<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Ryzhov, chief of the Russian Agency for </F>
International Cooperation and Development administration for the 
development of free economic zones, investment programs, and 
resources: "Free Economic Zones: When Will They Start 
Operating?"] 
  [Text] Some 14 free economic zones [FEZ's] have now been 
established in Russia. Most of them were announced in 
1990-1991. It was then that 12 FEZ's appeared at once. Most of 
them covered the territories of entire oblasts, such as Chita, 
Kemerovo, Kaliningrad, Sakhalin, and others, but none of them, 
even such a promising zone as "Nakhodka," is actually in 
operation, and there are objective reasons for this. 
  For instance, when preferential economic and legal status 
was 
granted to territories that in many cases are bigger than some 
European countries, the state's actual economic potential was 
not taken into account. World experience was also ignored. It 
shows that countries spend $20-70 million per square kilometer 
of FEZ to provide all the facilities. The state's greatest 
outlay is at the initial stage, the establishment of the 
production infrastructure, in which the foreign investor avoids 
investing. The "Dauria" FEZ in Chita Oblast alone covers an 
area of more than 431,000 square km. Moreover, in such 
"superzones" it is virtually impossible to ensure proper 
monitoring of the implementation of the special customs and 
currency rules. And these are key elements of the FEZ economic 
mechanism. No wonder, then, that in the course of further 
changes to the existing legislation on the zones the main 
concessions, including tax concessions, were abolished. 
  So the FEZ question remains open: Formally they exist, but 
in practice they do not operate. In our view, the lack of a 
realistic idea of the purpose and potential of the FEZ's and of 
a cogent blueprint and program for their creation were largely 
responsible for this. Many regions thought, indeed in some 
cases believe even now that the zones are a kind of panacea, 
particularly in the socioeconomic sphere. In fact, they are 
just one factor in the development and functioning of the market 
mechanism. Their main role is to boost foreign economic 
activity and expand export production by bringing in foreign and 
Russian investments, advanced technology, equipment, and 
managerial experience. Only after they have been formed and 
developed, which will take years, can the zones have a 
modernizing effect on the local economy. 
  And, as world experience shows, the crucial factors in 
successful FEZ development are a convenient and advantageous 
economic and geographic position, the presence of the requisite 
production, transport, and business infrastructure and manpower 
reserves in the region, and favorable opportunities for 
conducting foreign economic activities. It is also extremely 
important that foreign investors should be interested in 
investing capital in this particular region. 
  Of course, as was mentioned before, you have to weigh up 
very 
carefully how big the FEZ should be. For instance, the world's 
first and one of the most efficiently operating export 
production zones is in the vicinity of Shannon International 
Airport in Ireland. Originally it occupied 10 hectares. Or 
take the "Masan" FEZ in South Korea. It occupies less than one 
square kilometer, yet it provides export products worth around 
$2 billion per year. Foreign experts recommend limiting the size 
of FEZ's to 140-160 hectares, at least at the initial stage. 
  Of course, there is also the experience of the relatively 
large Chinese special economic zone, but it is highly specific 
and has not spread elsewhere either in China itself or in the 
world as a whole. The socioeconomic conditions in the PRC were 
different from those in Russia. One very important purpose 
behind the creation of these zones was to "test" the market 
management mechanisms for subsequent introduction into the 
planned socialist economy. The fact that they were orientated 
toward political as well as economic results is also of 
considerable importance. Their very location was obviously 
geared to the businessmen of Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. It 
is no accident that the bulk of foreign investments in them 
comes from foreign businessmen of Chinese extraction, primarily 
from Hong Kong. 
  It is indicative that export production in these zones is, 
as 
a rule, low-technology. The proportion of products for export 
is not great enough either. At the same time, wide use is made 
of imported raw materials. The FEZ's did not obtain a positive 
balance of payments until 1990; that is, 10 years and more after 
they were founded. 
  Certainly the Chinese example shows many clearly positive 
results, but we are talking here only about choosing the most 
effective way forward. Incidentally, the compact economic and 
technical development zones created in a number of "open" PRC 
coastal cities, similar to the "classic" export production 
zones, have demonstrated a much greater ability to actively 
involve foreign capital in the retooling of industry. 
  So what kind of future lies in store for the Russian FEZ's? 
It depends to a crucial degree on the creation of a strong and 
stable legislative base. There already is a draft law on FEZ's. 
It was sent by the Russian president to the former Supreme 
Soviet as long ago as last March, but it was not examined. Now 
it will be adopted by the Russian Federation Federal Assembly. 
  The draft law, prepared with international practice in mind, 
contains new conceptual approaches to the formation of FEZ's. 
In the first place, it is proposed that they should be compact, 
no more than a few square kilometers in size. This kind of area 
can be equipped without creating too great a financial burden 
and within an acceptable timeframe, proper customs and financial 
control can be arranged, and the requisite infrastructure can be 
fully established. Indeed, tax concessions will not go to 
entire oblasts but will extend only to small zones. The plan is 
to equip them in the manner of industrial parks. The range of 
preferences is to be made pretty wide and, we hope, attractive 
to foreign businessmen. At any rate, it will not differ 
significantly from the more or less standard range. 
  The FEZ's will be divided into two types: export production 
zones (production type) and unbonded zones (warehousing type). 
Incidentally, the latter have now been given the go-ahead with 
the publication of the Russian Federation Customs Code, and the 
drafts are now being worked out. 
  International practice indicates the advisability of FEZ 
specialization. There are around 400 warehouse-type zones and 
more than 300 export production zones in the world at the 
moment. Most of the former operate in industrially developed 
states. There are around 130 in Europe and more than 180 in the 
United States. 
  Export production zones are more popular in developing 
countries. At the beginning of the nineties there were more 
than 300 operating, over 100 were in the process of being 
organized, and 50 and more were at the planning and preparation 
stage. More than three million people are employed in them (in 
1990 it was two million). Of course, there is far less need for 
them in the developed countries, since they already have a 
full-fledged market and major high-technology export potential. 
  As for the future Russian export zones, it is envisaged that 
they will be obliged to supply at least 50 percent of their 
products for export. If a FEZ resident fails to accomplish this 
task he could lose his license. At the same time, there are 
plans for a flexible system of incentives for producers of 
export goods. The size of the concessions will depend on the 
volume of exports, the degree of processing, the standard of the 
technology used, the proportion of local raw materials and 
supplies, and so on. 
  In order to create the FEZ's, the draft law provides for the 
allocation of funds from the federal budget (including tax 
concessions), budget loans, part of the money obtained in the 
course of privatization, and also the use of the budgets of the 
regions where they are being formed. 
  In this connection it is important to bear in mind that the 
proposed future redistribution of the powers of the center and 
the regions, in particular in the budget sphere, will obviously 
also make significant adjustments to the process of financing 
and developing FEZ's. Local authorities will have to tackle 
many problems indpendently and ensure, in particular, that the 
zones are not turned into economic enclaves, isolated from the 
national economy, but are closely linked to the corresponding 
region and use its resources, raw materials, components, and so 
on. There has been a very marked desire of late on the part of 
private Russian investors to get involved in the formation of 
the zones. Given the current budget deficit, this is a 
perfectly possible extra source. 
  Nonetheless, the formation of zones is primarily a state 
issue. So the preparation of a state program for their creation 
is envisaged. Obviously it will be worthwhile having a proper 
competition among preselected drafts and, at first, a limited 
number of FEZ's, primarily for export production. Otherwise we 
will continue to have the "zone mania" which has gripped many 
regions of Russia in the past couple of years, and the 
government, as in the past, will be inundated with ill-conceived 
and often totally unacceptable proposals on opening FEZ's. 
  It is equally important to identify the federal management 
organ responsible for coordinating all the work. These 
functions used to be performed by the Russian Agency for 
International Cooperation and Development, although not 
entirely. Recently the agency, together with the Russian 
Federation Customs Committee, was instructed to organization 
unbonded zones, but the problem basically remains. 
  This has been a brief account of the past and immediate 
future of the creation of FEZ's in Russia, but if you glance 
further into the future, the example of the developed countries 
shows that export production zones sooner or later lose their 
significance for them. Russia is just at the start of this 
road, but when production facilities in our FEZ's develop and 
attain maturity it will be sensible to buy them from foreign 
partners, as the South Koreans have already started to do in the 
case of highly efficient enterprises in the "Masan" zone, but 
unbonded zones are traditionally an effective means of boosting 
the foreign trade of both developed and developing states and 
they remain effective. 
  The creation of FEZ's here, as in many other regions of the 
world, could be an effective means of attracting foreign 
investments and a catalyst for the development of foreign 
economic relations and the economy of the country as a whole, 
but to achieve this the policy behind their formation must be 
well thought-out and consistent.

  [Text] Monday, January 10 -- The National Independence 
Party (ERSP) leaders held a news conference on Friday [7 
January], describing the past year and the party's views of the 
cabinet changes. Chairman Tunne Kelam admitted internal 
conflicts and assured that the party strengthened itself and 
also maintained its supporters (approximately 1,000 members). 
Kelam described the ERSP as more centrist and orientated at the 
national identity than the "Fatherland". Juri Adams stressed 
the need for the cabinet reshuffle, Kelam pointed out that the 
government made a major move towards "a real politicians' 
government." Viktor Niitsoo criticised Toomas Sildmae's 
performance at the Economy Ministry, claiming that the ministry 
had submitted only one "low-quality" draft law to the Riigikogu 
[parliament] last year. Adams added that the "Fatherland" had 
been forced to admit Sildmae's unsuitability and claimed that 
Estonia "will lose nothing" by his resignation.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 10, BNS -- Estonian President Lennart 
Meri in a statement, addressed to the public on Sunday [9 
January], explained the reasons behind holding back his 
approval to new ministerial nominations. 
  Meri, denying allegations by some leading politicians, said 
there was no constitutional crisis in Estonia. Meri said he as 
the country's president had based his actions on the president's 
rights and responsibilities, as stipulated by the Constitution. 
  He quoted the Constitution's Article 90, which says that no 
minister can be relieved of duties or appointed to office 
without a presidential ruling, which in turn has to be preceded 
by a formal proposal by the prime minister. The choice between 
approval or non- approval of the candidate is left with the 
president, Meri says in the statement. 
  "The proposal concerning changes in the Cabinet, submitted 
by the prime minister on Jan. 6, was a rather large-scale one: 
the proposal suggested the replacement of the foreign minister, 
the economics, the finance minister and the defense minister; 
the defense minister was to replace the foreign minister, the 
rest of the vacant ministerial positions were to be given to 
three members of the parliament. The President of the Republic, 
taking as basis the prime minister's proposal, made a decision 
in a smaller scale than what was suggested. With this ruling 
from Jan. 7, 1994, the president didn't create a constitutional 
crisis. On the contrary, while making my decision I proceeded 
from the presidential oath: to faithfully fulfil my duties with 
all my abilities and to the best of my judgement for the good 
of the Estonian people and the Republic," the president said. 
  Meri said he had talked with Prime Minister Mart Laar about 
the possibilities to more effectively organize the state 
leadership work already in September. The prime minister then 
had considered it unnecessary to make changes in the Cabinet. 
  "The outcome of the local elections, which were held after 
that, showed that power relations between the political forces 
in Estonia had changed during the year. The prime minister made 
his conclusions and decided on Cabinet changes, for which 
purpose he started to resolve the crisis emerged in the Pro 
Patria (party). International developments went their own way, 
which was not quite favorable for Estonia. Therefore I suggested 
to the prime minister and the foreign minister on Dec. 22 to 
postpone making changes in the Cabinet until late February, so 
that we could realistically take into account the new power 
relations in Europe. /--/ These arguments, which directly 
concern Estonia's security policy, were not taken into account 
and the proposed Cabinet changes regrettably have coincided with 
crucial foreign political events," the president's statement 
reads. 
  Meri says no concrete shortcomings were pointed at in the 
work of Economics Minister Toomas Sildmae. He says Sildmae also 
enjoys the trust of many Cabinet members. The president says he 
has met Heiki Kranich, candidate for the post of the finance 
minister, only twice so far, and economics minister nominee 
Toivo Jurgenson, only once. 
  "Under such circumstances it would have been irresponsible 
of 
me to approve the candidates. I once more say: I have sworn to 
the State Assembly and to the people to fulfil my duties to the 
best of my judgement. Therefore please allow me to once again 
emphasize that in a democratic practice of state leadership the 
advisability of decisions by the head of the government has to 
be clear to the Estonian citizens, the State Assembly and the 
president," Meri says. 
  The president said he had made a decision to some extent 
different from what had been suggested, thus giving the prime 
minister the opportunity to once again and with full seriousness 
wage giving or not giving the control levers of the country's 
economy into the hands of the best experts. 
  "I regret that the government has interpreted my position 
from a one-sided point of view and presented the problem in a 
different light, in order to exert pressure on me by referring 
to a constitutional crisis. I am particularly worried by the 
time-point. At present we should concentrate our forces on the 
most critical section of the front -- on the foreign policy, on 
ensuring Estonia's security. The head of the government has 
chosen the wrong time and the wrong way," the president says.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 10, BNS -- The chairman of the 
opposition Coalition Party, Tiit Vahi, accused Prime Minister 
Mart Laar of failure to cope with his duties and said it was the 
head of the government rather than the Cabinet as such that 
needed replacement. 
  "Our (the Coalition Party's -- BNS) position is that the 
head 
of government is failing to cope with his tasks," Vahi said. 
Vahi, the predecessor of Mart Laar in the prime minister's 
office, said his party would be ready for cooperation if the 
opportunity came up to appoint a new prime minister candidate. 
  Vahi said there was no constitutional crisis in Estonia, as 
the constitution gives the president the right to sack ministers 
and approve new ministers into office. 
  "How the authors of the constitution meant it, is quite 
another thing," Vahi said. 
  But the Coalition Party leader also added he had been 
somewhat bewildered by the president's decision not to relieve 
the economics minister of office. 
  "In my personal opinion, this can be interpreted as the 
president's wish to shape the setup of Mart Laar's Cabinet," he 
said. 
  Vahi added that the interior political crisis emerged in 
Estonia had to be resolved by intensive negotiations between the 
prime minister and the president.

  [Excerpt] Tallinn, Jan 10 -- President Lennart Meri on 
Monday signed a decree appointing all four ministers proposed by 
Prime Minister as ministers, Mart Laar said. 
  "I am glad that the problem was solved. That will enable us 
to resume peaceful and constructive work and, surely, we all got 
a useful lesson," Laar said and added that "constitutional 
dispute had ended". 
  Laar said he had received the information from Tunne Kelam, 
vice chairman of Estonian parliament who had been informed of 
the President's move over the telephone by Meri's office. Laar 
also said Meri had expressed wish to hold a speech before the 
parliament on Tuesday in order to explain his latest moves. 
  Meri's office has not confirmed the news. 
  Last Saturday, Meri rejected Laar's government reshuffle 
plan 
refusing to dismiss Economics Minister Toomas Sildmae while 
sacking Finance Minister Madis Rike and turning down Premier's 
nominee for Finance Minister, Heiki Kranich. 
  Meri agreed to award Foreign Minister's portfolio to Juri 
Luik and Defence Minister's portfolio to Indrek Kannik. Both 
ministers refused to take up their new positions if Meri refused 
to approve the whole package. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 10, BNS - Estonian President Lennart 
Meri at 3.40 p.m. [1340 GMT] today officially denied reports on 
having approved the list of the four minister nominations and 
said the information provided to the press by Prime Minister 
Mart Laar was wrong. 
  Meri also said he had "no intention to sign the ruling," the 
president's spokesman said. 
  The spokesman confirmed reports that the president was going 
to address the parliament 10 a.m. Tuesday. 
  The president also confirmed the reports that he had talked 
with the parliament's Deputy Speaker Tunne Kelam on the 
telephone, but denied having told Kelam that he was going to 
approve the minister candidates. 
  The president's statement came after the prime minister less 
than two hours earlier had quoted Kelam as saying that the 
president had promised to approve all four minister candidates. 
Kelam conveyed the president's words at a meeting with the 
ruling coalition MPs at the government and parliament residence 
at Toompea today, Laar said. 
  The prime minister said the government coalition at the 
meeting had ruled to offer to the president the possibility to 
meet all the coalition's MPs at a time and conditions convenient 
for the president. 
  "I am glad that the problem got a solution. This provides us 
with the possibility to continue our work confidently and with 
constructiveness. There are things to learn for all of us in the 
recent developments. The things that happened show that we have 
to adopt a number of laws to establish more exactly how things 
have to proceed. That sparks strike every now and then from 
contacts between the institutions of the president, the State 
Court and the chancellor of law unfortunately cannot be avoided 
in the first year following the adoption of the constitution, 
since we are a young democracy," Laar said. 
  The prime minister said a constitutional dispute was no sign 
of the constitution's weakness. 
  "The same provisions also exist in the German constitution, 
for instance, and our legal system in many aspects is based on 
that system. In Germany the democratic tradition quite simply is 
so long that problems like this never come up," Laar said. 
  Ain Saarna, spokesman to the prime minister, said the 
government was expecting the document from the president and was 
going to abstain from comment for the time being. 
  The presidential press office in the latest report said 
Prime 
Minister Mart Laar on Sunday, Jan. 9 had presented to the 
president the new ministerial candidates and submitted a new 
proposal to approve the ministerial nominations. 
  The president is going to make his decision Tuesday and read 
it to the parliament at 10 a.m. the same day.

  [Text] President Lennart Meri signed today, in front of the 
Riigikogu, the proposals by Prime Minister Mart Laar, so to 
speak, concerning the government reshuffle. 
  In his speech, the president emphasized it was not what one 
would wish, but it was compelled by this moment in the internal 
and external political situation. In the words of Meri, an 
exceedingly unsuitable time has been chosen for the government 
reshuffle, because leading Estonian politicians should, at 
present, give the main attention to the NATO and the U.S.-Russia 
summit meetings, and not to the examination of, so to speak, 
one's own navel. 
  The president regards the wish by the Isamaa [Fatherland 
faction] to stay in power at any cost as the cause of the 
situation that has arisen. The president expressed surprise 
that Laar himself did not resign, but began a government 
reshuffle. The resignation of Laar, in the opinion of Lennart 
Meri, is in the interests of Isamaa itself. The Isamaa crisis 
is a crisis for the prime minister. Meri appealed also for a 
decisive expansion of the government coalition. 
  With that, the president has officially released Toomas 
Sildmae from the position as economy minister, and appointed 
Heiki Kranich and Toivo Jurgenson as finance and economy 
ministers respectively.

  [Text] The Estonian Government has appointed a special 
envoy to the town of Paldiski 50 km southwest of Tallinn where 
the Russian Navy deploys a nuclear training center. He is Yuriy 
Tikk, a Defence Ministry adviser, government spokesman Ain 
Saarna told reporters on Friday. His area of responsibility is 
law enforcement in the town which was closed to foreigners until 
recently. 
  Paldiski is the country's only place which held no local 
elections and Tikk will represent the central government until 
local self-management is introduced there. 
  Various estimates put the number of town residents from 
6,000 
to 7,000 with 1,200 of them belonging to the Russian naval base 
there. There are about 200 ethnic Estonians who are eligible to 
stand in local elections. 
  The envoy is given two weeks in which to draft proposals for 
solving the town's problems. Simultaneously, the Interior 
Ministry is instructed to register all town dwellers by the end 
of March and the Justice Ministry given two weeks to put forward 
proposals on the legal basis of local self-government. 
  Colonel Raul Luks who was appointed by President Lennart 
Meri 
as military administrator of Paldiski has been at work since 
January 1. He is responsible for any decision making linked to 
Russian pullout from the town. 
  A trainload of machinery and equipment needed for 
dismantling 
nuclear reactors crossed the Estonian-Russian border en route to 
Paldiski on Friday, the spokesman said.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 10, BNS -- The Defense Police at 
present has got no reasons to initiate criminal proceedings 
against Pyotr Rozhok, a representative of Vladimir Zhirinovsky's 
Russian Liberal Democratic Party in Estonia, the head of the 
country's security police said. 
  Juri Pihl, the director general of the Defense Police 
Department, added that Estonia still needed "to keep an eye on 
such people." He said this was necessary despite the fact that 
the country's authorities knew of nothing Rozhok or his fellow 
Russian Liberal Democratic Party supporters had done against 
Estonia's national interests. 
  Rozhok a few days earlier told the press a branch of 
Zhirinovsky's party existed in Estonia. 
  Estonian Justice Minister Kaido Kama has called the party's 
alleged activity in Estonia illegal, because the branch 
organization has not been formally registered with the country's 
authorities. Kama said the activity of the Zhirinosky group in 
Estonia should be investigated by the defense police. 
  Also President Lennart Meri in a speech recently said the 
country's security police had to pay attention to the activity 
of "some foreign political parties in Estonia." 
  Rozhok, a resident of the northeastern town of Narva, claims 
his telephone is being tapped, but says he has had no direct 
contacts with Estonian defense police officials so far.

<F P=106> [From 11 January RAHVA HAAL, HOMMIKULEHT, pp 3,9] </F>
  [Text] Tuesday, January 11 -- Finance Minister Madis Urike 
and his associates held a news conference yesterday, describing 
their past work as satisfactory. 
  The ministry succeeded in its main tasks last year -- to 
lead 
a strict monetary policy and to cut the inflation, to balance 
the budget, to prepare draft laws and to perform the role of an 
"economic policeman", Minister Urike said. Chancellor Enn Pant 
added that the ministry had completed the taxation reform, 
compiled four budgets and submitted 58 draft laws. He rejected 
Prime Minister Mart Laar's accusations of the ministry's 
insufficient support to reforms, stressing that it would be 
unfair to demand more of the ministry. Deputy Chancellor Tiit 
Saat announced that up to 20 percent of profits go untaxed, but 
Pant stressed that the enterprises' unpaid taxes have been 
reduced as compared to 1992. 
  Urike added that the national investment programme will be 
prepared by February. The review of foreign aid in 1993 has not 
been completed as yet, but the approximate amount had been 
similar to that of 1992 -- 1.1 milliard kroons. Most of it is 
used on business trips and foreign consultants, he added.

  [Text] According to an order by Andrejs Rucs, the head of 
the local government of the Vidzeme district of Riga, two 
generals of the North-Western Group of Russian Forces were 
detained and deported to the state border today. The 
above-mentioned persons were detained this morning when 
representatives of the local government of Vidzeme district came 
to a Russian Army facility in Riga to take it over. 
  Andrejs Rucs spoke to Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis about 
today's incident and this issue was also discussed at a session 
of the National Security Council today. Rucs added that the 
fact that the generals were detained on a day talks were 
scheduled between Russian and Latvian delegations was a 
coincidence. He expressed an opinion that the incident might 
cause the Saeima and the government to demand finally from the 
Russian side a concrete timetable for the army withdrawal. 
  Sergey Zotov, the head of the Russian delegation, arriving 
for the talks on army withdrawal today, said that the talks 
could not begin until the above-mentioned incident is clarified. 
  Martins Virsis, the head of the Latvian delegation for talks 
with Russia, while waiting for the Russian delegation on the 
airfield, commented that the incident was a deliberate attempt 
to disrupt the talks. The Latvian side will correspondingly 
[words indistinct], (?said) Virsis.

  [Text] Criminal proceedings were instigated at the Latvian 
prosecutor's office today over the detention and deportation to 
Russia of Major Generals Nikolay Taylakov and Anatoliy 
Vodopyanov, who are serving at the headquarters of the 
Northwestern Group of Russian Troops. Both generals have been 
sent back to Russia on the orders of Andrejs Rucs, the chairman 
of the local government of Vidzeme district of Riga, when 
representatives of the local government went to a property of 
the house management enterprise of the Russian Army at 9 Krusta 
Baznicas Street this morning in order to take it over according 
to the local government's resolution. 
  Taylakov and Vodopyanov threatened to set guards at this and 
two other sites due to be taken over, but as the sites were 
already under control of the Home Guard, Rucs decided to send 
the generals out from Latvia to avoid incidents. 
  Rita Aksenoka, aide to the prosecutor general, reports that 
corpus delicti can be seen in the action by the local government 
officials. The proceedings were instigated according to Clause 
162 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Latvia, which deals 
with abuses of power and authority, and Clause 125, which deals 
with illegal detention. The case is being investigated by the 
prosecutor's office's department for particularly serious cases. 
  Ilgonis Upmalis, head of the Latvian bureau for monitoring 
the Russian troop withdrawal, reports that both generals have 
already returned to Riga. According to the LETA news agency, 
Russia has discontinued the talks on troop withdrawal from 
Latvia in this connection.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>
  [Text] Riga, 11 Jan -- The actions against the Russian 
ambassador and the representatives of her army that occurred in 
Latvia on Monday [10 January] were called thoughtless and a 
provocation by Georgs Andrejevs, Latvian minister of foreign 
affairs. On the instruction of the head of one of Riga's 
districts, four of Russia's military facilities were blockaded, 
the ambassador's car was detained, and two major generals were 
arrested and taken away in the direction of the frontier in 
handcuffs. As a result, talks with the Russian delegation 
scheduled for today have been postponed. 
  "Armed conflict was a reality," Andrejevs noted in an 
interview on television on Monday evening. According to him, 
President Yeltsin had given the command for a number of 
divisions stationed close to the frontier with Latvia to be in a 
state of operational readiness. In a report for the press 
circulated that same evening the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
notified that "the Government of Latvia will do everything 
possible to prevent similar measures of a provocative nature 
from happening in the future which might have a negative effect 
on the prestige of Latvia in the world and complicate the 
internal political situation in the state." The government 
stresses, it goes on to say, that in the future all questions 
connected with the withdrawal of Russian troops will be resolved 
by means of talks. 
  It has been announced that criminal proceedings have been 
instituted with regard to all the facts that will establish the 
degree of guilt of each participant in the action. The Cabinet 
of Ministers of Latvia gathered for an extraordinary sitting 
late in the evening. 
  Evening television broadcasts also showed the main 
instigator, Andrejs Ruchs [as transliterated], head of the 
Vidzemskiy [as transliterated] district of Riga, who had ordered 
that anyone hindering his instruction should be shot. He warned 
the generals when they were arrested that if they did not resist 
they would be taken to the frontier unharmed. Ruchs stated that 
there will be no more talks on the territory of his district. 
  "It is naive to think," the minister of foreign affairs of 
Latvia noted, "that what happened is the outcome of the 
`creativity' of just a few people."

<F P=106> [Report by Senior Lieutenant Oleg Groznetskiy of the </F>
Northwestern Group of Forces: "Robbery Under Cover of 
Misunderstandings. Provocations Against Russian Servicemen by 
Latvian Home Defense Guard Continue"] 
  [Text] In the chronicle of actions by the Home Defense 
Guard against Russian troops temporarily stationed on Latvian 
territory, a UAZ-469 automobile was stopped by home defense 
guards 27 November 1993 at around 1200. Under threat of the use 
of weapons, the driver and the automobile were taken to the Home 
Defense Guard 12th Battalion headquarters, where a R-838 radio 
transmitter set was removed from the automobile. 
  In the area of Plavinas 14 December 1993 at 1200 a GAZ-66 
automobile belonging to the courier-mail communications service, 
which was transporting correspondence from Riga to Jekabpils, 
was shot at with a small-bore weapon by unknown individuals 
following behind in an automobile. As a result of the shooting, 
a wheel was pierced. The camouflage uniform of the people doing 
the shooting, as well as the color of the vehicle, provide 
grounds for believing that they belonged to the Home Defense 
Guard. 
  An officer from the Northwestern Group of Forces press 
center 
asked Mr. Juris Dalbinsh [name as transliterated], deputy chief 
of staff of the Home Defense Guard, to comment on these and 
other similar actions in respect of Russian servicemen. 
  "The incident involving the removal of the portable radio 
transmitter was an annoying misunderstanding," Mr. Dalbinsh 
explained. "The reason for it was that the home defense guards 
had not made themselves familiar with the intergovernmental 
agreements on the use of postal and electric communications and 
Russian Federation Armed Forces radio frequencies. In this case 
the home guards acted unlawfully, and therefore a court 
investigation will be conducted and we will inform you of the 
results in writing. The culprits will be disciplined. As for 
the shooting at the Russian military vehicle 14 December, we 
have no information about this. I specially got in touch with 
the battalion on whose territory this incident supposedly took 
place, and I found out that they were not given any tasks that 
day, and were not even on patrol." 
  [Groznetskiy] "Mr. Dalbinsh, would you not admit the 
possibility of the unsanctioned use of weapons by your 
subordinates?" 
  [Dalbinsh] "No, that is out of the question. In broad 
daylight, in a vehicle with `Home Defense Guard' symbols on it 
-- that's going too far. We recently had a very serious 
discussion with Latvian Republic President G. Ulmanis (the 
president is the commander in chief of the Home Defense Guard -- 
O.G.) during which it was pointed out that it is impermissible 
to use weapons without grounds for doing so. The Home Defense 
Guard command drew the relevant conclusions: The requirements 
concerning who can be issued with weapons have been made 
tougher. However, people are human. Not everyone can bear the 
burden of authority provided by weapons in a normal way; but we 
will conduct the relevant work..." 
  Following the conversation with Mr. Juris Dalbinsh, another 
report came in. As Major V. Turovskiy's household effects were 
being transported along the Riga-Nizhniy Novgorod route on 23 
December of last year in the area of Jekabpils, the KamAZ truck 
was shot at with a small-bore pistol. The attackers were in a 
light-gray Riga Bus Plant automobile bearing Home Defense Guard 
emblems on its doors....

  [Text] The President of Estonia, Lennart Meri, has called 
upon NATO not to react to the warnings of the Russian president. 
If NATO wants to survive it must prove that it is Manfred 
Woerner, not Boris Yeltsin, who holds the NATO council, the 
Baltic News Service quotes the Estonian president. In Lennart 
Meri's opinion the Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas 
acted very correctly in making an official request for Lithuania 
to be admitted to NATO. According to the Estonian president, 
there is a vacuum of security in the Baltic states at present, 
and certain forces in Russia may be tempted to fill it.

  [Text] The lack of a "too sensitive reaction" from Russia 
and other countries to Lithuania's decision to join NATO proves 
that this step is in line with the processes taking place in 
real life, said President Algirdas Brazauskas on Monday [10 
January]. 
  Addressing a press conference in Vilnius, he said he hopes 
that a resolution concerning the prospects for integrating 
Lithuania and other countries of Eastern and Central Europe into 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will be adopted at the 
NATO summit taking place in Brussels. 
  Brazauskas believes that the implementation of the 
"partnership for peace" initiative, designed to pave the way for 
the countries in Central and Eastern Europe to membership in the 
continent's collective security structures, will be conducive to 
this. 
  According to the president, there is a need to search for 
solutions that would make it possible to include the whole of 
Europe in a system of collective security. 
  Brazauskas told his hosts at the National Radio's Russian 
Service in Vilnius over the weekend that Lithuania's decision to 
integrate into NATO must not change its relations with Russia 
and other neighbors in any way. 
  In his words, this political move "should not be interpreted 
as an intention to "alter or stiffen ties with Russia and other 
states." All European leaders, in his opinion, should agree on 
"a single security umbrella." 
  Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius, accompanying Brazauskas, 
added that "Lithuania's pro-western orientation is nothing new 
in its foreign policy". According to him, integration with NATO 
and other European security structures will be conducive to 
regional stability, indispensable not only to Lithuania but to 
all neighboring states.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>
  [Text] Lithuania does not believe that it committed "an 
unfriendly act" toward Russia by expressing its desire to join 
NATO, Deputy Foreign Minister Albinas Januska told Interfax on 
Monday [10 January]. 
  In his opinion, he said, a number of views expressed by the 
Russian president's press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, and by 
Russia's Foreign Ministry recently "look odd." However on the 
whole, Januska said, Moscow's reaction to the letter sent by the 
Lithuanian authorities to NATO, with the request to consider the 
possibility of admitting Lithuania to the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, "is quite natural for Russia," and it "testifies 
to some vestiges of the past in Russian thinking." According to 
him, even the highest echelons of power in Russia evidently have 
not completely shed their notion of NATO as a "hostile bloc." 
  Lithuania's decision to become a member of the North 
Atlantic 
Treaty Organization was prompted by the circumstance that the 
country "is not in a position to ensure full security for itself 
on its own," the deputy foreign minister explained. "We view 
NATO as the only guarantor of stability and security in Europe, 
and therefore we appeal to that organization," he said. 
  "The strengthening of nationalist and expansionist forces in 
Russian politics gave rise to some anxiety" in Lithuania, the 
diplomat said. "To some extent, this is what prompted us to 
search for other means to ensure our security, but our striving 
(to join NATO - IF note) must not be explained only with this," 
he noted. 
  According to Januska, sometimes Moscow tries to pretend that 
the desire of Russia's neighbor countries to join NATO provides 
the nationalist forces in Russia itself with trump cards. "If 
we continue to be in fear of aggravating frictions within 
Russia, we simply will not be able to uphold our own interests," 
he said. 
  Lithuania is prepared to cooperate with the Russian 
Federation within the framework of the "partnership for peace" 
concept worked out by NATO, the deputy foreign minister said. 
He added, however, that Lithuania's ultimate goal is to be a 
"full-fledged member" of that organization.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 07, BNS -- Estonia and Latvia were 
informed in advance about Lithuania's intentions to officially 
ask for NATO membership, said Lithuanian Foreign Minister 
Povilas Gylys. 
  In an interview with the leftist TIESA newspaper, Gylys said 
the reaction of the two Baltic neighbors was slightly different 
because Estonia is more reserved about Lithuania's step. 
Apparently, the Lithuanian minister gave the interview before 
Estonian President Lennart Meri's view on the matter was made 
public. 
  Gylys said "although we maintained close relations with 
NATO, 
our desire was unexpected to many." 
  The minister said Lithuania's request for NATO membership is 
based on national security interests and is not directed against 
anybody. "We move toward an era of politics without 
confrontation." 
  In Gylys opinion, rapprochement with the alliance is an 
evolutionary process, while Lithuania's move might only speed it 
up. "This depends not only on Lithuania."

<F P=106> [From ELTA "NEWS BULLETIN" No. 411] </F>
  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 10, ELTA -- Lithuania did not suddenly 
decide to join NATO, President Algirdas Brazauskas told a news 
conference on Monday [10 January]. 
  Consultations upon NATO membership began in mid-1993 and a 
letter to NATO secretary-general Manfred Woerner was sent last 
October. Brazauskas was induced to formally apply to NATO by "a 
resolution concerning NATO membership accepted by various 
parliamentary factions on December 23 and NATO summit taking 
place on January 10-11 in Brussels". By the way, Lithuania's 
application was received and distributed to NATO leaders and a 
"preparatory work" had been done, Brazauskas said. 
  Brazauskas confirmed he consulted with Latvian and Estonian 
presidents before sending the entrance application and they had 
approved the Lithuanian step. Besides Russian reactions already 
announced in the press, Brazauskas said he did not receive any 
other statements from the leaders of that country. 
  Waiting for an answer from Brussels, it is worthless to 
expect any concrete date of admitting Lithuania into NATO, 
president said. 
  He noted a lot of money would be needed for integration into 
NATO. More than five per cent of national income -- 130 million 
Lt [litas] /about 33 million dollars/ -- are allotted to the 
needs of National Defence system this year. But it would hardly 
be enough to reconstruct Lithuania's military structures 
according to NATO standards, so Brazauskas is "expecting support 
from other states as well".

Brazauskas -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Having recently declared a wish to join NATO, 
Lithuania is observing the NATO summit in Brussels with great 
interest. 
  I welcome the invitation to participate in the program 
called 
Partnership for Peace which was presented this morning by the 
heads of the NATO states and partners in cooperation. This is 
the road for Lithuania for complete integration into NATO 
political and military structures. 
  Lithuania looks positively at the efforts made by NATO to 
respond to the changes in Europe and in the world and to ensure 
a stable entrance into the 21st century. 
  I believe that the document defining the nature of 
partnership signed by Lithuania and NATO will be a consistent 
supplement to the efforts made by Lithuania to set up a 
democratically controlled military force and relevant relations 
between military and civilian institutions. 
  I have entrusted the government and the leaders of relevant 
ministries to take the necessary steps and get ready to sign the 
document on partnership, to assess the supplies, the resources, 
and the forces, and to prepare a program of measures through the 
implementation of which all the common objectives of partnership 
will be achieved.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Today's news conference in the 
Seimas held by Seimas Deputy Chairman Aloyzas Sakalas focused 
its attention on foreign policy and international relations. 
[passage omitted] I asked him to describe our foreign policy 
  [Begin Sakalas recording] Lithuania's foreign policy must be 
based on some main principles. There must be a foreign policy 
concept containing some main principles. [passage omitted] 
Unfortunately, I do not at present see such a concept in our 
foreign policy based on principles. These principles should be 
as follows: Relations with the closest neighbors, relations with 
other countries. 
  In relations with the closest neighbors I would put in the 
first place relations with Russia. Russia, as is known, has 
taken over the rights of the former USSR, it has only taken over 
the rights of the former USSR. If only rights, then why not 
responsibilities, too? And if responsibilities, then such 
issues as compensation and others may be discussed. If it has 
taken over rights only, then on what basis? So much about 
relations with Russia. In addition, we must evaluate the 
Russian military doctrine that has been published and is well 
known. We must respond correspondingly to this doctrine. There 
has been no such response so far. [passage omitted] We must 
evaluate this doctrine. [passage omitted] We must support all 
democratic forces in Russia and evaluate statements by the 
Liberal Democratic Party. We have not done this so far. 
  When we have all such criteria, our evaluations, we will be 
able to conduct our diplomacy in relations with Russia. 
  As for other neighbors, for instance Poland, are concerned, 
we have no treaty with Poland, we have no treaty with Belarus. 
[passage omitted] We must evaluate on what basis we are prepared 
to sign a treaty with Belarus. [passage omitted] The trouble 
with Poland is the Zeligowski action and the Suwalki Treaty that 
was broken, and it seems to me that we must say whether we 
adhere or refuse [as heard], but there must be a decision, and 
not like it is now -- diplomats travel to Poland and back and 
there is no order. Either we firmly say that until this is 
evaluated we do not intend to sign the treaty, or give up some 
things and sign a treaty that does not mention history and deals 
with the present only. 
  As far as Germany is concerned, there are many people who 
have suffered from the Nazis, were deported to Germany and were 
lost there. The Bundestag is examining the issues of 
compensation and we should say something and not wait for 
something to happen. 
  And lastly, Latvia and Estonia. Either we integrate in a 
common economic zone with some common political obligations, or 
each country remains separately. We must think about this. 
[passage omitted] 
  We must not find ourselves under the influence of a single 
foreign state. [passage omitted] It must not happen that 60 
percent our economy is linked with some specific country that 
can later dictate its economic and political conditions. 
[passage omitted] 
  I do not think our statement on joining NATO will result in 
a 
positive decision. I think that there has to be an additional 
incentive for the West to think, as soon as possible, about the 
possibility of admitting us to NATO, but not yet as the solution 
of such possibility. [sentence as heard] [end recording]

  [Text] Vilnius, 11 Jan -- The Lithuanian Seimas today 
ratified a law permitting citizens of the republic to acquire 
and carry light firearms. The new law comes into force on 1 
April this year, although, as one of the Seimas members joked, 
"1 April is not the most appropriate date." 
  Firearms may be legally acquired by persons over the age of 
25 who have no court record, do not abuse spirits, are 
well-balanced, not addicted to drugs, and who are not registered 
at a psychiatric clinic. 
  It was pointed out at the Seimas session, that the adoption 
of such a law was a forced measure, since the rise in crime in 
Lithuania is getting beyond state control.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 10, BNS -- During its spring session, 
the Lithuanian parliament is scheduled to discuss laws dealing 
with reforms in local administration and the country's 
administrative-territorial division. The whole package has been 
tagged "the little Constitution" of Lithuania. 
  The Lithuanian president, lawmakers government members, 
municipal officials and regional government commissioners met in 
the parliament Monday [10 January] to discuss the principles of 
local administration and territorial division reforms. 
  The meeting's participants discussed several issues, 
including a new administrative-territorial division of 
Lithuania, municipal property problems and a bill on municipal 
elections. 
  Municipal elections in Lithuania are scheduled for next 
fall. 
The draft provides for a single-mandate system of elections, but 
several members of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party 
faction proposed to introduce proportional representation. 
  Opposition MP [member of parliament] Andrius Kubilius said 
Monday the opposition will only back a single-mandate system.

  [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas did not 
confirm the law on the declaration of property by civil servants 
and sent it back to the Seimas for a second round of debates. 
  According to the president, some articles of the law run 
counter to the clauses of the Constitution which declare general 
equality before the law and inviolability of private property. 
  Everybody understands that this law is needed. However, it 
is absolutely not necessary to carry it too far and violate the 
Constitution, Brazauskas said at a news conference this morning. 
According to him the law was adopted in certain psychological 
circumstances. 
  The provisional law on the declaration of income and 
property 
by civil servants and [word indistinct] was adopted 23 December 
on the initiative of and great pressure from the rightwing 
opposition. According to the law, civil servants and office 
workers must supply information about property which is in their 
possession until 1 February, 1994. Furthermore, the information 
must be supplied by 1 May this year. Information concerning the 
purchase of property in 1994 must be supplied by 1 March, 1995. 
  According to the president, a number of office duties 
specified in the law which are subject to the declaration of 
property violate the constitutional concept about general 
equality before the law. 
  According to the president, the seizure of undeclared 
property envisioned by law is anticonstitutional. 
  Mr. Brazauskas pointed out that a package of laws on 
taxation 
which also includes the law on general declaration of property 
is currently being prepared. According to him after this law 
has been adopted then it will be possible to speak about the 
declaration of property by individual persons. 
  The president also said that he personally is ready today to 
declare his property and his income.

  [Excerpts] Comment on the president's refusal to endorse 
the law on property declaration was presented today by Andrius 
Kubilius, head of the Seimas opposition. 
  [Begin recording] [Kubilius] This draft law was prepared by 
the efforts of the opposition, and I can even say that thanks to 
the efforts of the opposition it was adopted by the Seimas 
before the New Year. Today, the president announced that he 
would probably not endorse this law, saying that allegedly it 
runs counter to the Constitution of Lithuania. 
  I would like to say that according to our point of view, and 
as far as I know, judging by the reports I read in the press, 
when this law was adopted this point of view is supported by 
some representatives and the leaders of the government, and this 
law is one of the main laws in the struggle against corruption 
because there is no other way to fight corrupt officials except 
by means of this law. This law binds every official to declare 
his property and income. At the same time the source of their 
income must also be revealed. 
  The president said that this law runs counter to the 
Constitution because the Constitution indicates that all 
citizens of Lithuania are equal before the law. However, he 
said that this law allegedly singles out certain officials in 
Lithuania and places some additional obligations on them. 
  I would like to say that the Constitution should be regarded 
as a certain general document, and when one specific clause is 
taken out then, of course, different points of view can be 
adopted. 
  However, I must say that there is also a clause in the 
Constitution, Clause number five, which reads that government 
institutions should serve the people. Therefore, this clause 
defines clearly how the officials at the governmental structures 
should work, i.e., they have to serve the people, the public and 
the state, and in no way should they serve their own interests. 
Extensive documents have been worked out in the West, called the 
code of practice of state officials, say, of the United States. 
Personal interests of a state official and those of the state 
are clearly defined. [passage omitted] 
  I think that in refusing to endorse this law the president 
is 
making a mistake, because the refusal to endorse this law, which 
is a rather complex law and which will became fully operational 
only in 1995, means that this law will not now become valid in 
1995. 
  On the other hand, I fully agree with the president when he 
says that we must have a general law on income declaration by 
all citizens of Lithuania. However, I must say that the 
government believes that such a complex law can only be 
implemented at the beginning of 1996. This means that until 
then, i.e. 1996, corruption in our governmental circles will 
continue to flourish. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Could this unwillingness to 
endorse the law on income and property declaration by state 
officials be regarded as an apprehension by some, or rather 
individual, officials? 
  [Kubilius] Absolutely. I can say firmly that, I am 100 
percent sure, that...[pauses] I do not want to say that the 
president is concealing something because the president is also 
obliged to reveal his income. I think that Lithuania is in no 
way different from any Western country where, at times, 
corruption scandals shake a state. 
  Rimantas Smetona, chairman of the Nationalist Union of 
Lithuania, said earlier at a news conference that while running 
away from socialism, Lithuania is now approaching Sicilism -- he 
means the Sicilian mafia. 
  In this sense, both corruption and the mafia in Lithuania 
are 
flourishing and we must make all efforts to fight it. The West 
could not invent anything else in the fight against corruption 
but this law on the declaration of income and property by state 
officials. 
  [Correspondent] [Passage omitted] The law was somehow linked 
to the elections. Can you comment? 
  [Kubilius] What the president said today reminded me of the 
words spoken by deputy chairman of the Lithuanian Seimas, Juozas 
Bernatonis, when he spoke during the debates on the law in the 
Seimas. The same articles of the Constitution were mentioned 
and the same problems were raised. 
  Already during the parliamentary debates on this law 
Bernatonis somehow said, half in joke -- although nobody speaks 
at the Seimas half in joke, and quite often very serious matters 
are spoken half in joke -- well, he said that instead of 
adopting this law let us declare new elections to the Seimas. 
  [Correspondent] Elections and the adoption of such a law: 
The Seimas is dismissed, and in this way the officials escape 
responsibility. 
  [Kubilius] In principle this would be so. I think that here 
some officials do not want to reveal their income and the source 
of their income, therefore, they think that it would be better 
to leave the parliament in a nice way through new elections.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian </F>
Liberal-Democratic Party, by Maria Graczyk; place and date not 
given: "The Remnants of the Empire"] 
  [Text] [Graczyk] You support the idea of a Russian-German 
border. Across Poland? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] In Europe, we are mostly interested in good 
relations with Germany, and it is in this context that one 
should address the Polish question. However, we do not want to 
interfere in Poland's internal affairs. Even if Poland wants to 
join NATO, that is an internal matter for Poland and NATO. 
  The creation of a new world order is a long process. Europe 
is currently experiencing a stage of profound destruction. 
After all, the Soviet Union has collapsed, and it would be hard 
to expect its remnants not to hit the neighboring countries. 
Poland has never had a permanent border. It has possessed 
various shapes at various times of history, and there was a 
period when it was divided and formed part of Russia, among 
other countries. Until recently, the Russian forces guaranteed 
the Polish border. Today, in this matter, one should turn to 
NATO and Germany, which play the greatest part in this section 
of the continent. For the time being, the Poles can carry on 
singing "Poland has not perished yet." 
  [Graczyk] What would change in Russia if you became prime 
minister? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] There will be a better economy, a strong 
state, and better guaranteed rights for all Russians, wherever 
they live. Is that too little? 
  [Graczyk] During the election campaign, you promised you 
would double the standard of living of your countrymen. How? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We will do this without any help from 
outside. Until now, the so-called help from the West has caused 
us more harm than good. Russia has been exploited materially 
and intellectually. Let them leave us alone, and we will 
reestablish Russian power. As prime minister I would make three 
basic decisions -- an end to all financial help for foreign 
countries, an end to the conversion of the weapons industry to 
civilian production, and a sharp struggle against crime. 
  The adherence to the arms embargo on the Middle East, for 
example, is costing us many billions of dollars. Russia could 
earn about $50 billion a year from weapons exports. After six 
months, not only would people's standard of living increase, but 
also their security. I would also bring more militiamen and 
soldiers out onto the streets. 
  [Graczyk] That smells of totalitarianism. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The state should not have been allowed to 
disintegrate! The Soviet Union might still exist today; one 
should have provided greater independence and divided the 
country into provinces. Such a variant should also have been 
suggested to the Asian and Caucasian regions, plus Belarus, 
Ukraine, and the Baltic countries. Then they would have 
realized the advantages to be gained from living within one 
large state in which all the principles of freedom -- cultural 
and economic freedom-- are respected. Look what is happening 
right now. Entire settlements are burning, towns are being 
bombed, people are perishing. 
  [Graczyk] Is the return of the USSR still possible? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, in a territorial sense. But the law, 
ideology, and government will be different. The territory of 
the former USSR could become the territory of a reborn Russia. 
That will only be possible when a new democratically oriented 
authority appears in the Kremlin, one that will work out a model 
of a strong state. A reborn and strengthened army is required 
for this purpose, together with a nuclear potential that must be 
improved so that our possible adversaries know that we are 
prepared to use it. Therefore we will develop our nuclear 
weapons, create a base in space, and from there we will defend 
Russia if the need arises. The ideal scenario calls for the 
existence of a Russo-Swedish and Russo-German border, and a 
border with China and India in the south. 
  [Graczyk] How can one describe the present situation in 
Russia? Is it democracy, yet another "disturbance" [smuta], or 
perhaps something else? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I would call it a political cocktail, because 
it contains obvious signs of chaos and anarchy from the time of 
the Great Disturbance, but also the beginnings of democracy, 
fascism, and nationalism. Also possible are potential sources 
of future religious wars and conflicts caused by the clash 
between two worlds -- the Christian one and the Muslim one. 
  As a lawyer and expert on human rights, I am an advocate of 
democracy, but I do not think democracy is the right medicine 
for the state's diseased organism. The only panacea is strong 
authority. Only after the organism of the state has recovered 
from the crisis and the economy has healed will it be possible 
to switch over to a democratic system. 
  [Graczyk] The communists also promised that democracy would 
occur after the period of proletarian dictatorship. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] That was their mistake. I am opposed to an 
ideological state. 
  [Graczyk] Then why do they call you a fascist? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The disease of destruction is very far 
advanced in Russia, and the economic crisis has assumed a 
particularly acute form. That is why it is essential to apply 
drastic measures. Only through fear can one enforce an end to 
the civil war, stop the disintegration of the army, and stem the 
tide of emigres. Economic structures must be made operational 
again. One must reestablish the old links between work places, 
factories, and kolkhozes. First we must heal Russia and lift it 
off its knees. 
  [Graczyk] Do you think the Russians expressed their 
weariness of democracy by voting for you? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] They have never lived under democracy! By 
voting for me, they have opted for democracy and entrusted me 
with it. Democracy is in the right hands now. 
  [Graczyk] But how can one introduce democracy to a country 
that has never had it? First there was the Czarist empire, and 
then the Bolsheviks came. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The shift to democracy must be suitably 
prepared. Democracy needs an economic base, political parties 
need varied social strata, and the Army needs an objective and 
specific conditions. What is needed today, however, is a 
freeze, a political diet. One must not sow seed in a fallow 
field -- a tractor has to go over it first. We need a strong 
authority. 
  [Graczyk] Boris Yeltsin's spokesman said recently that he 
does not rule out the possibility of cooperation with you. 
Under what conditions would it be possible? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I am ready to do anything for the good of 
Russia. We will cooperate with our president any way he wants. 
Together with my staff I am preparing a program that we will 
submit to the president soon. I hope that on parliament's first 
sitting on 11 January, President Yeltsin will entrust mew with 
the task of forming a government. But if he appoints someone 
else, I will accept that. We will not even be offended if we do 
not obtain any ministerial post. Time is working to our 
advantage. 
  [Graczyk] Until recently you were critical of Boris Yeltsin. 
You even called him your worst enemy. And now you want to 
cooperate with him. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I respect the will of the voters who voted 
for him. But I have no doubt that I will win the next 
presidential election. Neither the so-called democratic camp 
nor the communists will stand a chance. That is a pity, because 
I am accustomed to a sharp struggle. I am sad that the victory 
will be so easy.

  [Text] The Russian Federation does not intend to establish 
official contacts with Serbian Krajina. The statement was made 
by a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official in Moscow. 
  According to sources in Belgrade, a delegation of the self- 
proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina intends to arrive in 
Moscow on Tuesday. The republic is a Serbian-populated area in 
Croatia, conflicting with Zagreb, and favoring unification of 
Serbian lands into a separate state. 
  A Russian diplomat said such a republic does not exist for 
Russia. Russia maintains contacts with Croatia, which is a 
member of the United Nations.

  [Text] Ottawa, 11 Jan -- "Khudozhnik Pakhomov," a Russian 
container vessel, unexpectedly called on Monday at the port of 
St. John's, Newfoundland, causing a wave of controversial 
reports on alleged dramatic events on board. The CBC television 
company reported in the morning, quoting police sources, that 
Canadian policemen and customs officials boarded the ship after 
learning that there had been a gun battle on board. At least 
one person was reported killed. Canadian Press agency reported, 
quoting its own sources, that two people had been killed and 
three wounded. It was alleged that the conflict began after 
stowaways had been found on board. 
  However, representative of the Russian Federation marine 
fleet in Montreal, Nikolay Zharnakov, contacted on the phone by 
ITAR-TASS, categorically refuted these reports. He said that 
there had been no gun battle and no firearms on board, and of 
course there were no casualties or fatalities. Mr. Zharnakov 
added that "Khudozhnik Pakhomov" had been heading for Montreal, 
having taken part one week ago in the search for the crew of 
"Marika-7", a Greek vessel that had sunk in stormy seas 1,500 km 
off of Newfoundland. The container vessel, owned by the Baltic 
shipping line, had also been affected by the storm and its 
anchor had been damaged. The vessel had to head for the nearest 
port for repairs. As she was approaching St. John's, a 
stowaway, who had been hiding in the hold, emerged on deck. The 
captain called the police and customs in order to have the 
surprise "passenger" sorted out. 
  A representative of St. John's customs service also 
confirmed 
in the evening that no dramas had happened on board. Police 
detained six stowaways who had penetrated the ship in a port in 
Europe. The customs official said three of the stowaways were 
Romanians, two Armenians, and one Russian. They all requested 
asylum.

  [Text] The following report was issued by the Defense 
Ministry on 10 January: Armenia's Armed Forces have been trying 
to attack our positions all along the front lines since 
yesterday. Supported by armored cars, the enemy is trying to 
control Agdam-Barda motor road in the northern sector of 
Agdamskiy Rayon. The battles are mostly continuing around 
Salakhly and Kengerli settlements. The Azerbaijani troops are 
bravely halting the enemy's offensive. Forty enemy troops and 
four tanks were destroyed during the battles. There are a great 
number of injured. Two tanks seized as war trophies by our 
brave fighters are now being used to inflict destructive blows 
on the enemy. 
  Following a long artillery barrage on 9 January, the 
Armenian 
troops tried to attack our positions in Beylagan. This attack 
also ended in failure. According to reliable sources, the 
Armenian side lost 50 soldiers in this fight and more than 70 
were seriously injured. 
  The Azerbaijani Army units destroyed the enemy's firing 
positions around Tonashen and Akopgomer settlements in northern 
Karabakh. Four Armenian armored cars, which used to shell 
Terterskiy Rayon, were destroyed and one T-72 tank was captured. 
  Armenia's Army units tried to attack our troops' positions 
in 
the Murov mountain range to the north of Kelbadzharskiy Rayon in 
the early hours of 10 January. Facing a strong resistance, the 
enemy withdrew after suffering losses.

  [Text] Baku, January 10 (TURAN)--The Defense Ministry of 
Azerbaijan says that yesterday's fighting in the front continues. 
  Units of Armenian Armed Forces are attempting to intercept 
the initiative. Last morning they launched an offensive towards 
the north of the city of Agdam. Earlier they bombarded 
positions of the Azeri Army from "Grad" power-plants. The 
Armenian's attack was repelled with return firing. Having 
sustained losses, Armenian units retreated to their positions. 
  Fighting in the southern section of the front continues. The 
Azeri Army reached the Goradiz-Fizuli Highway. Yesterday the 
Armenians abandoned a number of important positions and Azeri 
Army units were able to reach the city of Fizuli. 
  The enemy has withdrawn from the village of Lulasaz and a 
predominant hill-top in the northern section of the frontline. 
The fighting near the Sarsang Reservoir continues. 
  For the past two days the Armenian Army lost 3 tanks, 2 BMPs 
and approximately 50 soldiers, say military sources.

  [Editorial report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1915 GMT on 10 January carries its "Moment of Truth" 
program, hosted by Andrey Karaulov, who interviews Robert 
Kocharyan, chairman of the State Defense Committee of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The interview was recorded on 4 
January 1994. Topics covered include Kocharyan's personal 
background, the danger of escalation of the war in Karabakh, the 
causes of the conflict, the Khodzhaly massacre in February 1992, 
whether anything has been gained since the conflict began, 
whether the Armenians' demands were realistic in 1988, how the 
Armenians obtained their weapons and whether they received aid 
from Armenia proper, and the state of the Karabakh economy. 
  Asked by Karaulov whether he would be prepared to sit down 
together with Azerbaijani Leader Geydar Aliyev in another 
edition of "Moment of Truth," Kocharyan says: "Yes, I would. 
What's more, we have things to talk about; I am ready, of 
course. I think that in general terms, if it works out, maybe 
it will save a few lives. If it only saves one life, it is 
already an achievement." 
  Pressed by Karaulov to confirm that Nagorno-Karabakh would 
never be prepared to be part of Azerbaijan, Kocharyan replies: 
"On 10 December 1991 a referendum was held in Nagorno-Karabakh, 
and the will of the people was expressed in the terms you have 
used. I believe that at the present time it would be more 
correct to freeze the war, if need be to bring in some 
disengaging forces which would simply take the heat out of the 
conflict between the two sides, and talks would be held, talks 
on status, talks on relations. Maybe some kind of mutually 
acceptable solutions would be found, some kind of treaty-based 
relations with Azerbaijan. It is not necessary at present, in 
the current situation, to touch on the subject of territorial 
integrity, the subject of independence, but simply to stop the 
war, and give people time to get their breath back. The people 
will decide what should then be done, it's their right, their 
business." 
  At the end of the program, a caption states that news of the 
latest Azerbaijani offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh came in just as 
the program was being prepared for broadcasting, and that a 
statement has just been received from Kocharyan by telephone 
specially for the program. The statement says: "Azerbaijan, 
having rejected the Russian initiatives for a cease-fire and the 
CSCE Minsk group's plan for a settlement to the conflict, began 
a major offensive in early December along the entire front. 
Continuous heavy fighting has been going on for more than a 
month. The situation is extremely difficult. On the southern 
section of the front the Azerbaijani army has managed, in spite 
of heavy losses, to make substantial headway. The territory of 
the adjoining state is being used in the offensive. The 
Azerbaijanis have prepared the offensive quite thoroughly. A 
large number of new tanks and armored personnel carriers have 
appeared, and troops are armed with 1993 model firearms, 
American anti-tank systems, American military radio sets and 
shells, and Turkish mortars. Artillery is constantly in action. 
All this testifies to major supplies of munitions and arms. And 
this is alongside the existence of a number of UN Security 
Council resolutions banning arms supplies to the region. 
Fighting in the Azerbaijani army are mojahedin from 
Afghanistan, specialist instructors from Turkey, and numerous 
mercenaries from Ukraine and Russia. It only remains to ponder 
on who pays for all this. It is very difficult for us to fight 
back with our limited human and material resources. We are too 
few to fight everyone. We are relying on the courage and will 
of our people."

  [Text] Baku, January 8 (TURAN) -- During the latest 
fightings at the southern sector of the front a Russian citizen, 
Lugovoy, Vladimir Vasilyevich, (1960) was taken prisoner. 
  A dweller of Krasnoyarsk region Vladimir Lugovoy was 
recruited on November 1993 by the leader of Armenian community 
of Pyatigorsk to fight in Karabakh. As Lugovoy said, special 
groups of Armenians actively recruit Russians in Moscow, 
Saint-Petersburg, Minvodi, Krasnodar and Vladikavkaz and send 
them to Armenia and Karabakh. Besides, Russian businessmen of 
Armenian origin transfer a certain per cent of their income to 
the special account for purchasing arms for Karabakh fighters. 
  As Lugovoy said, the recruiters prefer highly qualified 
retired servicemen. So, Lugovoy himself is a scout who served 
in Germany for a few years. 
  As Lugovoy also said, they promised to pay him 35 thousand 
rubles per day. Women sharp-shooters from Estonia and Latvia 
are being paid in hard currency for each killed Azeri. The 
mercenary also said that two Russian mercenaries from Voronezh 
were killed by Armenians for "being too insistent" in their 
demands to pay them fee earned for several months. 
  According to Lugovoy Russian battalion, recruited from the 
servicemen of the 7th Russian Army, a battalion consisting of 
Cossacks living along the Don River, a Special Battalion 
consisting of Russians and Cossacks are fighting on the Armenian 
side at Fizuli line of advance.

  [Text] According to POWs from CIS countries captured in 
Karabakh, Azerbaijan pays each of the mercenaries fighting on 
its side 500,000 Russian rubles a month. For carrying out 
especially important military assignments, a soldier of fortune 
receives additionally up to 10,000 US dollars. Member of 
parliament of the Nagornyy Karabakh Republic writer (Zuriy 
Balayan) has given this information to SNARK agency. Apart from 
this, nearly 1,500 Afghan modjaheddin are also fighing on the 
Azeri side, which is not even being denied by Kabul. Balayan 
expressed his surprise by the total absence of any reaction from 
the Russian leadership to the recent television report on a 
group of mercenaries recruited in Ivanovo that was departing for 
Azerbaijan. This was an IMA-press report.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 10 Jan -- IBERIA news agency learned from 
reliable sources that Georgia might join the ruble zone in the 
immediate future. Russia is putting forward quite strict terms 
for this; in particular, it is ready to accept Georgia in this 
zone provided Georgia refuses that part of the foreign 
countries' debt which, after the disintegration of the Soviet 
Union, belonged to it, and refuses foreign assets, gold mines 
(if such are available or will be available in future), and 
independent credit emissions. 
  According to the reports by the same source, Russia may also 
demand that nominees for the posts of finance minister and 
president of the national bank be chosen only with Russia's 
participation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman of the Republic </F>
of Abkhazia Supreme Council, by Wojciech Gorecki in Gudauta; 
date not given: "There Will Be a State"] 
  [Text] [Gorecki] Could you define the present status of 
Abkhazia? Is it formally a part of Georgia, a part of the 
Russian Federation, or is it a fully sovereign state, albeit one 
that has not been recognized by anyone in the world? 
  [Ardzinba] Abkhazia is, in fact, a sovereign state and it is 
worth pointing out here that the Abkhazians have a tradition of 
statehood that goes back to the 12th century. We want to join 
the family of democratic countries: Our parliament accepts all 
the norms of international law and has ratified all human rights. 
  Unfortunately, the path toward the recognition of Abkhazia 
on 
the international arena is a long and complicated one. We have 
to proceed along it; however, we have already succeeded in 
taking the first step. 
  [Gorecki] How would you personally assess Russia's policy 
toward Abkhazia? On the one hand, your biggest neighbor has 
sent a contingent of peacekeeping forces while, on the other, it 
is imposing a blockade upon Abkhazia and restricting the supply 
of electric power to five hours a day.... 
  [Ardzinba] Russia is behaving in a strange manner toward us 
and I view the steps taken by Moscow as harmful and unjust. 
Following a war that lasted many months, in which people were 
killed, villages and towns destroyed, and material losses 
amounted to approximately 2 trillion rubles, our country wants 
peace. In order to ensure the latter, we have turned to Russia 
and international organizations for help. We were counting on 
the fact that world opinion would condemn Georgia as the 
aggressor and impose sanctions upon it. Meanwhile, although 
Georgia is constantly violating the terms of the Sochi agreement 
(that formally brought the war to an end -- W.G.), repressive 
measures are being taken against us. Why is this happening? 
Please ask the authorities in the Kremlin. 
  [Gorecki] How do you view Abkhazia's future? What are the 
main problems facing your republic? 
  [Ardzinba] Until we sign an agreement with Georgia on the 
regulation of bilateral relations and receive political 
guarantees that peace will be maintained, we will not view the 
war with this state as being over. We, for our part, are ready 
to negotiate. 
  The most important problem is, of course, the normalization 
of daily life and the strengthening of Abkhazian power 
throughout the republic. Once the Russian Federation has lifted 
the economic blockade, our fundamental task will be to conclude 
a bilateral treaty with it. 
  In the near future, the draft of the new constitution of the 
Republic of Abkhazia will be submitted to the Supreme Council. 
The general public will decide upon its final form in a 
referendum.

  [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze said that the 
former president Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who killed himself 
recently, "did not represent a serious political force in 
today's Georgia because his ideology and his supporters had been 
defeated." 
  Shevardnadze warned against complacency, however. In his 
words, there have been certain groups behind Gamsakhurdia which 
"will try again to set up a pro-fascist organization which will 
oppose the existing authorities." 
  Shevardnadze believes that it was up to Gamsakhurdia's 
family 
where to bury him. "We will agree to anything," he said. 
  He called for an international investigation of 
Gamsakhurdia's death "to prevent any rumors."

  [Text] Georgia's National Ideology Party press center today 
gave IBERIA news agency the following statement: To UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali; Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
chairman of Russia's Liberal-Democratic Party; Iliya II, the 
catholicos-patriarch of all-Georgia. 
  Georgia's National Ideology Party expresses deep sorrow over 
the tragic death of Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the leader of the 
national movement of contemporary Georgia, the first president 
of Georgia. He was an internationally recognized dissident, 
human rights activist, writer and philosopher. Georgia's 
National Ideology Party calls on the current official 
authorities of Georgia to show good will and hand over the body 
of Zviad Gamsakhurdia to the Georgian nation. Meanwhile, this 
will give Georgian people the possibility to pay proper homage 
to their first president. Those who think that the national 
and political symbol of Zviad Gamsakhurdia will fade following 
his tragic death are mistaken. On the contrary, with time this 
symbol will grow larger and become stronger for the good of the 
Georgian nation. Georgia's National Ideology Party, expressing 
the wish of the ancient Georgian people, demands that Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's first president, the author of Georgia's 
soul mission, be buried in the Mtatsminda pantheon [overlooking 
Tbilisi] next to Merab Kostava, and the day of his burial be 
made a day of national mourning. 
  By holding the corpse and keeping it in secret, certain 
forces wish to create a myth of the dead president's life, as if 
he were alive, which confuses people and neutralizes the 
Georgian people's reaction to the death of the president. Then 
these forces could claim that Zviad Gamsakhurdia's death had no 
impact on the Georgian people. The appearance of the corpse 
would dispel all kinds of misinformation and would not further 
psychologically torture the people, who have already been 
tortured enough. 
  Moreover, in our opinion, there are well-grounded doubts 
that 
before his tragic death, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, together with his 
entourage, were arrested under strictly secret circumstances. 
It is obvious that the arrest was aimed at the political and 
personal repentance to which Gamsakhurdia would have reacted by 
going on hunger strike. 
  Was it a forced suicide or murder? Time will establish 
which. Today only one thing is clear -- the first president of 
Georgia is no longer alive and a proper homage must be paid to 
him. 
  Georgia's National Ideology Party firmly believes that the 
political farce connected with the murder of Zviad Gamsakhurdia 
must end and the Georgian people and the whole world must be 
told the truth. A special commission comprising the leaders of 
political parties, alongside public representatives, must be set 
up for this aim. 
  [Signed] Zurab Gagnidze, chairman Georgia's National 
Ideology 
Party, Tbilisi, 10 January 1994

<F P=106> [Interview with former Prime Minister Tengiz Sigua by Eteri </F>
Kakabadze; place and date not given: "Tengiz Sigua: 
`Gamsakhurdia Had a Choice; the Opposition Did Not'"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Kakabadze]Could you 
tell us how and by whom was the decision taken to bring 
Shevardnadze back to Georgia? Why was he specifically chosen? 
After all, the opinion about him in Georgia was far from 
unanimous. 
  [Sigua] I can tell you how I viewed it. This is a person 
with enormous international prestige and it would not have been 
serious on our part had we dismissed this aspect. 
Shevardnadze's return to Georgia could have given us two big 
advantages. He could have ensured Georgia received 
international recognition and its entry into such influential 
international organizations as the United Nations, CSCE, and so 
forth. It is wholly natural that these processes would have 
been connected with the name of Shevardnadze. Indeed, this is 
what subsequently happened. The second advantage lay in the 
fact that he could have developed international action on a 
broad scale and attracted foreign credits into the country with 
the help of which we would have been able to get the economy 
back on its feet. According to my calculations, just some four 
to five months after his return, we would have received $300-400 
million in the form of preferential credits. Unfortunately, 
this did not happen. However, there were also two big 
disadvantages. The first was western Georgia; with his return, 
the situation there would have become even more acute. The 
second was the attitude of the Russian generals to the 
Gorbachev-Yakovlev-Shevardnadze [alliance]. However, when I 
weighed the pros and cons, the former outweighed the latter. 
  [Kakabadze] Did you have any opponents in this 
matter? 
  [Sigua] Yes. However, I managed to persuade them that 
Shevardnadze was no longer the same person whom Georgia used to 
know. Moreover, I sincerely believed this myself. 
  [Kakabadze] Why have you said this with such regret? 
Do you think you made a mistake? 
  [Sigua] Of course, I made a mistake. Life has shown that he 
has not changed a bit since he was first secretary of the 
[Georgian] Central Committee. I can see that no genuinely 
democratic -- not pseudo-democratic -- transformations have 
occurred in the country since his arrival. There is just the 
appearance of democracy. Tell me, how can one simply justify 
the fact that the law on elections was changed by him five times 
as a result of which people entered parliament who now make up 
the majority. This was just the start. One voluntaristic 
decision followed another.... The appointment of God knows who 
as ministers. Who can explain to me what guidelines one needs 
to follow in order to appoint a person with two criminal 
convictions as minister of internal affairs? One can go on and 
on. I admit that I made a mistake regarding this person. 
  [Kakabadze]However, can one suppose that what is at 
play here is not so much the subjective factor but objective 
conditions? Do you think that anyone else in his place could 
have done more? 
  [Sigua] I know that Shevardnadze's double game with the West 
was our ruin. It was already clear at the Malta summit that 
something had occurred in the division of spheres of influence 
and that Georgia and perhaps the whole Transcaucasus would be 
the first to leave Moscow's sphere of influence. At least, I 
felt that Shevardnadze knew what we simple mortals did not know 
and, therefore, he set his sights exclusively on the West. 
However, I realized as early as April that this was not the 
case. In such a situation, it would have been necessary to 
change one's policy and speak with Russia in a different way and 
not use the language of intrigue while playing up to the West. 
When those 88 UN observers did not come to Georgia, I already 
knew that the West, if not completely, had started to give us up 
as a bad job. On whose support had we been counting on all that 
time? Shevardnadze refused when [Russian Defense Minister] 
Grachev suggested bringing a contingent of Russian troops into 
Ochamchire [Abkhazia], Poti, Zugdidi, and Senaki [Mingrelia]. 
As a result, we experienced the Sukhumi tragedy. Who will 
answer for this? And one more thing -- why, if we are opposed 
in principle to the introduction of Russian troops, should we 
destroy our principles and bring them in no matter but with less 
effective results? Where is the logic in this? 
  [Kakabadze]Where does the solution lie today? The 
people are already saying that independence is costing us too 
much. 
  [Sigua] There is a solution. First, we have to retrieve 
the credits issued by the National Bank and this should be done 
as a matter of urgency. I have already stated that, according 
to my calculations, some $70-100 million from these credits have 
ended up in foreign banks. They must be returned and, in order 
to do this, our police should join Interpol whatever it may cost 
us and, thereby, establish ties with European banks. We should 
retrieve at least half of this money. This is the first thing. 
Second, for some five months now, no one has said a word about 
the fact that the IMF has elaborated a special mechanism aimed 
at giving support to system changes in Georgia. It is stated in 
the letter, which I handed to Shevardnadze and to which he has 
not reacted in any way, that the fund is ready to grant 50 
percent of our quota in this organization right away. This 
amounts to $200 million. These $200 million plus the returned 
credits plus the work done in order to obtain more preferential 
credits from developed capitalist countries.... I believe that 
approximately $400-500 million, which can be collected in this 
way, is wholly sufficient for the initial stage of establishing 
Georgia's economy. Of this amount, approximately $70 million 
has to be allocated to the Georgian National Bank in order to 
strengthen the new national currency -- the lari -- that will be 
introduced in the near future. Otherwise, the same thing will 
happen to it as happened to the coupon. I view this way as a 
realistic one. We will then be able to purchase the necessary 
quantity of energy sources and the necessary raw materials and 
get our industry off the ground. According to my calculations, 
on this basis, we could achieve 65 or possibly 70 percent of the 
level of production that was attained in 1987. This is the 
figure that will bring our economic depression to an end. 
  I am often being asked why am I opposed to our joining the 
CIS. I am not against our membership, provided it is officially 
established that we were forced to take this step. In that 
case, I will know that there was no other way out. However, 
when we are being told that joining the CIS is our only chance 
of survival, I do not agree with this. Russia will not feed us 
for free and trade with us at dumping prices. It is another 
matter that we should maintain very close financial and economic 
relations with all the former republics of the USSR as, at 
present, we basically do not have the means to conduct trade on 
new alternative markets. However, it is not necessary to join 
any new alliances in order to do this.

Constitution of the Russian Federation. A total of 32,937,000, 
or more than 58 percent, voted in favor of the Constitution. 
After the elections, 150 complaints were registered and some of 
these had been submitted for examination in the courts. The 
election campaign cost 160 billion rubles. Nikolay Ryabov also 
reported that representatives of 29 nationalities had been 
elected to the Federation Council. Russians make up 76 percent 
of the total number of deputies in the upper chamber.

  [Text] President Boris Yeltsin is to make a brief opening 
speech at the first session of the Federation Council, the upper 
house of parliament, at 10:00 on Tuesday, Council Member and 
First Vice Premier Vladimir Shumeyko told FC deputies. 
  He informed Council members about a presidential decree to 
equip the House with modern communications allowing to in 
contact with a total of 44,000 telephone numbers nationwide. 
  The session is expected to discuss and adopt procedures and 
house rules on its first day of work, Shumeyko told INTERFAX. 
  Since the constitution does not say who exactly is in charge 
of the first session, the organizing committee will recommend 
the eldest deputy do so to fall into line with the procedure 
adopted by the State Duma, he said. 
  He named leader of the Peasants' Party Yuriy Chernichenko as 
the eldest member of the Federation Council, which is also 
expected to elect its Speaker. 
  The Council is to meet every third week of the month. The 
session's seven-point agenda includes discussion of house rules 
and organizational matters, elections of Speaker and his 
deputies, formation of house committees and election of its 
leaders. 
  Shumeyko spoke of two viewpoints on the arrangements for the 
Federal Assembly. Some say the two houses must employ the same 
staff for day-to-day management. Others prefer independent 
staffs since the two house operate autonomously. 
  The Council will need about a week to cover the whole of the 
first session's agenda, Shumeyko said.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Todres report under the "Senate" rubric: </F>
"Vladimir Shumeyko May Become Federation Council Head. 
`Territorial Factions' Take Shape in Upper Chamber"] 
  [Text] It seems that the Federation Council will not wait 
too long to elect its chairman, who may be named as early as 
today. Vladimir Shumeyko, chief of the organizing committee, has 
already said that he is going to propose the vote right after 
the question of voting procedure was resolved. 
  By many accounts, it is Mr. Shumeyko, elected in Kaliningrad 
Oblast, who has the best chances to assume this job. He even 
plans to ask Boris Yeltsin to allow him to combine his permanent 
job at the Federation Council with being deputy prime minister. 
Earlier, Vladimir Shumeyko had said that he did not consider 
the future speaker as "a ceremonial figure, but as a 
decisionmaking politician" -- apparently unlike "the first-night 
speaker," Yuriy Chernichenko, who will open the senate's meeting 
as the oldest deputy. 
  There have been no reports about any consultations among 
other senators as to who would be their head. Viktor Stepanov, 
chief of the Karelian Supreme Soviet, even suggested that there 
should be no speaker in the upper chamber at all so that "no one 
will manipulate the deputies." This option is unlikely to 
materialize. What this means, however, is that Vladimir 
Shumeyko may have as many as 169 competitors, but none of them 
can seriously challenge him. 
  Still, one should proceed with care when forecasting the 
results of the vote. The Federation Council, unlike the State 
Duma, has so far been devoid of party lines. Any talk about 
party factions in the council is yet out of the question: out 
of 170 seats, the communists have 12; "Russia's Choice," 6; and 
the Agrarian Party, 1. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy claims that senator 
Leonid Polezhayev, Omsk Oblast governor, has connections with 
his party. Mr. Polezhayev himself denies this. Mr. Shumeyko 
has already said that he was "glad that the upper chamber does 
not have any party affiliation." It is likely, however, that 
territorial blocs will emerge in it instead of party factions. 
  Eduard Rossel, dismissed from governorship but still leader 
of the Urals Economic Cooperation Association, continues his 
efforts to form a group called "Deputies of the Urals." On 
Monday evening, the council of the "Siberian Agreement" 
association was meeting to work out its line of conduct; the 
next meeting was scheduled for Wednesday. 
  The essence of the policies regional elites are expecting 
their delegates to pursue was formulated fairly clearly by 
conferences of entrepreneurs in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, 
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, and Magadan: They requested that the 
Far East authorities take protectionist measures to shield 
domestic businesses and introduce tight taxation rules for 
foreign entrepreneurs.

  [Text] Moscow January 10 TASS -- 170 lawmakers of the 
Federation Council, the upper chamber of the new legislature, 
were promised major privileges in the near future at a meeting 
with a presidential representative on Monday. 
  Pavel Borodin from the administrative office of the 
president 
told the lawmakers, who are mostly regional leaders, that their 
chamber will get 500 office cars, a special polyclinic, country 
houses, as well as four-room apartments in Moscow. 
  Some of the lawmakers opposed the privileges qualifying them 
as "impermissible luxury". 
  But Borodin said that the accomodation privileges may be 
expected only in the middle of 1995 when a corresponding complex 
of buildings with a total space of 360,000 sq metres is to be 
constructed. Besides, it will be the parliament which is to 
adopt the final decision on the issue, he said. 
  For the time being, lawmakers will have to tolerate some 
inconveniences. They will live in hotels, share one office for 
two people, work in a poorely prepared conference hall which has 
dark walls and unpleasantly looking chairs. 
  But Borodin promised fast improvements, including an office 
for each lawmaker.

<F P=106> [Message from President Boris Yeltsin to the State Duma in </F>
Moscow on 11 January; read by Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin--recorded] 
  [Text] Esteemed deputies of the State Duma! Permit me 
first of all to deliver greetings from the president of Russia 
to this state authority, the State Duma. 
  Esteemed deputies of the State Duma! The Federation Council 
and the State Duma of Russia today commence work. For the first 
time in the history of our country, the representative and 
legislative body has been elected on a multi-party basis in an 
environment of a free contest of views, positions, and 
philosophies. The Russian Federation parliament is beginning 
its work under a real division of powers, which is not only 
proclaimed by the Russian Constitution, but also is consistently 
implemented in its provisions. This is the most important 
condition for constructive interaction between the Federal 
Assembly, the president, the government, and all bodies of state 
in the country. 
  Before us stands one task that unites us all: to seek 
decisions that take the fullest possible account of the 
diversity of interests that is natural in any pluralist society. 
A range of groups within society is represented in the current 
Russian parliament -- a range of sentiments and opinions in 
contemporary Russia are reflected here. I do not call upon you 
to show unanimity, but it will be difficult to save our country 
from upheaval without acknowledging and rallying toward shared 
values. These values are civic peace, stability, the unity of 
the country, and its renewal. 
  We are responsible for this. Our electors live and want to 
live in a peaceful Russia. They desire stability and calm, and 
all the arms of power should not confound the aspirations of the 
people of Russia. We should all unite in our striving to 
preserve the integrity of the country, the dignity of Russia, 
and a sense of civic pride in our fellow countrymen. 
  One of the major tasks facing us is to overcome the economic 
crisis, and to achieve a high standard of living in Russia. It 
is not only possible but essential to pool our efforts to 
resolve these problems. 
  On the eve of the New Year, I sent a letter to every Russian 
parliamentarian seeking suggestions on how best for us to work 
together. Many of you responded and displayed an interest in 
cooperating. Every suggestion is being carefully examined and 
analyzed. I thank you, and I assure you that it is possible to 
conduct a civilized political dialogue that will exert a 
favorable influence on the situation in contemporary Russia. 
  Ahead of you, esteemed deputies, lies a great deal of hard 
work. I hope that in accomplishing it, you will manifest your 
best human and political qualities, and that you will justify 
your electorate's trust, for the good of our motherland. I 
believe that the destiny of Russian Federation 
parliamentarianism will have a successful outcome. Bon voyage, 
esteemed deputies! 
  Boris Yeltsin, President of Russia. [applause]

<F P=106> [Address by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to the State </F>
Duma in Moscow on 11 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] Esteemed members of the State Duma! I hope that the 
good wishes and salutations from the president of the Russian 
Federation will set the tone for the State Duma's work, bring us 
all together in a businesslike and constructive mood, and usher 
in a work pattern of harmony and cooperation. 
  I should like to add a few words from myself, on behalf of 
the Russian Government. The first day of work of a 
fundamentally new parliament elected by the citizens of a 
sovereign state provides good grounds for reflecting on the 
lessons of the recent past. We have traversed a long and 
difficult road together -- the road from declarative sovereignty 
and the formal attributes of the independence of Russia to a 
state that draws up its own borders and its own armaments and 
forces and occupies a worthy place among the world powers. This 
is the road of new economic realities which, although encumbered 
by a multitude of problems, are already delivering our 
fatherland from a topsy-turvy economic world. This is the road 
of awareness of the impermissibility of hostility and 
confrontation -- the road to the new political realities of this 
new year, which are emerging as a result of the people's 
approval of the new Constitution and of the elections to the 
Federal Assembly. The results of the referendum and elections 
are unambiguous on the main point: the citizens of our country 
opted a new Russia, for a strong power, for political stability, 
for reforms and democracy. The state has acquired a firm legal 
foundation, and it is now our common duty to finish building the 
edifice of our new Russian Federation statehood. 
  The government is ready, and will work jointly with the 
corps 
of deputies in all areas of legislative activity -- and together 
we have plenty to do here. That's putting it mildly. To date, 
there are about a hundred bills that have been prepared by the 
government alone that are ready to be submitted for examination 
by the State Duma. They include a civic code for the Russian 
Federation, laws on delegated management of property, on 
mortgages, on making amendments and additions to taxation 
legislation, laws on banks and banking activity, the foundations 
of land, labor and housing legislation, and many others. 
  Esteemed deputies: there are in our native language two 
related words which I, as chairman of the government, would like 
to exclude from the political style of the executive branch of 
power. They are intolerance and impatience. Renouncing the 
first means primarily an ability and readiness to hear and 
listen -- to hold constructive dialogue with a political 
opponent. For this reason, taking account of everything that is 
useful and promising in the economic resources of the factions 
and other deputies' associations represented in the Federal 
Assembly becomes an everyday obligation of the government. 
Second -- what it is that the government should renounce --- 
impatience, which in striving for quick results has frequently 
led us, and still leads us today, to mere outward effects, but 
far from always equally effective decisions. The prohibition on 
impatience envisages primarily scrupulous work on bringing order 
to all the resources of state economic policy. I am convinced 
that order in the state economy begins with establishing order 
in the work of the government. A presidential decree actually 
aimed at this has been signed. 
  The results of the elections bear out that the limits to 
society's patience have to a considerable degree been exhausted. 
But it has to be soberly acknowledged that slackening efforts 
and attempts to soften the burdens of the crisis by populist 
measures will not bring alleviation, but will only drag out this 
stage of the development of the crisis and the associated 
deprivations. Analysis of the first results of the work that 
has been done on the state of the economy and existing problems 
enable us to draw an important conclusion. The prerequisites 
have arisen for moving on to a new stage of reforms -- the stage 
of stabilizing the economy -- when the center of gravity of all 
the government's activity shifts to creating favorable 
conditions for the work of Russian manufacturers. In order to 
implement this task, I shall make every effort to consolidate 
the activities of the government, the parliament, and the 
Russian Central Bank. 
  In social policy we are bound to turn the reforms face to 
face with the people. Social policy for us means not only 
targeted support for the poor, but also granting all citizens 
the possibility of having worthy living conditions. We intend 
to proceed without sudden and unjustified shifts in policy and 
ill-considered shock decisions. We are pondering a certain 
adjustment in our program of practical actions. Most of what we 
want to do is compatible with the basic principles contained in 
the pre-election policy documents of many parties and electoral 
blocs. In my view, this provides a real basis for joint work by 
the government and parliament. The government expresses 
confidence that this work will succeed. We are geared precisely 
for this. I hope that this is how it will work out. I wish you 
success in your work. Thank you. [applause]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 11 TASS -- The first meeting of the 
Russian State Duma, one of the chambers of newly-elected 
parliament, was today addressed by Vice-Chairman of the Central 
Election Commission Aleksandr Ivanchenko. He noted that the 
elections to the new Russian parliament were held at a dramatic 
period of the country's life. Their main result is that they 
have laid a good foundation for national concord. 
  Ivanchenko said that more than 58 million people had taken 
part in the elections. As a result, the country got a new 
constitution. All the parties and movements have expressed their 
readiness to create a new parliamentary system. The elections 
were held for the first time in Russia according to the 
proportional system. They refuted the view of some sceptics 
that elections in Russia could be held only according to the 
majority system. 
  Ivanchenko noted the openness and glasnost of the election 
campaign. The Central Election Commission was able to guarantee 
equal rights and opportunities to each of the 13 registered 
election unions. 
  "The elections were monitored for the first time by 
international observers. More than one thousand of them came to 
Russia for that purpose," Ivanchenko stated. 
  "The Election Commission had accomplished a huge amount of 
work during a very short space of time," he added. Ivanchenko 
noted that only 150 complaints and appeals were received by the 
Central Election Commission after the voting, and that they were 
all carefully studied and corresponding measures were taken. He 
said that there was no doubt that the elections were absolutely 
legitimate. Ivanchenko also stated that the financial 
activities of all the election unions were now being checked and 
the results would be published. 
  The vice-chairman of the Central Election commission said 
that 144 deputies were elected to the State Duma of the Federal 
assembly (parliament), including 225 in federal constituencies 
from parties and movements, and 219 -- in single-mandate 
constituencies. He recalled that no elections were held on the 
territory of the Chechen Republic due to the stand assumed by 
its leadership. No elections were held also in several 
constituencies of Tatarstan. Six seats are yet to be filled in 
the State Duma. 
  Ivanchenko said that the newly-elected deputies of the Duma 
included people of 32 nationalities. More than one-third of the 
deputies have scientific degrees or titles. Representatives 
from presidential structures account for about five per cent of 
all the Duma members. The State Duma includes 68 former 
people's deputies of the Russian Federation, 32 of whom were 
elected in single-mandate constituencies. Ivanchenko dwelt also 
on shortcomings of the present election system. He stressed 
that the electoral legislation should be improved.

  [Text] Moscow January 11 TASS -- State Duma, the low 
chamber of the Russian Federal Assembly (legislature) is now 
engaged in a heated debate about how many people can form a 
parliamentary group or faction. No decision was reached before 
the lunch break. Three figures were proposed -- 14, 20 and 50 
people. A rating vote left only the last two numbers for 
further debate, but none scored a majority in further voting. 
  Factions, their leaders and numbers are of special concern 
to 
the present legislature in which the Liberal Democratic Party 
can command the largest single group of deputies and thus have a 
decisive say in voting. 
  Before the break the Duma elected members of the commission 
charged with seeing to it that the electronic system used in 
registering and displaying voting results function effectively, 
and two other commissions. The deputies also elected a 
provisional secretariat of the State Duma.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 10 TASS -- The latest consultations 
and negotiations held by the factions of the State Duma give 
reason to say with a big degree of certainty that the lower 
house of the new parliament will begin its work with determining 
"the weight categories" of deputy groups. 
  It should be recalled that the State Duma which consists of 
450 deputies includes representatives eight election blocs. On 
the eve of the December 12 elections political scientists 
divided the blocs according to the classical scheme "left -- 
center -- right." However, after the elections the scheme turned 
out to be inapplicable as even the factions which considered 
themselves democratic (the Russia's Choice election bloc, the 
Party of Russian Unity and Accord and the 
Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc /Yabloko/) failed to set up a 
parliamentary coalition. Meanwhile, the left -- communists and 
agrarians -- have already struck deals on some issues but keep 
silent about their alliance with the faction of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR). 
  The Women of Russia bloc and the Democratic Party of Nikolay 
Travkin stand somewhat aloof in this scheme as they consider 
themselves a "centre" and are likely, together with independent 
deputies, side either with their left or the right. It is 
noteworthy that none of the factions has received a 
parliamentary majority in the State Duma. 
  The deputies are most likely to be preoccupied with 
struggling for power in the new parliament in the first couple 
of days of its work. Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar voiced 
concern that the communists and LDPR members will try to gain 
the upper hand in the duma by taking under control its major 
committees and commissions dealing with defence issues and 
international relations. The three other biggest factions of 
the duma (LDPR, the Communist Party and the Agrarian Party) 
obviously have refused to support Russia's Choice in its 
intention to take over the Duma Budget Committee. As a result, 
the bloc has withdrawn from the talks with them. 
  Moreover, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord "suspects" 
Russia's Choice of striking a deal with the three 
above-mentioned factions to nominate four deputies of the State 
Duma speaker. Independent deputies elected in individual 
constituencies have repeatedly warned that deputies elected on 
party tickets who have only half of the seats in the house are 
trying to push through their candidates to the duma ruling 
bodies by the principle of factionalism rather than 
professionalism and political neutrality. 
  Thus, the interfactional discussions have resulted so far 
only in an agreement that the post of speaker will be most 
likely taken up a representative of one of the small factions 
since big factions are strong enough to influence decision 
making in the house. Among the candidates are Anatoliy 
Adamishin and Vladimir Lukin of the Yabloko bloc, and Alevtina 
Fedulova of the Women of Russia bloc. 
  It is unlikely that representatives of the State Duma 
factions will reach a consensus on the coexistence of the 
legislative and executive branches of power. Communist leader 
Gennadiy Zyuganov, obviously unaware of the presidential decree 
on the composition of the new government published today, said 
that his party will "continue its struggle for the government to 
be formed with consent of the parliament." 
  Vice-prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin recently regretted in 
an interview with ITAR-TASS that the government is being formed 
in unprecedented secrecy, while Gaydar emphasised that his bloc 
will support only those ministers in the parliament who share 
its programme. All this goes to prove that there is strong 
opposition in the parliament to the constitutional right of the 
president and prime minister to form a government independently. 
  Political observers are doubtful that factions will manage 
to 
act constructively while adopting more important laws in the 
future. The majority of blocs, including the Party of Russian 
Unity and Accord, the Yabloko bloc, the Democratic Party, Women 
of Russia, the Communist Party and LDPR strongly oppose "shock 
therapy" as a method of carrying out economic reform in the 
country. At the same time, Gaydar and his followers, although 
admitting the need for social reorientation of reforms, still 
insist on a tough monetary policy. 
  Observers believe that no peace and accord will reign in the 
State Duma even after the first "hot" sessions of the house. In 
this situation the president may count only on support of the 
Upper House, the Federation Council, whose deputies include the 
presidents of several Russian constituent republics, heads of 
regional administrations and independent deputies. This will 
enable the Upper House to control and curb the unpredictable 
Lower House. 
  Under the new constitution, the Federation Council considers 
laws adopted by the Lower House and makes decisions on the 
redrawing of borders between the subjects of the federation, 
imposition of a state of emergency and on holding presidential 
elections. In fact the Federation Council will virtually act as 
a buffer between the president, the government and the State 
Duma.

"Extra-Parliamentary Opposition Makes a Statement. Some of Its 
Colleagues Promise To Follow Its Commandments"] 
  [Text] At yesterday evening's news conference in the 
Rossiya Hotel well-known opposition leaders presented a 
"Statement by Leaders of Parties and Public Organizations 'On 
the Illegitimacy of the Constitution Submitted to the Referendum 
by B. Yeltsin.'" In the opinion of the authors of the 
statement, the constitution restores an authoritarian system; it 
was cooked "in the president's kitchen" and was adopted with 
extremely gross violations not only of the 1978 Constitution but 
even the 1990 Referendum Law, namely: the election commissions 
were formed on the decision of the executive branch; they openly 
campaigned in favor of the constitution; and the opposition was 
not given access to the media, while the vote count was 
conducted incorrectly and with widespread rigging. Therefore 
the politicians who had invited the journalists proposed that 
the constitution be deemed illegitimate. The Federal Assembly, 
however, in their opinion may work, but work only with one goal 
-- to approve the law on elections to the Constituent Assembly 
which in its turn will adopt a new and "fair" constitution. 
  The statement was signed by Rumyantsev, Aksyuchits, Pavlov, 
Astafyev, and other well-known opponents of the presidential 
team representing the National Salvation Front, the 
Constitutional Democrats, the Russian People's Union, the 
Russian Christian Democratic Movement, and other organizations 
of similar orientation. What makes the statement special, 
however, according to the meeting's organizers, is not the fact 
that it bears a few signatures by newly elected deputies to the 
Federal Assembly (for instance, Mr. Baburin) but the promise to 
join the signatories given by leaders of the Agrarian Party and 
the communists. Thus, according to Mr. Rumyantsev, the 
agrarians were among the initiators of working out the document, 
while according to Mr. Pavlov, not only communist leader 
Zyuganov expressed a wish to sign the document, but even a party 
plenary session has already made a corresponding decision. 
  Therefore, in the opinion of the press conference 
organizers, 
the first sessions of the State Duma will follow not the 
presidential scenario wherein "Mr. Filatov wags his finger to 
tell the deputies to engage in organizational matters for two 
months" but, to the contrary, they will proceed according to the 
plan devised by the authors of the statement. With just a day 
to go before the opening of the Duma the opponents of the 
Yeltsin team are sure that the objective of many factions and 
deputies will be to analyze the question of their own legitimacy 
in light of the events of last September-October, which will 
naturally come into conflict with the goals of the president's 
supporters. 
  Because as of now, according to Mr. Rumyantsev, we have "a 
powerless Duma," this opposition inside it will not immediately 
lead to the goals declared in the statement -- the adoption of a 
law on the Constituent Assembly and a new, "democratic" 
constitution. In these conditions special importance will be 
taken on not so much by opposition to the government course in 
the Duma as by extra parliamentary struggle wherein a weighty 
word will be spoken by politicians not elected as deputies, that 
is to say, an overwhelming majority of signatories to the 
document that was promulgated to the press. 
  Such hopes are surely not devoid of certain reason. Even 
coming from outstanding parliamentarians of the recent past, 
however, they appear rather to be illusions since the movements 
represented in the Federal Assembly certainly have their own 
cadre plans, including with respect to activity outside the 
State Duma. And although the upcoming Duma debates cannot 
possibly be called cool, it seems that the factions in 
opposition to the government will follow the path proposed by 
their colleagues with no deputy mandates precisely up to the 
point where their fervor results in an undesirable and 
irreversible buildup of pressure in the Duma boiler.

  [Text] Moscow January 10 TASS -- The leaders of major 
Russian parliament factions have not adopted the final decision 
on the candidate to the post of the State Duma speaker, but 
succeeded in "working out the concept of approach to this 
issue," Viktor Zerkaltsev, a communist lawmaker told ITAR-TASS. 
  He said the factions have decided not to disclose the 
preliminary agreements on this issue, but did not deny that the 
Communist Party would not claim the speaker's post as "it does 
not consider itself to be a small faction". 
  The leaders of the four biggest factions agreed that the 
post 
of the speaker should be occupied by the representative of "a 
neutral small faction" while all the big factions will get the 
posts of deputy speakers, according to a statement made by 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic 
Party. But on January 7 leaders of the Russia's Choice bloc 
abandoned the talks on the question. 
  Zerkaltsev regards this decision of the Russia's Choice bloc 
as "surprising". Until recently the bloc "though not accepting 
the candidates still agreed with the conception of choosing the 
speaker", he pointed out. He believes that the chairman of the 
State Duma will be elected on the second day of the session. 
Otherwise the process will become endless, Zerkaltsev stressed.

"Sergey Shakhray Does Not Like To Move Twice, and Acts as 
Independent Deputies' Defender"] 
  [Text] Yegor Gaydar said yesterday that following talks 
with the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], the Agrarian 
Party of Russia [APR], and the Russian Federation Communist 
Party [RFCP], "Russia's Choice" started coordinating efforts 
with independent deputies and the Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord [PRES] faction. 
  The PRES leader held a news conference on the eve of the 
Federal Assembly's opening session, in which he suggested that 
the parliament begin its work with a vote of confidence in the 
government or personally Viktor Chernomyrdin. According to 
Sergey Shakhray, this would boost the current cabinet's stand, 
for deputies from the radical opposition would raise this 
question sooner or later anyway. He said that Viktor 
Chernomyrdin responded to this idea favorably when meeting with 
PRES chiefs, although he has not yet finally made up his mind. 
Sergey Shakhray pointed out at the same time that reorganizing 
the government before the parliament began its work "amounts to 
an apple of discord between the government, the president, and 
the parliament," because, in his view, this should have been 
done after consultations with Federal Assembly factions. He 
said he did not know what place would be accorded to him in the 
government and, therefore, he did not take part in the move to 
the White House because he did not like "to move twice." 
Incidentally, yesterday Boris Yeltsin signed an edict on the 
structure of the Russian Government and tasked Viktor 
Chernomyrdin with naming the government's lineup, which puts off 
the tide of resignations expected by analysts further into the 
future. "We cannot accept the attempt of the four largest 
factions ("Russia's Choice," APR, RFCP, and LDPR -- R.B.) to 
strike a deal on the speaker and candidacies of committee 
chairmen," the PRES leader said. He also supported the newly 
formed group of State Duma deputies with an intimately familiar 
name -- the Interregional Group of Independent Deputies. The 
group is made up of around 50 deputies. The crux of the 
grievances voiced by the independents and backed by Sergey 
Shakhray is that they insist on the participation of regional 
associations comprising deputies elected in territorial 
districts in all talks on the candidacies of the speaker and 
committee chairmen. They propose that all the State Duma's 
working bodies be formed on a parity basis (with one half 
allotted to the parties, the other half to the "territorial 
deputies"). This is why the "independents," the PRES, and the 
"republicans" (15 deputies from republics and autonomous 
entities) oppose a vote based on party lists and insist on a 
secret ballot for electing State Duma chiefs. According to 
Sergey Shakhray, the formula of representation should be as 
follows: the State Duma chairman should have two deputies from 
parties and another two from "territorial" parliamentarians; 
each of the eight committees should have accordingly either a 
party chairman and a "territorial" deputy or the other way 
around. Obviously, the PRES leader's throwing his weight behind 
the 225 deputies elected in territorial districts could have 
drastically boosted Sergey Shakhray's speakership chances, which 
have dropped nearly to zero, had it not been for two "buts." 
First, it is fairly dubious that the "territorial deputies" are 
completely nonpartisan; second, the four "pillars" of the State 
Duma have already given up "behind-the-scenes deals" and have 
switched to open confrontation.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Shchipanov report under the "News From the Very </F>
Top" rubric: "Nothing Has Been Decided Yet"] 
  [Text] It came to light on 7 January that the Russia's 
Choice executive council had made a strategic decision to cut 
short the four-sided consultations with the Communists, 
Agrarians, and Zhirinovskiy-Liberals on a preliminary 
distribution of key positions in the State Duma. 
  Such a step may look quite symbolic. In fact, Russia's 
Choice had previously been accused of being inconsistent: It 
had promised "never to shake hands with Zhirinovskiyites," and 
then went on and sat down with them at the same table as if 
thereby sanctioning the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia as a 
component part of the political establishment. In the given 
case, however, Russia's Choice expressed a concrete protest 
against the attempts by the remaining three parties to bring 
coordinated pressure to bear on it while distributing the 
positions of Duma committee chairmen. Zhirinovskiy, who had been 
refused entry to a number of countries, is modestly soliciting 
the position of chairman of the international affairs committee, 
while the Communists, in league with the "bearers of the sickle" 
-- the Agrarians -- are seeking the positions of heads of the 
defense and security committees. As if this were not enough, 
Yabloko went and demanded for itself leadership of the budget 
committee, which Russia's Choice would have paid any price to 
reserve for itself. So it is no accident that Russia's Choice 
should decide to make such a tough move. 
  In the meantime, despite the clear desire of the Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord leader, the factions have in fact 
managed to agree on an exceptionally "narrow circle" of 
contenders for State Duma speaker. Observers believe that 
having the two hot bets down the home stretch are: A. 
Adamishin, former first deputy foreign minister; and A. 
Fedulova, the former "first Young Pioneer" of the land of 
Soviets. According to our lights, A. Adamishin confirmed the 
other day the seriousness of his parliamentary intentions, 
having tendered his resignation from his Foreign Ministry 
position. Unlike his boss, Kozyrev, he cannot simultaneously 
have his seat in parliament and keep his ministerial seat. 
(Incidentally, Adamishin's aides have resolutely declined any 
comment about his intentions). 
  I. Ivanov, Russia's ex-ambassador to Spain, has already 
become Kozyrev's new first deputy. Mrs. Fedulova, however, 
seems to have some moral edge on the career diplomat. The 
election of a woman to the position of speaker would send good 
vibrations around this country and the world in addition to 
cutting the ground from under the nascent feminist movement in 
Russia.

<F P=106> [Rustam Arifdzhanov report: "Government's First Resolution: </F>
Build a New Parliament Center"] 
  [Text] Decree No. 1 of the Russian Federation Government 
was signed by its chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin on 6 January 
1994. It is the document "On the Construction of a Complex of 
Buildings for the Parliament Center -- Official Residence of the 
Federal Assembly." 
  We wrote in the last issue of the newspaper about the 
proposed construction of a new administrative complex for 
parliament in Moscow. The initiative for building it came from 
the president's administration, and according to Pavel Borodin, 
the president's administrator of affairs, as quoted by INTERFAX, 
it is proposed to earmark about half a billion dollars for the 
purpose. 
  However, the report was denied almost immediately by 
government First Vice Premier Yegor Gaydar. He stated that no 
such decision is in preparation, or at least he is not aware of 
it. 
  Nonetheless, apparently at the very same time as Yegor 
Timurovich was refuting the report, Viktor Stepanovich was 
signing the first decree of the year. According to this decree, 
it is planned to carry out work on the erection of a complex of 
buildings for the new Parliament Center in 1994-1995. The 
government of Moscow is instructed, in conjunction with the 
president's administration of affairs, to identify a plot for 
the construction of the complex in the central section of Moscow 
within a month. A competition is announced among Russian and 
foreign firms for the best design. It is planned to commission 
the new Parliament Center in the first half of 1995. 
  The figure of half a billion dollars does not appear in the 
decree. Nonetheless, the sum total of expenditure on an 
imposing new construction project is expected to be equally 
vast. The Ministry of the Economy is instructed to allocate the 
necessary quotas of state capital investments, including hard 
currency resources. Yet meanwhile Gaydar, who runs that 
ministry, knows nothing about the preparation of the decree. He 
simply was not informed. 
  Boris Fedorov, the other vice premier and minister of 
finance, only learned of the decree "from the newspapers" on 10 
January. Prior to that, he too had stated that no government 
decision exists as far as he knows -- "at any event, I have 
signed nothing and authorized nothing." 
  After the decree's existence became known not only to the 
country's ordinary taxpayers, who were not expecting their money 
to be used in quite this way, but also to the vice premiers, 
IZVESTIYA's correspondent asked the finance minister some 
questions. According to the minister, he really had not been in 
the know. No session of the government or the government 
presidium had been convened on this subject. As for Boris 
Fedorov's personal opinion, he thinks: We cannot at the present 
day permit ourselves a construction project of $500 million or 
thereabouts. Such a sum is simply not available in reality, or 
even in the plans. Furthermore the finance minister does not 
consider the government's removal to the White House to be 
justified. 
  Maybe the construction will be financed out of the funds of 
the president's administration of affairs? Not likely. The 
president's administration of affairs does have what is known as 
a separate line in the budget, but it seems that no such sums 
are envisaged there. 
  The new construction project will be a heavy burden on the 
country's already unenviable budget. Is it really necessary 
today? Especially since there does not appear to have been any 
special pressure from the newly fledged deputies along the lines 
of "build us a new house immediately." 
  Obviously we are not so rich as to allow ourselves to buy 
things on the cheap. But nor are we so poor as to create new 
administrative palaces in the shortest possible time "for show." 
  I admit we were waiting with considerable interest to see 
how 
the government would begin the new year and what, in the changed 
situation, would be its first step. So now we know.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Yermolin: "Federal Assembly Starts </F>
Work. Wishing It and Ourselves Success"] 
  [Text] Not long before the memorable 21 September, at the 
old parliamentary Defense and Security Committee, I was shown 
the schedule for the preparation of draft laws in 1993-1994. 
More than 30 of them directly affected the Armed Forces. I 
would not presume to judge how far all these drafts truly 
reflected the vital problems of the Army, servicemen, and their 
families, but certainly the schedule itself indicated the 
existence of a comprehensive program of legal provision for the 
life and activities of the Armed Forces. Suffice it to say that 
the draft Fundamentals of Legislation on Veterans had already 
passed its first reading and was close to becoming law. 
  I recall this today only because I would like the new 
parliament's deputies and us to remember the purpose of the 
lofty assembly -- not only to resolve Federation Council and 
State Duma property questions, not only to enable factions to 
get down to brass tacks, make political statements and debate 
with the government and the president, but also to carry out 
meticulous work on Russian legislation. Particularly as it 
turns out that our legislation is far from perfect and has big 
gaps in it, like a ship on the stocks. 
  But this is just one area in which legislators apply their 
efforts. One of many. And servicemen, of course, are one 
stratum of the population that is waiting impatiently for the 
rule-of-law state to take their interests into account. If one 
is talking about laws that have already been adopted, they 
represent merely a kind of foundation stone -- there is no end 
of work to be done to provider the superstructure and work out 
the details. 
  Both chambers of the Federal Assembly start work today, 11 
January. Having found their workplaces, not without difficulty 
(and scandal), our elected representatives have to solve a mass 
of organizational questions -- who is to head the chambers, who 
is to head the committees and commissions, what the standing 
orders should be, what to pay attention to first and foremost, 
and so on. At the stage of consultations the parliamentary 
forces did not make much progress toward accord. But let us 
hope that the very atmosphere of parliamentary business will 
attune the deputies to cooperation. As for various threatening 
statements by the leaders of factions in the State Duma, let us 
put them down to the obligatory rhetoric on such occasions. 
  Of course, it would be naive to hope that the new 
parliamentarians will focus exclusively on legislative activity. 
The obligatory backcloth, as in any parliament, will be 
political struggle. The question is to what extent will this 
struggle preoccupy deputies' minds and will there be any room 
left for actual legislation. 
  We are all faced with an example of the tragic denouement of 
the conflict between the two branches of authority. Will this 
lofty assembly be the bulwark of a rule-of-law state or will it 
turn into another source of political tension in the country, 
embroiling the broadest strata of the population in an 
internecine struggle? Unfortunately, there are few grounds for 
optimistic forecasts at the moment. On the one hand, the energy 
of election rivalry is not yet spent and is still making an 
impact, on the other hand, the new parliamentarians' ambitions 
are beginning to take shape. Naturally, the interplay of these 
ambitions is hotting up the atmosphere of the Federal Assembly, 
which was not exactly cool to begin with. 
  What can one hope for in such a situation? The common sense 
of the majority of parliamentarians, that is all. Presumably, 
only a few of them will not be aware that what is being decided 
today is the fate not of individual statesmen and politicians 
who see themselves as irreplaceable, but the fate of the 
reforms, and, ultimately, the fate of Russia. In fact, it is 
all clear and simple: If this parliament turns into an arena of 
intransigence, with squabbles and feuds as its main attractions, 
we will all have to forget about our dreams of a civilized, 
rule-of-law state for a long time. 
  So a new chapter of Russian parliamentarianism is beginning. 
It is hard to imagine any Russian citizen not wishing the 
Federal Assembly success. In the end, any other outcome would 
result in irrevocable losses for society and the forfeiture of 
civil peace. But, as the say, let us wait and see.

<F P=106> [Statements by Duma Deputies Irina Khakamada, Vladimir </F>
Lysenko, and Yekaterina Lakhova; carried under "The Duma Through 
the Eyes of Deputies" rubric] 
  [Text] Irina Khakamada: Walking the Tightrope 
  The parliament which we elected is unpredictable. No one has 
an absolute majority. Whether a decision is passed or not will 
depend each time on what forces reach agreement between 
themselves in the Duma. Not only are the interfactional 
alliances movable, but each faction itself is not monolithic and 
is also movable, since the leaders' ambitions and the increasing 
influence of personalities within their associations will also 
play their role. 
  Why the democrats lost and what conclusions should be drawn 
from their defeat is a question that has been discussed quite 
thoroughly already. I only wish to stress that if the 
government carries out unpopular reforms and at the same time 
wants to win elections, it should prepare itself support among 
the population in advance. The decisions on increasing pensions 
and the transfer of the militia to municipal authority (after 
all, our militia today cannot defend the citizen -- I have 
encountered this in my own life) should have been published not 
today, after the elections, but before them. Voters refused to 
follow the word "democrats" out of inertia, thus demanding that 
they be shown respect: If you want their support you have to 
give them money and responsibility. Give them the chance to see 
what they get for their taxes: Here is where they are going, 
and this is the sort of return I am getting. Therefore 
populists of all sorts were able to play on the absolute 
insolubility of social problems. From the example of my 
election campaign I can assert how difficult it is to oppose 
categorical, "splendid" promises. I was a candidate in a 
district where there is a concentration of "dormitory suburbs" 
[spalnyye kvartaly] which are unsound in every aspect, including 
ecologically. And one of my rivals promised that, if elected, 
he would close down the plant that is poisoning life in the 
entire region. Of course, he will not close the plant. But it 
sounded good! There is, of course, the normal mechanism -- but 
one which, admittedly, requires a longer time to take shape: 
The plant's profits should be taxed only after all expenses 
necessary for purification installations have been deducted from 
them. I am sure that I managed to win the election campaign not 
by handing out impossible promises but only because my program 
-- notice that it is a liberal program, and therefore does not 
enjoy absolute support today -- was absolutely specific. 
  The Liberal Democratic Party pf Russia has such a broad 
representation in parliament because it combined the votes of 
those who thereby expressed their dissatisfaction with the 
inconsistency of the reforms, and of those who truly share the 
ideas of the leader of that party. However, Zhirinovskiy's 
party today represents a big question mark, in my view. 
Everyone is talking about its leader, but what do his comrades 
in arms represent? Will it receive a political weight in 
parliament corresponding to its size? This will be shown by the 
proceedings in parliament. Even today, however, it is clear 
that, given such a parliament, it is impossible to expect the 
clear-cut advancement of reforms. There will also be 
difficulties over the formation of the government, the power 
ministries, and foreign policy. Much will now depend on the 
president, who, thank God, has been given significant powers 
under the new Constitution. A huge part will also be played by 
the extent to which both communists and democrats take 
responsible stances, to what extent they are professional and 
analytical in their choices. Let us have no more fighting to 
prove who is cleverer and stronger. Let us have as much 
negotiation and as much accord as possible. 
<H5>  Vladimir Lysenko: "Period of Grace" for Parliamentarians </H5>
  The "Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin" bloc is preparing quite 
seriously for parliamentary work: Yavlinskiy in the "EPItsentr" 
[Economic and Political Research Center] has drawn up many 
documents, and we have interesting social and economic programs; 
we will have plenty of things to propose to the State Duma. 
  Our faction is one of the few which proposes to create a 
parliament based not upon a rigid faction system but on a "soft" 
option. That is to say that, as a rule, deputies should work in 
the factions for whom they were elected; but it would be 
incorrect to bind deputies so rigidly that they could be 
expelled from parliament if they have some kind of difference 
with their faction or want to switch to another faction. This 
is incorrect because the rules of the game were initially 
different; neither the Statute on the Federal Assembly nor the 
Constitution provides for rigid discipline within factions. 
Second, it should be borne in mind that, in a transitional 
period, much changes, events move from one stage to another, and 
positions change too. For instance, I have many friends in 
"Russia's Choice" and in Shakhray's bloc with whom I would like 
to cooperate. But I do not rule out that the situation could 
reach a point -- as often has been the case with the democrats 
-- where we could end up virtually as each other's main enemy, 
if we pursue the previous policy. I am also thinking of the 
activity of certain bloc leaders. Hence, it seems to me, a 
deputy should have the right to change faction at least once. 
  I am for the democrats coordinating their actions in 
parliament. Everything should be discussed and agreed between 
ourselves beforehand; we should find common ground on which to 
stand in negotiations with the rest. Unfortunately, there are 
other approaches in our faction. Some deputies believe that we 
should reach agreement with the communists on one issue and with 
"Russia's Choice" on another. This position -- keeping 
equidistant from either side -- is quite frankly alarming. 
<H5>  Yekaterina Lakhova: Women Will Not Be "Tame" </H5>
  We realize that voters who supported the "Women of Russia" 
bloc in the elections will follow closely how we justify their 
trust. Either we will discredit the women's movement, or we will 
strengthen it. We intend to work seriously in parliament in 
order to overcome the traditional idea of women's low political 
activeness and to fight to increase women's social status -- 
right now it is intolerably low. We seriously intend to fight 
to see that a woman is elected one of the deputy chairmen of the 
State Duma. It is time to stop treating half the population of 
the country like second-class people; we should not be a 
laughing stock in the world community. 
  I think that parliament should actively influence the 
formation of state policy. Insofar as this policy is formed in 
laws, everything is in our hands. I object to the idea that, if 
the government does not change its course, we should not support 
it; we can influence this course by adopting new laws and making 
rational amendments to existing legislation, especially as 
regards property questions, privatization, and so forth. 
  Will our faction's voice be heeded in parliament? It is hard 
to predict at this stage. But we will not be "tame" -- that is 
unequivocal. People are constantly trying to pin "Women of 
Russia" to someone else's coattails -- now to one bloc, now to 
another. I think that every faction will try to preserve its 
autonomy. We will find common approaches in resolving some 
problems, but we will also seek allies in other factions to 
lobby for our issues. We will try to make ourselves heard. 
Especially since there is the experience acquired in the 
previous parliament. We will take account of this, just as we 
will take account of past mistakes.

  [Text] Tajik militants attacked Russian border guards three 
times over the weekend. As a Russian officer reported to 
Interfax, the rear of the 12th outpost of Moscow's Border Unit 
came under fire from mortars, recoilless guns, and rocket 
installations. 
  A Russian border outpost on Turg mountain and Parvar and 
Arvar villages were also attacked. The servicemen suffered no 
casualties. Counter strikes were delivered on the militants' 
positions. 
  The officer also reported an attempt by a gang of militants 
to break through a border section guarded by the 3rd outpost of 
the Pyanj Border Unit. After a clash with guards, the gang 
retreated back into Afghanistan. 
  Stepped-up militant activity is linked to better weather 
conditions on the Tajik-Afghan border.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vilor Niyazmatov] </F>
  [Text] Tashkent January 10 TASS -- Kazakhstan's President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev arrived in Tashkent on an official visit on 
Monday. His plane just landed in Tashkent airport. 
  This is his first trip to neighbouring Uzbekistan this year. 
In 1993 the leaders of the two republics held five such 
meetings in Tashkent, Almaty, Kokchetav, Kzyl Orda and Chimkent. 
  Those were not spontaneous or off-hand meetings. It is 
common knowledge that official contacts and the policy pursued 
by the two leaders who have already been recognised by the world 
will largely affect the situation in the entire Central Asian 
region. Each such meeting helps solve urgent economic and 
social problems and lay the foundation for building a common 
market in the region. 
  These issues will feature prominently during the talks 
between Nazarbayev and Uzbek leaders. The sides are expected to 
sign a package of documents which will bring the two countries 
even closer together and provide a basis for stronger 
cooperation. 
  It is symbolic that today's meeting between Nazarbayev and 
Uzbek President Islam Karimov has coincided with the first 
anniversary of the creation of the term "Central Asia" coined by 
the leaders of Kazakhstan and five Central Asian republics at 
their summit meeting in Tashkent last January. It was then that 
the Central-Asian-region notion was brought to life. Despite 
all economic hardships it has taken firm roots in the political 
lexicon. Although not all goals were fulfilled at that meeting, 
regional integration is beginning to take up real shape.

<F P=106> ["Own Information" report carried as part of "Military </F>
Review" feature under the general heading "Everything Changes in 
the Army. Except the Defense Minister's Birthday": "It Isn't 
Every Minister That the President Visits Bearing Flowers"] 
  [Text] According to information from confidential sources, 
Pavel Grachev received a visit 1 January from Boris Yeltsin, who 
congratulated him on his 46th birthday that day. The unofficial 
meeting between the president and the defense minister at the 
festive table lasted over two hours, after which, according to 
an eyewitness, both men went out into the street in noticeably 
good spirits. In the opinion of observers, the fact that the 
president visited the defense minister on his birthday 
demonstrates B. Yeltsin's sympathies for the military department 
and its leader. The visit was all the more important for Grachev 
since before this event, according to reports in some of the 
mass media, he had tried to obtain an audience with the 
president to discuss the results of the elections and the 
results of the year in the Russian Federation Armed Forces, but 
the president did not have the time for a meeting. 
  That there has been some change in the cool attitude of the 
president's structures and B. Yeltsin himself toward the Defense 
Ministry and toward P. Grachev since the 3-4 October events is 
also indicated by comments from Dmitriy Volkogonov, the Russian 
Federation president's adviser on military questions. On B. 
Yeltsin's behalf he characterized the Russian Federation Defense 
Ministry's activity as "normal." 
  The Russian president's adviser called the reorganization of 
the Defense Ministry and the General Staff at the present time 
dangerous because society and the Army are not ready for that 
just now, although he did not rule out such a possibility in the 
next few years.

<F P=106> [From 10 January RAHVA HAAL, POSTIMEES, HOMMUKULEHT, </F>
PAEVALEHT, p 1,3] 
  [Text] Monday, January 10 -- One of the authors of the 
constitution, MP [member of parliament] Juri Adams, described 
the situation as leading to a constitutional crisis, and hoped 
that the president will accept the candidates. He claimed that 
the president's actions convey a message of no confidence in the 
prime minister and the government coalition to the voters. "The 
president will have to provide a good explanation, why the 
candidates recommended by the prime minister are unacceptable," 
Adams said. 
  Prime ministerial legal advisor Aino Lepik von Wiren 
described the presidential decision as arbitrary and stressed 
that the constitution was not intended to delegate such powers 
to the president. 
  Riigikogu [parliament] foreign affairs commission Chairman 
Vello Saatpalu claimed that the president is seizing more power 
than the constitution allows and described his manners in 
signing agreements with other states as "incomprehensible." 
Saatpalu further claimed that foreign ambassadors had expressed 
their amazement at the vagueness of the president's powers. 
  Coalition Party member Academician Endel Lippmaa claimed 
that 
the economic development has been successful and there was no 
need to replace the ministers. He criticised the refusal of the 
appointed new ministers to start performing their duties as 
"excessive party loyalty" and described the situation as a 
crisis of interpreting the constitution rather than a 
constitutional crisis. 
  Leader of the Liberal Democrats Tiit Kbin was of the same 
opinion, stressing that the constitution should have been more 
accurate about the president's authority in the matter. 
  Former MP Jaan Kross invited the appointed ministers to 
start 
working and expressed his regret at the "politically 
uncomfortable" situation. 
  Environment Minister Andres Tarand described the situation 
as 
a threat of a crisis, rather than a crisis itself. But he 
claimed that the president is not to decide over the suitability 
of ministerial candidates. 
  MP Valve Kirsipuu expressed her confidence in Heiki 
Kranich's 
ability to handle the functions of the finance minister and 
described the president's actions as "petty".

  [Excerpt] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas speaking 
at a news conference this morning touched upon the NATO summit 
in Brussels, in addition to other issues. 
  Here is correspondent Audrius Baciulis with a report from 
the 
news conference and about other events which took place at the 
Lithuanian Seimas. 
  [Baciulis] Algirdas Brazauskas said that today a response is 
expected from Brussels concerning Lithuania's wish to join NATO. 
He also said that when NATO received the written membership 
application from Lithuania, it was immediately disseminated 
among all its sixteen members. According to the president, not 
all the states had submitted written applications asking to join 
NATO. 
  In the president's view, although there will be no specific 
date given from which Lithuania will become member of NATO, 
Lithuania nevertheless supports the Partnership for Peace 
initiative proposed by the USA which, according to Algirdas 
Brazauskas, is a starting point in the process of joining NATO.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 07, BNS -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher expects the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels 
to make decisions on the establishment of essentially new 
cooperation between the alliance and East European countries. 
  Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys received a letter 
from Christopher this week, saying the Brussels summit would be 
a favorable possibility to start closer security cooperation 
between the alliance and the newly emerging democracies in 
Eastern Europe, including Lithuania, the Lithuanian Foreign 
Ministry said. 
  Christopher said the summit is likely announce that NATO 
will 
welcome new members in the future. The alliance's evolutionary 
expansion would preserve its strength, harmony among its members 
and its ability to act. 
  The secretary of state said the Partnership for Peace 
program 
offers Lithuania close practical cooperation with both military 
and political structures of NATO. The initiative would require 
serious military and political steps -- to observe international 
obligations, to guarantee civil control of the armed forces and 
to properly arrange the military budget. 
  Christopher expressed hope that Lithuania will support the 
Partnership for Peace program and will take an active part in it.

  [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze dismissed the 
idea of using Russian troops to enforce law and order in 
Georgia. In a regular Monday radio interview he said that a 
country which cannot instill law and order on its own did not 
deserve independence. 
  This was his response to the statement made by parliament 
speaker Vakhtang Goguadze Sunday that law and order could not 
prevail in Georgia unless Russian troops were called in and 
Georgia entered the ruble zone. 
  Nevertheless, Shevardnadze admitted that there could be no 
law and order in Abkhazia and North Ossetia without Russian help. 
  Shevardnadze noted that entry into the ruble zone should be 
given serious thought. In his words, the introduction of a 
national currency in Georgia was an erroneous and premature 
action. "The state and every family had to pay dearly for 
this," he emphasized. 
  Shevardnadze said that during his visits to Turkey, France, 
and the U.S., and talks with the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund, he might seek advice of foreign 
statesmen on entry into the ruble zone.

<F P=106> [Opening address by President Boris Yeltsin at the first </F>
session of the Federation Council in Moscow -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed members of the Federation Council! Under 
the Constitution, 178 places are provided for in the Federation 
Council - 171 people have been elected, 140 people have 
registered. So the Federation Council is competent to begin its 
work. Allow me, in accordance with the Constitution, to declare 
open the first sitting of the Federation Council, of the Federal 
Assembly of the Russian Federation. [applause followed by 
Russian national anthem] 
  Esteemed members of the Russian Federation! As of today, 
Russian statehood is acquiring new qualities. The bicameral 
parliament of the Russian Federation is beginning its work. At 
the same time, the chronological link which was broken for 
decades is restored. The State Duma has begun work at the same 
time as the Federation Council. And it is not a matter of the 
formal restoration of the name of a state institute of Russia. 
The meaning of what has happened is much deeper. Russia is 
returning to its roots, is restoring lost traditions. It cannot 
acquire its true character without that. It's not possible to go 
forward without that. It's not possible to take a worthy place 
in the contemporary world without that. 
  The new Russian statehood is based upon a solid legal basis, 
the Constitution, which was adopted not by a group of people, 
not by a party but, for the first time in the history of Russia, 
by nationwide vote. We all still have a lot to do to ensure that 
the constitutional statutes become norms of our life, to learn 
to live in accordance with them. 
  I recognize fully the particular responsibility that lies 
upon the president in that common work. As president of the 
Russian Federation, in carrying out my duties, I will observe 
and defend strictly the Constitution of the Russian Federation 
adopted on 12 December 1993 by nationwide vote, respect and 
guard the rights and freedoms of the people of Russia and serve 
faithfully their interests, defend the sovereignty and 
independence, security and territorial integrity of the state, 
fulfill conscientiously the duties placed upon me by the 
Constitution. I am counting on the deputies of the Federal 
Assembly also to adhere strictly to the Constitution of Russia 
in their actions. 
  Those who are here in the Federation Council are those who 
won free and democratic elections in sharp and open competition. 
I congratulate you on this great political and personal 
success. You have been elected to the Federation Council, the 
upper chamber of the Federal Assembly. Russian citizens have 
put their trust in you, they have transferred on to you part of 
their power and at the same time placed on you great 
responsibility for our fatherland, for the people of Russia. I 
hope every one of you fully realizes this. 
  You will now participate immediately in running a great 
power, in determining its destiny. Each of you will now have a 
much greater opportunity to be of use to Russia. I believe that 
you you will use this opportunity to the maximum for the good of 
our people. 
  On this exciting day I should like to share with you what I 
believe to be especially important for present-day Russia. 
First of all, the parliament starts its proceedings in a 
country which is at peace. The electorate expects from deputies 
real efforts to consolidate civil peace. Last year a great 
effort was required to retain this peace. At the hardest moment 
most of those now in this hall backed the president and helped 
to avert chaos and civil confrontation in Russia. 
  There is a great need now for members of the Federation 
Council and deputies of the State Duma leading the Russian 
parliament to the the road of creation. Cooperation must be the 
main thing in relations between the legislative and executive 
authorities. The Federal Assembly is starting its work in a 
single Russian Federation state. No matter for whom our voters 
voted, no matter what party or bloc they gave their vote to, 
they were unanimous that the Russian Federation should continue 
to be an integral state, a firm federation. It is our duty to 
fulfill this will. The Constitution clearly demarcates what 
things come under the jurisdiction of the federation and of its 
components. We must strictly adhere to that, and at the same 
time remember that strong regions are the condition of Russia's 
prosperity. 
  Parliament is starting its working at a most crucial moment 
of the existence of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Each 
of the states is increasingly coming to understand that alone 
they cannot cope with most difficult problems, and that they 
cannot survive alone. Our countries are already being linked 
together, and in this process it is Russia's vocation to be the 
first among equals. 
  Our compatriots, those in the former Soviet republics, first 
and foremost, rely on the fact that voluntary, free, and 
peaceful integration will grow from strength to strength. They 
hope that their lawful interests will be protected. And our duty 
is to live up to these expectations. 
  The election of the Russian president to the post of CIS 
chairman provides an exclusively favorable opportunity to 
implement these aims. Our position remains unchanged. The 
richer, the more comprehensive, and the closer the relations 
between our states are, the better. You are starting work in an 
atmosphere of profound transformations in the country. We all 
know how difficult it was to move from endless and fruitless 
talk to practical deeds. It is imperative now not to stop 
half-way. 
  Over the two years of reforms in Russia, the basis for a 
market economy has been laid. But this is just the beginning. In 
the course of the parliamentary campaign, many fresh and 
original ideas were voiced which can give fresh impetus to 
reforms. 
  The parliamentarians have a realistic opportunity to 
implement these ideas, first and foremost in laws. It is laws 
which are the foundation of democratic power. 
  In many respects, the Russian Federation's legislation has 
still not become the legislation of the market. Almost 
insuperable obstacles still remain both for businessmen and 
bankers and private farmers. If during the time of your work in 
this sphere you can bring about a breakthrough, you will not 
only justify the aspirations of the electorate, but will assume 
a worthy place in the history of Russia. We have many 
resourceful and energetic people who want and can get down to 
work. Today they are in need of our support. We must finally 
give them the opportunity of working and earning. These people 
are the very basis of our country's prosperity. It is their 
hands that are creating a stable and prosperous society in which 
no one will feel himself humiliated and alienated. 
  At the same time, material prosperity alone will not make 
the 
country happy nor revive in citizens of Russia a sense of their 
own dignity. We must honestly admit that in the most difficult 
transformations in the Russian Federation, only a very little of 
the mighty potential of the multinational culture of the 
fatherland has so far been activated. This culture has been 
left on the sidelines of the reforms, and it is perhaps this 
that is the reason for many difficulties and failures. It is 
our common task to align the market and culture to the greatest 
possible degree. Unless we do so, the market will not become 
civilized; unless we do so, the market will not emerge from 
crisis, there will be no revival of spirituality, there will be 
no revival of Russia's greatness. 
  I call upon you to bear this constantly in mind in your 
work. 
The Federal Assembly is starting its work in a period when the 
Russian Federation's democratic statehood is being established. 
Everyone knows with what pain and difficulty this process has 
been proceeding. The adoption of the Constitution offers a 
realistic opportunity for making this more calm and effective. 
  It can be said that for the first time agreement has been 
reached in Russia on the rules and norms which are obligatory 
for all political forces. And we must at all costs preserve 
this accord, in order that there can be calm in the country, in 
order that dictatorship can never return to Russia. We can and 
must help public and political forces to find accord on the main 
issue, the categoric and total exclusion of force from the 
country's political life. 
  There shall be no justification for those who organize mass 
disorders. No one must evade responsibility for calls for 
violent actions, for inciting national, social or religious 
dissension amongst people. 
  There is one more issue I would particularly like to dwell 
on. Russia is a great power and it will never agree to be on 
the sidelines of world civilization. The time has ended when 
our country felt itself to be a besieged fortress and was in 
confrontation with the rest of the world. Our task today is to 
activate truly wide and equal cooperation with the world 
community. 
  It is not by military might alone that a worthy place in the 
world is defined. Our country and people have a great resource 
of vital energy, and it is up to us to help our fatherland to 
gather its forces, to revive those powerful stimuli which would 
resurrect its greatness. International law is our fundamental 
guideline in the world. Russia will strictly abide by its norms 
and principles, convinced that this is the most efficient way of 
protecting national interests. 
  However, one other aspect is of no lesser importance: all 
states must also strictly abide by norms of the international 
law in their relations with Russia. No double standards will be 
tolerated here. I hope that State Duma and Federation Council 
deputies will support both the president and the government in 
this respect. 
  Esteemed members of the Federation Council! The majority of 
you are experienced politicians who have learned the secrets of 
power and are capable of distinguishing great politics from 
petty intriguing. I see you as one of the main stabilizing 
forces of Russian statehood. And both the president and 
parliamentarians could voice disagreement with one or other 
decisions taken by the other, could be dissatisfied with each 
other, could argue and stand their ground. But any political 
problems can and should be resolved only by legal procedures. 
We must remember always that we represent a great country, a 
great people, multinational Russia, and that means that as long 
as our powers are in force we are not free from that demand, 
even in our private life, and even more so on the state tribune. 
  It is essentially, finally, to forget revolutionary 
vocabulary, to rid ourselves of the vestiges of unhealthy 
suspicion and political maximalism [maksimalizm]. 
  Given the diverse party nature of parliament, there is a 
fundamental basis for joint constructive action - that is 
concern for the citizens of Russia, that is sticking to the 
strategic course for economic reform. We should consider the 
constitutional and democratic procedures for forming power and 
defining the political and economic policy of the country to be 
unshakable and inviolable. At the same time, the state is 
obliged to defend democracy by all legal means. In Russia, in 
Russian statehood there are quite a few old and not so old 
traditions. They are to be enriched substantially and new 
elements are to be introduced into them. 
  This directly concerns the Federation Council. 
Constitutional norms define the overall structure of work of the 
upper chamber of the Russian parliament. A lot of work lies 
ahead to specify these norms. I hope you will approach it 
looking not just one or two years ahead, but far into the 
future, into the 21st Century. I intend to be in constant 
contact with legislators, to hold consultations with the leaders 
of parliamentary factions on all the most important issues. 
  The Constitution envisages an annual presidential address to 
the Federal Assembly. I will make one shortly, after procedural 
matters are solved in either chamber. In this address I will 
submit to you a program for political and economic changes in 
1994, the main directions of domestic and foreign policy, and I 
will also outline plans for the next two years. The address will 
take stock, as carefully as possible, of all the constructive 
ideas contained in election manifestoes and programs, as well as 
of deputies' proposals on ways to organize our cooperation. 
  Esteemed Russian members of parliament: you have been asked 
by the citizens of this country to lay the foundation for the 
building of Russian parliamentary culture. This is peaceful, 
creative, and also very difficult work. Special responsibility 
has been placed upon you: you are the start, and the future of 
Russia depends to a large extent on how successful this start 
is. 
  Let me wish you success in our common cause of shaping our 
fatherland. Thank you.

and recognition of the authority of the deputies. The main 
question on the agenda is the election of working bodies and of 
the chairman of the Federation Council and his deputies, as well 
as the formation of committees. 
  The house will elect yet another commission today from among 
the deputies to conduct the secret nomination of candidates for

  [Text] Sevastopol -- On 11 January, the press center of the 
Black Sea Fleet made public a statement which says in 
particular: "For the past two months, the Ukrainian Navy Command 
has been making unilateral attempts to resubordinate all Black 
Sea Fleet naval engineering service units deployed in the 
fleet's distant garrisons. Following recent unlawful actions in 
respect of the Black Sea Fleet naval engineering service 
departments in Odessa and Nikolayev, another action has been 
staged, aimed at having the Izmail region's personnel swear 
allegiance to Ukraine." 
  The press center of the Black Sea Fleet affirms that the 
fleet's group of units deployed in Izmail has virtually found 
itself under economic blockade. To normalize the situation and 
prevent further negative developments, the Black Sea Fleet 
Command has called for wisdom on the part of the Ukrainian Navy 
Command and voiced the opinion that it is necessary to wait 
until the Black Sea Fleet issues are settled by the Russian and 
Ukrainian presidents in a civilized manner. The Black Sea Fleet 
leadership has sent relevant documents on the situation in 
Izmail to the Ukrainian and Russian defense ministries.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Antoshkin report: "Commonwealth `Blue Helmets.' </F>
Getting First Collective Experience of Localizing Civil War in 
Tajikistan"] 
  [Text] The border forces which Russia has kept on the 
Tajik-Afghan border (the Moscow, Pyandzh, Khorog, and Ishkashim 
border detachments) have been clearly unable to cope with the 
"caravans of death" flooding across the Pyandzh River on the 
border. Gunmen have been bringing in from neighboring 
Afghanistan not only assault rifles and ammunition. Mines have 
been brought over by the hundreds, as have mortars, recoilless 
guns, and even probable "Stinger" surface-to-air systems. The 
Islamic gunmen soon moved from the tactics of "quiet 
infiltration" to blatant armed breaches of the border. 
  This situation could not be tolerated any longer. Russia's 
repeated proposals to strengthen the border details with 
military subunits from neighboring countries in the region have 
finally met with a response. Initially 500 men were allocated 
per country. Then, on 24 September 1993, the heads of the 
parties to the Collective Security Treaty signed an agreement on 
the creation of Collective Peacekeeping Forces [CPF] in 
Tajikistan. Colonel General Boris Pyankov was appointed 
commander of the CPF. 
  The agreement signed 24 September envisaged that the 
necessary military contingent would be set up by 15 October last 
year. This task was carried out. Subunits arrived in good time 
from Russia and the Republic of Uzbekistan, as did subunits 
allocated by the Republic of Tajikistan. Certain subunits from 
the Tajik Defense Ministry were made operationally subordinate 
to the CPF command. The question of the Kazakhstani battalion 
has been virtually resolved, although, because of certain 
differences of opinion in that country's parliament, 
participation by Kazakhstani servicemen in the CPF system has 
been somewhat delayed. 
  The CPF are quite an impressive military force. They 
comprise ground force units and various kinds of aircraft. They 
also have tanks and artillery, air defense, engineering, and 
communications systems. Their main task is, together with the 
Russian border guards and the subunits supporting them from 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and the Tajik Government 
troops, to close off the border as tightly as possible and to 
ensure reliable protection and defense of it. 
  Everything necessary has been provided to this end. The CPF 
Headquarters is staffed with generals and officers from all the 
member states, many of whom have combat experience. Moreover, 
there are representatives in Tajikistan from each defense 
ministry. This makes it possible to rapidly solve all the 
problems that arise. 
  Unfortunately there are plenty of those problems. This was 
confirmed yet again by the joint session of the Commonwealth 
foreign and defense ministers during the recent Ashgabat summit. 
The session heard a report from Colonel General Boris Pyankov, 
commander of the CPF. He stressed yet again that the main 
problems continue to be inadequate force staffing and funding. 
Moreover, there is a need to redeploy certain CPF subunits to 
allow them to carry out their missions more effectively. 
  As of today a reinforced Uzbek battalion is located near the 
population center of Shaartuz, in direct proximity to the 
Tajik-Afghan border. It covers the most likely avenues for 
armed incursions by gunmen into the Russian Pyandzh Border 
Detachment's sphere of responsibility. 
  The Kazakhstani military contingent, originally sent to 
reinforce the Khorog Border Detachment (Gorno-Badakhshan), is 
protecting Khorog Airport, accompanying convoys, and taking part 
in patrols. 
  Some forces from Kyrgyzstan are being deployed in the town 
of 
Murgab (Gorno-Badakhshan), and others in the population center 
of Sary-Tash. A battalion is protecting the East Pamir Highway. 
One other battalion from Kyrgyzstan is operationally 
subordinate to the chief of the Ishkashim Border Detachment. 
  During the discussion of Boris Pyankov's report the 
Kazakhstani side expressed doubt about the expediency of 
transferring its forces to the Komsomolbad region deep within 
Tajikistan. The reasoning is simple -- the peacekeeping forces 
are supposed to be used to protect the border. But the 
Komsomolbad region can hardly be considered quiet. As is clear 
from the map, it is from here that the hardline opposition plans 
to launch one of its strikes against Dushanbe. Moreover, 
Kazakhstan believes that the 500 men previously sent to 
reinforce the border detail do indeed represent national 
peacekeeping forces. That is why it would not be expedient to 
send yet another battalion to Tajikistan. 
  After a brief discussion of these and other problems the 
decision was made to take additional measures to stabilize the 
situation on the state border. I think that this will solve 
many of the problems mentioned in Boris Pyankov's report. After 
all, with the coming of spring -- which is not far off in 
Tajikistan -- the situation on the border could deteriorate 
sharply. 
  The situation in the republic remains complex. That is 
recognized by everyone. But the main thing -- stopping a civil 
war -- has been achieved. There is a chance for political and 
military reconciliation. The Commonwealth "Blue Helmets" are 
extending that chance and giving the Tajik people an opportunity 
to forget about the horrors of civil war and start organizing a 
peaceful life.

  [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS--Russian newspapers highlight 
President Boris Yeltsin's remarks at the opening of the first 
session of the Federation Council -- the upper house of the 
newly elected Russian parliament, greetings from Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin to the deputies of the State Duma -- the 
lower house of parliament, as well as U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's upcoming visit (beginning on Wednesday night) to 
Moscow. 
  TRUD on the Federation Council's first meeting: "The first 
meeting of the Federation Council did not at all resemble the 
vociferous and ungovernable gatherings of the Congress of 
People's deputies, or vice versa, the too 'manageable' meetings 
of the dissolved Supreme Soviet." 
  The newspaper describes the social status of the deputies to 
the Federation Council: 152 out of 171 deputies are white-collar 
workers. Among them, representatives from regional legislative 
and executive power bodies constitute a considerable proportion. 
Eight deputies are entrepreneurs, three are farmers. There is 
one military officer. Seven are jobless. There are no 
industrial workers among the deputies. 
  TRUD also points to high educational qualifications of the 
parliamentarians: there are ten professors, and 19 candidates of 
science (12--in the field of economics, 5--technology, and 2-- 
philosophy) 
  In ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, Ivan Kivelidi, chairman of the 
Entrepreneurship Council to the Russian Government and general 
director of the Interagro Foreign Economic Association, reflects 
on whether the parliament will manage to undo the `Gordian knot' 
of economic problems. 
  Emphasising the need to draw up a market-oriented liberal 
legislation, Kivelidi points out as follows: "There are plenty 
of entrepreneurs in the new parliament. In my view, people, who 
can find unconventional solutions inn an extreme situation 
marking the establishment of market relations, may well 
constitute a creative backbone in parliament". 
  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA runs an account of the meetings of the 
Federal Assembly houses under the headline "Good Luck to You, 
the Parliament of Russia". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the U.S. President's upcoming visit 
to 
Moscow. The newspaper writes that the distinguishing feature of 
the forthcoming Moscow summit will be the participation of yet 
another leader in it, namely, Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk. 
  A tri-partite agreement will be a "giant step for global 
security", the newspaper quotes Clinton as saying. "Accords 
that are expected to be reached during the two leaders' talks 
are certain to be of benefit to Russia, particularly considering 
the latest actions of the West which conceded to Moscow over the 
NATO enlargement issue, which has shown once again which aspect 
of U.S. foreign policy is a priority". 
  PRAVDA views the forthcoming summit in Moscow in a somewhat 
different way. "It is the first time that the leader of the only 
remaining superpower after the break-up of the Soviet Union 
calls on the president of Russia. In this respect, the 
forthcoming summit is a historic one. 
  "The lack of parity in relations with Washington is the main 
flaw of the Moscow summit. Without equality, one can hardly 
count on stable and long-term results". 
  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA on the same subject: "The first meeting 
between the Russian and American presidents in Moscow promises 
to be rather productive. The American President arrives in 
Moscow on Wednesday night with considerable achievements in his 
foreign policy activities which will, doubtless, be rather 
highly evaluated in Moscow". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the arrest and release of two 
Russian 
generals in Latvia. The newspaper carries an item headlined 
"Russian Generals in Latvian Handcuffs", about the unlawful 
actions of Latvian authorities against the two Russian military 
officers. "Latvia and Russia found themselves on the verge of an 
armed conflict after two Russian generals were forcibly driven 
into the forest. 
  "The incident, it seems, has been settled. However, would 
the issue end at that? A local newspaper still continues to 
publish lists of officers and members of the families of Russian 
servicemen, with their residential addresses and places of work 
indicated..."

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kiev </F>
on 11 January] 
  [Text] The highest level meeting of NATO member states in 
Brussels has adopted the Partnership for Peace program. This 
document includes an appeal to former members of the Warsaw Pact 
and other European countries to participate in the program. The 
appeal of NATO member countries has been adopted at a difficult 
time, when some parts of the continent are sowing the seeds of 
conflict, and the majority of Central and East European 
countries are alarmed by the lack of structural mechanisms for 
security in this region. 
  Ukraine believes that the proposal of NATO countries to 
implement the Partnership for Peace program is a timely and 
broad-minded step in the right direction which will enable all 
interested countries to begin practical work on concrete 
political and military cooperation with NATO. Ukraine sees 
great interest in the development of such cooperation, and will 
cooperate with NATO and its member countries to the full extent 
within the framework of the Partnership for Peace program. 
Ukraine embraces with understanding the NATO initiative, which 
does not draw new lines of partition in Europe, while leaving 
the door to NATO open and serving as an instrument to gradually 
expand the organization eastward. Ukraine thinks that NATO is 
able to play a serious role in developing a reliable and 
all-embracing system of European security; Ukraine is ready to 
make a considerable contribution to the development of new 
architecture of security. The active participation of Ukraine 
in the "Partnership for Peace" program will assist in this 
process.

  [Text] Kiev January 12 TASS -- President Bill Clinton is 
due to arrive in Kiev, capital of Ukraine at 19.00 p.m. on 
Wednesday, despite fears that his "hastily-arranged stopover in 
Kiev could prove tougher than he thought" by thick fog which 
could make his landing difficult in the Ukrainian capital. 
  Sources from among the Ukrainian presidential staff told 
ITAR- TASS Clinton's stop-over will last for about two 
and-a-half hours. 
  The American and Ukrainian presidents are expected to 
discuss 
bilateral relations, military political problems and 
international security. 
  After the talks, President Clinton will board Air Force One 
en route to Moscow. President Leonid Kravchuk will join his and 
President Yeltsin in the Kremlin on January 14 for a trilateral 
summit which is expected to culminate in the signing of 
documents, which will ease tension in relations of the three 
countries.

  [Text] Kiev -- As Yuriy Serheyev, head of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs' Information Directorate said at a news 
conference on 11 January citing U.S. Senator Albert Gore [name 
and title as received], a definitive text of the trilateral 
negotiations document has not been drawn up in Washington. 
During Bill Clinton's meeting in Kiev, the main subject of the 
consultations will be a discussion on a wide range of issues 
concerning bilateral relations. "Taking into account that Bill 
Clinton's visit to Kiev will be short, the signing of a document 
is not envisaged either," said Serheyev. 
  During their stay in Washington, members of the Ukrainian 
delegation headed by Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov met, 
in the White House, U.S. President Bill Clinton; Anthony Lake, 
adviser to the president on issues of national security; and R. 
Nicholas Burn, special assistant to the president and senior 
director, Russian, Ukrainian and Eurasian affairs. The issue of 
expanding both countries' economic relations, problems of a 
military and political nature, and the issue of international 
security were discussed during the meeting. 
  At the U.S. State Department, the Ukrainian delegation held 
negotiations with State Secretary Warren Christopher, First 
Under Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, and Under Secretary of 
State Lynn Davis concerning issues of developing economic 
cooperation between both countries. The U.S. side expressed 
readiness to help economic reforms in Ukraine, in particular to 
grant aid for the implementation of the government's market 
reform program. 
  Considerable attention was devoted to discussing the program 
of negotiations by a Ukrainian Government economic delegation 
that will visit Washington at the end of January. The Ukrainian 
delegation also held consultations at the U.S. Department of 
Defense where its members met William J. Perry, first deputy 
defense secretary and John Shalikashvili, chairman Joint Chiefs 
of Staff. During the meeting the sides discussed cooperation 
between both countries in the military sphere, in particular in 
the sphere of disarmament and conversion of Ukraine's defense 
complex. The signing of a bilateral statement on the principles 
relating to the creation of a U.S.- Ukrainian committee on 
conversion of the defense industry took place in the Pentagon.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kuznechevskiy: "Will Clinton Be </F>
Persuaded To Visit Kiev?"] 
  [Excerpts] On 12-15 January, after the NATO summit 
conference in Brussels, U.S. President William Clinton will 
visit Russia for the first time since his election. The agenda 
for his talks with Boris Yeltsin is known: questions of 
security in Europe and the world, nonproliferation of nuclear 
weapons, and settlement of regional conflicts, questions of 
bilateral relations, mutual exchange of information on the 
development of the countries they represent. 
  On learning of the visit in advance, the Ukrainian 
leadership 
tried to amend it, proposing that Clinton visit Ukraine. The 
Washington Administration explained to the Ukrainians that 
President Clinton considers it more expedient to visit the 
capital of Belarus, which is unconditionally fulfilling the 
international pledges it has made on the nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons. And Washington sees this as a most important 
principle in the creation of a system of collective security in 
Europe ad in the world as a whole. 
  The content of what were unsuccessful talks for the 
Ukrainian 
leadership was made public. This resounding diplomatic slap in 
the face showed who is master of the present situation. It was 
made clear to Kiev officials that Washington is not merely 
unhappy with Kiev's behavior, but is annoyed and does not 
consider it necessary to conceal its annoyance. What is this 
unusual situation all about? [passage omitted] 
  The world community's concern is understandable. Following 
the breakup of the USSR, 130 SS-19 ICBM's, each with six 
warheads, 46 modern missiles, each with 10 warheads, 564 cruise 
missiles, and 30 strategic bombers with 416 warheads on board 
were left on the territory of the Ukraine. That makes 1,656 
warheads in all. That is greater than the French, British, and 
Chinese nuclear arsenals put together. So Ukraine is the 
world's third biggest nuclear power (after the United States and 
Russia). 
  In Ukraine's current conditions of political instability 
this 
nuclear potential could be a threat to European security. The 
public in neighboring countries knows, for example, that the 
founding session of the Ukrainian National Fascist Party took 
place in December in the Officers' Club in Lvov. It said that 
its aim is the forcible expansion of Ukrainian borders by 
conquering part of the territory of Russia, Belarus, Poland, and 
the Baltic states. We know how nervous the West was when it 
heard the results of the elections in Russia and of 
Zhirinovskiy's party's success in them. What if the elections in 
Ukraine in March follow the Russian model?... 
  Of course, the situation does not appear dangerous at the 
moment. As is known, not a single missile in Ukraine can be 
launched without Russia's consent, since the keys to the launch 
codes are in Moscow. But it is also known that Ukrainian 
specialists have been trying secretly for a year to decipher the 
codes. What if they decipher them and start blackmaining the 
West in an attempt to extort financial compensation? 
  The United States is obviously seriously concerned about 
this 
prospect, aware of the true reasons why Kiev is clinging to the 
nuclear weapons. It was obviously no accident when John 
Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff, 
recently let drop that defense against Russia is certainly not 
the reason why Kiev wants to keep the nuclear weapons on its 
territory. 
  Is that not why Bill Clinton himself telephoned Leonid 
Kravchuk on 30 November to complain about Ukrainian policy in 
the sphere of its position on nuclear weapons? 
  Russia's position on this question is clear and it has been 
repeatedly expressed by President Yeltsin and Andrey Kozyrev: 
Ukraine must not join the club of nuclear powers. To all 
appearances, we are at one with the leading powers of the West, 
in particular the United States, on this question. 
  The United States and Russia are not shutting Kiev out of a 
dialogue on this question. According to the information that is 
available, although Clinton has refused to go to Kiev during his 
Jaunuary trip, he will allow the organization of a tripartite 
meeting involving the three presidents on the question of 
dismantling Ukraine's nuclear missiles. So it is very possible 
that Leonid Kravchuk will be invited to Moscow during the 12-15 
January period.

  [Text] Kiev, 11 Jan -- Serhiy Plachynda, the chairman of 
the Peasant Democratic Party of Ukraine [SelDPU] has stated that 
U.S. President Bill Clinton's declaration that a trilateral 
agreement on nuclear weapons is to be signed in Moscow, is none 
other than a diktat and that it grossly interferes in Ukraine's 
internal affairs. 
  "Clinton ought to think about the fact that Ukrainian 
nuclear 
missiles are a guarantor of peace worldwide, rather than just 
for Ukraine, as well as for Europe and America itself," said the 
SelDPU chairman. 
  "If Zhirinovskiy does come to power, he will not be 
fastidious in either utterances or actions, which is why there 
must be a deterrent, which is what Ukraine's nuclear weapons 
are. After a considerable section of Russians have followed 
Zhirinovskiy, having opted for fascism, to make such statements 
as that by Clinton is quite outrageous," SelDPU Chairman 
Plachynda pointed out.

  [Text] "President Leonid Kravchuk has no authority to sign 
any interstate documents regarding nuclear disarmament," 
chairman of Ukraine's Popular Rukh, Vyacheslav Chernovil, 
declared in his interview with Interfax-Ukraine. 
  Chernovil also emphasized that "principles of Ukraine's 
nuclear policy were determined by parliament during the 
ratification of the START-I treaty with certain reservations." 
In Chernovil's words, "all leaders of the country, including the 
president, must adhere to this course." 
  "If Kravchuk signs an agreement on nuclear weapons during 
his meeting with Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin on January 14 in 
Moscow, it will have no juridical force," believes Chernovil. 
  Valentin Lemish, chairman of the parliamentary commission on 
defense and security, told journalists on Monday that the 
agreement to be signed by the three presidents in Moscow is 
subject for ratification by the Ukrainian parliament. According 
to Lemish, "if the agreement is in line with the parliament 
resolution on ratification of the START-I treaty, we shall have 
no questions."

  [Text] A briefing was held today at the Ukrainian Foreign 
Ministry in Kiev. Commenting on the possibility of signing any 
final document on eliminating nuclear arms on Ukrainian 
territory during the talks in Moscow between the U.S., Russian, 
and Ukrainian presidents -- as hastily reported by Ostankino 
Television -- and on a bilateral meeting between the Ukrainian 
and U.S. presidents, Yuriy Serheyev, chief of Foreign Ministry 
Information Department, in particular said: 
  [Begin Serheyev recording] As of today, I cannot say that a 
final document has already been drafted; I cannot say what form 
this document will take. That is why the scheduled tripartite 
conference in Moscow may have any form. If the final draft of 
the document is not completed, the Moscow conference is likely 
to be of consultative nature and aimed at coordinating aspects 
which still need to be coordinated. If the Moscow meeting 
manages to resolve uncoordinated issues, the document should 
take some form. I want to draw your attention to [word 
indistinct] commentaries, or I would rather say biased 
commentaries regarding the translation of Mr. Gore's statement 
which can be interpreted as an agreement or a treaty. As you 
see, at this stage, it is better to speak about a document 
rather than agreement or treaty. 
  Discussions over the form and essence of this document are 
still continuing, in Ukraine's governing circles as well. I 
want to stress that the Moscow summit will be preceded by a 
short meeting in Kiev. The possibility and likeliness of such a 
meeting were discussed very thoroughly through diplomatic 
channels. I also want to point out that as stated in 
yesterday's declaration by the Council of Ministers' and 
presidential press service, the main theme of the meeting will 
be the discussion of a wide range of issues concerning bilateral 
relations. This is very essential. Moreover, this statement is 
not unilateral; it was coordinated. There is a mutual desire on 
both sides to discuss bilateral relations at this meeting. This 
is not a bad example and not a bad result demonstrating that 
prospects are opening for a more constructive dialogue and more 
constructive relations with the United States in the spheres 
discussed in the course of Mr. Christopher's visit to Kiev. In 
particular [we should] balance our relations, direct them into 
the stream of military-political cooperation, and in the first 
place, economic cooperation. This visit once again emphasizes 
the attention paid Ukraine and importance of developing 
bilateral relations with her. Naturally, in the course of the 
Kiev meeting, issues tackled in Brussels and those to be tackled 
in Moscow will be discussed. [end recording]

  [Text] "I cannot say that a document for the U.S., 
Ukrainian and Russian presidents to sign in Moscow on January 14 
exists," Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's spokesman Yuriy Sergeyev 
told journalists in Kiev. 
  In his words, "the document, in particular guarantees of 
Ukraine's security, is being drafted." He added that if the 
document is not drafted before Friday, the Moscow meeting will 
be consultative." 
  According to Sergeyev, the brief meeting of the U.S. and 
Ukrainian presidents in Kiev on January 12 will concentrate on 
the bilateral relations. "Ukraine and the United States want to 
have balanced relations which should emphasize the economic 
rather than the military and political sphere," he explained. 
  Sergeyev also explained that all treaties and accords that 
the Ukrainian president would sign must be ratified by the 
country's parliament. 
  The Ukrainian Supreme Soviet ratified START I with numerous 
reservations. The treaty provides for withdrawal of nearly 
1500, or 16 percent, warheads and 176, or 42 percent, strategiic 
missiles from Ukraine. 
  Numerous national democratic deputies of the Ukrainian 
Supreme Soviet have criticized the president's intention to sign 
a nuclear disarmament treaty in Moscow.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast; video report by Vladimir </F>
Grigoryev] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Russia, Ukraine, and the United States 
are expected to sign a treaty in Moscow next Friday [14 January] 
on the complete elimination of the strategic nuclear weapons 
deployed on Ukrainian territory, U.S. President Bill Clinton 
said during a press conference in Brussels. 
  [Grigoryev] This statement really caused a sensation and has 
already elicited a positive response worldwide. The upcoming 
signing of the agreement follows intensive tripartite talks in 
Washington, which resulted in Ukraine's renouncing its nuclear 
potential. 
  As you know, following the breakup of the Soviet Union, 
Ukraine inherited 176 strategic missiles and 1,800 nuclear 
warheads. That constitutes a more powerful arsenal than those 
of France, China, and Britain together. 
  In return for dismantling their weapons, Ukraine's 
parliamentarians demanded that the West provide considerable 
financial aid for economic reforms and security guarantees, as 
well as compensation for the short-range tactical missiles that 
have been handed over to Russia. The talks in Washington showed 
that this was no time for bartering and that the whole world can 
benefit from the agreement. Nor will Ukraine lose out. It is 
to receive nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes. And Russia is to 
cancel Ukraine's enormous debt for energy sources. Finally, the 
United States will provide the republic with economic and 
technical aid, as well as guaranteeing its security. 
  The importance of the upcoming treaty signing is indicated 
by 
the fact that tomorrow, following a change in the initial 
program for his visit, Bill Clinton will meet President Leonid 
Kravchuk in Kiev in order to express his support. [video shows

  [Text] Kiev, 12 Jan -- President Leonid Kravchuk's firm 
intention that the sovereign Ukraine should become a 
nuclear-free state has been confirmed once more today by Viktor 
Stelmakh, head of the press service of the Ukrainian president 
and Cabinet of Ministers, in a telephone conversation with the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent. The president acts consistently in the 
spirit of the resolution, passed by the country's Supreme 
Council, on Ukrainian ratification of the well-known treaty on 
the destiny of the nuclear weapons on its territory, the head of 
Kravchuk's press service pointed out. 
  The occasion for the conversation at 0930, during which a 
real official statement was made, was the coming visit to 
Ukraine today of U.S. President Bill Clinton for a meeting with 
Kravchuk. The head of Kravchuk's press service said Clinton's 
arrival from Prague was expected here this evening at 1900 and 
his stay would last about two and a half hours. The Kiev 
dialogue would center on fundamental questions for the signing 
in Moscow, currently in preparation, of the trilateral treaty on 
nuclear weapons.

Lavrynovych, the deputy chairman of the People's Movement of 
Ukraine [Rukh], interviewed by a UNIAN correspondent on 11 
January. "All this, however, is reminiscent of the corresponding 
period in the history of the Ukrainian People's Republic. If 
Ukraine really gives up its nuclear weapons by being promised 
some mythical compensation, and not just gives them up, but 
removes its weapons to Russian territory, it will be a step that 
will be conducive to the liquidation of Ukraine's statehood."

  [Text] Kiev, 11 Jan -- Anatoliy Shybiko, deputy chairman of 
the Ukrainian Republican Party, noted in an interview with a 
UNIAR correspondent that without having in front of him the 
agreement on liquidating Ukraine's nuclear arsenal and without 
understanding its point, it would be premature to give a 
preliminary assessment of this agreement. In his opinion, a 
final assessment of the agreement should be given only after a 
text of the agreement between Ukraine, Russia, and the United 
States becomes available. Mr. Shybiko is deeply convinced that 
Ukraine should remain a nuclear state for the near future and 
should accede to the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear 
weapons as a nuclear state.

remains unchanged: for a nonnuclear Ukraine but in a nonnuclear 
world," stressed Mykhaylo Ratushnyy, member of the Congress of 
Ukrainian Nationalists leadership in an interview with a UNIAR

around us is not nonnuclear, we are against signing an agreement 
between Clinton, Kravchuk, and Yeltsin." Mr. Ratushnyy noted 
that the Ukraine Republican Party considers the signing of an 
agreement on depriving Ukraine of its nuclear arsenal to be a 
betrayal of Ukrainian interests. "We do not believe American 
promises. America looks after its own interests first and 
foremost, and the Ukrainian Government should look after its 
Ukrainian interests, which it does not do."

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk has said that Ukraine 
wants close economic and political contacts with Lithuania and 
other Baltic states. The Ukrainian leader believes, though, 
that the development of all-round relations with the Baltics 
aggravates both objective and subjective factors. 
  In an interview with the popular Lithuanian newspaper 
LIETUVOS RYTAS Kravchuk described as an objective problem the 
painful transformations in the economy in the republic. As a 
result of such transformations, believes the president, it is 
difficult to maintain long-standing contacts among the 
republics. Kravchuk believes as subjective factors the passive 
attitude of the regions, enterprises and the governments. 
  Kravchuk believes that the situation may start improving 
following the meeting between the presidents and he invited the 
head of the Lithuanian state Algirdas Brazauskas to visit 
Ukraine at any time suitable for him. He is also prepared to 
visit Lithuania. 
  Asked by the newspaper to comment on the Lithuanian official 
statement to enter NATO, the Ukrainian president has favoured 
the initiatives "Partnership for Peace" and added that Ukraine 
would not object against Lithuania's entry to NATO, since we do 
not see in it any discomfort or strategic threat. 
  Kravchuk said that neither the United States nor Russia are 
interested to expand NATO. He explained his view by the fact 
that today large states, like the United States and Russia want 
to have zones of influence. Russia, believes the Ukrainian 
leader, attempts to retain in its sphere of influence former 
Soviet republics and the countries of the central and eastern 
Europe. He said that the methods to ensure the influence 
contradict those universally acknowledged. 
  The Ukrainian president has said that in principle he does 
not approve the division along these lines and added that large 
and small states should be equal partners. If so, we can rely 
on stability and lasting peace, and neighbourly relations, said 
Kravchuk.

  [Text] The Crimea should not be allowed to turn into the 
hunting ground of political terror or another war zone in the 
former USSR, Nikolay Bagrov, chairman of the Crimean parliament, 
told INTERFAX-Ukraine. In his view, Russia alone can guarantee 
stability in the region. "The Crimea cannot be rescued outside 
an alliance with Russia or peaceful reintegration into our 
historic Motherland," he said. 
  Bagrov also said that a campaign designed to discredit the 
Russian Party of the Crimea and himself as a candidate had been 
launched in the runup to the presidential elections that are 
scheduled to be held in the Crimea on January 16. 
  He complained that once he refused to drop out of the 
presidential race or call on his supporters to vote for another 
candidate, "certain political forces resorted to psychological 
terror" against him threatening to kill him, his family and 
friends. 
  The Russian Party leader thinks that the opponents of a 
Russian Crimea will not stop at criminal methods. He said: "I 
had to call officially on the state authorities of the Crimean 
Republic, Ukraine and the Russian Federation to prevent turning 
the Crimean general elections into a pretext for political 
terror or violence which could provoke an explosion or armed 
conflict."

  [Text] Our sources in Simferopol reported the Crimean 
presidential election campaign is increasingly assuming a 
scandalous and very physically violent nature with the 
contestants growingly relying on fist arguments. Thus last 
weekend witnessed a meeting of the Russian Party's activists, 
who demanded to recall their party leader, Sergey Shuvaynikov's 
candidature, accusing him of attempting to conceal the sources 
of his campaign financing and embezzlement. A few hours later 
three unidentified persons broke into the apartment of Russian 
Society chairman (Anatoliy Los), whose voice was among the 
loudest to accuse Shuvaynikov, took him to the street and beat 
him up. According to some other members of the Russian Party 
Political Council, they were threatened with physical violence, 
too.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Pilat report under the "Crimea" rubric: "Crimean </F>
Tatars Will Vote for President After All. A Candidate To Be 
Expelled From His Own Party "] 
  [Text] Returning to a discussion of whether its countrymen 
should participate in the elections for the Republic of Crimea's 
presidency or not for the fourth time in the past two weeks, the 
Crimean Tatar People's Assembly rescinded its own 2 January 
decision on boycotting the elections. Now the Assembly believes 
that the pre-election situation has changed drastically and 
there are fears that a person who insists on redrawing the 
current borders may come to power. (As a matter of fact, five 
out of six candidates, except for Crimean Supreme Soviet 
chairman Nikolay Bagrov, call for this to be done.) This is why 
the Assembly called on the Crimean Tatars to vote against the 
five and thus give their backing to Bagrov. "Our decision," 
Assembly chairman Mustafa Dzhemilev told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 
"was prompted exclusively by the desire to preserve peace on the 
peninsula." The Assembly thinks that the decision it made does 
not amount to the recognition of the institution of the 
presidency as set forth in the Law on the President, approved by 
the Crimean Supreme Soviet. The Assembly will not recognize the 
powers of the future president if he takes steps to redraw 
borders or make decisions on Crimea's status without taking into 
account the Crimean Tatar people's opinions. In all, 17 
Assembly members voted for taking part in the presidential 
elections, with 10 "No" votes and 2 abstentions. 
  The Russian Party of Crimea's emergency congress, attended 
by 
members of Crimea's Russian Society, expelled Sergey 
Shuvaynikov, who is running for the Crimean presidency, from the 
party he headed. Shuvaynikov was accused of having concealed 
from the party the fact that he had been expelled from a 
military political school in 1972 and refused to reveal the 
sources of financing his electoral campaign. According to 
observers, however, the main reason for what occurred was 
Shuvaynikov's refusal to withdraw his candidacy and to join the 
"Russia" bloc, which fielded Yuriy Meshkov, chairman of the 
Republican Party of Crimea, as its only candidate. According to 
some members of the Russian Party of Crimea's political council, 
however, the congress was not legitimate and Shuvaynikov's 
expulsion from the party was illegal. This is what your 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent was told by Andrey Mazyuk, 
member of the Russian Party of Crimea's political council.

<F P=106> [Interview with Security Service Chief Yevhen Marchuk and </F>
State Protection Service Chief Mykhaylo Hayduk by unidentified 
reporter; place and date not given; from "Without a Protocol" 
program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Marchuk] The Ukrainian 
Security Service has been actively cooperating with the State 
Protection Service. One of the primary goals of the Security 
Service is fighting terrorism. To fight terrorism we must 
interact with the State Protection Service. I want to point out 
that the Security Service performs a wide range of tasks that 
exceed the framework of functions of the State Protection 
Department. Speaking of the problem of fighting terrorism as a 
pyramid, the State Protection Service is at the very top, while 
the Ukrainian Security Service deals with more fundamental, 
concealed aspects of the same problems. Thus, we disclose 
persons threatening terrorist acts against political leaders, 
the state leadership, or people's deputies at all levels from 
the village to the Supreme Council. When this work enters its 
completion stage we interact with the State Protection Service. 
I want to emphasize that for both services the political views 
of threatened individuals make absolutely no difference. In 
1993, the Security Service has investigated more than 120 cases 
of threats to statesmen and deputies at all levels, presidential 
representatives, and the president himself. Some 90 cases were 
disclosed, including threats of terrorist acts against 
Vyacheslav Chornovil, Deputies Ostroushchenko and Izmalkov, and 
former Defense Minister Morozov. Thus, you see that we pay no 
attention to the political views of these people, and this 
problem has no political connotation for the Security Service. 
By the way, we also disclosed threats against Russian President 
Yeltsin and Moldovan President Snegur, as well as a terrorist 
act against a foreign embassy in Moscow, prepared by foreign 
citizens on Ukrainian territory. I want to point out that this 
is an international problem. 
  [Reporter] I believe that the experience of foreign 
countries might be useful to us. These countries encountered a 
lot more problems of this kind. There have been a lot of 
terrorist acts in the United States, India, and so on. Do you 
have any contacts with appropriate services from other states? 
  [Hayduk] The State Protection Department is working on 
improving its activities and studying the foreign experience. 
For example, a conference was held in Hungary in November 1993, 
attended by representatives of 32 states, including Ukraine and 
Russia. The conference discussed the issues of fighting 
terrorism and granting security to political leaders. We also 
held a three-week seminar in Kiev with U.S. special services on 
the coordination of efforts and the joint resolution of legal 
issues, conducted practical classes on the physical and 
psychological fitness of functionaries. By the way, under an 
agreement with Yevhen Marchuk, a department will be opened at 
the Kiev Security Service Institute in 1994 for training 
specialists for our department.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers has approved a 
statute of the Kiev Oblast and City Board for Protection of 
State Secrets in Press and Other Mass Media. It was decreed 
that the board is a local body of the State Secret Protection 
Committee, as well as a part of the oblast administration due to 
the principle of dual subordination. The primary task of the 
board is the protection of state secrets and secret information 
in printed sources and other means of mass media including 
papers, journals, books, television and radio programs, 
documentary films, and exhibitions, as well as textual, audio, 
and audiovisual materials destined for shipment abroad, 
disclosure of which can harm military, scientific, 
technological, and economic interests of Ukraine. The board 
will give consultative assistance to local authorities, 
organizations, enterprises, publishing houses, mass media, and 
expert commissions in order to prevent the disclosure of state 
secrets and secret information in materials, which are being 
prepared for publication, broadcasting, or shipment abroad. The 
board is not entitled to control the ideological contents of 
those materials. The board carries out its activity on the 
basis of normative documents adopted for protection of state 
secrets and secret information in the press and other mass media.

<F P=106> [Grigoriy Nesmyanovich report: "Hryvnya Will Replace </F>
Coupon, Although the Economic Situation Is Unlikely To Be 
Altered by a Change of Currency"] 
  [Text] To all appearances, the national currency of 
Ukraine, the need to introduce which has long been discussed in 
Kiev, will be brought in over the next few days. Several 
Ukrainian mass media sources, referring to a statement by Viktor 
Yushchenko, chairman of the board of the Ukrainian National 
Bank, even named specific deadlines: The noncash hryvnya should 
have been brought into circulation 6 January, and the cash 
hryvnya 10 January. So far, however, this has not come about. 
  The proposed exchange rate for the hryvnya in respect of the 
karbovanets is one to 10,000. It is possible that this will be 
the main achievement of the financial operation, insofar as the 
number of zeros on price lists at regular food stores right now 
simply shocks the purchaser. In other respects, only at a 
stretch can the aforementioned action be considered necessary 
and well-timed. It is impossible to keep track of the names of 
authoritative economists, politicians, scientists, and 
financiers who warned: If it is necessary to introduce the 
hryvnya, only do it once the karbovanets has stabilized, and, 
most importantly, once the economy stabilizes. Otherwise, the 
entire inflationary squall of what went before will rain down on 
the new national currency, and the hryvnya's image will be 
undermined even faster than that of its predecessor, the 
karbovanets. 
  But it is difficult to link the temporary fall just prior to 
the New Year of the dollar and Russian ruble rate in respect of 
the karbovanets with any kind of major positive progress on the 
part of the Ukrainian economy. It is simply that, following the 
colossal November price hikes against a background of a natural 
increase of the activeness of purchasers before the holidays, 
there were too few banknotes in circulation, and monetary 
turnover slowed sharply. Therefore, savings accrued by citizens 
in the form of foreign currency came into play... 
  Of course, this has not altered the essence of what is going 
on in the economy. Suffice it to cite facts expounded in the 
latest interview by Ukraine's Power Engineering and 
Electrification Minister Vilen Semenyuk: "Enough coal remains 
in our depots to last roughly one month.... Fuel oil is now 
coming into our stations in quantities representing 15-20 
percent of what is needed.... Only emergency reserves are left 
in the depots...." 
  Of course, people feel the effects of this in terms of cold 
radiators in their apartments, the regular disconnection of hot 
water and light, and television sets which remain lifeless until 
evening (by limiting television operating time, the country 
saves 3.6 million kW-hours of electricity every day.) However, 
few expect the new currency to change any aspect of life 
drastically, or to warm people up....

  [Text] On Monday President Mircea Snegur issued a decree on 
organizing parliamentary elections on February 27. 
  The government and local governing bodies together with the 
Central Electoral Commission should guarantee equal 
opportunities to all participants in the election campaign. 
  Under the decree candidates who are employed at executive 
government bodies at the time of registration should resign from 
their positions not later than 40 days before the elections. 
Their jobs will be kept for them for the time of the election 
campaign. They will take part in election meetings and appear in 
the media as private individuals. 
  The heads of executive government bodies have no right to 
campaign for or against candidates to parliament. 
  At a conference of top ranking officials in Chishinau on the 
coming elections President Snegur has declared that the specific 
conditions of the first multi-party parliamentary elections in 
Moldova require that he state his attitude to the election 
campaign. 
  He said: "Firstly, the constitution binds the president to 
be 
involved in the election campaign. I will bend every effort to 
guarantee the best conditions for parliamentary elections. I 
call the voters to cast their ballots for those who firmly stand 
for strengthening the Moldovan state and independence." 
  "Secondly, the president went on to say, [punctuation as 
received] I will continue to support political forces that 
pursue a policy of strengthening Moldova as an independent and 
sovereign country without any conditions or double standards. 
This stand is in full accord with my program in the 
presidential elections that won clear support from voters. I 
favor those who strengthen the unity of the country by concrete 
actions. I am going to vote for those who put forward and are 
capable of carrying out concrete programs to overcome the 
economic crisis, those who would guarantee stable progress and I 
am going to urge voters to follow my example." 
  "Thirdly, every guarantee of equal participation in the 
elections to all political forces will inevitably result in 
irreversible democratization, a key attribute of constructing a 
democratic and law-governed state". 
  "Fourthly, local executive bodies should organize the 
election campaign strictly in keeping with the law and 
presidential decree offering equal opportunities to all 
candidates". 
  "In the fifth place, Snegur emphasized, I am confident that 
the people on the left bank of the Dniester have fully realized 
who wanted to separate us and why. I hope everyone has 
understood what should be done to prevent the elections from 
being blocked by those who do not want us to live in peace and 
harmony the way we have for centuries." 
  The president urged the media to cover the election campaign 
fully and objectively without insulting any of the participants. 
  The Moldovan head of state singled out the responsibility of 
government bodies of all levels for taking resolute measures to 
stop any attempts of any political forces or individuals to win 
seats in parliament through fanning ethnic discord. 
  Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli thinks the early 
parliamentary 
elections offer a unique chance to determine the future of the 
nation. At the conference in Chisinau he said the elections 
should put an end to the speculations of destructive forces 
operating in Moldova that are opposed to the independence of the 
country and favor unification with Romania. 
  The prime minister urged cabinet members planning to run for 
the new parliament to go on leave by January 15. He said 
cabinet members and representatives of executive bodies should 
run in the election campaign on equal grounds with other 
candidates. 
  IF [INTERFAX] Note: The prime minister himself has been on 
leave since Monday. He is running for parliament on the ticket 
of the influential Agrarian Democratic Party along with his 
deputies Nikolai Oleinik and Valentin Kunev as well as the 
current speaker Pyotr Luchinsky.

<F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Chisinau, 11 Jan -- The Supreme Soviet of the 
unrecognized Dniester republic has today adopted an appeal to 
deputies of the Russian Federal Assembly, asking for support for 
the Dniester region and hoping for understanding of its 
proposals on the creation of a confederation in Moldova. In 
their message the Dniester deputies accuse the leadership of 
Moldova of "persistently not wanting to tackle the Dniester 
problem and pursuing a policy of endless veering between 
threats, military conflict, and political blackmail." If 
Chisinau does not want to "find a mutually- acceptable 
settlement" of the conflict, Tiraspol asks the Russian 
parliamentarians "to recognize the Dniester Moldavian republic 
as an independent and sovereign state friendly to Russia". The 
document also contains a request not to withdraw the Russian 
14th Army from the Dniester region. 
  Moldavian Parliament Deputy Chairman Victor Puscas told the 
ITAR- TASS correspondent that the appeal from the Tiraspol 
authorities to the Russian parliamentarians bore witness to the 
fact that they were unwilling and unable to settle the Dniester 
region problem around the negotiating table. "There can be no 
question of any confederation," he said. "The Dniester region 
problem can and should be resolved within the framework of a 
united Moldova by means of granting the left-bank districts 
special juridical status."

<F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador to the United States Sergey </F>
Mikalayevich Martynov by Vasil Spas; place and date not given: 
"U.S. President Chose Minsk Not Accidentally"] 
  [Text] [Spas] Syarhey Mikalayevich, in a few days, 
U.S. President Bill Clinton will pay an official visit to Minsk. 
This will be the second U.S.-Belarusian summit within the last 
six months, which is rather unprecedented in relations between 
the largest state in the world and a rather small country such 
as Belarus. In connection with this, how would you describe 
relations between Minsk and Washington, and what has been 
achieved in our relations over the last six months? 
  [Martynov] Relations between Belarus and the United States 
were officially classified as friendly in a joint declaration, 
which was adopted at the first meeting between Stanislav 
Shushkevich and Bill Clinton in July of last year. 
  The first July visit by a Belarusian delegation was not held 
without a reason, but occurred as a result of efforts made over 
the entire existence of relations between Belarus and the United 
States. While speaking about achievements of this period, one 
must emphasize that Belarus has signed with the United States an 
array of agreements on cooperation in the military-technical 
sphere. The main ones among them were signed during the visit 
by Stanislav Shushkevich to the United States. These agreements 
are still paving the way for relations between the United States 
and other countries of the former Soviet Union: There have been 
no similar agreements between the United States and other CIS 
countries, except with Belarus. We are the only ones with whom 
the United States has signed agreements on cooperation in 
military conversion and in ecological restoration of 
radioactively and chemically polluted strategic nuclear weapons 
facilities. Such agreements, I would like to emphasize, exist 
only between Belarus and the United States. 
  Currently, we are receiving $76 million in disarmament aid 
from the United States, and we would like to receive additional 
funds for this purpose in 1994. 
  We have received considerable economic assistance in the 
form 
of preferential deliveries of grain and bread. Additionally, an 
array of programs is being introduced -- some of them are 
currently being reexamined -- regarding technical cooperation 
between the United States and Belarus in establishing a 
financial-credit system, a monetary system, development of 
private farming, etc. 
  [Spas] The January trip to Europe by Bill Clinton will 
be his first visit to the Old World as U.S. President. 
Moreover, this is a very short visit -- altogether about one 
week. This way, Minsk is one of the four European capitals to 
be visited by President Clinton. Why, in your opinion, did he 
choose Belarus as one of the points of his brief European tour? 
  [Martynov] Why did the President choose Minsk as one of the 
points on his first European itinerary? Probably, only Bill 
Clinton himself could give a more precise answer to this 
question. From our point of view, the choice was determined by 
the constructive and weighed course in Belarus' disarmament and 
foreign policies, as well as by Belarus' position as the most 
stable post-Soviet republic, which has not shed a drop of blood 
during the process of deep transformations, and which is 
conducting democratic and economic reforms. 
  Another factor is that the United States is interested in 
the 
development of relations with Belarus, and there are directions 
which require a more active impulse at a higher level. In 
particular, this regards the development of economic cooperation 
between the United States and Belarus. 
  [Spas] What could you say about prospects for the 
development of economic cooperation between the two countries? 
So far, the political and, I would say, military-political 
aspects have been the center of attention of U.S.-Belarusian 
relations. 
  [Martynov] A goal of the development of our economic 
relations, and simultaneously, a goal of the preparations for 
the visit, is, first of all, the establishment of legal grounds, 
on which trade and credit relations between the United States 
and Belarus will be later developing. Second, it is possible 
that certain issues of cooperation in abolishing trade barriers 
will also be addressed, and Belarus will receive assistance in 
establishing a market economy infrastructure, speeding the pace 
of economic reform, privatization, etc. 
  [Spas] Speaking about U.S.-Belarusian relations, one 
cannot forget the humanitarian aid the United States delivers to 
Belarus. 
  [Martynov] Yes, our Embassy cooperates with numerous 
humanitarian organizations. The aid they have already sent to 
Belarus, first of all to Chernobyl victims, amounts to millions 
of dollars. I expect that this assistance will continue. We 
also receive a great deal of humanitarian aid from the U.S. 
Government. 
  [Spas] Bill Clinton's visit to Minsk will undoubtedly 
increase Belarus' popularity in the United States, thanks to our 
foreign and disarmament policies. This will also be reflected 
in the improvement of economic relations between the United 
States and Belarus. 
  [Martynov] Belarus' popularity in the United States is not 
the only goal of our relations. Conditions suitable for 
investments and prospects for improved business relations also 
play an important role. As soon as such conditions are created, 
the message will come very quickly. 
  [Spas] At a briefing held in Washington on 16 
December, a top U.S. Administration official stated that Belarus 
is a very important country. We have already underlined the 
importance of Bill Clinton's choice, however, what did that 
official have in mind saying that Belarus is a very important 
country? 
  [Martynov] Of course, this opinion, voiced by a top White 
House official, is not accidental. The White House does not 
voice such statements accidentally. As we believe, the opinion 
was determined by the geopolitical and strategic position of 
Belarus in Europe in general, and in Eastern Europe in 
particular, as well as the uniqueness of Belarus' position among 
post-Soviet countries. In this sense, Belarus can serve as an 
example of a post-Soviet country, which develops quite 
successfully, of course, taking into account certain objective 
economic hardships.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] The visit to be paid by President Bill Clinton to 
Minsk confirms that the United States reacts to Belarus's 
denuclearization initiatives more concretely than anyone esle in 
the world does, said Valeriy Tsepkalo, foreign policy adviser to 
the chairman of the Belarusian parliament. 
  He believes that after President Clinton's visit European 
countries -- Germany, Britain, France -- will have a more 
sympathetic attitude to the problem of global security. 
  Belarus, Tsepkalo said, was the only one among the former 
Soviet republics to sign with the United States a package of 
agreements concerning such issues, as the conversion of defence 
plants, the forming of an exports control system, and 
recultivation of territories where strategic and chemical 
warfare troops were deployed. "Each of these agreements 
requires substantial currency infusions from the United States, 
and they have already begun to arrive," he said. 
  Several important agreements, particularly on lifting trade 
barriers and on giving Belarus technical aid in building 
free-market infrastructure and promoting privatization, are 
expected to be signed in Minsk, said INTERFAX's interviewee. 
  However, even when these documents are signed, Belarus can 
hardly hope to get a vigorous flow of American investment, 
Tsepkalo noted. "What Belarus is likely to get is a tangible 
incentive for creating a more favorable climate for investment," 
he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Uladzimir Hlod: "Stanislav Shushkevich: `Nobody </F>
Will Save Us. Except We Ourselves.'"] 
  [Text] In an exclusive interview with a BELINFORM 
correspondent, Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich has 
confirmed the agency's report on his upcoming meeting with 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  According to the legislature speaker, the meeting will be 
held in the very near future. The sides are to outline their 
positions for the upcoming visit to Moscow by U.S. President 
Bill Clinton, and to discuss the main issues of 
Belarusian-Russian relations. Stanislav Shushkevich emphasized 
that the meeting is not accidental, but conscientiously 
prepared. He also said that he will present not his own 
viewpoint, but the opinion of the Supreme Soviet Presidium at 
the meeting with Boris Yeltsin. The legislature leader refused 
to detail the agenda of negotiations, and added that the 
following tendency can be seen currently in the republic: 
"Before an issue is thoroughly examined, discussed, and 
analyzed, we consider it concluded." 
  Stanislav Shushkevich also stated that he will honestly 
report to the Russian president the difficult economic situation 
in our republic. He noted that, unfortunately, there are 
widespread beliefs that even the best attitude of Russia toward 
us cannot change the situation. "I have requested a report on 
Minsk enterprises that are standing idle. I am afraid to reveal 
the numbers. They are so disastrous that I have asked that they 
be further specified. Unfortunately, many people at our finest 
enterprises remain jobless through no fault of their own. This 
testifies to the fact that our economy is in a critical state. 
Therefore, I do not agree with the statements that we will solve 
all our problems by introducing the monetary union. This is 
concealing the disease. It should be cured, not concealed from 
the doctor. We ourselves should find a way of adapting our 
economy to market relations. Other economic relations are out 
of the question, given our joining the union with Russia. 
Should this not occur, the republic will be in danger of a 
calamitous collapse. I will repeat it again: The ruble zone 
will not save us from everyday hard work," underlined the 
Supreme Soviet chairman. 
  According to Stanislav Shushkevich, the statement issued by 
the prime ministers of Russia and Belarus, which has not yet 
been ratified by signing appropriate documents that would 
specify the mechanism for implementing it, resembles rather a 
declaration of intentions. 
  Speaking about the upcoming visit to Minsk by Bill Clinton, 
the leader of the Belarusian legislature noted that the 
Belarusian-U.S. negotiations "will be of a consultative nature." 
When we conceptually solve such issues as disarmament, 
conversion, and the monetary union, the signing of appropriate 
documents will be a technical matter, stated the Supreme Soviet 
chairman. 
  Stanislav Shushkevich said that he had been very surprised 
by 
an INTERFAX report citing [Prime Minister] Vyacheslav Kebich as 
saying that "after Russia joins NATO, also Belarus could become 
a member of this bloc." The point is, explained the speaker, 
that all basic documents of Belarus, including the Constitution, 
set the course for neutrality, not for favoring any blocs. We 
have a completely different foreign policy focused on 
neutrality, stressed Stanislav Shushkevich. He admitted that he 
had not yet discussed this issue with Vyacheslav Kebich, but 
apparently, it must have been a mistake. Probably, journalists 
misunderstood the prime minister, he added. 
  Additionally, Belarus has never and nowhere stated its 
intentions to join NATO at the official level, concluded the 
speaker. This statement contradicts the agreement on collective 
CIS security, and Vyacheslav Kebich has always supported it.

  [Text] Stanislav Shushkevich, Chairman of the Belarussian 
Supreme Soviet, will leave for Moscow late on Tuesday to meet 
with Russian President Boris Yeltsin there. Officials in 
Shushkevich's headquarters told Interfax that the setting up of 
a monetary union of the two countries would be a major issue the 
two men will discuss. 
  Observers note that Shushkevich and Belarussian Prime 
Minister Vyacheslav Kebich have significant differences over the 
economic integration of the two countries. 
  Valery Tsepkalo, an adviser of the Supreme Soviiet chairman, 
told Interfax that Shushkevich largely shared the views of 
Stanislav Bogdankevich, Chairman of the National Bank of 
Belarus, who opposes the signing an agreement on the merger of 
the monetary systems in the form it was drafted by a bilateral 
ad hoc team of experts. 
  Valery Dashkevich, an advisor of the National Bank of 
Belarus 
(NBB) chairman, told Interfax that his chief "thinks that before 
a monetary union is established an agreement should be reached 
on common prices of fuels and basic raw commodities. ... If his 
view is ignored, the NBB chairman may resign." 
  According to Dashkevich, the NBB chairman will accompany 
Shushkevich to Moscow. 
  Asked by Interfax whether Shushkevich intended to coordinate 
with Yeltsin his position in talks with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, Tsepkalo doubted the need in this because, in his view, 
"Belarus does not have differences with the U.S.A. or Russia."

<F P=106> [Interview with Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav </F>
Shushkevich by Valyantsin Zhdanko; place and date not given: 
"Belarus and Collective Security. Is the Scandal To Continue?"] 
  [Text] Belarus joining the CIS collective security 
system. Currently, this issue, on which so many discussions were 
held half a year ago, has quietly disappeared from the press, 
and has almost been forgotten by the people. 
  However, over the upcoming weeks, this issue will 
probably again become the number one topic in the legislature 
and a reason behind the fierce battle for power. 
  In Ashgabat, a Belarusian delegation headed by Prime 
Minister Vyacheslav Kebich participated in work on drafting 
documents concerning collective security. There have been 
reports that our CIS partners do not want to accept the 
stipulations, on which Belarus insisted while signing the 
agreement. 
  [Zhdanko] There have been contradictory rumors about 
Belarus signing the agreement. 
  [Shushkevich] Belarus signed the agreement on joining the 
CIS collective security system long ago. However, there are 
still certain forces here which are ready to treat this issue 
differently. It is interesting that our partners have far fewer 
doubts. For example, in an interview with INTERFAX, Viktor 
Samsonov, chief of the Headquarters for Coordinating Military 
Cooperation of CIS countries, stated that Belarus joined the 
system of collective security and fulfilled all procedures. In 
the same INTERFAX bulletin, Mechyslav Hryb questioned this fact. 
Since the honorable chairman of the Supreme Soviet committee 
had such doubts, I have asked lawyers to further analyze the 
issue. What is the result? As a matter of fact, there are no 
doubts, however there is a question of terminology. The point 
is that the Vienna convention provides for joining agreements by 
signing them or by issuing a statement saying that they will be 
ratified. The 10th paragraph of the agreement on collective 
security says that one can join the agreement. It does not 
provide for signing it. 
  [Zhdanko] Cannot one remove the ambiguity of this 
situation? 
  [Shushkevich] On 31 December, I sent a letter to CIS 
Executive Secretary Ivan Karatchenya. I informed him that I 
legalized the agreement in the same way Azerbaijan and Georgia 
did. However, since the Supreme Soviet requested that I not 
join the agreement but sign it, I replied that, had I done so, I 
would have actually confirmed our joining the agreement, and I 
cited the Supreme Soviet resolution attaching stipulations to 
it. The stipulations, as is known, prohibit the participation 
of our troops in any actions abroad and activities of armed 
forces of the countries that have signed the agreement on our 
territories, without Supreme soviet permission. It was not only 
this issue which forced me to write the letter. I was surprised 
that Vyacheslav Frantsevich Kebich, the head of our delegation, 
did not sign certain ordinary documents regarding collective CIS 
security at the meeting in Ashgabat. These were a resolution on 
further work on a draft protocol of the agreement on collective 
security, the resolution "On Key Measures for Implementing the 
Agreement on Collective Security," a protocol on terms and 
procedures of joining the agreement, and a resolution on 
appointing the secretary general of the Collective Security 
Council. Had I been well and able to head the delegation, I 
would have unconditionally signed the documents. I believe 
that, having consulted the Supreme Soviet Presidium, I will 
still have an opportunity to announce that we are ready to sign 
the documents. 
  [Zhdanko] But, immediately after the Ashgabat 
meeting, the prime minister explained why Belarus had been 
forced to play an observer's role during debate on this issue. 
  [Shushkevich] I do not like when somebody tries to 
complicate something simple. If the head of the delegation -- 
the prime minister -- had been convinced that I had not signed 
the document, he could have demonstratively stated that he would 
do it. He had the right to do so as the head of a delegation 
appointed by the Supreme Soviet. But such a question did not 
arise, since it would have been nonsense. Therefore, I believe 
that this is just part of a campaign to prove that somebody does 
not want to do anything against the interests of Belarus. 
  [Zhdanko] Assuming that the procedures for signing the 
agreement were violated, is the Foreign Ministry responsible for 
this? 
  [Shushkevich] In countries with statehood experience, their 
official state structures establish appropriate procedures. If 
the Foreign Ministry believes that I did not properly sign the 
agreement, it is its responsibility to inform me about this and 
indicate which procedures were not fulfilled. The Committee for 
National Security could have done the same as well. But, 
instead of doing this, they began ununderstandable hysteria. I 
sent this letter to clarify the situation. 
  [Zhdanko] Is it possible that Belarus will join the 
system of collective security, having stipulated certain terms 
and its special status within this structure? 
  [Shushkevich] The stipulations adopted by the Supreme 
Soviet, in my opinion, contradict, to a certain degree, the very 
sense of the agreement... One must realize that our 
stipulations can be approved only if this is agreed with all 
countries which have signed the agreement without any 
stipulations. I believe that our diplomats should handle this 
issue. I have not seen any move by the Foreign Ministry and the 
Cabinet of Ministers which would be aimed at implementing the 
Supreme Soviet resolution. In a previous letter to leaders of 
CIS countries and the latest one, I could not conceal the 
stipulations -- I was obliged to reveal them. When will the 
issue be finally solved? When the Supreme Soviet adopts a 
resolution on ratification. If the stipulations are approved, 
they should also be accepted by other countries. Should this 
not occur, we should annul the stipulations. I believe that 
preparing the agreement for ratification would be the best form 
of work for today, as well as completing a thorough analysis of 
the question of whether our joining can be accepted with such 
stipulations.

  [Text] Minsk, 12 Jan -- The signing of a statement by the 
Governments of the Russian Federation and Belarus on the 
forthcoming unification of their monetary systems should not 
have any effect on the results of cooperation between the 
republics and international financial organizations, a BELINFORM 
correspondent was told by Yevgeniy Bogomazov, head of the sector 
of the Belarusian Council of Ministers for coordinating the work 
of republican bodies with international economic and financial 
credit organizations. 
  He said that plenipotentiary representatives of the two 
republics had signed a message in Moscow to the IMF, the EBRD 
[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development] and other 
international organizations, in which they gave an assurance 
that the unification of the two monetary systems would not have 
an effect on the prospects for cooperation between the two 
republics and these organizations and would not affect the 
independent status of each of the republics.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Shimanskiy report: "Failure of Belarusian Ruble </F>
Regarded Equivocally in Belarus"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- The statement by Prime Ministers V. 
Chernomyrdin and V. Kebich on the union of the two states' 
monetary systems has whipped up passions even more in Belarus. 
Many questions have arisen, but three main ones worry 
everybody. What advantages does the republic derive from such a 
union? Is it not losing its sovereignty? What will be the 
Belarusian coupon's future fate? 
  It is difficult to answer these questions fully at present. 
Let us stop and consider several points only. V. Kebich's 
government has for a long time been actively striving to create 
an economic and currency union, right to the point of a union of 
the two states' monetary systems. When proposing ways of 
extricating the republic from the social and economic crisis, 
the premier recently stated: It is much easier to stabilize our 
state's economy and finances by pooling our resources. All the 
more so as Russia is giving us this chance. 
  Nevertheless a union of the monetary systems is regarded far 
from unequivocally in Belarus. Especially in the republic's 
parliament. A group of people's deputies, including members of 
the parliamentary opposition, recently wrote in an analysis of 
the situation in the newspaper NARODNAYA GAZETA that it really 
will be a question of Belarus giving up its independence. 
  But S. Bahdankevich, chairman of the board of the National 
Bank of Belarus, considers that the creation of a single ruble 
zone does not threaten the republic's sovereignty and that the 
danger has been exaggerated. In essence, Bahdankevich says, we 
will only coordinate the budget deficit and the volume of credit 
issued. But we will have full sovereignty within the framework 
of these parameters. Only time will tell to what degree 
Belarus's chief banker is right. But now the Belarusian ruble 
will exist on the territory of the two states without let or 
hindrance. During the negotiations both sides agreed on an 
exchange rate of 1:1 for the Belarusian and Russian rubles. 
  Belarusian economic planners are also in favor of a union of 
the monetary systems. Who can tell us where to find more 
convenient sources of energy resources for the republic, a 
consumer market which is more extensive and adapted to our 
commodities output, and where to find such lenders? More than 
90 percent of the energy sources and raw materials the republic 
requires come from Russia. About 70 percent of Belarus's exports 
are delivered to the Russian market. 
  There are insufficient currency and gold reserves in Belarus 
to pursue its economic policy independently of its neighbors. 
In short, Belarus's economy is closely linked to Russia. This 
cannot be left out of the equation.

Kuchma met with Vyacheslav Kebich. On the same day, the former 
Ukrainian prime minister held a news conference. "Economic 
conditions compel us and our Belarusian colleagues," he said, 
"to make our legislatures and governments pay special attention 
to the problems we are currently experiencing.... We have 
crossed that dangerous line which separates us from the 
abyss...." In the opinion of Leonid Kuchma, 
Belarusian-Ukrainian relations are very weak.

  [Text] [Gukovskiy] Your appointment has met with different 
kinds of reaction. Some people believe that nominating the new 
commander is an attempt to remove troops from under the Interior 
Ministry's strict control. The Council of Ministers is 
allegedly pursuing the goal of providing governmental 
structures' security in case Belarus encounters events similar 
to those that occurred in Moscow in October 1993. This is why 
they appointed "their man" to this post, someone who is devoted 
and reliable. 
  [Platonov] These are fabrications. Nothing has changed 
since my nomination. The functions of the Interior Troops are 
the same. Article 1 of the Law on the Interior Troops determines 
the status of these troops as a state-controlled armed formation 
responsible for protecting lives, health, rights, freedoms, and 
personal interests of citizens, society, and the state, its 
constitutional structure, as well as the sovereignty and 
security of Belarus. 
  Article 5 adds that the interior minister exercises general 
control over the Interior Troops, while direct control is 
exercised by the deputy minister, who is in fact the troops' 
commander. 
  Why did they appoint me? I think because 50 percent of my 
functions as deputy minister coincided with functions performed 
by the Interior Troops command. Combining the two posts seems 
like a sound idea to me, preventing the forming of a large 
bureaucratic machine. I am an appointed functionary, just like 
other interior officers. 
  [Gukovskiy] You said that nothing had changed since your 
appointment. What would you like to change? 
  [Platonov] I have had too little time for these kinds of 
conclusions, while there are a lot of urgent problems. These 
include supplies of equipment and materials. Look how poorly 
armed our interior troops are.... We will probably turn to the 
government for help. The combat readiness of our troops must be 
increased. 
  [Gukovskiy] On the first day of the [13th] Supreme Soviet 
session, Independence Square in Minsk was packed with special 
equipment and people in militia uniforms, reportedly belonging 
to a Belarusian regiment. What kind of unit is that? Did 
deputies need such a powerful shield? In my opinion, this gave 
the opposition an excuse to accuse the government of using force 
to step up tension. According to the Popular Front, this almost 
amounted to orchestrating an unconstitutional coup. 
  [Platonov] The Prosecutor's Office investigated this affair 
following a motion from the Popular Front. The mass media 
depicted me almost as a dictator who came to arrest the 
legislature on that day. This is nonsense. I simply followed 
orders. Moreover, that was not Kebich or Danilov who gave these 
orders, although newspapers have been describing the latter as a 
monster. The orders were issued by the interior minister 
himself. Can you imagine what could have happened had I failed 
to perform this task and provide for the deputies' safety? 
  The situation was very tense. On the eve of the session, 
Belarusian Servicemen Association Chairman Nikolay Statkevich 
was summoned to the KGB offices and notified that in case of 
unrest the blame would be put on him. Today, the Servicemen 
Association is rejecting everything, but believe me that there 
was a great danger of clashes and provocations. 
  With regard to the Belarusian regiment, I want to underline 
that this is quite a different unit performing other functions. 
There were no representatives of the regiment in the square. 
Minsk residents simply associate this name with the activities 
of the former regiment of the USSR Interior Troops used for 
operations in hotspots of the former Soviet Union. This 
operative regiment has been disbanded and a militia brigade has 
been formed on its basis and that of a militia regiment. The 
brigade protects public order in the Belarusian capital, also 
during mass demonstrations. 
  [Gukovskiy] One of the tasks of the Interior Troops is 
protecting the safety of the Republic and its citizens. In 
light of this, how do you assess the activities of the 
Belarusian Servicemen Association? 
  [Platonov] The association was registered by the Ministry of 
Justice as a public movement. However, it is evidently 
performing political functions. From this perspective, the 
association's activities, in my opinion, are illegal. I do not 
think that we should have any "armed servicemen" aside from the 
Armed Forces. From whom will they protect us? 
  The nationalist inclination of the Servicemen Association, 
the Popular Front, and other similar organizations is very 
dangerous. It is good that we have become independent and won 
our sovereignty, but we should not overshoot the mark. Take 
disputes over the "historic" victory of Orsha, for example. 
Have they contributed to Belarusian-Russian friendship? Only 
one step separates nationalism and national chauvinism from 
fascism. We will continue to keep close watch over any 
manifestations of these tendencies. 
  [Gukovskiy] Do you have problems maintaining relations 
with other law enforcement agencies? 
  [Platonov] Your question must have been prompted by the 
well- known letter from the Interior Ministry and KGB leadership 
to Shushkevich and Kebich. I cannot be held responsible for the 
entire ministry. I have always had good relations with the KGB, 
the Defense Ministry, and the State Committee for National 
Security and Crime Fighting. 
  There are no obstacles to our work on the part of Danilov. 
Today, neither the KGB nor the Interior Ministry can be left 
uncontrolled. Our structure is subordinated to the Council of 
Ministers and helps enforcement structures coordinate 
activities, draws other ministers and departments into resolving 
urgent issues, including issues of material supplies. 
  We are grateful to the Defense Ministry that has often 
helped 
us in the past, and which recently granted us one of its 
garrisons for training our troops. 
  [Gukovskiy] How proficient are the Interior Troops? 
  [Platonov] We have good officers, a majority of whom have 
both special military training and experience. Some 800 
Belarusian officers have been redeployed to the Republic from 
other regions of the CIS. They, too have problems, of which the 
housing problem is the most acute. However, the active stance 
taken by the government and personally by Vyacheslav Kebich, who 
recently visited the troops, gives us hope that they will be 
resolved. 
  Yet, we are disappointed with low proficiency of our active 
service soldiers. Military commissariats often draft young 
people unfit for the Interior Troops. 
  [Gukovskiy] You are urging the importance of professional 
training, but as far as I know, you were nominated to be deputy 
interior minister after working in the Komsomol. This fact is 
often cited by your opponents. Could you brief us on the 
highlights of your biography? 
  [Platonov] I was born in Vitebsk in 1940 in a Belarusian 
family, although I was registered as a Russian because my family 
was evacuated to Krasnoyarsk Kray during the war. I returned to 
Belarus in 1961, graduated from the department of physics and 
mathematics of Vitebsk Pedagogical Institute, and became a 
schoolteacher. Then, I served in the Army and worked in the 
Komsomol. My last job here was as first secretary of the 
Central Committee. I studied in the Social Sciences Academy 
between 1980-1983, where I wrote my dissertation. Then, my life 
dramatically changed -- I was directed to work in the Interior 
Ministry. Those who blame me for lack of professionalism do not 
know that before entering the Academy I took a special course at 
the Armed Forces General Staff and received a the rank of 
colonel. 
  [Gukovskiy] Unlike many representatives of the nomenklatura, 
you often mention your membership in the CPSU and the years 
spent in the Komsomol. 
  [Platonov] This is not something of which to be ashamed. I 
am proud that I worked under the leadership of people like Petr 
Masherov. They taught me to be responsible and provided me with 
invaluable moral support. 
  [Gukovskiy] In accordance with the law, you cannot be a 
member of any party. What are your political inclinations? 
  [Platonov] I do not see any powerful political trend whose 
ideas I would like to follow. Unfortunately, extreme left-wing 
and right-wing views prevail in the political spectrum of 
Belarus. Representatives of all these groups know me, because I 
often attend their meetings -- that is part of my job. 
  Times are changing and so are law enforcement agencies. 
Earlier, we tried to resolve problems by means of muscle. 
Today, we have legal footing for our actions. Neither I nor my 
subordinates want to provoke clashes and demonstrate who is the 
boss. All issues of contention should be resolved peacefully.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Gusak, deputy chairman of the Belarusian </F>
United Democratic Party: "The Time of `Soft' Reforms Has 
Passed"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Currently, the structural 
reconstruction of the Belarusian economy requires the following 
measures: 
  1. It is necessary to create a transportation net for 
delivery of oil from third countries, that is, to implement the 
idea of a Baltic-Black Sea oil collector [BBSoc]. Politicians 
and experts from Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine, who 
participated in the international conference addressing the 
issue of fuel deliveries to our region, supported this idea. 
The costs for the reconstruction of oil pump stations and the 
building of a gas pipeline could stand at $350-400 million. 
This is an acceptable sum for several states. The BBSoc 
operation will do away with the Russian monopoly on oil in the 
region and our oil and gas shortages. Costs for oil 
transportation from Saudi Arabia through the territory of the 
Baltics to the Novopolotsk oil processing factory will represent 
some 12-14 percent of the total cost paid for oil purchases. In 
general, this oil from Saudi Arabia will be cheaper than that 
from Russia, which we are receiving on a barter or 
clearing-house basis. Hence, the first and foremost task of our 
government is to protect our market from monopoly control. 
  2. To do away with Russian gas deliveries, we deem it 
expedient to deliver condensed gas from Algeria. Algeria has 
enormous potential to condense extracted gas and is looking for 
markets. We could charter gas tankers in Algeria. To pump the 
condensed gas, we could use existing gas pipelines and install 
the necessary cryogenic equipment. Gas pipelines, as well as 
oil pipelines, will connect Belarus with the Baltic and Black 
Seas. Several dozen tankers per year will satisfy 50 percent of 
our oil requirements. 
  All civilized states have antimonopoly laws, according to 
which deliveries of raw materials or fuel (under one title) 
cannot exceed 25-30 percent of the overall amount used by the 
state. We expect that the 1994 price for Russian gas will 
approach the level of world prices, therefore, we will have to 
pay more for municipal services; prices will jump. All this 
will twist the inflation spiral, which in turn will sweep the 
goods out of our shops. 
  3. We should reconstruct our oil processing factories and 
provide for their full capacity, which exceeds the republic's 
demand for oil products. The excess of oil products could be 
sold abroad and the money used to purchase oil. 
  4. The BBSoc states should unite their efforts with other 
CIS states and pursue a single economic policy with Russia to do 
away with its crushing terms. 
  5. Specific measures should be taken to cut down 
hard-currency expenditures and we should learn to pay for only 
imported goods in hard currency. For example, Belarus does not 
have the branch of power mechanical building, while our 
equipment for power engineering is already worn out and requires 
deliveries of very expensive spare parts. At the same time, the 
giant Zhodino truck factory is living through a difficult period 
of unplanned production stoppages due to lack of orders. This 
automobile giant could be retooled and turned into a host 
enterprise of power mechanical building. 
  6. Enterprises should introduce energy conservation 
technologies into their production. In connection with this, 
appropriate departments should establish a Republican standard 
of energy use per unit of production. Enterprises that have 
reached a high level of energy conservation should enjoy tax 
breaks. The amount of tax breaks should enable these 
enterprises to continue the introduction of advanced 
technologies. In capitalist states, such practices have proved 
successful and quite advantageous. 
  7. Expenditures on state staff and nomenclature should be 
sharply reduced. All official cars should be sold at public 
auctions. Only two personal cars -- for the Supreme Soviet 
chairman and the prime minister -- can be maintained at state 
expense. Money for the sold cars should be directed to the 
Health and Education Ministries. The costly staff of state 
bodies should be cut by 50 percent. When our fat cats begin 
filling their cars with gas at private gas stations, they will 
work out a new approach to oil issues in Belarus. 
  8. A law banning the employment of all former communist and 
soviet nomenclature -- fed during the Gorbachev era -- in high 
places should be adopted. Law enforcement bodies should begin 
to legally investigate economic crimes and corruption of high 
officials. Stolen money should be returned to the state 
coffers, while law violators should be prosecuted. If this is 
not done, the Republic will not defeat the Mafia-nomenclature 
clan, which lives at the expense of people, and economic reforms 
will lead to the creation of a political regime akin to those in 
Latin America. 
  9. We should begin to profoundly reconstruct the economy 
with the aim of raising its efficiency and decreasing the 
power-output ratio and input of materials. To do this, we 
should reevaluate the significance of the agricultural sector of 
the economy. 
  There are a lot of models of economic reforms causing a 
certain degree of social unrest or a degree of radical change. 
A lot depends on the starting point. The time of soft reforms 
has gone. Currently, our industrial output equals postwar levels 
in Germany, Japan, or Korea. The models of economic reform in 
those states have been different, while they had one thing in 
common: People worked nine hours a day and 6 days a week; they 
had a week's unpaid vacation, and the unemployment rate was 
around 10 percent. Our government will likely introduce the 
same parameters for us. 
  So, please, do not be happy if you happen to shake hands 
with 
our prime minister.

  [Text] The first official session of Moscow's Duma opened 
in the former building of the Mayor's office on New Arbat Street 
on Monday. The opening State Duma meeting will be held in the 
same premises on Tuesday. Taking part in today's session are 32 
of the 35 deputies, elected by Muscovites on December 12, 1993. 
  In his opening address, 61-year-old Vladimir Plotnikov, the 
Duma's elder, said that the main task today was to adopt a 
statute of Moscow, which will become "a constitution for Moscow 
as a constituent part of the Federation." He also voiced hope 
that the relatively small membership of the Duma would guarantee 
its cohesion. 
  On Monday, deputies will discuss procedural matters, elect a 
speaker, and hear a speech by Konstantin Buravlev, the first 
vice-premier of Moscow's Government, who will discuss social and 
economic development and the budget for Moscow this year, report 
about temporary working groups, and announce an agenda for the 
next Duma session, scheduled for January 19.

  [Text] During the break in the work of the Federation 
Council, Tatarstan's President, Mintimer Shaymiyev, declared to 
Interfax that he had come to the chamber's session to 
participate in its work as a guest. 
  Shaymiyev expressed the opinion that if Kazan and Moscow 
sign 
a treaty before the additional elections to the Russian 
parliament scheduled for March 13, then Tatarstan's people will 
actively participate in the voting. 
  Elections did not take place on Tatarstan's territory on 
December 12 because less than 30 percent of electors came to the 
electoral districts. 
  "The factor of an agreement will play its decisive role in 
this issue and will finally determine whether the republics' 
representatives are elected to the Federation Council and State 
Duma," announced Shaymiyev. To this effect he expressed 
conviction that the treaty would be signed before March 13 and 
Tatarstan "will be represented in the new parliament." 
  According to Shaymiyev, relations between Kazan and Moscow 
should be grounded on the Basic Laws of the Russian Federation 
and Tatarstan and should be "agreement-constitutional ones." 
  Commenting on the Russian president's speech at the 
Federation Council's session, Shaymiyev said that "he met with 
great satisfaction the thesis stating that a strong Russia 
should consist of strong regions." "One should not fear to 
transfer authorities to the regions because as of today none of 
the regions tries to violate Russia's integrity," said Shaymiyev.

  [Text] Ioshkar Ola, January 11 (TASS) -- The youngest 
lawmaker was elected the speaker of the parliament of the 
Republic of Mari El in central European Russia. 
  Anatoliy Smirnov, who has not yet turned 30, defeated former 
speaker Yuriy Manakov who boasts the highest popularity rating 
in the republic, according to the latest opinion polls. 
  Smirnov made a typical Soviet-Russian style career. He began 
as an ordinary worker, but then switched to Komsomol, the youth 
branch of the former Soviet Communist Party, and succeeded to 
raise to the post of the secretary of a district party committee. 
  However, when market reforms began in the country, Smirnov 
abandoned the Communist post and went to work in a commercial 
bank and after that to a property managing fund which organised 
privatisation.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali arrived in 
Kazakhstan's capital of Almaty yesterday on the last leg of his 
weeklong official visit to three Central Asian states. He was 
received at the airport by Kazakh Foreign Minister Suleymenov 
and other senior officials. During a brief discussion with the 
Kazakh foreign minister at the airport, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali 
said ties between Kazakhstan and Pakistan will always be 
friendly and stable. He said Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto 
attaches great importance to ties with Central Asian states. 
  Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said the Kashmir 
problem is the most important issue between Pakistan and India 
and its resolution is essential to improving the security 
environment in South Asia. Refuting a REUTER report which 
stated the Pakistan foreign minister's warning that a nuclear 
war could break out in South Asia if the Kashmir issue is not 
resolved, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said a number of countries have 
expressed concern over the threat of war between Pakistan and 
India on the issue. He said in categorical terms that Pakistan 
wants a peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. 
With the same desire, Pakistan got ready to hold talks with 
India on every aspect of the dispute. He said to make the talks 
meaningful, it is essential that human rights violations be 
halted in occupied Kashmir, and that India, with due 
seriousness, should display its political determination to solve 
this issue.

  [Text] [Unidentified correspondent over video of a row of 
flags and a sign reading "Emba-5", air defense systems being 
tested] The Emba Test Range in Kazakhstan makes it possible to 
hold fire practices of 10 regiments or air defense brigades at 
once. Kazakhstan is a foreign country now. However, on the 
basis of an agreement, field training exercises are held here 
just like during the past decades. General designers use these 
exercises to perfect air defense systems. [video shows air 
defense systems being fired] 
  Modern Russian air defense systems are superior to foreign 
ones in terms of multiplicity of channels [kanalnost], 
protection [zashchishchennost], mobility, and kill probability. 
So for example, at a recent exercise, the Buk-M1 system scored 
30 hits of the most modern air targets with 31 missiles. The 
air defense men did not disappoint us on this occasion either. 
Not a single missile missed its target. And that despite the 
fact that the battery was manned by only two privates instead of 
the statutory 16. [video shows test range, air defense systems

  [Text] Dushanbe January 12 TASS -- Missile fire was again 
opened from the territory of Afghanistan Tuesday on the 12th 
post of the Moskovskiy detachment, guarding the Tajik frontier. 
ITAR-TASS has learned from military sources in Dushanbe that 
there were no casualties among Russian servicemen. 
  According to the same sources, the number of armed 
provocations on some sectors of the Tajik-Afghan border has 
increased sharply since early January. For instance, fire was 
opened on the deployment area of the 13th post of the Moskovskiy 
border guard detachment on Sunday. Tajik mujaheds fired eight 
shells at the post from Afghan territory. 
  Borderguards of the Pyanj detachment have cut short three 
attempts of small groups of Tajik opposition fighters to break 
into Tajikistan from Afghan territory in the past five days.

<F P=106> [Correspondent Vladimir Berezovskiy report: "Ruble Has </F>
Scaled the Pamirs"] 
  [Text] Tashkent -- Last Sunday Tajikistan entered the 
Russian ruble zone. Moscow has allocated the republic credit 
worth 120 billion rubles [R]. The objective is to get the 
republic's economy, brought to its knees by civil war, up and 
running and to avert the real threat of famine. 
  During recent months, and after Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and 
Turkmenistan switched to their own currencies, Tajikistan has 
been buried in an avalanche of Soviet money. By hook or by 
crook, this money worked its way into the Pamirs where it was 
used to buy cars, houses, carpets, and valuable items. The 
rapid increase in inflation cast practically the entire republic 
beyond the pale of poverty. Especially as the average wage here 
used not to exceed R20,000. 
  However, the Russian ruble does not promise Tajikistan an 
immediate solution to all its problems. The government has 
taken extremely unpopular measures in order to ensure that the 
credit it has received will last six months, whereupon Dushanbe 
will probably switch to its own national currency anyway. 
  And so the old money cannot be exchanged for Russian money. 
Only half of January's pay will be issued in Russian money; the 
rest will be paid into special accounts. The population can 
place old money on deposit, but it is unclear when this will be 
unfrozen. The confiscatory nature of the money reform is also 
emphasized by the fact that a ceiling of R64,000 has been 
imposed on wages. This is motivated by the fear that "spare" 
money will flood into Russia, washing away goods and whipping up 
inflation -- which was what happened before. 
  The introduction of the ruble, unfortunately, has hit "our 
people" hardest -- those looking to resettle in Russia. Under a 
government directive, only R20,000 per family member may now be 
taken out of the republic. But what is to be done with the 
money that was paid out for apartments, houses, dachas, cars, 
and other property?

<F P=106> [Report by Ivan Zhagel: "Tajikistan Has Received Political </F>
Credit of 30 Billion Rubles and Will Obviously Receive the Same 
Amount Again"] 
  [Text] During the extended vacation, an "Ostankino" news 
program showed an item on the start of the exchange of old 
rubles for new Russian rubles in Tajikistan. The event could be 
considered an exception since previously not a single former 
Soviet republic had succeeded in getting Russia to assign it 
cash. 
  The Russian Goskomsotrudnichestvo [State Committee for 
Cooperation with Commonwealth Members] confirmed that cash worth 
30 billion rubles [R] had been imported into Tajikistan and that 
intergovernment agreements between the two countries have 
stipulated a sum of R60 billion. 
  Actually all leading workers at the Goskomsotrudnichestvo 
with whom we talked were very reluctant to provide information 
and asked not to be named. This behavior is entirely 
understandable since we can now expect a sharply negative 
response from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Armenia, and some other 
countries of nearby foreign parts which have sought but have not 
gotten the same favor from Russia. 
  Why has an exception been made for Tajikistan? One deputy 
chairman of the Goskomsotrudnichestvo called this a "big 
exception" made "by force of circumstances." It is not hard to 
guess what these circumstances are -- the complete collapse of 
the Tajik economy, the continuing war on its borders, and 
Russia's interests in this region. 
  On the other hand it is wrong to suppose that Tajikistan has 
now fully entered the ruble zone and has joined its money area 
with Russia. Yet this view does exist among Tajik leaders. But 
the rubles were not supplied for nothing but as a state credit. 
And on the same terms which have been set for other republics 
and primarily the transfer of gold and currency reserves to 
Russia. It is true that there are not so many of these reserves 
in Russia so the agreement stipulates that the supply of cash be 
compensated largely through the mortgage of property. But from 
talks with Goskomsotrudnichestvo staffers it could be understood 
that the specific establishments to be mortgaged have not yet 
been determined. 
  In addition the credit has been supplied for six months, 
during which period Tajikistan must fulfill all terms for really 
entering the ruble zone. And these terms provide for the 
complete subordination of the national bank to the Central Bank 
of Russia, the coordination of tax, customs, and budget policy, 
and the implementation of economic reforms. If the Tajik 
leaders manage to do all this within six months then they are 
relieved of their obligation to service the credit provided to 
them. Otherwise they will pay in full.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>
  [Text] Dushanbe January 11 TASS -- The preliminary results 
of the implementation of the first stage of the Russo-Tajik 
agreement on the republic's accession to Russia's single 
monetary system, which began on January 5, have been summed up 
in Tajikistan. Tajik banks have stopped accepting deposits from 
the population as of today. The circulation of old 10-rouble 
banknotes was stopped the day before. 
  ITAR-TASS has learned from sources close to the Tajik 
government that Imamali Rakhmanov, chairman of the Tajik Supreme 
Soviet, had optimistically assessed at a meeting of a special 
state commission on Monday evening the preliminary results of 
the first stage's implementation. He stressed that this 
important undertaking, in spite of several organisational 
difficulties, was carried out with less social losses than 
predicted by sceptics. On the whole, more than 120 billion old 
roubles were withdrawn from circulation. The population got 
wages and various allowances amounting to 10 billion new 
roubles. The head of the Tajik state noted in particular that 
honest people had not suffered from the republic's phased 
accession to Russia's rouble zone. However, he ordered Tajik 
law enforcement bodies to look into cases when individual 
enterprises and commercial structures had turned in to banks 
scores of millions of old roubles. 
  It was stressed during the commission's meeting that the 
heads of corresponding ministries and departments were 
confronted with the tasks of supplying the market with enough 
goods, primarily food products, exercising strict control over 
the state commercial system, and preventing the leakage of new 
Russian roubles to other countries. 
  In the meantime, the situation in the state retail trade 
network and on the local markets is deplorable. Food stores are 
empty as before. Nothing has changed for the better at Dushanbe 
markets. Owners of commercial kiosks have not reduced prices.

the idea of dual citizenship, which was introduced recently by 
Turkmenistan, they told reporters in Tashkent Monday. 
  Karimov, for example, has said that Russians living in 
Uzbekistan should believe that the republic's constitution 
provides them equal conditions and rights alongside the local 
population and other nations living in the republics. 
  For his part, Nazarbayev said that Kazakhstan's Constitution 
does not offer dual citizenship and he, as the president, must 
obey it.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature; by Andrey </F>
Pershin, Andrey Petrovsky, Vladimir Shishlin; edited by Boris 
Grishchenko] 
  [Text] Uzbek and Kazakh presidents Islam Karimov and 
Nursultan Nazarbayev signed an agreement in Tashkent Monday on 
the setting up of an economic union. 
  Karimov emphasized at a news conference that the agreement 
called for removal of customs offices on the boundary between 
the two countries, free movement of people, goods and services 
and creation of legislation for joint development of 
communication and transport lines. The existing customs treaty 
will be ineffective as of February 1, 1994. 
  According to Karimov, third countries may join the treaty. 
  The Uzbek president told journalists that the bilateral 
talks 
had culminated in signing agreements on a regional investment 
bank and an inter-state clearing bank and on settlements between 
the National Bank of Kazakhstan and the Central Bank of 
Uzbekistan. 
  By still another agreement, the $39 million debt Uzbekistan 
owed Kazakhstan at the end of 1993 will be regarded as a state 
credit to the Uzbek government. 
  Answering a question about the need in such a union, 
Nazarbayev said that Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan had always 
supported economic integration and disapproved of 
self-isolation. "This union became an urgent need as equal 
national currencies began to circulate," he said. He emphasized 
that the two presidents had agreed that their partnership should 
be equal without any dictate or hegemony. 
  Both presidents had a dim view of dual citizenship such as 
what Turkmenistan had recently introduced. Kariimov said: "I 
want the Russians living in Uzbekistan to believe that the 
republiic's Constitution provides equal opportunities and rights 
with the native population and all peoples living here." 
  For his part, Nazarbayev said that the Kazakh Constitution 
did not provide for dual citizenship and he as the president had 
to abide by the Constitution. 
  Nazarbayev formulated the watchword for today as To 
Prosperity through Unity and Karimov as Ethnic, Inter-Ethnic and 
Civic Accord. 
  Karimov and Nazarbayev left for Nukus, Uzbekistan, to attend 
the summit of five Central Asian countries which will discuss 
ways to safeguard the Aral Sea. 
  This meeting will take over from the Kzyl-Orda summit at 
which the leaders of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Turkmenistan and Tajkstan agreed on March 26, 1993 on joint 
action to rescue the Aral Sea and the surrounding areas. 
  Informed sources close to the Uzbek government told Interfax 
that the heads of Central Asian states would discuss in Nukus 
the introduction of national currencies. Unless these problems 
are resolved, experts believe, cooperation in the ecological or, 
for that matter, any other sphere, was impossible.

<F P=106> [Mekhman Gafarly report: "Only Government Newspapers Come </F>
Out in Republic. Independent Publications Denied Registration"] 
  [Text] The new year has brought no faster democratic 
change in Uzbekistan, where a virtual end has been put to 
freedom of speech. A repeat registration of the mass media was 
completed by the republic's State Press Committee in the first 
10 days of December. Contrary to expectations by the numerous 
Uzbek opposition, the republic's State Press Committee did not 
register a single newspaper whose founder was a journalist 
collective or a private person. 
  In the wake of the "Gorbachev perestroyka," a number of 
independent publications are known to have appeared and existed 
till late last year. Besides, some former organs of party and 
Komsomol organizations, and even of local soviets, started to 
publish material in a democratic spirit. Deciding to put an end 
to this "journalist laissez faire," the republic's leadership 
officially announced that all publications in the republic 
should be registered again. As was expected, the only printed 
organs that continue to be published are those of power 
structures. Having been registered as founders of five main 
daily republic papers are the Supreme Soviet, the Cabinet of 
Ministers of the republic, the People's Democratic Party -- 
successor to the former Uzbek Communist party led by 
Uzbekistan's president -- and the Republican Fund in Support of 
the Press set up in accordance with Islam Karimov's edict. The 
founders of oblast, rayon, and town newspapers have 
correspondingly become the administrations of the oblasts, 
rayons, and towns as in recent Soviet times when the mass media 
were fully controlled by the official authorities.

  [Excerpts] We will continue on the same subject of the 
government reshuffle. We have asked correspondent Peeter 
Kaldre, who is currently in the studio, to comment on today's 
presidential speech and events at the Riigikogu. 
  [Kaldre] President Meri's speech consisted of two parts 
[words indistinct]. Firstly, he justified his negative attitude 
to the government reshuffle as proposed by Prime Minister Laar. 
Secondly, he explained the extraordinary circumstances 
affecting Estonia's independence under which he did agree to 
sign Prime Minister Laar's proposals, amounting to him agreeing 
to dismiss Toomas Sildmae as economics minister and appointing 
Toivo Jurgenson to this post, and to appoint Heiki Kranich as 
finance minister. 
  If one is to (?explain) matters straight away then the first 
half of Meri's speech was predominantly devoted to criticism of 
Laar and the defense of Toomas Sildmae. In Meri's opinion, Laar 
did not have sufficient instinct as a statesman to resign in the 
interests of the Fatherland. This would have been at the time 
when it came to light, after the local election results [in 
October], that the balance between political forces in Estonia 
had altered considerably. Laar opted for another path, the 
unsuccessful government reshuffle whose aim was to preserve his 
own -- that is Laar's -- power. The Fatherland's crisis is 
first and foremost the prime minister's own crisis, said Meri. 
Meri's belief is that Laar should have taken into account 
popular feelings and expanded the government coalition 
resolutely, even at the price of his own personal resignation. 
  Next, Meri dwelled on Estonia's achievements in the economy 
and finance sphere, as accepted at world level. If anything at 
all has been functioning effectively in Estonia, it is the 
economy, Meri stated. That is due to the fact that a hard core 
of home-grown industrial, trade, and financial circles have 
emerged in Estonia based on Estonia's own capital. Meri spoke 
about Toomas Sildmae's letter of yesterday in which Sildmae says 
that he sees no reason for his resignation. Sildamae is 
convinced, as before, that an open economy forms the foundation 
of Estonia's development as a state. The government must 
support precisely this, rather than the state system which is 
corrupt. Meri doubts whether Estonian industrial and trade 
circles will continue to feel secure after Sildmae's departure. 
  Meri highlighted the fact that the security of our economic 
policy has not at all been analyzed. Instead, only arms are 
being discussed. At the same time, the Russian capital's 
infiltration into Estonia, through both shadow individuals and 
firms is beyond control. Who does the Republic of Estonia 
belong to, Meri asked? 
  In the second half of his speech Meri explained the 
extraordinary circumstances that made him sign Laar's proposals 
for the government reshuffle. Meri reproached Laar for 
neglecting new essential developments in international life. 
The current NATO summit and the upcoming Russian-U.S. summit 
may bring about a decisive change in the balance of powers, that 
one way or another, will also affect Estonia. Instead of being 
extremely active in the foreign policy sphere, weeks have been 
spent on the government reshuffle and our whole intellectual 
potential has focused on contemplating our own navels. At 
present, the government should be in top gear for activity. The 
government reshuffle that Laar has carried out took place in an 
undesirable manner and at the least suitable time, said the 
president. 
  Meri concluded the following: He takes a negative attitude 
to 
the proposed governmental changes, but the present extraordinary 
moment and the country's interests demand that the president 
should agree. Under the very eyes of the peoples' deputies Meri 
signed the government reshuffle documents. 
  What is one to conclude from all this? The following aspects 
are obvious. Meri's speech was pointed against Prime Minister 
Laar. Several grave accusations were raised against Laar. 
Firstly, that Laar does not consider popular opinion and 
feelings, and thus he has become alienated from the people, as 
the people have from him. It is interesting that the Fatherland 
as a party, and the government coalition as a whole, were not 
included in Meri's criticism. I want to protect the Fatherland 
from the Fatherland itself, Meri noted. [passage omitted] 
  After such a speech from Lennart Meri it is hard to believe 
that there are any prospects for the Toompea [seat of Riigikogu] 
and Kadriorg [presidential residence] to cooperate, albeit that 
the president did not exactly say this in an interview to 
Estonian Radio. Only two options are left: Either Laar or Meri 
will resign. The latter seems unlikely indeed. In any case, 
Meri has left the public with the impression of a true father of 
the nation who, in the interests of Estonian security, is forced 
to take decisions that in the long term he considers to be 
without any prospects. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From 12 January RAHVA HAAL, POSTIMEES, pp 1,3] </F>
  [Excerpt] Wednesday, January 12 -- President Lennart Meri 
ended the controversy over the cabinet reshuffle by finally 
appointing the four ministers. 
  The Riigikogu session voted again on some draft laws before 
the president's arrival -- the new defence minister Indrek 
Kannik is no longer an MP, but he had nevertheless voted twice 
on Monday [10 January]. 
  The president held a 14-minute speech, criticising the 
government coalition and specifically Prime Minister Mart Laar 
for the inopportune time for the replacement of the ministers. 
The government's secretive way of acting is alienating the 
people from the government, the president warned, stressing that 
he is attempting to protect the "Fatherland" against the results 
of its own acts. He regretted Laar's "lack of statesmanship" in 
not resigning and maintaining the existing secretive system of 
decisionmaking. Meri warned against an "infiltration of Russian 
state capital into Estonia" and rhetorically asked, "Who really 
owns the Republic of Estonia?" The president again stressed the 
efficiency of Toomas Sildmae in the Economy Ministry and 
expressed his doubts whether the change of ministers will 
increase the confidence of the national business circles. 
Referring to the NATO summit, Meri claimed that the reshuffle 
was conducted at the most unfavourable moment. However, he 
signed the document relieving the four ministers and appointing 
their successors. 
  The president declined from answering any questions of the 
MP's and left immediately.

<F P=106> [From 12 January RAHVA HAAL, POSTIMEES, PAEVALEHT, </F>
HOMMIKULEHT, pp 2,3] 
  [Text] Wednesday, January 12 -- Prime Minister Mart Laar 
described the recent events as a crisis of power rather than of 
government, stressing that the coalition had remained firm. He 
added that the constitution is inadequately expressed and needs 
a number of additional laws to guarantee the actual balance of 
power. 
  Laar rejected the president's accusations of inopportune 
moment for the reshuffle. "I consider the change of ministers a 
significant factor guaranteeing Estonia's stability. 
Considering the hard times ahead, we should go on with a 
monolithic government which effectively cooperates with the 
parliament," he said. 
  The prime minister admitted that the presidential speech 
contained a number of correct critical points, but added that 
Meri had not expressed his criticism so directly at the previous 
meetings. Laar also stressed that the government had been 
paying "constant attention" to the infiltration of the Russian 
capital into Estonia. 
  "Fatherland" faction chairman Tiit Sinissaar described the 
accusations as surprising and questioned the arguments used by 
the president. Deputy faction chairman Kalle Jurgenson stressed 
that the "Fatherland" sees no reasons for the resignation of the 
prime minister. 
  "Fatherland" MP [member of parliament] Mart Nutt and 
Moderate 
Vello Saatpalu stressed that Estonia is a parliamentary state 
and the president exceeded his authority. Centrist Andra 
Veidemann described the situation and the presidential 
expression of no confidence to the prime minister as 
"interesting and unprecedented". Coalition Party MP Ulo Vooglaid 
expressed his surprise and delight at the president's frank and 
honest analysis of the critical problems.

  [Excerpts] A government session took place today on 
Toompea. At the post-session news conference President Lennart 
Meri's speech was also under discussion. Mati Kirotar reports: 
  [Kirotar] The rivalry between Kadriorg [presidential 
residence] and Toompea [seat of government and parliament] seems 
to have ended for the time being. The subject of the 
presidential speech in the Riigikogu [parliament] today came up 
again at the news conference after the government session. 
Premier Mart Laar said that he had not declared any kind of war 
on the president. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Laar recording] There were definitely many very 
accurate observations in Mr. President's speech, in particular 
those to do with rivalry between Andres and Pearu [reference to 
a literary classic]. I think that such rivalry has indeed 
damaged the Estonian state. I believe that our common aim is to 
avoid anything similar in the future. There were also some 
other aspects which I fully subscribe to, for example the influx 
of Russian capital into the Estonian economy, as Mr. President 
claimed. As far as Russian capital influx into Estonia is 
concerned, this is indeed under the government's close scrutiny. 
We have for example arrived at a position not to support the 
granting of banking licenses in Estonia to Russian banks, 
whether state or non-state. Or at least we would consider each 
individual application very thoroughly. I believe that the new 
economics minister will definitely... [changes thought], as Mr. 
Meri sees a problem in this area and pays serious attention to 
it the problem has arisen for Mr. Meri at the moment [as heard]. 
I am not fully certain that this is so and I would not like to 
accuse the outgoing economics minister of anything. [passage 
omitted] 
  I hope that these shocks of the past few days will not lead 
us further afield but will educate us instead to conduct our 
affairs better. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 11, BNS - Estonia and Lithuania 
announced today they were ready to start cooperation with NATO 
under the "Partnership for Peace" plan. 
  Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar at a press conference 
today 
indicated Estonia was interested in the "Partnership for Peace" 
program. He said the country was going to prepare its formal 
position on the issue within the next few days and submit it to 
NATO. 
  He said the document which must bear the signatures of the 
president and the prime minister had been drawn up already. 
  "We wish to start negotiations with NATO on future 
cooperation on the first opportunity. We wish to fill the 
agreements to be signed with a concrete content," the Estonian 
prime minister said. 
  The issue of Estonia's membership in NATO was also discussed 
by the parliamentary foreign Affairs Commission today. 
  The commission ruled to draw up a draft resolution for the 
parliament, seeking the president to write a formal application 
for Estonia's membership in NATO. The draft resolution was 
approved by the parliament's 9-member Foreign Affairs Commission 
with 6 votes to 2 and one abstention. The adoption of the 
resolution now depends on a vote in the parliament. 
  "The idea that remained in the atmosphere at the discussion 
was that we were late with our application for NATO membership. 
Unlike in Latvia, there is even no institution in Estonia to 
have expressed support to Lithuania on the country's entering 
its application for NATO membership. The prevailing tone in the 
commission was that the process of becoming a member in NATO has 
to be set off to express our political attitude," said Tiit 
Made, member of the Foreign Affairs Commission. 
  He said the commission's attitude toward the "Partnership 
for 
Peace" plan was mainly positive. The commission is to take the 
issue for discussion again on Jan. 24, when the text of the 
partnership plan is to be more closely examined. 
  "It was found that early membership in NATO was not a 
realistic prospective and that 'Partnership for Peace' provides 
the possibility to move forward step-by-step. Also NATO has to 
maneuver politically while accepting new members, in view of 
Russia's attitude," Made said. 
  Made in his interview with BNS also criticized the 
inactivity 
of the Foreign Ministry in expressing interest toward NATO and 
supporting Lithuania's application. 
  Toivo Klaar, head of the political department at the 
Estonian 
Foreign Ministry, said Estonia's attitude toward the adoption of 
the "Partnership for Peace" program was positive and that the 
country was going to use every opportunity for cooperation with 
NATO and other countries involved in the partnership program. 
  Klaar said the partnership program provided an "excellent 
opportunity for integration with NATO, for working closely with 
the alliance and moving toward the final goal, a member's status 
in NATO," he said. 
  Commenting on the NATO leaders' decision not to grant 
security guarantees to the countries under the program, Klaar 
said that these things "are not yet the way we liked." 
  But he pointed out as important that consultations can be 
held in case the security of the NATO partners is threatened. 
  "The great potential that NATO has, the power that stands 
behind it, and the consultations -- already this by itself can 
be a guarantee of peace," he said. 
  He said the Baltics as well as the Central European 
countries 
of the so-called Visegrad group -- Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and 
the Czech Republic -- both had their best points for integration 
with NATO. 
  "The Visegrad countries have bigger armies and more 
experience. At the same time the fact that our armies are small 
and young allows us to build them up from the very beginning on 
patterns suitable for NATO," Klaar said. 
  He pointed out as an important step Estonia's decision to 
purchase of arms of the NATO standards from Israel, as well as 
the Baltics' decision to set up a common Baltic peacekeeping 
battalion, which can participate in peacekeeping operations 
together with NATO units in the future.

  [Text] "The wish to join NATO of the former Warsaw Pact 
member states and states that have freed themselves from the 
Soviet Union, is primarily conditioned by a sense of danger," 
Clyde Kull, Estonian representative at the North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council and head of Estonian representation by the 
European Union, the Estonian Ambassador to Belgium, Netherlands 
and Luxembourg, told ETA. 
  Kull said that another reason to join NATO is that despite 
making some positive statements, Russia has not damaged [as 
received]to prove the friendliness and democracy of its foreign 
policy. 
  "Russian statements in connection with the Lithuanian wish 
to 
join NATO sound a bit nervous, and, in fact, strengthen the wish 
to join," Kull said. "It appears that Russia does not consider 
NATO as a friendly alliance. Although Russian military doctrine 
stresses that Russia has no enemies, including NATO, it still is 
against other states joining NATO," Kull said. 
  Kull said that it must be considered, how real and possible 
the widening of NATO is at the present moment. "The Lithuanian 
application will most probably have no results at the present 
moment, for NATO has not managed to determine its future and 
identity in the changing world," Kull said. 
  Vello Saatpalu, head of Riigikogu foreign committee, who 
returned from the CSCE Parliamentary Assembly political and 
security council committee session in Brussels, said the 
Lithuanian application was a "good shake to the dispersing 
Western Europe", admitting, however, that Estonia and Latvia 
were not yet ready for a similar statement. "We have still 
several conflicts with our Eastern neighbor, but the step will 
have to be taken in the future," Saatpalu said.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 11, BNS -- The NATO summit in 
Brussels gave the countries of Eastern Europe the maximum of 
security guarantees NATO could go for at the moment, said Clyde 
Kull, the Estonian ambassador in Brussels. 
  The statements by NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton, both favorable of the security 
interests of Eastern Europe "were the maximum we could have," 
Kull told a BNS correspondent. 
  Woerner said NATO's message to the new democracies of 
Central 
and Eastern Europe was one and the same: the countries won't be 
left on their own luck. "If we admit new members to NATO, this 
must help to stabilize Europe and not to divide it once again," 
he said. 
  NATO leaders in the summit offered the nations of Eastern 
Europe cooperation under the "Partnership for Peace" program. 
The program gives the region no binding security guarantees, but 
NATO under the scheme would accept the obligation to engage in 
security consultations with countries participating in the 
program, if the country feels its security threatened. 
  Kull said he regarded NATO members as ready to "go rather 
far" in case the security of countries involved in the program 
was threatened. But he added that the alliance was likely to 
abstain from military intervention, but use "strong political 
means of influence" instead. 
  The Estonian ambassador said preparations for the NATO 
summit 
had taken place under heavy pressure from the Eastern Europe. He 
said the pressure had contributed to entering some new clauses 
into the final document of the meeting, such as the words that 
the NATO "doors are open." 
  Kull was sure that NATO and the Western countries were 
interested in the Baltics as a possible sphere of interest. 
  "It is absolutely clear that a policy of dividing the 
spheres 
of interest is under way in Europe," Kull said. "Also Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev has said that Russia has 
geopolitical interests, which are determined by the borders of 
the former Soviet Union. If it is not Russia that has its 
influence there, someone else will fill the place," Kull quoted 
Kozyrev as saying. 
  But Kull also said the interest of the West in the Baltic 
region could be described as economic and social rather than 
military and political.

to Laar, a statement from Estonia to NATO has been drawn up and 
should logically bear signatures of both the president and the

be ready immediately to start talks so as to (?fulfill) a 
Partnership for Peace agreement with a spcific content, Laar 
added. According to Laar, the statement under discussion would 
(?serve) as a starting point for the talks. Estonia wishes to 
be one of the first countries to open talks with NATO with quite 
a specific program, art Laar added.

that during the night of January 10, Estonian President Mart 
Laar held telephone discussions with members of the Latvian 
government following a provocation in Riga against Russian 
servicemen and diplomats, and the placing of Russian troops in 
Latvia in a state of increased combat readiness. 
  The Latvian side informed Laar that the situation was 
getting 
back to normal. 
  Both sides compared the events with the situation in Latvia 
in 1940 which led to those countries' occupation by the Soviet 
Union, and emphasized the importance of preserving peace and 
stability, and of efforts to ensure their countries' security. 
  An agreement was reached on maintaining permanent contacts 
between the Latvian and Estonian governments until the crisis is 
resolved.

<F P=106> [Report by Leonid Levitskiy: "Majority of Estonians in </F>
Favor of Review of Border with Russia"] 
  [Text] Tallinn -- The majority of Estonians consider that 
the border should be restored to its prewar position. 
  Estonia should get back Ivangorod, the area around the Narva 
river, and Pechory. But the majority of Estonians hope that a 
solution will be found which is acceptable to both states. The 
newspaper POSTIMEES drew this conclusion on the basis of a 
sociological poll carried out by the "Emor" company. 
Specialists questioned 1,000 people. These were on the whole 
young Estonians (16-24 years of age) and elderly Estonians 
(65-74 years of age), who stated that it is necessary to 
reinstate the Tartu (Yuryev) Peace Agreement and the border 
between the countries which it established. According to the 
paper, those with a low level of education favor the prewar 
border. Estonians with higher education and Estonians living in 
the republic's northeast come out in favor of a compromise 
solution for the border problem.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 10, BNS - Estonia received about 1.1 
billion kroons in foreign aid and signed 109 million U.S. 
dollars (about 1.5 billion kroons) worth of loan agreements with 
other countries, former Finance Minister Madis Uurike said in a 
press conference today. 
  Uurike said the country's government used 63 million dollars 
of total 109 million dollars received in loans. The rest was 
provided to the banking sector and regional governments, who 
have accepted the obligation to repay the loans. 
  The energy, transport, environment and banking sectors were 
the main areas of the economy to receive additional funding from 
the loans. Many of those applying for the loan money, however, 
were unable to get a share in the funds, as the total investment 
capacity fell about 23 billion kroons short of the amount sought 
by the loan applicants. 
  But the former finance minister also pointed out positive 
changes in the usage of the loan and foreign aid money. He said 
investments and cooperation projects have replaced fuel, 
medicines and cars purchases as the main destination of the loan 
money.

<F P=106> [Leonid Mlechin article: "Other People's Humiliation Is No </F>
Cause for Gloating"] 
  [Text] Expressions of gratification because East Europe 
has been refused admission to NATO must not be overtly cynical. 
  As a matter of fact, in what way is East Europe different 
from West Europe? Back in 1945 it ended up in the Soviet zone 
of influence, deprived of an opportunity for normal development, 
but an event which had fatal consequences for the East Europeans 
occurred even earlier, in August 1939. It was the 
Molotov-Ribbentrop pact with all its secret protocols, which 
divided this part of Europe between the Soviet Union and Germany. 
  This is why two Europes exist. As far as the West Europeans 
are concerned, the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact is just a vague 
memory of the dark past. For the East Europeans, this division 
of the continent was a reality. East Europe can be defined as 
the group of countries which became the objects of trade between 
Moscow and Berlin in 1939. 
  A reduction to the role of historical object leaves deep 
scars, Polish writer Czeslaw Milosz remarked, and calls for 
caution toward the two large neighbors -- Russia and Germany. 
Decades of pain and humiliation -- this is what distinguishes 
the East European countries from those in West Europe. 
  All the arguments cited by Moscow, Washington, or Paris 
against East Europe's inclusion in NATO are sensible and 
rational: "It is not worth investing large sums of money to 
reequip and retrain the East European armies to NATO standards. 
The East Europeans themselves would find it more useful to aim 
for membership of the European Union and worry more about the 
economy than the army. And the main point is this: There is no 
need to antagonize the Russians, many of whom still consider 
NATO to be their enemy...." To put it briefly, a great power 
enjoys some advantages in geopolitics -- people try not to 
insult it unnecessarily. 
  But the perfidious scar of Europe's prewar division has not 
disappeared off the face of the continent. Another question: 
Is it worth the Lithuanians or the Poles exploiting this tragic 
past and exciting anti-Russian feelings in the West now, when 
there are no grounds for it? It is, however, obvious that the 
inbred fear of a fresh division will govern the policy of the 
present and future generations of East Europeans. 
  Historical guilt is a metaphysical term which is rejected by 
many people. But it is, nonetheless, not worth while expressing 
enthusiasm because of NATO's decision and gloating over other 
people's humiliation.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy article: "Partnership for Peace"] </F>
  [Text] Speaking at the NATO session in Brussels, U.S. 
President Bill Clinton set out his "Partnership for Peace" 
program. Approved by the bloc's heads of state and government, 
it is now its official policy. But the program is not only of 
interest and importance to NATO. It speaks of the basis on 
which the NATO countries' new relations with those known in the 
West as the "newly independent states" -- the countries of East 
Europe and the former Soviet republics -- will be built. The 
"partnership" idea has already been discussed for six months, 
but had thus far lacked any "content" -- but the specific 
proposed actions and avenues for cooperation are turning a 
slogan into a program of action and, in this instance, 
cooperation. The picture has now been clarified to a certain 
extent. 
  From the time it was announced as a slogan for future 
partnership between the NATO countries and their former enemies 
in East Europe and the USSR, the central question worrying the 
world public has been the possibility of quantitative growth and 
the expansion of the NATO alliance and its expansion as a 
military-political bloc. There have been stormy debates in the 
European and trans-Atlantic capitals on the pluses and minuses 
of such prospects. This problem has also been actively 
discussed in Russia. 
  We can assume that it was no secret that Washington did not 
immediately reveal the nature of its proposals. It cannot be 
ruled out that the U.S. leadership was launching a trial 
balloon, wanting to see the reaction both from its allies and 
from its future "partners" to its plans, to hear the political 
thunder and lightning about the program (which did indeed occur) 
beforehand and take account of them in President Clinton's 
official report, and only then to firmly state that membership 
of the NATO bloc is not the starting point for the plans to 
build partnership but the ultimate goal. 
  As U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin noted, participation in 
"Partnership for Peace" will not be a clear run [propusk] into 
NATO. It would be more correct to see it as a certain trial 
period, during which current NATO allies will have to be 
convinced of the new partners' reliability, and the latter will 
have to demonstrate the sincerity and practicality of their 
aspirations by their actions (the governments of Poland, the 
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania have 
already stated their aspirations officially, and other East 
European states are also prepared to do so). 
  NATO members intend to organize concrete cooperation with 
each of the applicant states individually. Although the overall 
framework has already been generally defined. This will take 
the form of mutual consultations on military problems, the 
training of military cadres, the embracing of NATO approaches 
and standards in planning and organizing combat training 
measures for troops and staffs, and the holding of joint 
command-staff and field training exercises. 
  "Partnership for Peace" assumes that states seriously aiming 
to join the West will be given the status of so-called associate 
members. This has not been completely defined, but is seen as 
something higher than the status of member of the North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council. At the same time, it differs substantially 
from the position of a full NATO member -- the bloc takes no 
responsibility for the collective defense of partners' 
territories, while nonetheless gaining the right for the NATO 
Joint Armed Forces to assimilate the associate members' 
infrastructures. Each state's contribution to the overall 
peacekeeping effort in situations such as the Yugoslav conflict 
will be taken into consideration. In other words, it is not a 
question of what NATO can do for the new partners, but of what 
the latter can do for the bloc. 
  It is clear from President Clinton's Brussels speech that, 
apart from purely military joint contacts, the partners will 
also have opportunities to organize cooperation in spheres such 
as peacekeeping activity, search and rescue operations, 
humanitarian aid operations, and environmental protection 
efforts. None of these areas is anything new; the first steps 
have already been taken in all of them -- some successful, 
others not very. The alliance's headquarters obviously believes 
that these operations will be more effective and timely under 
NATO rather than UN auspices. 
  Despite the NATO (and, particularly, U.S.) leadership's 
reluctance to accept new members into the bloc in the immediate 
future, the states east of the former "iron curtain," the 
situation within them, and their political policy are at the 
center of attention of Brussels and Washington. As NATO 
Secretary General Manfred Woerner admitted, "it is obvious that 
the United States cannot prosper amid chaos and conflict, and 
the United States needs the alliance as a most important tool 
for exercising American influence and leadership in Europe." 
Needless to say, an expansion of NATO would also mean an 
expansion of America's potential in this sphere. The principles 
on which these ambitions would be realized is another matter. 
  Washington currently admits that it is impossible to allow a 
few of even the best-prepared states into the bloc -- it would 
very much smack of the formation of a some kind of new 
anti-Russian coalition (particularly given the regrettably tense 
relations between Russia and a number of its former allies). It 
would also hardly be sensible to let all comers join NATO at one 
fell swoop -- the sharp growth in numbers without any careful 
qualitative preparation for such a step would essentially 
destroy the bloc and make it an unimportant organ similar to the 
CSCE. The gradual, drawn-out process proposed by Clinton at the 
NATO Brussels session makes it possible to avoid sharp 
confrontation -- above all with Moscow -- although it leaves 
many questions open. 
  One of the most obvious questions, whose dangers we have to 
face even now, is whether the NATO membership will become a kind 
of instrument of blackmail. There is a very great temptation 
(and not everyone is currently capable of resisting it) to use 
the power of "big brother" -- the role which NATO plays -- to 
attempt to pressure the Russian leadership. This may be simpler 
than organizing or, rather, reestablishing a normal working 
dialogue, but it is hardly any more effective. All the more so 
at a time when Russia is building a good and constructive 
relationship with most NATO countries on a bilateral basis and 
gradually at bloc level. 
  Following the official announcement of the "Partnership for 
Peace" program and its adoption by the NATO leadership, we can 
expect efforts to implement it not at a level common to all, but 
in certain areas. During President Clinton's current tour of 
the states of East Europe this will undoubtedly be discussed in 
Prague, Kiev, Minsk, and Moscow. 
  Bill Clinton arrives in the Russian capital 12 January. U.S. 
sources report that no new "historic initiatives" should be 
expected -- the top-level talks will focus on perhaps more 
prosaic but nonetheless extremely important problems. These are 
U.S. support for the reform processes in Russia, and the 
steering of that support toward easing the social tension 
engendered in our country above all by the painfully difficult 
transformations in the economy. The Russian and American 
leaders will also examine how successfully the accords on U.S. 
assistance reached back in Vancouver are being implemented -- 
whether they are working, where the obstructions are if there 
are problems, how to accelerate the transition from fine 
declarations to routine but productive action. 
  In Minsk, Kiev, and Prague the emphasis during talks will be 
different. And this is logical. The same Americans, in the 
words of General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. Joint 
Chiefs of Staff and until recently commander in chief of the 
NATO Allied Armed Forces, clearly see a difference of approach 
to partnership with Russia and, for example, the Czech Republic, 
countries with differing potential, different possibilities, and 
dissimilar starting points. Furthermore, in the last two-three 
years some areas of cooperation have already been mapped out, 
and weak points along this path have also emerged. They need to 
be eliminated on a reciprocal basis. The main point is that 
Russia is ready for equal partnership for the sake of 
strengthening security in Europe and throughout the world. And 
it hopes to be shown the same attitude by our potential allies.

  [Text] Now we have an interview on the eve of an event. 
The first official visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton to 
Russia begins on 12 January. In this connection our commentator 
Lidiya Podolnaya interviewed Aleksandr Bessmertnykh, who made 
the preparations for several summits and took part in them in 
various capacities, including that of USSR foreign minister. 
Aleksandr Aleksandrovich now heads two nongovernmental 
organizations, Russia's Foreign Policy Association and the World 
Council of Ex-Foreign Ministers. Let us hear the conversation. 
  [Begin recording] [Podolnaya] Sensations and some kind of 
breakthrough are always expected of such summit meetings. Are 
there any grounds for expecting something similar from the 
present meeting? 
  [Bessmertnykh] I don't think so -- and that is the good 
thing 
about it. This summit meeting is one of those rare meetings 
which are not overloaded with bureaucratic agenda items. 
Officials tend to delight in talking about the 20-25 odd 
agreements which presidents are going to sign when, sometimes, 
these selfsame presidents have not even set eyes on them. This 
means that the presidents have an opportunity, after making each 
other's acquaintance in Vancouver and, I think, getting to like 
each other, to discuss what kind of Russia Washington wants to 
see in the near future ... 
  [Podolnaya, interrupting] As its partner? 
  [Bessmertnykh] As its partner, and what kind of America 
Moscow would like to see. In other words, the presidents are to 
discuss, for the first time perhaps, a strategically very 
important task: How these two great powers are to live together 
in a changing world. Naturally -- and you are quite right -- 
they must build this concept on the basis of the premise that 
they remain partners, and that they must be partners, but it 
will be very important, I think, for the presidents to strip off 
the declarative veneer of politics, something which was 
achieved, for instance, on Malta, when the presidents of our two 
countries frankly told each other that certain events in Europe, 
the reunification of Germany, the disappearance of the Warsaw 
Pact, the liberation of East Europe, and so on were all possible 
in present circumstances. They should say roughly the same 
things now about the future development of world forces and the 
place of the United States and Russia in this new set-up. 
  [Podolnaya] Security issues usually dominate talks of this 
kind. Of all the questions to be discussed by Clinton and 
Yeltsin, which are the ones which require a quick solution in 
spite of being the most complex and sensitive? 
  [Bessmertnykh] I think that this time security should be 
examined in a slightly different light. In order to study the 
problem of security the two presidents will have to sort out 
questions connected with the two states' own national security. 
Not everything is clear-cut here. There is still quite a lot 
of suspicion, notably among the U.S. political elite. These 
people talk with rather surprising frivolity about the revival 
of Russian imperialism and accuse Yeltsin's Russia of engaging 
in such imperialism. I witnessed this myself during a recent 
visit to the United States. This shows that there is no clear 
understanding of what Russia's vital interests are and what they 
are not. The way in which these vital interests are defended is 
another matter. Our president could well assure his American 
counterpart that this will be done within the framework of 
international law and existing principles governing the conduct 
of great powers, as permanent members of the Security Council. 
After that has been done, it will be easier to talk about what 
is to be done next with nuclear weapons. 
  It is absolutely vital to reach agreement on the 
desirability 
of a further reduction in the level of nuclear armaments. The 
question of how to complete work connected with nuclear 
armaments in the Ukraine is bound to come up, of course, but the 
main topic will, nevertheless, be the subject of European 
security, notably in the context of the fairly lively debate on 
the future of NATO. I think that in this area, too, both sides 
should tell each other fairly clearly what they expect of the 
North Atlantic organization, NATO, and what they expect of the 
future system of European security. Here Russia has its own 
interests and it would be no bad thing if the U.S. leadership 
was made to understand that these Russian interests must be 
respected. But these Russian interests certainly do not 
contradict the tasks of pan-European security. 
  [Podolnaya] On the contrary, the two things actually 
coincide. 
  [Bessmertnykh] They coincide. In practice they complement 
each other. If Russia's security interests are adequately 
safeguarded, one can safely say that pan-European security has a 
chance of surviving. I personally consider that the question of 
NATO membership, expansion of NATO, has been prematurely 
inflated to unbelievable proportions. Nobody in the West really 
wanted to expand this organization by bringing the East and 
Central European states into it. In my view President Yeltsin 
was absolutely right when, on one occasion, he said that Russia 
has no objection, in principle, to certain states joining this 
alliance, but in the first place, Russia's interests plainly 
decree that this process should take a certain period of time. 
Second, the NATO organization must itself be transformed. 
After all, this was something we agreed on. It was agreed that 
NATO would be transformed into an organization more in keeping 
with the present international political and strategic 
situation. So, the Russian interest stipulates that this 
organization should first be transformed and given new functions 
and status. The expansion of this new organization will not 
then be a problem. 
  This range of questions is bound, of course, to be very 
important. Here I would also like to mention the problem of 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The year 1995 is 
approaching. This is the year when the nuclear non-proliferation 
treaty comes up for renewal. I think that, as before, the 
United States and Russia should stand side by side on this 
question, coordinating all their actions in perfect harmony.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>
  [Text] The brief stop at Kiev's airport to be made by 
President Bill Clinton on his way to Moscow will mean a gesture 
of good will and a kind of reward for the compromise reached at 
the Russian-American-Ukrainian consultations held in Washington 
recently, a high-ranking official from Russia's Foreign Ministry 
told Interfax on Tuesday. 
  According to him, participants in the consultations agreed 
in 
principle that the nuclear arms deployed in Ukraine will be 
removed to Russia in exchange for compensation from Moscow. 
This circumstance made it possible to conduct a meeting between 
the Russian, American, and Ukrainian presidents on January 14 
within the framework of the upcoming Russian-American summit. 
  According to the ministry official, the plan worked out in 
Washington envisages that the nuclear arms to be removed from 
Ukraine will be deconcentrated in Russia. "Russian specialists 
will deconcentrate the enriched uranium of nuclear warheads, 
that is bring it to the level of uranium used as fuel," he said. 
  "Russia will sell that fuel to the Americans, who are in 
control of almost all uranium markets. In addition, part of 
that uranium will be supplied to Ukraine as fuel for its nuclear 
power plants. In other words, Ukraine will get some compensation 
for the nuclear arms to be removed from its territory." 
  This plan, the Russian diplomat pointed out, will be 
reflected in a special statement and a memorandum to be issued 
after the proposed meeting between the Russian, American, and 
Ukrainian presidents in Moscow. "This plan is to be 
supplemented with concrete figures, calculations, etc. But this 
is a purely technical issue to be resolved after the Moscow 
summit in the process of negotiations," he said. 
  According to him, "it is essential that in Moscow Ukraine 
will indicate the exact date when no nuclear weapons will be 
left on its soil." The date in question will be known only by 
January 14, since the relevant negotiations are continuing. 
Nevertheless, this circumstance prompted the U.S. president to 
make changes in the itinerary of his trip," he said. 
  According to preliminary plans, the official noted, in the 
course of his European tour President Clinton was to visit 
officially not only Moscow and Minsk, but also Kiev. "However, 
Ukraine's 'nuclear drift' and the Ukrainian parliament's failure 
to ratify the START-I treaty and the Lisbon Protocol to it in 
full (IF note: START-I was ratified, with numerous 
reservations, along with the Lisbon Protocol with the exception 
of Article 5, which obliged Ukraine to join the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty as a denuclearized state) nudged the 
Americans toward striking Kiev off their list. After the 
consultations in Washington the stick was replaced by a carrot - 
Bill Clinton will make a stop at Kiev's airport, if only for an 
hour," he said. 
  According to the information available to Interfax, the 
program for the American president's state visit to Moscow has 
been fully coordinated; it will be published on Wednesday. 
However some details of the program became known to Interfax. 
  Bill Clinton is expected to arrive in Moscow Wednesday 
evening (at about 22:00). 
  He will not be accompanied by his wife; he will stay at the 
Radisson-Slavyanskaya Hotel. However on January 14, when 
Clinton's wife, Hillary, arrives in Moscow, the couple will move 
to the Kremlin, where the official residence of the American 
leader will be located. 
  Russian-American top-level talks are scheduled for January 
13 
and 14. In addition, on January 14 the Russian and American 
presidents will be joined by their Ukrainian counterpart. 
  In the evening of January 14, Yeltsin and Clinton are 
expected to give a news conference. 
  In the morning of January 15, after the farewell ceremony to 
be held in the Kremlin, the U.S. president will leave for Minsk 
to hold talks with the leadership of Belarus.

  [Text] The leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who also heads his party group in the 
State Duma, has described the coming visit of President Bill 
Clinton to Moscow as unnecessary and useless. In his opinion 
the visit discredits Clinton because "Russians are going to see 
he has come to support a team of bankers -- the Gaydar 
government." 
  In Tuesday interview with INTERFAX Zhirinovskiy called the 
refusal of the American president to meet him a mistake. At the 
same time Zhirinovskiy is grateful for the refusal because this 
"gave credit to the leader of Liberal Democrats and added votes." 
  "Russians know that all this disarray was organized from the 
West, it was mostly Americans who helped our Democratic Russia 
to undermine the country," Zhirinovskiy declared. This refusal 
"indicates that I am the only honest and clean politician 
because the person who helps to undermine the country does not 
want to meet me". 
  A leading figure in the Communist group in the State Duma 
Victor Ilyukhin does not attach any hopes to the Clinton visit. 
"America has never wanted and will never want Russia to be a 
strong power, the main purpose of the United States is to split 
Russia and get free access to its energy resources", he told 
INTERFAX on Tuesday. 
  Ilyukhin feels that lately Russia "has involuntarily stopped 
planning its home and foreign policies and has been living on 
hints from the United States." He attributed the coming visit 
to the need "to support the Russian president and government" 
after the December elections that demonstrated, in his opinion, 
that "the situation has notably changed to the disadvantage of 
the ruling regime." 
  A leading figure in another parliamentary group Grigoriy 
Yavlinskiy does not expect anything special and thinks the visit 
will be simply a pleasant exchange of opinions between the two 
presidents. 
  Neither does the leader of the Democratic Party Nikolay 
Travkin believe that the United States can help Russia in any 
way. If Russia were recognized as an equal partner in politics 
and economy, this would help Russia best. "We do not need any 
tips," Travkin thinks. 
  A member of the presidential council Andranik Migranian has 
told journalists that President Clinton is going to make a 
mistake if he selects the participants for his meeting with the 
leaders of political parties and groups. If Clinton simply 
refuses to meet Zhirinovskiy, the advisor does not see a great 
problem in that. However, if he refuses to meet other opposition 
groups too, this will give the opposition another pretext to 
criticize democratic parties for their excessively close ties 
with the United States.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Polyakov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS -- As Clinton moves from 
Western to Eastern Europe, the leaders of former Soviet 
republics - Russia, Ukraine and Belarus - are preparing for his 
visit by comparing noted and making last-minute moves ahead of 
the arrival of the American President on the former Soviet 
territory. 
  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk is the first to meet the 
U.S. President during a brief stop-over in Kiev's Borispol 
airport on Wednesday. 
  The brief exchange between the U.S. and Ukrainian presidents 
in Kiev is expected to set the tone for the tripartite summit in 
Moscow on January 14, in which Clinton, Yeltsin and Kravchuk 
hope to discuss and sign documents which will ease relations 
between these three countries complicated by Ukraine's stance on 
the nuclear weapons deployed on its territory. Incidentally, 
Yeltsin had to issue a formal invitation to Kravchuk to arrive 
in the Russian capital, whereas a short time ago a telephone 
message was sufficient to bring former leaders of any of the 
Soviet republic to the USSR capital. 
  Meanwhile, Belarusian Leader Stanislav Shushkevich has 
already arrived in Moscow for talks with President Yeltsin. 
Although a report from Minsk says the visit is mainly due to 
concentrate on bilateral relations between Russia and Belarus, 
the two leaders will pay no less attention to comparing their 
strategic notes and coordinating positions with a view to the 
U.S. President's visit to Moscow which is due to begin later on 
Wednesday. 
  Russia, Ukraine and Belarus were the first to sign an 
agreement in December 1990 which put an effective end to the 
Soviet Union and initiated the creation of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States, which most of the other former Soviet 
republics, except for the Baltic countries, joined thereafter. 
However, frictions continued to exist between the three Slav 
countries, the former Soviet nuclear weapons being one of the 
points of contention. 
  Another debatable point is these countries' differing 
attitudes to NATO's proposed extension to the east. 
  It can be surmised with a considerable degree of certainty 
that these issues will feature prominently both in bilateral 
talks between Yeltsin and Clinton and particularly in the 
tripartite summit in which Yeltsin, Clinton and Kravchuk will 
seek to come to terms on these pressing questions.

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Popov article: "A New Partnership? What </F>
Political Baggage the U.S. President Is Bringing With Him to 
Russia"] 
  [Text] For some time now summits, as these top-level 
meetings are traditionally called, have been an inexhaustible 
source of inspiration for caricaturists. In fact cartoonists 
started mining this vein of gold well before the era of 
Gorbachevian perestroyka, back in the days when the Soviet Union 
still existed as one of the two superpowers. Our editorial 
files contain a copy of the American magazine NEWSWEEK which 
carried items about two interlinked events. The magazine 
announced the election of RSFSR Supreme Soviet Chairman B.N. 
Yeltsin, calling him a "talented demagogue." Alongside this 
report, a column of humorous remarks opens with a comment from 
Gorbachev which he let drop in a conversation with some 
Americans on a Washington street: "I really feel at home here!" 
  Alas, they were already openly mocking us, enjoying the joke 
to the full and rubbing their tummies with glee. But what can 
we say now about these so-called summits?! 
  On the eve of the Clinton-Yeltsin meeting scheduled for 
12-15 
January, the British newspaper THE TIMES took the liberty of 
giving the U.S. President a few practical recommendations. THE 
TIMES believes that it is pointless for the West to be soft on 
Russia and try to "placate" Yeltsin since "Russia is no longer a 
superpower or an equal partner, and Yeltsin," THE TIMES claims, 
"is a caricature rather than a politician." Therefore, it says, 
Clinton, who is well known for wanting to please everybody, 
might not on this occasion demonstrate this trait in his 
character because "he should not refuse to be confrontational 
toward Russia." Needless to say, THE TIMES reasons, Russia will 
not like the U.S. position, particularly on such a sore point as 
the enlargement of NATO through the addition of Russia's former 
Warsaw Pact partners, the East and Central European countries, 
but "in the final analysis that is Russia's business." 
  We do not know whether Clinton will heed this advice, but 
this is what Vice President Al Gore stated the other day on his 
behalf: "The United States resolutely supports plans to bring 
NATO and East Europe closer together." 
  The traditional list of questions on the agenda of the 
Gorbachev era -- "bread, milk, flour, etc." -- will naturally 
still receive emphasis, but the topic of using Western loans to 
support reform has long set teeth on edge, and it is now totally 
clear that America is at best prepared only to make gestures 
involving charitable aid, and even this is limited to gestures 
that will yield greater dividends on the purely propaganda level. 
  House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, the U.S. Moscow 
Embassy information bulletin reported, has delivered a very 
emotional report entitled "New Partnership: Relations Between 
the United States, Russia, and the New Independent States." The 
report contains a passage about the congressman's personal 
impressions of Moscow, which are capable of wringing tears even 
from people with hearts of stone: "...The price of bread has 
risen from 10 kopeks to 40 rubles [R], i.e. by 4,000 percent. 
Even though shelves in stores are full, by no means everybody 
can afford these goods.... On one of the central streets of 
Moscow three wretched children with sad faces sat begging -- 
their dirty, skinny hands in torn gloves stretched toward me 
brought to mind the era of Charles Dickens." 
  We must suppose that attempts will be made to shield Bill 
Clinton from this sort of distressing encounter on the Moscow 
streets. Moreover, the Missouri Democrat's news about the price 
of Russian bread is already relatively stale -- these days, 
alas, Russians can only dream about loaves costing R40; they now 
cost approximately R300. But if such an encounter were to take 
place, how could the U.S. President comfort the child beggars? 
THE WASHINGTON POST has reported that Clinton intends not to 
increase, but on the contrary to cut aid to foreign states. 
  Nevertheless we may assume that Clinton will not leave B.N. 
Yeltsin without any support whatsoever; Yeltsin is the man whom 
the U.S. President once enthusiastically called "our guy!" Many 
things have bound Clinton and Yeltsin together closely, 
particularly during the past year, marked by bloody events. On 
the eve of the U.S. President's visit to Moscow it is 
appropriate to remind readers that this trip could have taken 
place last year -- immediately after the declaration of special 
rule in Russia. At the time the U.S. Government circulated the 
transcript of a Clinton news conference held 23 March 1993. Let 
us cite some excerpts from this document: 
  Question. Don't you think your visit to Moscow could drag 
the United States too deeply into the power struggle in the 
(Russian) capital? 
  Answer. I would like to go to the meeting with an 
"aggressive" and very specific U.S. aid plan.... 
  Question. What policy will the United States opt for if the 
Soviet legislators vote to impeach President Yeltsin, which 
looks extremely likely? Will you continue to regard Yeltsin as 
the legitimately elected leader of Russia? 
  Answer. Today that is precisely how I see him. He is the 
only (nationally) elected figure. The rest take their cue from 
a Constitution adopted in the Communist era. Right now I do not 
wish to consider other possible responses.... 
  However, additional information about these "other possible 
responses" was then supplied on the pages of THE NEW YORK TIMES 
by a ranking White House Administration spokesman who wished to 
remain anonymous. He implied that the United States would 
resolutely support Yeltsin if he assumed emergency powers: "If 
Yeltsin suspends the activity of the undemocratic parliament, 
this will not necessarily be an undemocratic act." And so in 
October the U.S. Administration unconditionally approved of 
Yeltsin's order to open fire. At the same time it is still not 
entirely clear: Was the administration merely an indirect party 
to this command, whereupon the whole world looked on, stunned, 
as tanks opened fire on the Russian parliament?! One thing 
cannot be doubted: The Russian president is not the only person 
whom the events of September-October 1993 will come back to 
haunt. 
  On the eve of Clinton's arrival in Moscow, the British 
newspaper THE DAILY TELEGRAPH quoted some spiteful words by 
Zhirinovskiy. In response to the U.S. President's refusal to 
meet with him in Moscow, the leader of the Liberal Democratic 
Party called Clinton a coward and advised him to "stay at home 
and play his saxophone." 
  It is, incidentally, entirely possible that Clinton will 
bring his saxophone with him, but the question of what else he 
will be carrying in his Moscow baggage remains open at the 
present time....

<F P=106> [Melor Sturua report: "Any President Needs a Devil's </F>
Advocate"] 
  [Text] Minneapolis -- On the eve of his departure for West 
Europe and Russia President Clinton met with a group of 
political observers. The discussion was not only interesting 
but instructive, since it touched not only on the essence but 
the psychology of the problems which Clinton will encounter in 
the course of his visit. 
  NEW YORK TIMES observer William Safire asked Clinton whether 
there is anyone within his administration with a view different 
from the Clinton-Christopher-Talbott line. In particular, is 
there anyone who would dare say this to the White House 
incumbent -- if you do not accept the East European countries 
into NATO now, when Russia is weak, you will never be able to do 
so when Russia is strong again. 
  Clinton's reply was very laconic -- nobody in my 
administration holds such a view. 
  Justifying this policy, Clinton described himself as a 
"force 
for optimism," particularly as regards Russia's future. "I 
believe," he said, "that if they continue as a democratic, 
market-oriented, reformist, noninterventionist nation, they will 
become a great power in the traditional sense of the word, and 
not an empire.... The whole history, character, and texture of 
Russia confirms this." 
  Unfortunately, the whole history, character, and texture of 
Russia not only do not confirm this but resolutely refute it. 
President Clinton's above statement demonstrates the danger 
posed by the absence of a "devil's advocate" among his foreign 
policy advisers on Russia -- someone who could somehow balance 
the influence exerted by the former TIME observer, translator of 
Khrushchev's memoirs, and friend from Clinton's Oxford student 
days. 
  It would be interesting to know whether there is a "devil's 
advocate" in President Yeltsin's entourage who, despite official 
policy, would recommend that he not prevent the East European 
countries from joining NATO. Speaking purely logically, there 
clearly is such an adviser in the Kremlin or close to it. After 
all, somebody prepared Boris Yeltsin's famous visit to the East 
European capitals, his meetings, and the texts of the speeches 
in which the Russian president by no means objected to his 
hospitable hosts joining NATO. 
  Of course, it is possible to cite changed circumstances 
since 
then -- currently defined in both Russia and the West by the 
single code word "Zhirinovskiy." Admittedly, everyone deciphers 
that code in their own way. Moscow claims that expanding NATO 
to cover East Europe would merely be grist to the mill of the 
ultraright-wingers and fascists, resurrecting the dark shadows 
of the policy of containment and even roll-back. Roughly 
similar arguments are being used in Washington, which has 
invented the elastic "Partnership for Peace" formula. Whereas 
the East European capitals, on the contrary, see the 
Zhirinovskiy factor as an argument in favor of NATO membership. 
  There is no room in this report to provide the extensive 
arguments in favor of each approach. I believe that right is on 
the side of Walesa and Havel rather than Yeltsin and Clinton -- 
and that it is reinforced by the whole history, character, and 
texture of postwar international development. It is hard even 
to imagine where Yalta would have led had NATO not negated its 
effects. Of course, Yeltsin's Russia is not Stalin's Soviet 
Union. But NATO membership for the East European countries 
would make this transformation even more decisive, if not 
irreversible. 
  One more point. Which is more important for peace in Europe 
-- Poland or Portugal, the Czech Republic or Greece? Hypocrisy 
dictates the reply that they are all important in their own way. 
Real politics and history -- with its rich texture -- tell us 
something else. But the fact is that, as was the case before 
World War II, the United States is not sufficiently mature in 
moral terms to fight for Warsaw or Prague even hypothetically. 
(All the more so in the nuclear era). But it was this 
reluctance to fight that was one of the main reasons why it 
ultimately proved necessary to fight. 
  Oscar Wilde claims in one of his famous paradoxes that the 
best way to avoid temptation is to give in to it. In politics 
such paradoxes can be catastrophic. In politics it is better 
not to tempt fate, but to put the tempters in their place from 
the very outset. Whatever they may be called -- Hitler or 
Zhirinovskiy. After all, Clinton is essentially not making a 
concession to Yeltsin but placating Zhirinovskiy. At any event, 
Vladimir Volfovich is entirely capable of drawing this 
interpretation from Clinton's "Partnership for Peace" lifesaver. 
Any concession which Clinton makes or will make to Yeltsin in 
this area strengthens both objectively and subjectively not the 
Russian president but his neofascist opponent.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Dolgopolov report: "Bill Will Carry Off No </F>
Surprises"] 
  [Text] Clinton lands at Vnukovo-2 airport at 2235 today. 
Early in the morning of 13 January the president has a 
one-on-one meeting with B.N. Yeltsin in St. George's Hall, then 
a walk around the Kremlin in the company of the Russian 
president, talks, talks...and a meeting with the patriarch, and 
in the evening a trip to Ogarevo, where he will be given supper 
at Yeltsin's residence. In the morning of 14 January, after 
laying the traditional wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown 
Soldier, Clinton will set off for a far from traditional 
tripartite meeting. His interlocutors will be two presidents: 
the Russian and the Ukrainian, Leonid Kravchuk. By all 
appearances, without quoting anyone, from this meeting 
unexpectedly great things can be expected. Let us call it a 
"breakthrough" beforehand. So Ukraine will acquire nuclear-free 
status and become a nonnuclear state. That would seem well and 
truly to put an end to a highly complex problem which, it has 
now emerged, three countries have been working energetically and 
without publicity to resolve. 
  No more sensations can really be expected. Except that we 
are all to have a personal meeting with Bill Clinton on 
"Ostankino" on 14 January at around 1530 (keep an eye on the TV 
schedules). The president, in his customary manner, will not 
address the audience of young people that has been assembled for 
him, but will conduct an easy and elegant Clintonian dialogue 
with them. 
  And so the collection of documents that is customary in 
these 
cases will be adopted and signed. A declaration, known, 
naturally, as the "Moscow" declaration, is bound to be chief 
among them. Its most important component is that the two 
presidents signing it will note that relations between Russia 
and the United States have entered the stage of mature 
partnership. 
  What else is there of interest in connection with the summit 
-- sorry, the official meeting? They will announce the demise 
of COCOM [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export 
Controls], which will come to an end in March, and the formation 
of a new monitoring organization in its place, in which Russia's 
rights are admittedly not fully defined. Most likely the total 
sum of U.S. aid, or rather, assistance, will be $2 billion a 
year. Russia will presumably put forward an unusual initiative 
on the formation of joint armed forces with the States, under UN 
auspices. At least, this matter has apparently been agreed at 
the top Russian military level. On our part, we are prepared to 
assign the 27th Motorized Infantry Division, with the 3d 
Infantry Division on the U.S. side. 
  And in conclusion, for those who were expecting political 
sensations in connection with the unexpected -- for the 
Americans -- outcome of our elections: Although Clinton's very 
busy schedule allows time for a few events that are not 
indicated in the program, the president certainly will not meet 
with Zhirinovskiy. 
  The scene of departure from Moscow for Minsk will be played 
out at Vnukovo, at 1015 on 15 January.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>
  [Text] "The Americans would never conduct in their own 
country reforms of the kind launched in Russia in 1992. 
Zhirinovskiy's godfathers are Gaydar, the International 
Monetary Fund, and monetarists of the Geoffrey Sachs type." 
This view was expressed in an interview with Interfax by the 
Director of the Institute for U.S. and Canadian Studies, Dr. 
Georgiy Arbatov. 
  According to Arbatov, he fears that during his visit to 
Moscow U.S. President Bill Clinton may fail to realize the need 
for "great changes in Russia's economic and social policy that 
could lead the country toward stabilization." Such changes 
alone are capable of turning Russia into a "normal country 
posing no threat to the rest of the world," Arbatov said. 
  According to him, stability in Russia did not increase after 
December's parliamentary elections. On the whole, he said, the 
"shock therapy" hit science, culture, education and health 
service most of all. "A horrible de-intellectualization of 
society" is in evidence. "Gaydar-style reforms are a road to 
the third world. Many people, and not only in this country, 
began to realize this after the success scored by Zhirinovskiy," 
Arbatov declared. 
  He believes that "Russia must rely primarily on its own 
strength." "As a matter of fact, the Americans have never given 
us tangible material aid, but they did us a disservice by 
recommending Gaydar-style reforms - the 'shock therapy'. The 
greatest aid they can give us is to stop giving bad advice," Dr. 
Arbatov said. 
  Arbatov said he hopes that after his visit to Moscow the 
U.S. 
president will acquire "a new insight into Russia's economic 
problems and tasks." "I would be very glad if precisely this 
happened," he said. 
  According to Arbatov, Russian-American relations today can 
be 
described as "normal on the whole." "There are neither serious 
breakthroughs, nor sharp deteriorations in them. When the 'cold 
war' ended, Russian-American summits lost their dramatism. It's 
obvious that such summits will become routine with the passage 
of time," he concluded.

  [Text] Moscow, January 11 (TASS) -- Russia and the United 
States of America are planning to hold a joint conference on 
environmental protection in 1994. An initiative belongs to the 
Russian Space agency and the CIA. 
  The Russian Ministry of Ecology also has shown interest in 
taking part in the conferenc. Its experts believe that the 
forum will draft joint scientific approaches towards ecological 
problems. The two countries should coordinate methods and 
instruments for estimating the state of the environment, norms 
of top permissible concentrations of pollution, levels of 
radiation, noise, vibrations, magnetic field and other 
hazardious factors. 
  One of the tasks of the forthcoming conference is supposed 
to 
be the development of joint decisions on environment monitoring 
from the space, especially of the arears of nuclear power plants 
and other dangerous objects.

  [Text] Moscow January 11 TASS -- The last American credits 
for purchasing grain have been used up. On behalf of the 
Russian Government the Exportkhleb Foreign-Trade Association has 
purchased in the United States and delivered to Russia about 2.7 
million tonnes of grain and 650,000 of soya grist. This means 
that the programme, dubbed in the United States as "food for 
progress," has been fulfilled. 
  Exportkhleb President Aleksandr Belik told ITAR-TASS that 
this credit was quite advantageous for Russia. It was granted 
for a period of 15 years. Repayment by instalments is to begin 
within 7 years from now. 
  All in all, Russia has purchased abroad, according to Belik, 
about 10.5 million tonnes of grain. Although purchases were 
made also in other Western countries, the United States has 
remained Russia's main supplier, as in many previous years. 
  Does Russia's intention to cut grain imports signify its 
desire to curtail cooperation with American agro-industrial 
firms? Belik believes that the possible area of such 
cooperation is sufficiently broad. He noted that Russia, no 
matter what efforts it exerts, will not be able to satisfy all 
its requirements in soya, maize, seeds, and fodder additives. 
The purchases will not be as impressive as they had been, but 
they are unavoidable. Therefore, Exportkhleb does not plan to 
interrupt its contacts. 
  "American grain farms are now experiencing some 
difficulties," Belik said. "The situation is better at farms 
that have gone over in proper time to the processing of grain 
into fodder, that have obtained a foothold in the food and 
processing industry. Why shouldn't we cooperate with them in 
the building of soya-processing complexes, combined fodder 
factories, and port elevators in Russia? The summer sales of 
ready goods is ending and we are trying to convince our American 
partners that investment ventures will lay the foundation for 
futue broad cooperation. As to Exportkhleb, it knows our 
market, its requirements and possibilities, and is ready to 
discuss various versions of cooperation, crediting, settlements 
and other terms meeting the interests of all the partners 
involved."

  [Text] The director general of the State Space Research 
and Industrial Center named after Khrunichev, member of the 
board of directors of the US-Russian joint venture 
"Lockheed-Khrunichev- Energiya" Anatoliy Kiselev said they had 
managed to conclude 9 commercial contracts on launching 
satellites for western companies using the Russian "Proton" 
booster over 12 months, thanks to the cooperation with 
"Lockheed." The contracts' total value is over $6000 million. 
  Kiselev told Interfax today that the deals envisioned 
launching the 21st low-orbit satellite within the framework of 
the global telecommunications system "Iridium" designed by the 
American "Motorola," one of the satellites of the third series 
of the international consortium INMARSAT, another one of the 
American company Loral, etc. 
  Kiselev pointed out that the cooperation with Lockheed and 
signing the deals was possible only thanks to the Russian 
government's decision to join the system of international 
control of non-proliferation of missile technologies. At the 
moment, Russia does not have deals running counter to this 
treaty. 
  According to Kiselev, the year of cooperation with American 
partners who took up marketing the most powerful Russian booster 
ever used and licensing satellites manufactured by western 
companies enabled the Russian Space and Missiles Center to pack 
up the program of commercial launches up to 2000 and look into 
the future with optimism.

  [Text] The governments of the United States and the 
Russian Federation have reached agreement on the provision to 
Russia of a nonreturnable subsidy of $125 million for the 
implementation of a program for the import of energy-saving and 
nature protection equipment and materials. This is being done 
within the framework of cooperation between the Russian 
Federation and the United States in the sphere of the power 
industry and environmental protection. The program is being 
funded by the United States in stages beginning with a 
nonreturnable subsidy of $10 million which will be distributed 
by the Russian Federation Government between the state and 
private sectors of the Russian economy to finance the import of 
equipment, materials, and services. 
  The minimum value of a deal for the acquisition of materials 
and equipment (the supplier in the United States will be 
selected on a competitive basis) is $100,000 and the financial 
resources in question will not be subject to taxation or customs 
duties. 
  Those components of the state and private sectors in the 
Russian Federation interested in obtaining such a subsidy must 
submit their applications to the Russian-American joint council 
created to oversee the general direction of the program under 
the auspices of the Russian Federation Government's Commission 
on Questions of International Humanitarian and Technical 
Assistance.

  [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS -- The Russian Foreign 
Ministry and the U.S. State Department have exchanged notes on 
the facilitation of the existing visa-issuing procedures, the 
Consular Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry reported 
today. 
  The exchange of notes came as a result of the implementation 
of agreements concluded at the Russo-American summit in 
Vancouver last April. It is intended to officially assert the 
high level of mutual understanding between Russia and the United 
states in the sphere of consular relations, to systematise and 
facilitate to the maximum all the visa formalities, and also to 
eliminate obsolete provisions which are ineffective and 
contradict the current spirit of cooperation. 
  The agreement is based on the principle of issuing multiple 
visas for terms ranging from one to two years to a considerable 
share of the citizens of both countries. This refers primarily 
to participants of various exchanges in the sphere of science 
and education, officials of joint Russo-American organisations, 
companies and banks, businessmen, and also certain categories of 
officials of state institutions, making official trips. 
  This agreement, which will take effect as of January 15, 
1994, cogs in with the relations of partnership and cooperation, 
typical for current Russo-American relations, and pursues the 
purpose of further promoting political, commercial, economic, 
scientific, and technological cooperation, expanding contacts 
among people and between the public organisations of the Russian 
Federation and the United States, the report of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry's Consular Department notes.

today, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Stanislav 
Shushkevich, chairman of the Belarus Supreme Soviet came to the 
conviction that it is necessary to draw up a new interstate 
Russian-Belarus treaty on friendship and cooperation, which 
would be in line with Russia's and Belarus' desire to build 
democratic states with a socially-oriented market economy, and 
with the historically special level of economic, political, and 
human relations between the two countries. This message is 
contained in the communique released by the Russian president's 
press service.

conducted at the meeting. Issues of economic cooperation were 
the focus of attention. Other questions of bilateral relations 
were also discussed, the document notes. 
  The two sides have exchanged opinions in connection with the 
forthcoming visits to Moscow and Minsk by U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, the communique notes. It has been noted that in the 
process of building economic relations with the United States, 
it is time to go from aid programs to programs of assistance in 
trade and investments as the main proviso of economic 
development and market integration of CIS countries' economies 
in the world economy.

  [Text] In connection with the incident in Riga, the 
Information and Press Directorate of the Russian Federation 
Defense Ministry has circulated a statement that states 
specifically: 
  On the morning of 10 January, an armed group of Latvian 
militia seized several buildings belonging to the North Western 
Group of Forces in a suburb of Riga. In response to a demand 
that the seized installations be vacated, the chairman of the 
suburb of Vidzeme gave the command to arrest the generals who 
had arrived at the scene. The Russian generals were handcuffed 
and put in a car that drove off toward the Russian border. 
Colonel General Mayorov, the commander of the North Western 
Group of Forces, informed the Russian defense minister of the 
incident. Army General Pavel Grachev, the defense minister, 
gave the order to put Russian troops stationed in Latvia on 
alert and to step up the guarding of installations and 
buildings. The men and materiel of the airborne assault troops 
and military transport aircraft were also put on alert. The 
commander informed President Ulmanis of Latvia of the incident, 
and he gave the order to free those arrested and issued an 
apology. The Russian generals and all the installations seized 
were freed. 
  The Defense Ministry of Russia demands an immediate 
investigation and that the culprits be punished.

  [Text] There was no danger of an incursion by Russian 
troops into Latvia in connection with the arrest of two Russian 
generals there, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Krylov told 
INTERFAX on Tuesday [11 January]. 
  The Russian troops stationed in Latvia went on higher alert 
in connection with the incident, but they neither left the 
places of their deployment nor launched any aggressive actions, 
he pointed out. 
  As INTERFAX already reported, Monday morning groups of armed 
Latvian militiamen seized several installations belonging to the 
North-Western Group of Russian Troops. The two Russian generals 
who came to the locality were arrested on instruction from the 
head of the administration of a Riga district. Only when 
President Guntis Ulmanis intervened and presented his apologies, 
the Russian generals were released and the invaded installations 
were freed. 
  According to Krylov, this "gross and unprecedented action 
was 
probably designed to provoke Russia to take retaliatory 
measures." "The saddest thing is that it was launched at a time 
when progress was being made at the Russian-Latvian talks in 
Riga in regard to the key aspects concerning the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Latvia," he noted.

that happened with Russian military and diplomats in Riga 
January 10. 
  Latvian volunteers blocked several buildings belonging to

several hours and showed a disgusting approach to the Russian 
Ambassador in Latvia. 
  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has ordered that the 
Russian military transport planes, paratroopers and pilots in 
the republic be put to combat alert owing to the events in the 
Latvian capital. 
  Kostikov has told reporters in Moscow Tuesday that should 
similar incidents repeat, the reaction of the president and 
Russia would be tougher, I would say very tough taking into 
account the world precedents.

  [Text] Russia is ready to reduce the term of the temporary 
operation of its early warning radar station in Skrunda, Latvia 
from 6 to 5 years. This was reported to Interfax on Tuesday [11 
January] by the head of the Russian delegation to a Riga 
conference of Russian and Latvian officials Sergey Zotov. He 
said the Latvian side was offered a new Russian draft agreement 
on the temporary status of the strategic facility. He stressed 
that the indicates Russia is trying to meet the Latvian side 
halfway. 
  As we have reported one of Russia's conditions for the 
withdrawal of its remaining 13,000 troops by August 31 is the 
right to control the radar station in Skrunda for several years. 
Latvia has agreed to that in principle, but finds it necessary 
to reduce the length of this period. 
  The conference in Riga is expected to continue on Wednesday 
and the discussion of the draft agreement on the radar station 
to continue during the coming round of talks in Moscow later 
this month. 
  Sergey Zotov described the Monday incident involving the 
Russian military and Russian army facilities as a crude 
provocation of extremist and nationalist forces aimed at 
torpedoing bilateral talks as well as a test of Russia's force, 
its ability to protect its facilities. 
  Zotov thinks the incident should prompt the West to conclude 
that Latvia is an unreliable partner. 
  Before the meeting Sergey Zotov protested against the 
incident to the head of the Latvian delegation Martins Virsis 
and demanded a full investigation of thee incident and 
punishment for those responsible.

  [Text] Many people were alarmed by yesterday's report from 
Latvia about provocative actions by the local authorities 
against two Russian generals. In this connection, various 
points of view have appeared. Incidentally, Latvian Foreign 
Minister Georgs Andrejevs stated that an armed conflict was a 
possibility. How is this assessed by the Russian Defense 
Ministry? We have contacted Yelena Agapova, the press secretary 
of the head of the Russian military department, over the phone. 
  [Begin Agapova recording] First of all, I would like to 
recall how these unprecedented events developed. In the morning 
on 10 January in a suburb of Riga, armed groups of the Latvian 
home guard seized the House of Officers, the billeting and 
operating unit, a hotel, and a number of other installations 
that belong to the Northwestern Group of Forces. Major General 
Nikolay Taylakov, the deputy commander of the Northwestern Group 
of Forces, and Major General Aleksandr Vodopyanov, the 
commander's aide for work with personnel, immediately arrived at 
the scene of the incident. When they demanded that the 
facilities seized be surrended, the chairman of the Vidzeme 
district commanded that the generals should be arrested. Highly 
unprecedented and most unceremonious actions were used against 
them. I would call them humiliating actions. They were 
handcuffed and put in a car, which was driven toward the Russian 
border. 
  Naturally, Colonel General Mayorov, the commander of the 
Northwestern Group of Forces, informed Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Sergeyevich Grachev. The minister ordered that all 
Russian troops stationed in Latvia should be put on a state of 
operational readiness and that the protection of installations 
and buildings belonging to the Northwestern Group of Forces 
should be stepped up. The forces and equipment of the airborne 
troops were also put on combat readiness. These include the 
famous Pskov division and also units of the military transport 
aviation. 
  The commander of the Northwesten Group of Forces also 
informed Latvian President Ulmanis about what had happened. 
During a meeting with the commander, Ulmanis expressed 
bewilderment as to what had happened, gave instructions that 
those arrested should be released, and conveyed his apologies. 
Yesterday by 1700 hours the Russian generals and all the 
occupied facilities had been surrended. 
  In connection with this, the Russian Defense Ministry is 
demanding that an immediate investigation should be carried out 
and those responsible for what happened punished. The Russian 
Defense Ministry believes any violent and illegal acts, like 
those we are now speaking about, against Russian servicemen, 
military units, or installations of Russian troops will be 
halted in a most decisive manner. [end recording] 
  We also asked Yelena Agapova how the Defense Ministry sees 
the reasons for this most blatant provocation against Russian 
servicemen. As far as we remember, things like this have 
happened more than once. 
  [Begin Agapova recording] To our great misfortune, this is 
not the first instance. On 27 November the Latvian home guard 
stopped an UAZ vehicle. Threatening with weapons, they brought 
the vehicle and a driver to the headquarters of the Latvian home 
guard battalion, where a radio station from the vehicle was 
dismantled. 
  On 14 December in the region of Plavinas, unknown persons in 
a car fired from small-caliber weapons on a courier and postal 
communications vehicle. The latter was carrying correspondence 
from Riga. 
  All this simply indicates that certain political forces are 
constantly trying to create a tense and nervous atmosphere 
around Russian troops and thus, have an effect on both the 
deadlines for the withdrawal and on the progress of the talks, 
and, in so doing, to acquire certain political capital. 
Unfortunately, all such attempts cast a cloud over the 
relations between the two states and do not help the 
establishing of good-neighborly relations. [end recording] 
  It is understandable that the Defense Ministry is 
attentively 
observing the state of troops stationed in the Baltics. What is 
the morale of these troops like? What are they ready for? 
  [Begin Agapova recording] The Russian troops stationed on 
the territory of Latvia maintain calmness and restraint and, in 
the event of a situation like this recurring, they are ready to 
take adequate measures. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report based on INTERFAX and POSTFACTUM </F>
materials in the "Demarche" column: "It Has Been Decided To 
Consider the Incident in Riga as an Extremist Provocation. 
Talks on Troop Withdrawal Have Been Resumed"] 
  [Text] According to the Baltic News Service, President 
Yeltsin "does not intend to react officially" to the 10 January 
incident in Latvia. Nonetheless yesterday the Russian 
president's press secretary Kostikov came out with a sharp 
statement on this score. In the future Russia will take into 
account the "U.S. experience" of reacting in similar situations, 
Vyacheslav Kostikov said. In the press secretary's opinion, 
should such excesses be repeated, "the reaction by the president 
and Russia may be tougher, I would say, very tough indeed, based 
on world precedents." 
  Thereby the incident involving the detention in Riga of two 
Russian generals and the capture of Russian military 
installations has presumably been exhausted. In spite of 
threatening statements by the Russian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, the Defense Ministry, and the Russian Federation 
Embassy in Latvia issued Monday evening, yesterday bilateral 
talks on the pullout of Russian troops resumed in the Latvian 
capital. Moreover, the Russian delegation offered to reduce the 
term of temporary operation of the radar station in Skrunda from 
six to five years. 
  At the same time, the head of the Russian delegation, 
Ambassador at Large Sergey Zotov, described the action by the 
Latvian self-defense forces as "a gross provocation by extremist 
and nationalist forces aimed at torpedoing the Russian-Latvian 
negotiations" and also as "a test of Russia's force and its 
ability to defend its installations against attack." It needs 
to be recognized that the test has been impressive. According 
to Russian Federation Defense Minister Grachev, not only the 
troops deployed in Latvia but also units of the Pskov airborne 
division were put on alert. 
  The Russian demarches have produced an appropriate effect. 
Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis officially apologized to 
Russia. The Latvian Prosecutor's Office has initiated criminal 
proceedings over the detention of the generals. Andreys Ruchs, 
chairman of the Vidzemskiy district, who was in charge of this 
action, has been dismissed from his post.

<F P=106> [Report by Maksim Yusin: "Diplomats in Riga and Moscow </F>
Choose Not To Exaggerate Incident"] 
  [Text] Following official apologies by the Latvian 
president and foreign minister, the tension in relations between 
Riga and Moscow has begun to abate. 
  As far as one can tell from what Russian diplomats are 
saying, Moscow is prepared to accept Latvia's story: The arrest 
of the two generals and seizure of the military facilities was 
the work of extremists operating without the republic 
leadership's knowledge. This was effectively admitted by Andrey 
Kozyrev as well. "A very crude provocation has occurred in 
Latvia," he said in a television interview. "It may be a 
provocation against the line of the Latvian authorities and 
president themselves." At the same time, according to the 
Russian minister, the generals' arrest was carried out by "armed 
territorial defense representatives, that is, government forces." 
  A spokesman for the Latvian Embassy in Moscow described this 
information as not entirely accurate: "In fact, the action was 
carried out mainly by the municipal police; that is, forces 
indirectly subordinate to Andrejs Rucs -- head of Riga's Vidzeme 
Rayon. As for members of territorial defense subunits, they 
participated in the operation on their own initiative, without 
the approval of the republic authorities." 
  According to information from embassy staff, Rucs was 
dismissed on 11 January. Criminal proceedings have now been 
instituted against him. He is accused of exceeding his official 
authority and of unlawful arrest. 
  To all appearances, the explanations from the Latvian 
authorities satisfied the members of the Russian delegation who 
flew to Riga on Monday for a further round of consultations on 
the withdrawal of forces. On the morning of 11 January the 
Russian delegation head, special envoy Sergey Zotov, agreed to 
start the talks that had been called off the day before as a 
protest against the arrest of the generals. 
  Diplomats in Riga and Moscow chose not to exaggerate the 
incident. Nonetheless it is clear to both sides that certain 
political forces are behind Andrejs Rucs, and further 
provocations, including armed provocations, against the Russian 
military cannnot be ruled out. 
  The deadline for the final withdrawal of forces has not yet 
been agreed -- negotiations are continuing. The likelihood is 
that Riga will ultimately accept the schedule proposed by the 
Russians: The last soldier is to leave Latvian territory before 
1 September 1994.

<F P=106> [Report by Colonel Igor Golin, chief of the Northwestern </F>
Group of Forces Press Center; Captain First Rank Valeriy Gromak; 
and Lieutenant Colonel Sergey Knyazkov: "Riga Provocation: Its 
Organizers Must Answer for Their Actions"; first three 
paragraphs are statement by Russian Federation Ministry of 
Defense Directorate of Press and Information] 
  [Excerpts] "On the morning of 10 January armed groups of 
Zemessargs (Latvian home defense guard) seized a number of 
military installations on the outskirts of Riga belonging to the 
Northwestern Group of Forces [NWGF]. Major General N.A. 
Taylakov, deputy commander of the NWGF, and Major General A.D. 
Vodopyanov, adjutant [pomoshchnik] to the NWGF commander for 
work with personnel, went to the scene of the incident. In 
response to their demand for the release of the facilities 
seized the chairman of the suburb of Vidzeme ordered the 
generals' arrest. The Russian generals were handcuffed and put 
into a car, which was driven off in the direction of the Russian 
border. NWGF Commander Colonel General L.S. Mayorov informed 
the Russian defense minister of what had happened. Defense 
Minister Army General Pavel Grachev issued instructions to place 
the Russian troops stationed in Latvia on combat alert and to 
step up security at facilities and buildings belonging to the 
NWGF. Likewise, air-assault troop and military transport 
aviation forces and resources were also placed on alert. The 
NWGF commander reported the event to Latvian President G. 
Ulmanis, who expressed bewilderment about what had happened, 
issued instructions for the arrested parties to be released, and 
offered his apologies. By 1700 hours the Russian generals and 
all the occupied facilities had been freed. 
  "The Russian Federation Defense Ministry demands an 
immediate 
investigation and the punishment of those responsible. Any 
violent, unlawful action against Russian servicemen, military 
units, or facilities belonging to Russian troops will be cut 
short in the most resolute manner. Responsibility for all 
possible consequences in this instance lies with the local 
authorities, who have an obligation to guarantee a normal 
atmosphere for Russian military units." 
  [Signed] The Russian Federation Defense Ministry Information 
and Press Directorate [passage omitted] 
  For justice's sake it should be acknowledged that the 
Latvian 
official authorities' reaction was immediate. Latvian President 
Guntis Ulmanis declared that the home guards' actions were 
illegal and that measures would be taken to bring about the 
Russian generals' immediate release. By 1700 hours the generals 
had been freed and conveyed to Riga, and by the end of the day, 
according to a statement by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, official apologies had been received via the Russian 
Federation Embassy. 
  As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA learned from Inart Skukinsh [name as 
transliterated], ITAR-TASS correspondent in Riga, an emergency 
session of the Latvian National Defense Council chaired by 
Guntis Ulmanis took place in the evening. It adopted a decree 
comprising the following five decisions: to examine the 
essentials of the emergency which had taken place; to relieve 
Andrejs Rucs, chairman of the Vidzeme district council and 
deputy chairman of the Riga assembly, of his duties; to conduct 
official inquiries within the home guard and municipal police of 
the relevant Vidzeme precinct; to prepare a response for Russia 
on what happened; and to clarify normative acts regulating the 
transfer and receipt of Russian Army property. 
  At an emergency session of the Latvian Government held at 
midnight, Republic Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs evaluated the 
event as a provocation. 
  Late in the evening Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs 
Andrejevs 
spoke on Latvian television. He noted that "armed conflict was 
a real threat." And in a statement for the press circulated the 
same evening the Latvian Republic Foreign Ministry made it known 
that "the Latvian Government will do everything possible to 
ensure that actions of a provocative nature which may damage 
Latvia's prestige in the world and complicate the domestic 
political situation in the republic will not be allowed to 
happen in the future." 
  The conflict would appear to have been defused, and 11 
January talks began between the heads of Russian and Latvian 
government delegations. However, nobody should be left in any 
doubt that Russia will take all requisite measures to protect 
its citizens, all its citizens, but particularly those in 
military or diplomatic uniform, from this type of encroachment.

  [Text] Russia "strictly observes the schedule of oil 
supplies to Ukraine," representative of the Russian Federation's 
Ministry of Fuel and Energy Vladimir Trofimov told Interfax. 
  He said that since the beginning of the year, Russia had 
supplied Ukraine with 600,000 tons of crude oil. Oil with a 
high content of sulphur accounts for a greater part of Russian 
oil supplies. It can only be processed by the Kremenchug oil 
refinery located in Ukraine. 
  Moscow and Kiev have reached the agreement on preserving the 
price of $80 a ton in 1994. Earlier, Russia was planning to 
sell oil to Ukraine at $100 a ton. 
  A high-ranking representative of the state enterprise 
Rosneft 
(Russian Oil) told Interfax that Russia was not planning to 
sharply reduce oil supplies to Ukraine in 1994. He believes 
that Ukrainian officials often make such allegations in order to 
put pressure on Russia. They do not understand that the most 
important problem for us is to receive payment for the oil 
already supplied, he said. This year, Kiev requested that Russia 
sell it more than 30 Mn tons of oil. 
  He also noted that a possible curtailment of oil supplies to 
Ukraine was due exclusively to technical problems. 
  In 1993 Russia sold 19.293 Mn tons of oil to Ukraine, 
although initially it was planning to supply 19.5 Mn tons of oil 
to this republic. Kiev owes Moscow more than 204 Bn rubles for 
the oil already supplied.

  [Text] Moscow, January 11 (TASS) -- A long-term credit of 
10 billion rubles (about 8 million U.S. dollars) has been 
allocated by Russia to Georgia for 1994 to help survive its 
depressed economy, an official from the Georgian Embassy in 
Moscow told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday [11 January]. 
  Moreover, as the republic has joined the Commonwealth of 
Independent States, additional technical credits for keeping 
functioning the Georgian metallurgic and mining industries are 
being considered, he said. 
  The same source reported that an agreement has been reached 
to plug in the Georgian power network to the united energy 
system of the southern Russia.

  [Text] Belgrade, 11 Jan -- The first of two trains with 
reinforcements for the personnel and combat hardware of the 
Russian "blue berets" battalion deployed in Serbian Krajina 
arrived today at the railway station of the town of Subotica. 
After the unloading of the hardware the detachment of Russian 
paratroops will go to the site of their deployment -- the 
"Klisa" airfield near Osijek. 
  In the next few days the 900 soldiers and officers of the 
"Rusbat," which is guarding a 100-km stretch of the line 
separating the Serbs and Croats, will be reinforced by more than 
300 extra Russian "blue berets." In addition to this 
reinforcement of personnel the battalion will have at its 
disposal several new armored carriers, anti-tank weapons and 
grenade launchers. The command calculates that this 
reinforcement will make it possible to lower the excessive load 
on the personnel who are manning 32 check- points around the 
clock. Meanwhile, the additional combat hardware will help to 
enhance the security of the Russian paratroops and forestall 
possible provocations and attacks. Incidentally, the Belgian 
battalion deployed in the same sector has already been equipped 
with the same types of weapons, while some national contingents 
of the UN forces even have tanks. 
  The situation in the zone for which the Russian battalion is 
responsible has become substantially more stable in recent 
months. This is explained not only by a certain easing of 
Serb-Croat relations but also by the skillful execution of their 
duties by the Russian soldiers and officers, constant contacts 
with the opposing sides, and efforts to prevent incidents.

Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has denounced the French proposal on air 
strikes in Bosnia. In his tactful style, he described the 
proposal as being fascist. He said so in the Duma corridor 
today during the first session of the two chambers of the new 
parliament. Before it started its work, the Duma observed two 
minutes of silence in memory of the victims of the revolt of 
last October.

Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, 
who is known to be actively pressing to be elected to the 
position of chairman of the parliament's foreign affairs 
committee, suddenly turned to international subjects. He 
described as "absolute fascism" the joint French-British 
initiative on a forcible settlement of the conflict in former 
Yugoslavia. He thus spoke about one of its authors, the French 
president: "That Mitterrand of yours has grown senile. He will 
last another half a year; so near his end, he dreams up all 
sorts of little ideas." 
  The reaction by President Mitterrand and the French Foreign 
Ministry to this statement is yet unknown.

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with Liberal Democratic Party leader </F>
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy by Cenk Baslamis in Moscow; date not given 
-- recorded; Zhirinovskiy speaks in Turkish] 
  [Excerpts] [Baslamis] We first asked Zhirinovskiy how he 
assesses the election results. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] This was an unexpected victory. These 
results were, therefore, a shock to Russia as well as the world. 
They are auspicious results because the Russians are sick and 
tired of the communists and the democrats. We are tired of 
them. The people want a party with a different policy. The 
people want a different political direction. Our party is just 
like your Demirel's True Path Party [TPP]. There is the TPP 
slogan: The party is in the building and the future in the hands 
of the father. That is what has happened with us as well. The 
Russians want a different party and a different direction. That 
is why we were successful. 
  [Baslamis] [passage omitted] Zhirinovskiy has all the 
characteristics of an extreme Russian nationalist. He 
incessantly talks about the Russian Empire. While he claims 
that he will be reannexing the former Soviet republics to 
Russia, Zhirinovskiy is training his youths in special camps. 
His commandos are studying the history of the Russian Empire 
and practicing target shooting. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I would like to state right now that we are 
working for peace. We do not want war. We do not want to 
occupy more territory. We want a mixed economy. We are not 
communists. We are not fascists. We are to the right of center. 
We are a centrist party. We are neither leftists nor 
rightists, we are centrists. That is what we are. 
  [Baslamis] No matter how strongly Zhirinovskiy claims to be 
a centrist, he is frightening everyone by hoisting the flag of 
extreme nationalism. The message that World War III is around 
the corner especially sends a chill up our spine. Zhirinovskiy 
claims to be misunderstood. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] At times I express the realities. I say what 
can occur. Certain people claim that I am expressing my wishes. 
What I am saying is that World War III is a possibility. I do 
not wish it but if the wars in the Balkans, the Caucasus, and 
Central Asia continue; if something happens between Iran and 
Iraq; or if the Kurdish problem in Turkey expands, then World 
War III might occur. I do not want it but we are slowly 
approaching that eventuality. 
  [Baslamis] The following book is a best seller in Moscow. 
It is called The Last Assault on the South written 
by Zhirinovskiy. In this book, he recounts how he will rebuild 
the Russian Empire. A third of the book is devoted to Turkey. 
He has very interesting theses and scenarios concerning Turkey. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] If the war continues in the Caucasus, Turkey 
will definitely be involved in it. 
  [Baslamis] Together with the Azerbaijanis? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Then there are the Kurds and the Armenians. 
It will be a complex issue. The Turks will side with the 
Azerbaijanis and the Kurds with the Armenians. Iran will be 
helping the Armenians and the Kurds. This region is exploding. 
On the western front Turkey will be facing both Bulgaria and 
Greece. 
  [Baslamis] In his book, Zhirinovskiy extensively talks about 
the Kurdish problem. What is interesting is that he claims that 
only Russia can solve this problem. He stresses that otherwise 
a Kurdish state will definitely be established. In his book he 
says: Pay attention to the Caucasus. The key is in the 
developments in that region. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] If the war in the Caucasus continues then the 
Armenians will occupy Azerbaijan and arm the Kurds who will, in 
turn, launch a big offensive in eastern Anatolia to establish a 
Kurdish state. 
  [Baslamis] On the one hand, Zhirinovskiy makes these claims 
and on the other he says that these are his simple predictions. 
He further claims that he does not intend to place Turkey in a 
difficult situation. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] This is only a thesis. This is not my wish. 
I love Turkey and the Turks. I am only expressing my views on 
what might happen. This is not my wish but it might happen. 
  [Baslamis] Despite Zhirinovskiy's claims to love Turkey, 
his love of Turks is doubtful. We do not know whether he is 
motivated by this love or not, but he refers to Turks at every 
opportunity in his book. How does he refer to the Turks? He 
describes them as barbaric and says that there is no such thing 
as Turkish culture. He adds: An unsheathed sword cannot be the 
basis for culture. What does Zhirinovskiy actually think about 
the Turks? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Everything is all right in the current 
Turkey. The Turks, however, arrived five centuries ago on 
Byzantine territory as enemies. They were the real enemy. They 
were not invited by anyone. They were living around Tashkent. 
They decided that the bread and water in the region were 
insufficient and mounted their horses to see what there was in 
the west. They decided that they had the power to occupy the 
rich people living in peace in the west. What kind of behavior 
was that? Why did it happen? This is all written down in 
history. I say that this is not the fault of the current 
Turkish people. There is a different people now, five centuries 
have gone by since. 
  [Baslamis] Zhirinovskiy is one of those most disturbed by 
Turkey developing relations with the Central Asian republics. 
The visit of Turkish leaders to the Turkic republics is, 
according to Zhirinovskiy, extremely meaningless. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Suleyman Demirel recently visited Ashgabat 
and other places. He met with Nazarbayev, the Kazakh president, 
and the presidents of Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and 
Azerbaijan. He is gathering them around himself. This, of 
course, is viewed as strange in Russia. Why did Demirel visit 
our Central Asian republics? There are Russians living there. 
There is a Turkish speaking population but there is also a 
Russian speaking population. 
  [Baslamis] Zhirinovskiy is warning both Turkey and the 
Western countries against interference in Russia. Actually, his 
book's message can be summarized as follows: If you interfere 
with us you will regret it. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] This is not what the Russian people want. 
Let them interfere with another people. It can backfire. That 
is what I wrote. It can backfire. That is why I wrote this 
book. It is all written there, it is written on what will 
happen if this interference continues. If this policy is 
pursued then it will backfire. The Russians will advance up to 
the shores of the Indian Ocean. The Turkish Army advanced up to 
the shores of Constantinople once. The Russians will now advance 
up to the shores of the Indian Ocean. 
  [Baslamis] His extreme nationalism pushes him to open 
threats. How does Zhirinovskiy view Turkey, where he was 
detained some 25 years ago? What is his assessment of the 
political parties? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I say that we are closer to ANAP [Motherland 
Party] and the TPP. You also have this religious party, the 
Prosperity Party. There are some similarities. We are, 
however, closer to the parties of Demirel and former president 
Turgut Ozal, namely ANAP. 
  [Baslamis] This is the kind of leader Zhirinovskiy is. 
Demagogue and crazy are a few of the mildest adjectives used in 
connection with Zhirinovskiy. What does he think about these 
adjectives? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] It is all propaganda. They [not further 
specified] also have such a center in Europe. They have one in 
our country as well. The Russian people are greatly influenced 
by my party. This kind of propaganda is being waged to counter 
this influence. According to the propaganda I am either a 
Zionist or an anti-Semite, either close to the communists or a 
fascist, either a racist or mad. They also claim that certain 
things happened to me in Turkey or that I wanted to live in 
Israel. This is all part of a scheme to reduce my influence on 
the Russian people. This is pure propaganda. This is a false 
weapon that has always been used in politics. They think that 
maybe the Russians will keep away from my party. The contrary 
is happening, however. That is why I am, in a way, happy. I am 
not the one, however, who is making this happen. This is the 
work of propaganda centers. It is also the work of my 
adversaries, the other parties opposed to me. It is, however, 
backfiring. I am, of course, quite happy with this outcome.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Liberal Democratic Party leader </F>
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy by Enrico Franceschini in Moscow on 11 
January: "Zhirinovskiy Says: `Italy Like Andorra'"] 
  [Excerpts] Moscow -- Just now that [Northern League leader] 
Umberto Bossi has relinquished plans to partition Italy, another 
political leader has appeared, determined to split our country 
into pieces, and to turn the small country that it is now into a 
tiny one -- "like Andorra, for instance." There is no cause for 
immediate alarm because, since becoming the "moral" victor in 
the elections, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has been firing off in all 
directions, more for the sake of provocation than in earnest. 
But he cannot be ignored, because some day this man could 
become Russian president. Whatever fate awaits him, his moment 
of truth came yesterday, when he triumphantly entered the 
skyscraper that (for the present) houses the new parliament. It 
was an entry worthy of a rock star, rather than a politician, 
because only Madonna and Michael Jackson are granted such a 
reception. [passage omitted] 
  Vladimir Volfovich, I asked him, amid the throng, is what 
you 
told one Austrian newspaper true? Do you want Italy to cede the 
South Tyrol to Austria? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Definitely. You wanted to break us up into 
pieces. Well, now you can taste some of your own medicine. 
  [Franceschini] Who do you mean by "you"? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] You Italians, you Europeans, you Westerners. 
You caused the Soviet Union to collapse, and it would serve you 
right to suffer the same fate and to see what it feels like. 
Thus, perhaps you will understand what Russia is experiencing 
now, without the 14 republics that have historically belonged to 
it. So, South Tyrol must go to Austria, Trieste can go to 
Yugoslavia, Sicily can go it alone, and so forth. 
  [Franceschini] But the Soviet Union was a vast and 
totalitarian empire. Italy is a small democratic country. Why 
do you want to break it up into pieces? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] You are small, but you must become even 
smaller. You must end up with an Italy as small as Andorra or 
Liechtenstein: Then you will understand! 
  [Franceschini] But in your opinion Russia should regain not 
only the former Soviet republics but also the former communist 
countries of Eastern Europe. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Not at all. I say this to the countries of 
Eastern Europe: Stay neutral, free, and independent. You do 
not need NATO at all. Why do you want to lick American and 
British generals' boots? You will never have anything to fear 
from Russia. Russia will never reach as far as Prague or 
Budapest. 
  [Franceschini] What about as far as Kiev? Are you in favor 
of taking away Ukraine's nuclear weapons? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Definitely, yes. It must have all its 
missiles taken away, and Russia must have them back. No new 
nuclear powers must emerge in the world; there are already 
enough. 
  [Franceschini] So you agree on this with Yeltsin and 
Clinton. 
They are working well in the negotiations with Ukraine... 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, they are good fellows, but let them 
first get out of the way. It would be better. 
  [Franceschini] Will you be seeing Clinton during the Moscow 
summit? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I am willing to meet with him, but he is 
afraid. I really do not know of what. 
  [Franceschini] Well, you have earned yourself a terrible 
reputation... 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, people say all kinds of things about me: 
The latest is that I am supposedly a KGB agent, and to think 
that I was never a CPSU member, have never been in prison or a 
mental hospital, I do not get drunk, I speak four languages, I 
have two degrees, I served my country faithfully in the Army, I 
have not run away to seek my fortune abroad, and I have never 
stolen a single ruble from anyone. Where can your Clinton find 
another Russian politician with a record like mine? 
  [Franceschini] But every second day you declare war on some 
foreign country or other... 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I am opposed to war; I am in favor of peace 
and of civilized coexistence between all the countries of the 
world. I do not threaten anyone, either in the South or in the 
West: We want relations of good cooperation with both Finland 
and Turkey, with both Afghanistan and Poland, but there are 
risks of war in the world, and they could increase if someone 
makes some wrong moves of the kind discussed by NATO in Brussels. 
  [Franceschini] Namely? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Namely, the idea of waging war on Bosnia. 
Mitterrand's proposal to bomb the Bosnian cities is pure 
fascism, or evidence of senility. Mitterrand is evidently a 
crazy old man; he has not long left to live, and intends to 
bring the world to war. He is the warmonger, not I. Mitterrand, 
Major, Kohl, Clinton, the Japanese, the whole of G-7: They are 
to blame for the war in the Balkans. They hold a summit in 
Brussels, but the time will come for other summits at which 
people will be called to account for all these crimes. 
  [Franceschini] Some people expect your first proposal in 
Parliament to be an attack on Boris Yeltsin. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Not at all. It will be a proposal for a 
general amnesty for all political crimes from 1985 to the 
present. That is, from the day Gorbachev came to power until 
the violent events of last October. The lengthy crisis and the 
changes of these difficult years have led to thousands of unjust 
sentences. Russia must bury its past at a stroke. It must look 
ahead. To the future. With me. Then it will succeed in rising 
up again.

  [Text] The truce among the conflicting mojahedin forces in 
Kabul lasted only 36 minutes. The truce was signed so that the 
[words indistinct] could leave the city, where heavy fighting 
was taking place. Reports from the Afghan capital indicate that 
many Kabul residents also exploited the truce and thousands of 
people left their homes to save their lives. 
  Since the beginning of 1994 when the battles started, 
hundreds have been killed and thousands wounded. The battles in 
Kabul are among pro-Rabbani armed forces, a coalition of 
voluntary Afghan Uzbek forces led by General Dostam, and 
military groups led by Prime Minister Hekmatyar. The [words 
indistinct] is that the national majority of the [words 
indistinct] are Tajiks. There were [words indistinct] on this 
before. [Word indistinct] that observers say that in the past, 
after Marxist rule, Afghan society faced more [word indistinct] 
ethnic differences, but these differences have now been 
transformed into an overt conflict. 
  General Dostam was a member of the central committee of the 
former ruling party in Afghanistan during Najibollah's rule and 
was the sworn enemy of Hekmatyar, who is a Pushtun nationalist 
and fundamentalist. Hekmatyar called Dostam a communist and 
[words indistinct] the radical Marxist regime in Kabul. 
  [Words indistinct] the coalition forces tried to infiltrate 
[name indistinct] region along Kabul river in the northeast of 
the city. Earlier, forces loyal to the president forced 
Dostam's men out of this area. The two sides used the air force 
several times. Dostam's aircraft heavily bombed the presidential 
palace and Kabul television. Bomber jets loyal to the president 
bombed the Bala Hesar stronghold of Dostam's forces and areas 
around the [word indistinct]. 
  Due to the chaos in Kabul and the absence of contacts, no 
reports have been received on the number of casualties, but it 
is clear the number is high. The whereabouts of the head of the 
Afghan Government are not clear. Some say he remains in the 
presidential palace, but Hekmatyar's spokesmen say he has fled 
Kabul. 
  UN representatives in Pakistan are continuing their efforts 
to reconcile the belligerent forces.

<F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 11 TASS -- After a "breakthrough" 
visit of the Russian president to China, Russia started a 
dynamic broad partnership with Beijing both on the international 
scene and in bilateral relations; China is a priority of the 
Russian foreign policy, Deputy Russian Foreign Minister 
Aleksandr Panov told an exclusive ITAR-TASS interview here today. 
  Panov was nominated to his post on December 30, 1993. 
  In his words, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is 
expected to visit China in late January to discuss preparations 
for a Moscow visit of the Chinese leader. 
  Russian relations with China same as with Japan "should not 
be a sensation but a norm; they should be relations of normal 
neighbours - two great powers," which interact in each other's 
interests, in the interests of the region and the whole world, 
said the official. 
  In the opinion of Panov, it is symbolic that 1994 starts for 
Russia with a visit of the U.S. President and a Chinese trip of 
the Russian foreign minister. Being different, these visits 
prove the well-balanced Russian foreign policy equally oriented 
to the west and to the east. 
  Russia has broad possibilities of cooperation with China, 
said Panov. Russia has not fully studied Chinese economic 
transformations to use them in domestic conditions, especially 
in the area of special economic zones. This idea is being 
considered in Russia, but China has done it more swiftly and the 
zones have boosted Chinese economic development. 
  The two countries are holding border negotiations. In his 
opinion, pronouncements of some politicians, especially in the 
Far East, claiming Russia is making unilateral unjustified 
concessions to Beijing are ungrounded. All the concessions are 
bilateral and mutual. 
  As for military cooperation, Russia and China are discussing 
the reduction of their armed forces in the border area. The 
negotiations "are not a sensation as it is clear no military 
preparations are underway or even possible on the borders, which 
increasingly become friendship frontiers". 
  Russian-Chinese trade is mutually beneficial and does not 
infringe Russian economic interests. It will constantly expand. 
The official called for informing the public of all aspects of 
the Russian-Chinese relations. In his opinion, the January 
Beijing visit of the Russian foreign minister will do a lot of 
good in this respect.

<F P=106> [Gennadiy Charodeyev report: "Five Japanese Captains </F>
Convicted in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk"] 
  [Text] The scandal between Moscow and Tokyo over the 
detained Japanese fishing boat Yunimaru and its captain Keiichi 
Noto, who was wounded by Russian naval border guards, is flaring 
up with renewed force. 
  About a month ago (see IZVESTIYA issue No. 233) our border 
guards entered the South Kurils Gulf -- Russian territorial 
waters -- where they intercepted a Japanese schooner which had 
been fishing for crabs. During the attempt to detain the 
poachers the latter offered armed resistance. The border guards 
commander gave the order to open fire. Captain Noto received 
slight wounds and the crew members raised their hands in 
surrender. 
  The Japanese press considered the Russian border guards' 
actions a national insult. The newspapers are demanding the 
immediate return of the captain, the trawler, and the crew. The 
Japanese are particularly incensed at the fact that the shooting 
happened in a zone which they regard as their own territorial 
waters. 
  "Such logic is categorically unacceptable to us," Grigoriy 
Karasin, director of the Foreign Ministry Information and Press 
Department, told IZVESTIYA. "The waters around the South Kurils 
belong to Russia, and Russian laws apply to them." 
  Meanwhile in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk the simultaneous trial of the 
captains of five Japanese fishing vessels detained while fishing 
illegally in Russian territorial waters has ended. The border 
violators have been ordered to pay a total fine of 20,000 
dollars and 400,000 rubles. Four of the captains have been 
given two-year suspended sentences; only one of them will be 
spending six months in a Russian jail. 
  The prosecutor has protested against the Yuzhno-Kurilskiy 
Rayon Court decision and expressed indignation at the 
"unjustified leniency of the sentence." The case has been sent 
for reexamination at a higher judicial level. 
  Prof. Kamil Bekyashev, a specialist in the sphere of 
international maritime law, believes that the Russian prosecutor 
has grounds for appealing against the court's ruling. Under our 
laws people found guilty of poaching especially valuable species 
of fish and in large quantities are supposed to be deprived of 
their liberty for up to four years. A suspended sentence is not 
allowed. 
  "We believe," Grigoriy Karasin stressed, "that poaching not 
only damages the fish stocks of the South Kurils Gulf but also 
has an adverse effect on the whole range of Russian-Japanese 
relations, and that includes the negotiations on a peace treaty. 
Border troops will be guided by the laws on Russia's state 
border and on the economic zone." 
  The number of violations of Russia's maritime border by 
Japanese boats engaged in poaching in this area is not 
diminishing. According to Foreign Ministry figures there were 
7,558 such violations in 1991, 7,932 in 1992, and 7,690 in 1993.

  [Text] Cairo, 10 Jan -- Evaluating the recently ended 
10-day joint Kuwaiti-Russian naval maneuvers held within the 
framework of the agreement on military cooperation between the 
two countries signed in Moscow at the end of November, a 
spokesman for the Kuwaiti Ministry of Defense described them as 
"excellent." 
  It would be possible to welcome Russia's contribution to 
ensuring Kuwait's security. But there is the troubling fact 
that Russian-Kuwaiti military cooperation has begun before the 
normalization of relations between Kuwait and Iraq and so 
inevitably acquires an anti-Iraqi complexion. The door to 
cooperation with Iraq -- a rich and influential state with which 
we used to be linked by very close ties -- has thereby 
essentially been slammed shut. In such a situation it is hardly 
rational, as our new friends, the Americans, say, to put all our 
eggs in one basket.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Shchipanov report under the "Our Commentary" </F>
rubric: "They Still Do Not Give Us the Money"] 
  [Text] It seems that chiefs of the IMF are in fact trying 
to deflect any accusations that it was its unreasonably tight 
policy with regard to Russia that contributed to the Russian 
extremists' parliamentary breakthrough. It is well known that 
an aggressive attack is the best defense. Well. The IMF has 
announced in its attacking style that it was not going to 
release the second part of its long-promised loan to Russia. 
The first $1.5 billion was given to us on fairly beneficial 
terms as early as last summer. It was expected that after a 
pause, approximately by January 1994, the Russians will get the 
remaining half as well. U.S. Vice President Albert Gore added 
fuel to the fire when he took international experts to task 
while in Moscow for their short-sighted rigidity in imposing the 
IMF's economic recipes on the Kremlin. It seemed that the IMF 
had no other choice given that the United States itself holds a 
dominant position in the fund. But the fund men have shown 
their mettle. 
  They continue to set those same conditions for carrying out 
reform by the Russian authorities. As if there were no fear 
following the breakthrough of V.V. Zh. [Vladimir Zhirinovskiy] 
and his ilk. The IMF is not going to compromise its principles 
in an apparent belief that there are enduring economic values. 
Fund experts are not content with the Russian Government's 
commitment to subsidize staple foodstuffs and energy resources. 
This is why the money will not come to Russia until it fulfills 
the established standards for putting brakes on inflation and 
cutting the budget deficit. Our official economists have 
repeatedly promised yet more budget "breakthroughs" in the past 
few months and cheered those who so wished with optimistic 
figures about decreasing inflation. Apparently, neither Fedorov 
nor Shokhin were taken at their word as the fund preferred to 
continue to exert pressure. 
  It is another matter that the fund may come under renewed 
American pressure following Clinton's visit. The Yankees 
account for the bulk of contributions to the IMF budget and are 
inclined to make the fund the main channel for infusing at least 
some Western assistance into Russia. Hence, even the IMF's 
professed resolve looks as if it were a direct threat to 
Clinton's course toward propping up Russia's volatile democracy. 
So, Washington and the IMF may reach a gentleman's agreement in 
the near future -- unfortunately, delays may amount to a few 
months -- whereby U.S. officials will no longer question the 
wisdom of fund experts (at least in public), and the IMF will 
finally agree to release the remaining part of the $3-billion 
loan to us.

<F P=106> [Igor Barsukov report: "IMF: 'Budget Restrictions Are </F>
Needed'"] 
  [Text] Washington -- The IMF and the World Bank, which 
have published a memorandum on policy toward Russia, have called 
on the Russian leadership to pursue the reforms without slowing 
down the pace. 
  The country's current economic misfortunes are caused by the 
collapse of the former system rather than by the government's 
measures for transition to a market economy, the document says. 
Therefore, instead of slowing down the pace of reforms, Russia 
ought to accelerate the implementation of reforms with a view to 
reducing the period of slump in production and decline of the 
population's living standards. 
  In this memorandum, perceived by local observers as a 
response to criticism of the two international financial 
organizations' policy toward Russia, the IMF and the World Bank 
have emphasized that, in order to reduce its budget deficit and 
curb inflation, Russia needs to introduce "tough budget 
restrictions" on the financing of state enterprises. It would 
also be worth the Russian leadership's while to step up its 
efforts in the sphere of privatization, extending it to the 
power industry and the military production sphere. Unemployment 
will rise as a result of the closure of inefficient enterprises. 
But this problem must be solved via the creation of a social 
security system and not by subsidizing food and energy prices 
for the country's entire population, the document says. 
  Citing the fact that Russia is insufficiently active in 
implementing the measures to curb inflation and reduce the 
budget deficit, defined by it jointly with the IMF, the Fund's 
leadership will refrain from granting it the second half of the 
credit line from the system transformation fund, amounting to 
$1.5 billion.

  [Excerpts] The Armenian Ministry of Defense has informed 
[name indistinct] NEWS AGENCY that Azerbaijan's military forces 
continued to fire on Armenia's northeastern border on 9 January. 
The defense positions in Krasnoselskiy Rayon's Chambarak 
locality were fired on by T-72 tanks from time to time until 
noon on 9 January. No one was wounded or killed in the firing. 
  Azerbaijan has maintained its military operations against 
Idzhevan's border. An enemy BMP [armored personnel carrier] 
fired on a civilian vehicle on [name indistinct] road at 1100 on 
9 January. One person was killed and another was wounded in the 
vehicle. The military unit in Mazanly fired on (?Kiransk) from 
a BMP from 1500 to 1530 on the same day. No one was killed and 
no damage was caused. The defense positions around Berkaber 
were fired on with large-caliber machine guns and mortars from 
1330 to 1410. The Armenian side refrained from returning the 
fire in all cases. [passage omitted] 
  According to the information disseminated by the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] Information Service and the NKR 
Press and Information Department, Azerbaijan's military forces 
launched attacks along NKR's front lines on 10 January. The new 
offensive began at 0700. The situation in Magavuz in 
Mardakertskiy Rayon was the most serious during the fighting. 
[passage omitted] 
  NKR's military forces retreated from their positions during 
the serious clashes on 7 January. According to the HAY LUR NEWS 
AGENCY and other sources, Azerbaijan's military forces managed 
to advance and capture several very important heights close to 
the Iranian border with the help of many military vehicles. 
They also launched attacks in several areas along the front 
line, from east to west. However, the enemy units were checked 
as a result of the serious resistance of the Armenian forces. 
All the enemy attacks were rebuffed. The situation was 
relatively peaceful on 8 January. The news agencies in the NKR 
report that Azerbaijan lost 80 men, two tanks, and an armored 
vehicle. We have not yet received any up-to- date information 
on the Armenian losses. 
  Azerbaijan's news agencies have reported that the Armenian 
side has lost 500 men. However, the NKR has denied that report. 
According to the [word indistinct] officials, the Armenian side 
lost 32 freedom fighters during the past three days. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Stepanakert, January 11 (SNARK) -- In the short 
hours of quietness the Karabakh soldiers are busy with burying 
numerous bodies of the Azerbaijani militaries. It can be 
explained by the absence of the Azerbaijani leaders' desire to 
take the bodies of the soldiers and officers to conceal the true 
quantity of losses they have in the clashes. 
  According to the data received from the Staff of the 
Karabakh 
Defense Army, the great number unburied bodies -- about 350 -- 
are at the suburbs of the Madagiz village, Mardakertskiy region. 
During the period of last 20 days about 800 soldiers and 
officers of the Azerbaijani Army were killed there. They were 
the 18-19 years old, the residents of Baku and Sumgait. 
  Recently at the border of the Martuninskiy (Karabakh) and 
Agdamskiy (Azerbaijan) regions more than 200 lost Azeris 
militaries were buried in the common tomb. Their documents 
witness the fact -- they were within the Mingechaur infantry 
battalion.

  [Text] Azerbaijan still rejects all programmes of the 
peaceful solution of the Karabakh problem. More than that, in 
the past days it provokes military actions on the Armenian-Azeri 
border. Northern areas of Armenia were shelled in the most 
barbarous way, the presidential spokesman Aram Abramyan has told 
the briefing in Yerevan. 
  He has said Azerbaijan has again illusions to solve the 
problem militarily. Armenia's position is unchanged, the 
problem cannot be solved militarily, said Abramyan. That is why 
the Armenian leadership will use every possibility to try to 
solve the problem politically, said the spokesman. 
  In this connection he said that Armenia backs any 
peace-keeping initiative in this direction, including the recent 
initiative proposed by Iran. Out of its two key provisions -- 
the ceasefire and the status of Nagoro-Karabakh -- Armenia has 
concentrated on the first one, since only during the ceasefire 
it is possible to conduct talks on a political status.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] While the Armenian workers were 
repairing the blown up sectors of the pipeline in Marneulskiy 
Rayon, yet another explosion took place on Georgian territory. 
It surpasses the others in its magnitude. A 300-meter sector 
of the 1,000-mm gas pipeline was blown up and put out of order 
at the place where it crosses the Kura River in 
Azerbaijani-inhabited Gardabanskiy Rayon. Moreover, a 
800-meter-long sector of the pipeline was displaced by some 5 
meters. 
  Specialists from the Armenian State Gas Enterprise have left 
for the site of the accident. In their opinion, the Kura River 
should be diverted and large-scale earth moving should be 
carried out at the location of the explosion in order to be able 
to repair the pipeline.

  [Text] Yerevan, January, 11 (SNARK) -- There are no hopes 
of receiving gas in the nearest future in Armenia, Roland 
Adonts, the General Director of the " Armenian Gas Industry " 
enterprise, has declared today to SNARK. 
  He said the Georgian Government is helpless and incapable 
not 
only to provide with the security of the pipeline but also to 
cope with the Azerbaijani military joints [as received] acting 
in that part of Georgia. 
  Adonts declared that Azerbaijani militants control all the 
elevations along the Southern part of the pipeline. He said it 
hampers the reconstruction of the pipeline. In the same time 
Roland Adonts rejected the idea of Armenia's military 
interference for provision of the pipeline security. He 
considers it impossible because this region of Georgia is 
basically inhabited by Azerbaijanians. This problem requires a 
serious political and military interference of Russia and 
Georgia.

Nagorno- Karabakh this morning. All the attacks have been fully 
repulsed. According to the ministry, the Armenians had 
considerable losses. 
  Some Armenian units leave the front on their own and are 
trying to escape to Armenia, the Azeri Defence Ministry's press 
service reports with a reference to intelligence information 
from the occupied republican areas. It also claims a number of 
deserters have been shot in the Armenian rear.

night, the Azeri National Army resumed offensive operations at 
many sections of the Karabakh front, sources at the Karabakh 
defence army headquarters' press center told ITAR-TASS. 
  The fighting was especially fierce in the Karabakh Mardakert 
region on the line of Madagis-Akop Kamari settlements and on the 
border of the Agdam region. All the attacks were repulsed by 3 
P.M. 
  After a counter-offensive, Karabakh units seized a number of 
heights in the Mardakert region.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ramiz Rizayev, Azerbaijan's ambassador to </F>
Moscow, by Boris Mikhaylov in the "Transcaucasus" column: "`We 
Have the Right To Count on the Support of the CIS and the World 
Community.' Ramiz Rizayev, Ambassador Plenipotentiary of the 
Azerbaijan Republic to the Russian Federation, Denies Reports 
About Afghan Mojahedin Involvement in Hostilities"] 
  [Text] [Mikhaylov] Mr. Ambassador, at a recent meeting of 
the CIS heads of state in Ashgabat President Geydar Aliyev of 
Azerbaijan demanded that a mechanism be worked out within the 
framework of the Collective Security Treaty that would enable 
the CIS countries to ensure Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. 
Could you speak about the Azerbaijani initiative in greater 
detail? 
  [Rizayev] The fact is that the provisions of the Collective 
Security Treaty are so defined today that it is oriented toward 
a rebuff against an "outside enemy" if such, God forbid, ever 
appears. Although, to be frank, neither Iran nor Turkey are 
threatening Azerbaijan; on the contrary, we enjoy good-neighbor 
relations with these countries. This treaty in its present 
shape does not provide for the possibility of collective defense 
in a situation when one country -- a party to this treaty, in 
particular Armenia -- commits aggression against another CIS 
member, Azerbaijan. Armenia, trampling upon international law 
and UN Security Council resolutions, continues to occupy 
approximately one-quarter of Azerbaijani territory. All the 
peace efforts undertaken earlier by the CSCE and the Russian 
Federation to deal with this issue have not brought any tangible 
results, primarily because Armenia continues to speak from a 
position of force. The unprecedented case -- the shooting by 
Armenian snipers at Russian Ambassador Vladimir Kazimirov's 
mission on 20 November -- has testified once again to Yerevan's 
unwillingness to come across with any concessions. After that 
attack, as is known, Russian Ambassador Kazimirov had to cut 
short his peacemaking efforts. It is also indicative that 
Armenia has demonstratively refused to apologize for this 
incident to the Russian side. In this situation we have the 
right to expect that parties to the Collective Security Treaty 
will give a legal assessment to Armenia's expansionist policy, 
because otherwise the very idea of a collective security system 
within the CIS framework can be discredited. 
  [Mikhaylov] Russian diplomat Vladimir Kazimirov in the 
course of a recent visit to Tehran stated that Russia is ready 
to continue its intermediary efforts to achieve a settlement in 
the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. How does Baku appraise 
Russia's peacemaking efforts? 
  [Rizayev] We can only support the aspiration by the Russian 
side to ensure peace and stability in this region. Russia in 
this mediation process can and should do a lot: Russia's 
geopolitical and economic interests call for stability along its 
southern borders, and moreover there are approximately half a 
million Russians living in Azerbaijan who consider our republic 
their motherland and share all the hardships on a par with 
everybody else. The peacemaking process should be based on the 
principle of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. At the same 
time one should bear in mind that the so-called "self defense 
forces of Nagorno- Karabakh" are a myth. In fact the formations 
acting in the zone of combat operations are a component part of 
Armenia's national guard. Therefore all attempts by the Armenian 
side to accord Nagorno-Karabakh the status of an independent 
party in the talks hold no water. How has the tiny Armenian 
community of Karabakh come by such a mighty power -- tanks, 
missiles, aircraft, and fuel to fill the deadly military 
machines? Therefore Yerevan's assertion that the conflict is 
occurring between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh is nothing but 
an attempt to absolve itself from responsibility for the ongoing 
war in the region. 
  [Mikhaylov] Some time ago first Armenian sources and then 
some Russian papers began to report that Afghan mojahedin are 
fighting on the Azeri side. Could you confirm this information? 
  [Rizayev] I can only express a feeling of utmost amazement. 
The Russian mass media are once again demonstrating unanimous 
silence over the tragedy unfolding in Azerbaijan before the 
entire world. More than a million civilians have been left 
without shelter; death is taking its toll; a real genocide is 
occurring, but we are not hearing any condemnation of this fact 
by the Russian public. At the same time certain papers are 
willingly airing the subject of Afghan mercenaries. Framed 
"documents" are being used and these fabrications are being 
backed up with fantastic figures. The impetus to this campaign 
was provided by statements of Armenian President Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan. This is an attempt to divert world public 
attention from the numerous facts of the involvement of foreign 
mercenaries as part of Armenia's occupation forces. There is 
evidence to suggest that Armenians who have been trained in 
Kurdish guerrilla camps in the Middle East are then transferred 
to Karabakh, and Syrian and Lebanese hirelings are also arriving 
here. 
  [Mikhaylov] Mr. Ambassador, I would like to ask a final 
question, which is related to the internal political situation 
in Azerbaijan. Could it be said that the present leadership has 
succeeded in achieving national accord in the country? Some 
time ago Ayaz Mutalibov, former president of the republic, 
expressed his readiness in the press to collaborate with the 
current authorities.... 
  [Rizayev] The Azerbaijan leadership is ready for a 
constructive dialogue with all healthy political forces of the 
country wishing to undertake efforts to lead the country out of 
the crisis. As for Mutalibov, I can say the following. It is 
bad when a man does not want to understand that his time has 
passed. It is okay if lying behind Mutalibov's statements are 
only his personal ambitions, but there is a danger that the 
ex-president is being turned into a kind of banner by well-known 
forces aiming to destabilize the situation in Azerbaijan, which 
is difficult as it is.

  [Text] According to the military and radio intelligence of 
the Nagorno-Karabakh army, Azerbaijanis send units composed 
mostly of citizens of various CIS states as well as Turkey and 
Afghanistan to the areas of the fiercest fighting. 
  A resident of the Russian city of Vladivostok, now 
prisoner-of-war Oleg Pilipenko, said that the Azerbaijani 
authorities arrest Russians who temporarily reside on the 
territory of Azerbaijan and force them into enrolling to the 
Azerbaijani army by beating. 
  According to sources in Stepanakert, Pilipenko recently 
appealed to the Russian authorities to help him and other 
Russians who were made to serve in the Azerbaijani army. 
  Another POW, resident of the Turkish town of Sivac Abil 
Umah, 
stated that a group of officers of the Azerbaijani Defense 
Ministry was touring Turkey at the moment drafting Turkish 
jobless into the national army. 
  Meanwhile, Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev recently said 
Baku had irrefutable evidence of mercenaries' participation in 
the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict on the Armenian side.

<F P=106> [Report by Kirill Petrov:"Karabakh Front Has Never Before </F>
Been So Broad, Threat of the Conflict's Internationalization Has 
Never Before Been So Real"] 
  [Excerpts] In the morning of 9 January, following a 
relative lull, the Azerbaijani Army, supported by armored 
equipment and aviation, launched a fresh offensive in 
Mardakertskiy Rayon. Fierce fighting is under way, the sides are 
suffering major losses. [passage omitted] 
  The real threat of the conflict's internationalization is 
another noteworthy aspect. It is, alas, an open secret that 
envoys from Azerbaijan and the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] 
are spending big money to hire "soldiers of fortune" in Russia, 
in Ukraine, in Belarus, in the Baltic countries.... 
"International aid" to the warring sides is already arriving 
from beyond the former USSR's borders. Afghan mojahedin are 
fighting on Azerbaijan's side. Furthermore, the notorious 
Hekmatyar and General Dustum have examined the possibility of 
rendering more effective assistance to Baku. Mercenaries from 
Lebanon, Syria, and other Near East countries are fighting in 
Nagorno-Karabakh's defense detachments. Teheran and Istanbul 
are finding it increasingly hard to conceal their annoyance with 
the development of events in the NKR. And even though these two 
capitals issue assurances of readiness to perform a peacemaking 
mission in the region, it is no secret that certain quite 
influential forces in both Iran and Turkey are also considering 
strongarm options of "international aid."

  [Text] Baku January 11 TASS -- A list of strategically 
important goods that can no longer be exported from Azerbaijan 
without a special permission of the Azeri president, was 
endorsed by a presidential decree here today. 
  It includes seventeen kinds of goods, including petroleum 
and 
its derivatives, natural gas condensate, polyethylene, 
sulphanol, caustic soda, snake venom, tobacco, cotton fibre, 
caviar, hand-made rugs, precious, ferrous, and non-ferrous 
metals, and also articles made of them. The export of electric 
power is also banned. 
  This decree, the document stresses, was adopted to ensure 
more effective use of the republic's export potential at a time 
when the Azeri market economy is being established, when the 
system of mutual settlements in foreign trade and measures to 
protect the domestic market are being toughened. It allows, 
until the adoption of corresponding legislative acts, regulating 
commercial relations with foreign countries, including CIS 
nations, to sell goods and render services outside Azerbaijan 
only if they are paid for in advance or if a letter of credit is 
made out. At the same time, the decree prohibits advance 
payments for goods purchased in foreign countries and services 
rendered by firms abroad. It is permitted to use letters of 
credit for this purpose. Restrictions have also been imposed on 
barter transactions.

  [Text] Baku, January 11 (TURAN) -- Yesterday President 
Geydar Aliyev issued a decree "On increasing the effectiveness 
of foreign trade in the Azerbaijan Republic". 
  The decree was issued in order to increase the effectiveness 
of export potential, to strengthen the system of trade 
calculations, and to protect inner trade. 
  The decree will remain in force until corresponding 
legislative acts regulating foreign economic activity can be 
adopted. 
  In line with this decree, outside the republic, goods will 
be 
exported through preliminary payment or by opening a letter of 
credit. Only with certain exceptions will goods and services be 
exported without preliminary payment by the order of the 
Cabinet. Preliminary payment for imported goods and services 
has been banned. These operations can be implemented with a 
letter of credit. Preliminary payment for imported goods and 
barters can be put into effect, in exceptional cases, with the 
permission of the government. 
  A list of strategically-sensitive goods, which can be 
exported only with the permission of the President, has also 
been defined. 
  The Cabinet has been given two weeks to work out and to 
adopt 
a list of temporary measures. In addition, the Cabinet must 
work out and present to the President a bill regulating foreign 
economic activity of organizations and enterprises. Since this 
decree went into effect on January 10, 1994, all the former 
decrees (No. 402 from January 13, 1993 and No. 403 on March 18, 
1993 and Instruction 118 from September 10, 1992) have been 
cancelled. 
  The types of strategic export production, consisting of 60 
articles, have been added to the Presidential decree. They 
include oil and oil products, chemical production, cotton, 
non-ferrous, black and precious metals, tobacco, snake poison, 
black caviar and others.

  [Text] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev has received an 
official delegation from the Latvian Republic. Expressing 
satisfaction with the bilateral ties between Azerbaijan and 
Latvia, which were allies in the past and are now independent 
republics, Aliyev noted that both sides are interested in these 
ties. (Oyar Kekhris), the head of the delegation, who is 
Latvia's deputy prime minister and economy minister, explained 
the reasons for the visit to Azerbaijan and provided information 
on documents signed with the Azerbaijani Government today. He 
referred to the joint Azerbaijani-Latvian Crescent Trade House 
established some years ago and noted that the new bilateral ties 
being established will benefit both sides. 
  Welcoming the agreement on establishing diplomatic ties 
between Azerbaijan and Latvia, Aliyev said he believed that 
trade, economic, scientific, and cultural relations will further 
develop between the two republics, which had close ties for 
decades, know each other's history and potential intimately, and 
are now confidently walking along the road of independence. 
  Socio-economic issues prevailing in the two republics were 
also broached during the meeting. 
  The state adviser on foreign policy affairs, Vafa Gulizade, 
Economy Minister Samed Sadykhov, and Trade Minister (Rizan) 
Guseynov took part in the meeting. 
  Prime Minister Suret Guseynov today received the Latvian 
delegation and discussed bilateral trade relations. It was 
noted that the economic and trade agreements signed between 
Latvia and Azerbaijan for 1993 have been fulfilled. To broaden 
cooperation in this field, there was an extensive exchange of 
views on concrete measures to be implemented in 1994. Proposals 
were put forward to establish customs ties. 
  A protocol was signed at the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry 
today on establishing diplomatic relations and on the principles 
of economic cooperation between Azerbaijan and Latvia. The 
documents were signed by Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan 
Gasanov and Economy Minister Samed Sadykhov and by the Latvian 
Economy Minister Kekhris Oyar. 
  Briefing reporters on the importance of the signed documents 
and the way in which they operate, Gasanov said it is very 
important for Azerbaijan to have diplomatic ties with the CIS 
countries. 
  Answering reporters' questions, Latvian Economy Minister 
Kekhris Oyar said economic cooperation with Azerbaijan, which 
has tremendous potential, will greatly benefit Latvia. 
  Diplomatic representatives to our Republic and other guests 
attended the signing ceremony.

  [Text] Baku -- Confusion over mutual transactions, the 
lack of a sufficient number of Russian rubles in Azerbaijan, and 
the impossibility of money transfers to Russia have introduced 
complete chaos into financial relations between the two 
countries -- which has not been slow to affect subscriptions to 
Russian publications, their delivery, and their printing in the 
republic. 
  Meanwhile, according to the information of the local 
Ministry 
of Communications, subscriptions to them have been taken out in 
Azerbaijan to the value of 150 million rubles. Citing the same 
old reasons, the leadership of the national bank has proposed 
returning the money to the subscribers. But Nazim Novruzov, 
chief of the Azerbaijani Press Distribution Association, has 
declared that possibilities have nonetheless been found to 
preserve four Russian newspapers for the readers: PRAVDA, 
IZVESTIYA, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, and ARGUMENTY I FAKTY.

  [Text] During the morning session of the Federation 
Council, the deputies adopted the agenda and rules of work. 
There are four items on the agenda: the election of working 
bodies, the rules of the first session, the election of chairman 
of the Federation Council, and the election of vice chairmen. 
  The majority of the deputies demanded that the government 
present a report because they believe that it does not know the 
economic and social situation in the country. Following 
debates, the decision was taken to ask Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin or some other leading Cabinet member to address the 
Federation Council. 
  The rules of the session consist of 14 articles. If the 
session is attended by two-thirds of the elected deputies (114), 
the session shall be considered legitimate. One of the articles 
defines the duties of the chairperson. During sessions he shall 
have no right to comment on the deputies' speeches. Another 
article says that the Federation Council's chairman and vice 
chairmen shall be elected during a secret ballot. Each 
candidacy to the post of vice chairman shall be discussed and a 
separate vote shall be held on it. 
  After a break, at about 16:00, the working bodies of the 
Federation Council's session will be elected, and debates will 
be held on the election of the Federation Council's chairman and 
vice chairmen.

  [Text] Moscow January 11 TASS -- Territorial associations 
in the Federation Council will pose a threat to interaction of 
the legislative and executive authorities, North Ossetian 
parliament head Akhsarbek Galazov told ITAR-TASS here today. 
  A major task of the parliament upper chamber is the 
provision 
of efficient interaction between the State Duma, presidential 
structures, the government and regions. The chamber should 
"connect Russian federal power bodies with the authorities of 
territories, regions and republics," he said. 
  In his turn, Eduard Rossel, staunch advocate of the idea of 
the Urals republic and president of the association of economic 
interaction of Urals regions and republics, voiced the 
expediency of territorial associations in the Federation Council. 
  In his opinion, they should set up "regional parliament 
centers to unite local representatives of the State Duma and the 
Federation Council". He said the Urals association has been set 
up to include two republics and six regions. 
  Rossel noted they have not held consultations with other 
regions on the creation of similar "parliament centers", but it 
is planned to hold a conference of representatives of all 
Russian economic associations in February to continue the 
creation of similar associations on their basis. 
  Yuriy Boldyrev, a leader of the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin 
bloc, noted territorial factions will inevitably appear in the 
Federation Council due to different interests of republics, 
territories and autonomous formations and different political 
outlook. 
  Some deputies sharply criticize the idea of territorial 
associations. Nizhniy Novgorod regional governor Boris Nemtsov 
said they "pose greater threat than political factions in the 
Federation Council". In his opinion, territorial associations 
will deteriorate differences between various Russian regions. 
  Vladimir Shumeyko is negative about the associations. 
According to the constitution, the Federation Council shall be 
formed with representatives of executive and representative 
authorities of federation subjects and "it can include no 
factions or associations", he said. 
  According to Shumeyko, the upper chamber should think of the 
way legislation is applied throughout the Russian Federation and 
the influence of laws on the fate of regions. Members of the 
Federation Council should be responsible people, almost 
"senators," stressed Shumeyko. 
  Chairman of the Central Electoral Commission Nikolay Ryabov 
stressed the danger of territorial associations. In his 
opinion, federation subjects can settle their differences 
through compromises and cited as an example the proposal of 
Viktor Stepanov to nominate deputies from republics, regions and 
autonomous districts deputies of the Federation Council chairman.

<F P=106> ["Reportage from the Federal Assembly Chambers' Sitting" by </F>
R. Minasov, Ye. Skukin, and ITAR-TASS under the general heading 
"We Wish You Success, Russian Parliament!"] 
  [Excerpts] Following his address at the opening of the 
Federation Council's first sitting, Russian Federation President 
Boris Yeltsin proposed that, until a chamber chairman is 
elected, the "reins" be handed over to the oldest deputy. This 
proved to be Peasants Party Chairman Yuriy Chernichenko, elected 
from Moscow City District. The chamber members voted that he 
take the chairman's seat. 
  In his turn, Yuriy Chernichenko proposed an expansion of the 
structure of elders and invited Yuriy Matochkin and Yevgeniy 
Krasnoyarov, heads of administration of Kaliningrad and Sakhalin 
Oblasts, respectively, to take their seats behind the presidium 
table, "thus encompassing all of Russia, from coast to coast." 
  Having elected, in accordance with the agenda, the sitting's 
first working organ, the deputies heard a report from Nikolay 
Ryabov, chairman of the Russian Federation Central Electoral 
Commission. Having emphasized that "the elections to the 
Federal Assembly were for the first time ever free from 
ideological fetters," he briefed deputies on the course of the 
election campaign which "disproved the prevailing opinion about 
the Russians' passiveness and lack of interest in politics." 
The Central Electoral Commission chairman presented a 
statistical sketch of the composition of the corps of deputies. 
It includes people of 29 nationalities, 76 percent of whom are 
Russians. The age of one-half of the chamber's members ranges 
between 25 and 50 years. There is a total of nine women. All 
have higher education, except two whose higher education has not 
been completed. Some 80 percent of deputies have described 
themselves as nonparty members. More than 50 percent are 
representatives of organs of executive power. The new chamber 
contains 49 former Russian Federation people's deputies. 
  A Credentials Commission was elected to verify the deputies' 
mandates. 
  Our new parliament resembles a large ship, only just 
launched 
from the stocks to face the gales and storms. The next few days 
will tell whether its cruise will be propitious and successful, 
whether it will manage to safely navigate the reefs and shoals. 
  For the time being, however, everything appeared more than 
propitious on the surface at the first sitting of the State 
Duma, which was held at the former City Hall building on 
Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment yesterday, 11 January: Deputies 
wore generous smiles and warmly greeted one another. Even 
though it is an open secret that the seeds of confrontation were 
already sown long before the start of the State Duma's work, 
especially as regards the distribution of leadership positions 
in the lower chamber and its committees, as well as its standing 
orders. 
  God grant that these seeds do not produce luxuriant and 
poisonous shoots! After all, what we need is not a shooting and 
maliciously growling parliament, but a lawmaking and sensible 
one. Will the State Duma, disbanded on four occasions in the 
course of its history, this time manage to at long last adapt to 
conditions in the Russian political field? 
  We addressed this question to Sergey Yushenkov (Russia's 
Choice): 
  "The Duma will survive because, in accordance with the new 
Constitution, its functions and powers are clearly defined. It 
has two powerful levers to influence the executive branch: 
lawmaking and the budget." 
  Stanislav Zhebrovskiy, deputy chairman of the LDPR [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia]: 
  "We will be a constructive force. Our party is in opposition 
to the government, but we intend to become a constructive 
opposition. We intend to act autonomously, without joining any 
blocs." 
  Vasiliy Lipitskiy (independent): 
  "There are grounds to assume that the State Duma will 
survive. There will be a problem as regards the way relations 
will develop between lawmakers, the president, and the executive 
branch. I would very much like to see them being proper from 
the very first day." 
  Let us look around us in the few minutes remaining until the 
opening of the first sitting. As always, the journalistic 
fraternity's attention is focused on Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. He 
is surrounded by a solid crowd of photographers, television 
reporters, and correspondents with their tape recorders, making 
it impossible to get close to him. One of our colleagues sadly 
remarked: "We are creating his own image." 
  LDPR member Georgiy Lukava opened the sitting on behalf of 
the State Duma elders. He congratulated the deputies on the 
start of their work and expressed the hope that it will be 
fruitful and coordinated. 
  Georgiy Lukava then gave the floor to Russian Federation 
Government Chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin. [passage omitted 
covered by referent item] 
  Aleksandr Ivanchenko, deputy chairman of the Central 
Electoral Commission, delivered a report on the results of the 
December elections to the Federal Assembly and the referendum on 
the Constitution. He announced that 439 deputies of the 444 
elected to the State Duma have been registered as present. 
  Let us return to the topic raised earlier in this reportage. 
Despite the diversity of political views, most deputies assume 
that the State Duma will actually prove capable of functioning. 
This is what the well-known economist Pavel Bunich said: 
  "I think that the technological market laws, which are most 
important for the country, will 'gallop through,' as the saying 
goes. The ideal and, in my view, attainable result in politics 
is to achieve neutrality." 
  Independent Deputy Anatoliy Dolgopolov, field ataman of 
Labinskiy Cossack Okrug, also advocates consolidation: 
  "The main point is to change course from the destructive 
tendencies in reform implementation to constructive politics. 
We cossacks uphold the Russian people's interests and support 
firm presidential rule. We would like to work the land, not to 
fight as Zhirinovskiy would have it. 
  "We have spent so long fighting, that it is time to start 
rebuilding that which has been destroyed." 
  The agenda of the first sittings includes questions 
concerning the ratification of the provisions of the State 
Duma's Standing Orders on factions and deputies' groups and the 
formation of factions and deputies' groups, the election of 
State Duma chairman and deputy chairmen, the formation of 
committees and the election of their leaders, the adoption of 
the State Duma Standing Orders, and the ratification of the list 
of urgent questions for the State Duma's first session. 
  The evening sitting was adjourned indefinitely due to the 
chairman's total incapacity and incompetence. Deputies proposed 
that Chairman Georgiy Lukava be replaced and that the future 
chairmanship of sittings be assigned to the State Duma 
Secretariat.

  [Text] The Russian president's press secretary, Vyacheslav 
Kostikov, told journalists that Boris Yeltsin had fears about 
the work of the new parliament, but pinned great hopes on it. 
He also said that the information about consultations in the 
parliamentary factions suggests that the work of the new 
parliament, above all the State Duma, would not be easy. 
  "Confrontational moods may triumph," he said. He noted, 
however, that the new Constitution gave the president enough 
powers to prevent revenging forces in the parliament from fully 
expressing themselves. 
  Kostikov told Interfax that the president's attitude to both 
chambers was positive. "Yeltsin is the president of all Russian 
citizens and respects the choice of the nation, however 
contradictory it might be," he said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 11 TASS -- The Federation Council's 
Credentials Committee, which was elected today at the first 
meeting of the new Russian parliament's upper chamber, 
recognized the powers of all 171 deputies elected to the 
Federation Council of the first convocation. Under the 
Constitution, the Federation Council is to consist of 178 
lawmakers, however the ballot in Tatarstan and the Chelyabinsk 
region was declared invalid and new elections are to be called 
there, Chechnya did not hold parliamentary elections at all, and 
one deputy only has been elected in the Yamal-Nenets autonomous 
district so far. 
  After their rights were confirmed, the lawmakers elected 
working bodies of the first meeting -- a secretariat, a 
vote-counting commission which is to count the votes until the 
conference hall is computerized, and an editing commission. 
  Then the deputies passed on to discuss a procedure for the 
Federation Council's first meeting. The discussion was quite 
calm and short. Even the item on a procedure for electing the 
upper house speaker did not provoke heated debates, although the 
vote itself is likely to become the most acute and difficult 
event at the meeting. The gathering agreed that candidatures 
for the post of chairman are to be nominated by deputies by 
secret ballot. Only one name can be written on the ballot. To 
become the Federation Council chairman, a deputy must poll over 
half the total votes. A special reservation stipulates that the 
speaker and his deputies cannot represent one and the same 
subject of the Federation. 
  When discussing the issue of "notorious quorum" and keeping 
in mind the constant lack of it at sessions of the former 
Supreme Soviet legislature, the lawmakers ruled that "a meeting 
is regarded as having legal powers if the attendance is no less 
than two thirds of the elected deputies".

  [Text] Moscow January 11 TASS -- Four out of 17 candidates 
will run on Wednesday for the post of the speaker of the upper 
chamber of the Russian parliament, the Federation Council, and 
First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Shumeyko is clearly in the 
lead. 
  On Tuesday 78 deputies nominated Shumeyko for the post and 
he 
needs 86 votes to become the speaker, a half plus one vote of 
171 registered members of the upper chamber. 
  The other three candidates are far behind Shumeyko. Petr 
Romanov, director of a plant in the Siberian city of 
Krasnoyarsk, was nominated by 13 lawmakers, Eduard Rossel, 
former head of the Sverdlovsk region and a staunch advocate of 
the Ural republic idea, got 10 votes, while former Industry 
Minister Aleksandr Titkin - 6. 
  Shumeyko told TASS that he would not quit the race even if 
lawmakers insist on that. "I do not intend to withdraw my 
candidature even if I am offered to", he said.

  [Excerpts] Moscow, 11 Jan -- Deputies from democratic 
factions are dissatisfied with the way the State Duma began its 
work, mainly due to the inexperience of an LDPR [Liberal 
Democratic party of Russia] member Georgiy Lukava, who is 
chairing the session, and his clear bias toward some parties. 
They believe that the establishment of a 50-seat minimum during 
the formation of factions will lead to the centrist parties 
being defeated and to the opposition playing a domineering role 
in the parliament. 
  The sitting of the State Duma, which opened at Moscow's 
Mayoralty this morning, focused on the struggle around the 
establishment of the minimum number of seats in a faction. 
While representatives of democratic groups favour a 20- or even 
a 14-seat minimum, the LDPR, the Communist party, the Agrarian 
party, and the Democratic Party of Russia advocate the 
introduction of a 50-seat minimum. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Moscow, 11 Jan -- The atmosphere in the State Duma 
building deteriorated sharply today immediately on resumption of 
work after the daytime break over a conflict concerning the 
person in the chair. 
  A number of deputies immediately demanded that Georgiy 
Lukava, a deputy from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
[LDPR], be replaced as chairman of the session as, in the view 
of many, his lack of experience meant he was not up to the task. 
In accordance with the Constitution, Georgiy Lukava opened the 
first session of the State Duma as the oldest of the deputies, 
and it was thought that he would chair the session until a 
speaker was elected. 
  Some deputies suggested that Georgiy Lukava should give up 
his place to one of the more competent deputies by means of a 
Duma resolution. However, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the LDPR 
leader, from a microphone in the hall, gave the stand-in 
chairman a categorical instruction "to go nowhere, switch off 
the microphone, and not allow anyone onto the podium." He 
demanded that discussion of the issue of the numbers in a 
faction be resumed, having been stopped before the break, and if 
necessary that "the militia be called." 
  The indignant deputies protested and refused to take part in 
the electronic registration announced by Georgiy Lukava. As a 
result, the electronic board showed that there was no quorum 
several times in a row. The first session of the State Duma 
continues -- for the time being -- in a less than constructive 
spirit.

  [Text] Moscow January 11 TASS -- Election of speaker of the 
lower chamber of the Russian Parliament will not be smooth; such 
is the opinion of many chiefs and member in groups of various 
parties in the Duma whose first meeting opened on Tuesday. 
  They wish this post to be filled by a representative of some 
small parliamentary group. ITAR-TASS learned this from a number 
of interviews at the first meeting of the State Duma. 
  The speaker will not emerge after the first round, believes 
Kirill Ignatyev, representative of Russia's Choice bloc. He 
believes that the nomination of a candidate by one of small 
parliamentary groups would be most suitable. Russia's Choice 
would support a number of candidates from such groups. It does 
not insist on its own candidate. "Should an aggressive majority 
of forces which can pursue the ideology of national 
exclusiveness, war and violence form, Russia's Choice bloc will 
have to offer its own candidate", Ignatyev said. The main task 
in parliament is to prevent decisions that could reverse 
economic transformations. 
  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy noted that the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin 
group is in favour of speaker from a small parliamentary group. 
He believes that in such case, speaker will be the least 
inclined to a standoff with large groups. He said that the 
priority task of groups in the lower chamber is to ensure normal 
operation of the parliament. He does not expect such a speaker 
to be elected promptly so that the regulations could be adopted 
and work begun. 
  Nicolay Travkin, head of the group of the Democratic Party 
of 
Russia, said that organising groups of deputies in the Duma is 
the main task at the first stage of its work. The election of 
speaker will depend on agreeing on a package. Unless such an 
agreement is reached, there will be voting on each individual 
candidate, and anyone can be elected. Travkin stressed the 
Democratic Party sees as its main task in parliament to turn it 
into an element of tranquillity and stability in the political 
life. Among the priorities of the parliamentary group of the 
Democratic Party will be the question of combatting crime. The 
choice of allies will depend on the matter at hand. 
  Leader of the parliamentary group of the Agrarian Party of 
Russia Mikhail Lapshin believes that the elections of speaker 
may pass smoothly and promptly if most of the groups of deputies 
show goodwill. 
  He said there were signs of goodwill before the opening of 
the Duma, and agreements could have been achieved if it were not 
for destructive stand of some groups of deputies. Among 
priorities of the group Lapshin named measures to protect the 
interests of peasants and the introduction of the passage of 
proposals connected with the functioning of the agroindustrial 
complex. The group of the Agrarian Party is prepared to 
cooperate with all the groups including that of the Choice of 
Russia. 
  The parliamentary group of the Communist Party of the 
Russian 
Federation is in favour of electing leading bodies of the Duma 
in a package, said the group's chief Gennadiy Zuyganov. He said 
that speaker could be elected form a small group and deputy 
speakers from large groups. He believes that each group could 
head one of the eight-ten committees. The leader of the 
Communist Party described the struggle for the change of the 
political and economic course, for conducting the "policy of 
construction, for the stabilisation of the political situation" 
as the parliament's chief task.

  [Text] Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Russian Unity and 
Accord Party, believes that Russia's Choice refusal to 
participate in consultations of major factions has given 
deputies from one-seat constituencies a better chance to be 
included in the management bodies of the State Duma. 
  In an interview to INTERFAX, he said that the proposal to 
elect candidates to all management bodies of the chamber on a 
basis of a single list would have little support. Sergey 
Shakhray said that the media and independent deputies favor 
individual and secret voting for every candidate. 
  He believes that the parliamentary chairman should have only 
two deputies, one from the party list and the other from a 
one-seat constituency.

<F P=106> [Olga Gerasimenko article: "Today is the First Working Day </F>
of the New Russian Parliament. What Does Fate Have in Store for 
It? What is Best: A Good Council or a Strong Duma?"] 
  [Text] The State Duma deputies who have reached Moscow 
after overcoming every conceivable obstacle in the fight for 
seats still do not suspect that the main battle is yet to come. 
Each of them will have to fit into the unwieldy structure of 
the Duma and satisfy their own personal ambitions at the same 
time. 
  According to a plan existing at the Duma each deputy apart 
from the State Duma chairman, the deputy chairmen, and the 
chairmen of the factions, must be a member of one of its 
committees. 
  In all it is planned to create 18 committees. However, this 
figure changed constantly while the plan was being worked out. 
Representatives of the president's side actively promoted the 
idea of forming no more than 10 committees within the Duma each 
of which would be in charge of several global spheres 
simultaneously. 
  The present plan for the operation of the State Duma 
committees exactly reflects the structure of the executive 
branch of power (in the form of ministries and departments) 
which is designed to make it as easy as possible for parliament 
to perform its monitoring functions. 
  Undoubtedly the authors of the plan for the internal 
organization of the Duma copied much from the parliament 
disbanded by the president. Let us recall here that in the 
bicameral Supreme Soviet there were just over 250 deputies 
working on a permanent basis in 19 committees and eight standing 
commissions. These committees and commissions performed the 
functions of a primary filter carrying out the preliminary 
examination of draft laws. Similar functions will be inherited 
by the 18 committees of the State Duma. Furthermore, even the 
names of the committees have been changed only slightly. The 
really striking innovations are not very important: Now, for 
example, questions of constitutional legislation and human 
rights have been transferred to one committee (and not two as in 
the former Supreme Soviet). 
  On the other hand two new committees have appeared: one on 
the budget and taxes, the other on banks, credit, and money 
circulation. The new structure does not have a committee on the 
mass media but does have a committee on the organization of the 
work of the State Duma. 
  It is still not clear which principles will determine how 
deputies will be distributed among the committees. The 
factions' opinions vary on this score: Some think that the sole 
guiding principle should be the professional training of Duma 
members (but what about "Yabloko," for example, which has four 
specialists in foreign affairs): Others insist that you should 
only take into account the personal preference of the deputy 
himself (however, apparatchiks of the former Supreme Soviet 
still recall that out of the 1041 deputies in the former 
parliament 700 were registered with the committee for 
international relations). "Russia's Choice," "Yabloko," and the 
Party of Russian Unity and Accord have put forward their own 
approaches: Namely, to form committees on the principle of the 
proportional representation of the factions and independent 
deputies. The points system for evaluating posts in the Duma 
has been constructed according to this plan: The post of State 
Duma chairman is rated at five points, the deputy chairman at 
three points, the chairman of the tellers commission at two 
points, a committee chairman at one point, and his deputy at 0.5 
points. 
  According to the author of this plan, each faction and 
deputies' group will receive a strictly defined number of points 
depending on the percentage of their representatives in the Duma. 
  The pro-president side is also proposing a voting mechanism 
based on that idea -- the State Duma approves a list of 
committee chairmen and up to two deputies. Only after that is 
the composition of the committees as a whole approved. 
  It is already obvious now that the struggle for the posts of 
the chairmen of two of the 18 Duma committees -- defense and 
international relations -- will be the most keenly fought. The 
activity of these committees, given that the powers conferred on 
them (the defense policy of the Russian Federation and the 
ratification and denunciation of Russia's international 
treaties) will have the greatest impact including for the 
president. Incidentally, the posts of chairmen of those two 
committees are being regarded as on a par with the speaker of 
the lower chamber of parliament. V. Zhirinovskiy, leader of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], is definitely 
competing for the post of chairman of the international 
relations committee and with an ulterior motive. 
  Quite a few lances have been broken over the question of the 
Duma's leading organ. There have been different suggestions 
both for the actual title (presidium, conference, or council) 
and the mechanism for the formation of this organ. (Let me 
remind you here that the presidium of the former Supreme Soviet 
was formed from the chairman of the Supreme Soviet, his four 
deputies, and the chairmen of the two chambers, of the 
committees, and of the commissions as ex officio members). 
  It is planned to form the Duma council from the speaker, the 
deputy speakers (ranging in number from two to five), and 
representatives of the factions on the principle of 
proportionality. However, it is proposed that the chairmen of 
the committees will only be given a consultative vote. 
  Many factions tend to see the Duma council as a powerful 
link 
in the internal structure of the lower chamber. 
  Deputies have a legitimate interest in the solution of the 
question of the right to freely change factions within the Duma. 
The "Russia's Choice" deputies are unambiguously insisting on 
"feudal law" although they will surely hardly be able to enforce 
such a "political loyalty" -- the resistance of the communists, 
agrarians, and the LDPR is too great. 
  Incidentally, it is quite likely that another faction, the 
ninth so far, will soon appear in the Duma under the leadership 
of Sergey Baburin, the independent deputy from Omsk. For that 
to happen he needs to unite at least 14 like-minded deputies 
around himself. 
  It only remains to be added that all the proposals on the 
organization of the Duma must unfailingly be approved by the 
deputies.

  [Text] A leader of the Russian Communist Party's faction, 
ex- chairman of the Soviet parliament and member of the 1991 
State of Emergency Committee Anatoliy Lukyanov, who was elected 
to the State Duma from the Smolensk Region, told Interfax on 
Tuesday that the beginning of the State Duma's work was a new 
stage in the life of society which could bring about signs of 
stabilization. Lukyanov is convinced that social stabilization 
largely depended on the policies pursued by the Russian 
president and was possible if the hopeless shock therapy was 
brushed away. 
  Leader of the Democratic Party, Nikolay Travkin, told 
Interfax that the current State Duma was the weakest legislative 
body in Soviet and Russian history. He said that the Soviet 
parliament was the strongest. The radical moods have triumphed 
and society has elected the most radical deputies to the 
parliament, he said. He noted, however, that the deputies' 
rigid organization and experience were the new parliament's 
strong points. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the leader of the Democratic Party, 
who scored the greatest number of votes among the deputies 
representing political parties (23 percent), does not intend to 
discuss the October events or the legitimacy of the adopted 
Constitution as opposition deputies propose. "We must carry 
on," he told Interfax. Speaking about possible candidates to the 
post of the State Duma's chairman, Zhirinovskiy said that he 
would not vote for anyone except the representative of his 
faction, Vladimir Gusev. (Gusev was born in 1932. He is the 
vice president of the scientific and industrial corporation 
"Promyshlennik"). 
  Yegor Gaydar, the leader of the Russia's Choice faction, 
said 
in an interview with Interfax that he did not support the idea 
of setting up a parliamentary commission for investigating the 
events in Moscow on October 3 and 4. He believes that the 
establishment of such a commission would violate the principle 
of division of power. He also said that his faction would 
support the candidacy of Russian ambassador to the U.S. Vladimir 
Lukin (the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc) to the post of the 
State Duma's chairman, although his faction was ready to support 
any other acceptable neutral candidate. 
  Another representative of Russia's Choice, Mikhail 
Poltoranin, stated that his faction would propose the candidacy 
of Sergey Kovalyov, a prominent human rights activist who led 
Russia's Choice during the elections. Poltoranin believes that 
if Kovalyov fails to score enough votes, his faction would vote 
for Lukin. 
  Chairman of the Karelian parliament and member of the 
Federation Council, Viktor Stepanov, believes that the post of 
speaker has been reserved for Moscow's representative. He also 
believes that this post will be contested by First Vice Premier 
Vladimir Shumeyko and ex-chairman of the Moscow Council Nikolay 
Gonchar. Stepanov told Interfax, however, that the choice of 
the parliament speaker was the most acute problem and that 
debates would last for several days. 
  Stepanov does not rule out the possibility of creating 
factions in the Federation Council. In his opinion factions 
will be created on the basis of territorial and political 
principles. He also noted that representatives of the republics 
would pursue the policy of broadening and strengthening 
federalism. 
  President of Kalmykia and member of the Federation Council 
Kirsan Ilyumzhinov supports the idea of setting up a 
parliamentary commission for investigating the events in Moscow 
last October. He told journalists that the government's actions 
during those events must be qualified as anti-constitutional. 
  Ilyumzhinov believes that the Federation Council must ensure 
the consolidation of society, which is blighted with a deep 
crisis. "If economic recession continues and living standards 
continue to fall, social tremors will become inevitable," he 
said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 11 TASS -- After heated debate the 
Russian State Duma reached on Tuesday [11 January] a compromise 
on the first issue it had to solve -- the minimum number for 
lawmakers to be able to register as an official parliamentary 
group. 
  The compromise set the figure at 35. The opposition proposed 
50, while reformers insisted on 20. 
  Lawmaker Anatoliy Lukyanov, former Soviet parliament 
speaker, 
explained that the State Duma will consist of groups and 
factions which will enjoy equal rights. The minimum number of 
members for factions will be 14. This is the number of seats 
enjoyed by the Democratic Party of Russia which was the last 
among eight election blocs to overcome the five per cent hurdle 
in the December elections. 
  Another compromise was reached on the issue of the interim 
chairman. Several lawmakers called to replace Georgiy Lukava 
from the party of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who they said is 
inexperienced in the job. 
  Now the session will be chaired by three oldest deputies in 
turn for two hours each -- Vladimir Bokov, Sergey Kovalev and 
Georgiy Lukava. 
  The Duma also elected Sergey Stankevich, the sacked 
presidential aide, to head the interim secretariat consisting of 
20 people. 
  Igor Bratishchev was elected head of the vote-counting 
commission while Grigoriy Bondarev became the chairman of the 
interim commission for procedural rules. 
  The interim secretariat will include five commissions -- for 
registration of deputies' associations, for organisation of the 
Duma sessions, for registration of deputies' proposals, for 
public relations, for work with proposals on Duma's schedule.

<F P=106> [Sergey Chugayev report: "In the State Duma, 11 January, </F>
1000: Calls for Cooperation Against the Backdrop of the First 
Skirmishes"] 
  [Excerpts] The first sitting of the Russian State Duma 
passed off under the banner of a wish to avoid confrontation 
from the very beginning. This was the reason why the agenda 
comprised questions agreed in advance among the factions. 
Elections for the tellers' commission, the commission for 
overseeing the electronic ballot, and the provisional 
secretariat took place without any particular difficulties. 
[passage omitted] 
  It was expected that some differences of opinion might arise 
during discussion of the Central Electoral Commission's report, 
delivered by Deputy Chairman A. Ivanchenko. Among other things, 
he reported that a total of 444 deputies representing 32 
nationalities had been elected to the State Duma (of which 430 
were present for the first session), that 95 percent of them 
have higher or incomplete higher education, and that one in 10 
deputies is a professor, academic, and so on. However, it was 
not this interesting information which proved the cause of 
conflict but rather the Central Electoral Commission's blatant 
attempt in delivering the report to preclude all questions 
associated with the election of deputies. Even the possibility 
of a proposal not to set up a credentials commission in the Duma 
but to transfer its functions to the Central Electoral 
Commission has not been ruled out. However, State Duma members 
are determined pretty unanimously to include a discussion of the 
Central Electoral Commission's Report in the agenda, so a 
credentials commission will probably be set up anyway. 
  Nevertheless, despite all the efforts, clashes in the 
opening 
hours of the Duma's work could not be avoided. As expected, the 
opening skirmishes took place in connection with the Statute on 
Deputies' Factions. 
  During preliminary consultations, deputies were unable to 
reach accord in respect of the minimum number of deputies 
required in order to secure the right to set up a faction. 
Communist representatives suggested that the ceiling be raised 
to a minimum of 50. Communist Leader G. Zyuganov justified this 
stance by saying that a multitude of small radical factions and 
groups will otherwise take shape in the Duma and paralyze its 
work as a result. Democratic Party of Russia Leader N. Travkin 
spoke in support of this. 
  Their opponents' proposal to reduce the minimum to 14 was 
put 
forward by "Russia's Choice" and supported by Shakhray's party, 
as well as supporters of "August" represented by I. Khakamada. 
As for the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], its 
leader, Zhirinovskiy, adopted an emphatically neutral stance, 
declaring that any outcome would satisfy him. 
  There has already been occasion in the preceding edition to 
write about the reasons behind the tension. The matter concerns 
the plans of "Russia's Choice." If it is decided to form 
factions comprising 14 deputies, "Russia's Choice" may split 
into several amicable factions in order to strengthen its 
influence in the Duma. 
  Among other things, a faction leader has the right of access 
to the microphone out of turn, plus other privileges. Of 
course, this situation does not benefit the Communists and the 
Agrarians. The situation is further complicated by shortcomings 
in the electronic balloting system, as well as many deputies' 
dissatisfaction that it was an LDPR representative who chaired 
the sitting. By the time the first recess began, passions were 
noticeably stirred. 
  As a result, the nigh-on hour-long debate failed to 
culminate 
in accord despite the well coordinated actions of the Communists 
and the Agrarians in defending a quota of 50 people. The 20-man 
quota supported by the democratic factions also failed to 
attract a majority of votes.

  [Text] The sitting of the State Duma "is going on with 
numerous violations of general norms and rules, but this is a 
syndrome of the first day." This was the assessment of the 
State Duma's first day of work voiced by the executive secretary 
of the Russia's Choice faction Sergey Yushenkov in his interview 
with INTERFAX. In his opinion, one can already make a 
conclusion that one of the largest factions in the new Russian 
parliament, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (leader -- 
Vladimir Zhirinovsky), "has good organization and discipline and 
acts exclusively in accordance with its leader's instructions." 
  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the bloc Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev- 
Lukin, believes that "the conflict in the State Duma will be a 
permanent one under the present structure of the parliament." 
At the same time, this will not affect the fate of economic 
reforms in Russia, he said. During his conversation with our 
INTERFAX correspondent he reminded that according to the 
Constitution adopted in December, all issues related to economic 
reforms had been handed over to the Russian president. "The 
reforms' future is in Mr. Yeltsin's hands," he noted. 
  Gennadiy Burbulis (Russia's Choice bloc) believes that there 
is a balance of political forces in the State Duma, there are 
about 50 percent of democrats and 50 percent of conservatives in 
it. He thinks that many radicals, including the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia, came to the State Duma "with the aim 
to participate at the presidential 1996 elections." The Duma 
will be "a difficult and clamorous one but it will not abandon 
the legal political activity, which the deputies have acquired 
during the elections, another time," Burbulis is convinced. He 
again categorically spoke against any opportunity to cooperate 
with Zhirinovskiy and his party. 
  Leader of the communist party's faction Gennadiy Zyuganov 
estimates the beginning of the Duma's work as "a natural normal 
process of getting accustomed under the new situation" given the 
fact that "neither the chairman nor the deputies have 
appropriate experience of parliamentary work." However, he 
believes that the majority of the Duma's deputies demonstrate 
"sound sense and do not resort to excessive polemics." He hopes 
that today the deputies will manage to solve the issue on the 
number of factions and not to lower it to less than 35 people. 
Thanks to this, he said, we'll manage to gather leaders of 
deputies associations on Tuesday evening and develop a draft of 
joint proposals. 
  Mikhail Poltoranin (Russia's Choice) believes that the Duma 
works nonconstructively. Under this situation, he said in his 
conversation with our INTERFAX correspondent, "I would like to 
rise and say: Dear Misters, according to available information, 
there are still reserve tank shells in the Taman division, 
that's why, let us work more constructively."

<F P=106> [Statements by academician Aleksey Yemelyanov, State Duma </F>
deputy for "Russia's Choice" electoral bloc, and State Duma 
Deputy Konstantin Zatulin of Russian Unity and Accord: "What Is 
in Their Baggage?"] 
  [Text] Academician Aleksey Yemelyanov: 
  I wish to confess at once that the mood in which I will 
attend the first session of the Duma differs significantly from 
my mood in 1989. At that time we people's deputies of the 
former USSR attended the first congress inspired and full of 
hope. It seemed only necessary to be elementarily honest and to 
learn how to expose society's diseases uncompromisingly, and our 
life would change cardinally for the better. We were surrounded 
by a halo of glory and honor on the part of the voters, and this 
accounted for the euphoria with which we were overflowing. 
  Much has changed now. The times have changed, and our 
perception of the world has changed. Mere slogans about 
democracy are plainly insufficient to refashion life for the 
better. We have realized how responsible the post of deputy of 
the top organ of representative power nonetheless is. I will 
name just one of the lessons which we must not forget: Holding 
rallies and parliamentarianism are not one and the same thing. 
We are going to the Duma not to ascertain political 
predilections and sympathies but to get down to business. It is 
important that all deputies -- both each individual deputy and 
those united in groups, factions, and blocs -- advance to the 
fore not personal ambitions or a desire for power but the 
interests of Russia and its many millions of people. 
  We have no alternative but to seek accord. Our society was 
paralyzed by political confrontation. Russia's former 
parliament took virtually no steps to overcome political 
confrontation. Now, I believe, everyone has realized that 
destiny itself and life itself doom us to accord. 
  I hope that our work in the Duma will help to stabilize both 
society and our economy. There is no alternative to reforms. 
But a correction clearly must be made to the paths which they 
will take. The social thrust of the reforms must be 
strengthened. I absolutely agree with the president when he 
says that we have tried the people's patience long enough, that 
there is a limit to this patience. The reforms must be carried 
out in the future not by means of lowering the people's living 
standards. The opportunities for this now are broader than at 
the time when we were only starting the reforms. 
  I believe that together with the president and together with 
the government the deputies of the top legislative organ of 
power will be able to find the solution to key problems in our 
life. The "Russia's Choice" bloc is ready for this. 
  Konstantin Zatulin: 
  The consolidation of various parliamentary factions depends 
on the reinstatement of the center, which is kicked around by 
everyone. The center is the blue helmets who are capable of 
keeping extreme forces away from confrontation. In the sphere 
of creating a coalition the PRUA [Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord] intends to orient itself toward groups of independent 
deputies representing industrialists, entrepreneurs, and 
autonomous entities. In particular, I am authorized by the 
party to hold talks with a number of political movements. 
  Insisting on the reform option which will not cause 
productive forces to be smothered, our faction will submit to 
the lower chamber a number of new draft laws concerning 
regulation in the budget-finance and tax spheres. 
  In the foreign policy sphere the party advocates Russia's 
reorientation away from distant toward nearby foreign parts and 
the creation of a confederation within the CIS framework. The 
draft of such a treaty is one of the ideas which we will attempt 
to get through the State Duma. 
  As the party of the provinces, we will devote many draft 
laws 
to regional policy. The powers and rights of the regions must 
be clearly outlined. 
  The PRUA has always supported the Constitution and the 
president and has been in favor of political stability and 
against all sorts of early elections and impeachments. The 
deputies of our faction are inclined to work for the whole term 
allocated to them by law and to instill order in the country by 
peaceful and legitimate means together with the president.

  [Text] [Announcer] The State Duma will resume its sittings 
on Thursday 13 January. Today, the pickets at the building of 
the State Duma expressed their liking for the deputies. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Aleksandr Lutskoy] About 
100 
supporters of the idea of communism and the restoration of the 
Soviet Union, under red banners and singing revolutionary songs 
to the accompaniment of accordions, gathered this morning near 
the building of the State Duma. The pickets chanted 
antigovernment and antipresidential slogans and expressed 
fervent approval of the communist deputies. 
  The latter, in turn, expressed gratitude for the support. 
  [Lutskoy, addressing Communist Deputy R. Gostev] You 
represent the Communists. 
  [Gostev] Yes. 
  [Lutskoy] What is your attitude toward the government? The 
present one? 
  [Gostev] It is a critical one. 
  [Lutskoy] Do you think we need a consolidation of all powers 
at present, both of the executive and the legislative powers? 
  [Gostev] Yes, certainly. 
  [Lutskoy] But if your attitude is a critical one what do you 
think should be done in respect of the present government? 
  [Gostev] We have a lot of questions for the government, and 
it is possible that finally a question on the resignation of the 
government will be raised. 
  [Lutskoy] Your attitude toward the LDPR [Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia]? 
  [Gostev] I think that one should regard the LDPR as a party 
that exists. But I think that to say that this is a party of 
fascists, etc, I believe that is wrong. LDPR reflects..., with 
the stand that Zhirinovskiy has put forward he has managed to 
strike a chord with people. 
  [Lutskoy] The communist deputies, having talked to the 
gathering, went off to work in the Duma, while the pickets 
continued rallying. [end recording] [video shows people on the 
street carrying anti-government slogans, singing, shouting; also

<F P=106> [Unattributed feature: "Federal Assembly: Combat or </F>
Cooperation? Leaders' Positions Stated. Will They Be Confirmed 
by Deeds?"] 
  [Text] The work of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly 
begins today. It seems that everything has been said, all 
priorities have been defined, and the accents have been placed. 
But at the same time there is a welter of questions. There are 
as many positions as factions, as many opinions as deputies. 
Our brief review will remind readers of what the main political 
blocs are bringing to parliament with them. 
  Gennadiy Burbulis, elected to the Duma from the 
Russia's Choice list, stipulates the position of his supporters 
in parliament as being the aim of "ensuring stability in the 
country without losing the fundamental course toward profound 
democratic transformations." He believes that it is dangerous 
for the reformist bloc not so much to remain in the minority as 
to "lose face in society and the confidence of voters." 
  Although the Civic Union did not clear the 5-percent barrier 
in the elections on party lists, its leader Arkadiy 
Volskiy expresses the belief that a Civic Union faction 
will be formed in parliament and will include at least 25-30 
deputies, elected from single-seat districts. The centrists' 
leader is one of those politicians who believe that the 
government's voluntary resignation and the formation of a new 
one, which the president could entrust to Viktor Chernomyrdin, 
is necessary from the outset of the Federal Assembly's work. 
Despite the clear defeat of the "center" in the elections, 
Volskiy is pinning his hopes on the formation of an association 
of centrist forces in parliament, which could be a guarantee 
against the State Duma's political instability, primarily 
against right-wing "Zhirinovskiy" extremism. 
  Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party 
of the Russian Federation, who on the eve of the elections put 
forward the formation of a strong political opposition in 
parliament as one of his association's main tasks, is now 
actively demonstrating the intention to cooperate with all 
parliamentary blocs. Commenting on the progress of talks with 
the three other biggest factions on the nomination of the 
speaker and leaders of parliamentary committees, he expressed 
the idea, not devoid of sophistication, that Communist deputies 
should defend "the interests of all factions," including 
Russia's Choice. What he possibly has in mind here is the 
proposal that representatives of each faction represented in 
parliament head one "key" committee each. One minor detail: 
This would mean sharing out these committees among factions 
without offending anyone and obtaining the support of all other 
Duma members. 
  The declaration of intent to cooperate constructively with 
political opponents could lead to a conflict with the program of 
priority initiatives elaborated by the Communist Party of the 
Russian Federation leadership, which include forming a State 
Duma commission to ascertain "the circumstances and 
socioeconomic and political consequences of the Belovezhskaya 
Agreements," and a number of draft laws of an economic nature 
aimed at changing the government's policy of reforms. 
  Alevtina Fedulova, chairman of the Union of Women 
of Russia, heads the Women of Russia faction in parliament. Her 
name is on the list of candidates for the speaker's post. What 
favors Fedulova is not only her membership of the "small" 
centrist faction, as a guarantee of political moderation, but 
also the fact that she belongs to the fair sex -- a guarantee of 
sensible conservatism, thoughtfulness, and loyalty to all 
deputies. In the opinion of Fedulova herself the speaker's sex 
should not play a decisive role; the main condition is that the 
speaker must not be a person of "extreme" political convictions. 
In order for the State Duma to work constructively "its leader 
must be able to collaborate with everyone and not waste time on 
bickering." 
  "Disturber of the Peace" Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
heads the Liberal Democratic faction, and after the elections 
retains the image of the most active politician among his 
deputies, having had time to tour Europe and cause a furor with 
his comments on the subject of international politics. In the 
State Duma Zhirinovskiy aspires at least to the chairmanship of 
the international affairs committee, and generally his appetites 
extend much further -- he is prepared to head the Russian 
Foreign Ministry. 
  As regards the faction as a whole, according to Stanislav 
Zhebrovskiy, first deputy chairman of the Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia, it "will not set itself the aim of 
confrontation" in parliament and intends to work in a regime of 
"constructive opposition." Evidently he deems the proposal for 
the State Duma to consider the draft edict on a general 
political and economic amnesty, including terminating the 
judicial proceedings in the case of the State Committee for the 
State of Emergency and absolving "from any type of 
responsibility" everyone who took part in the events of October 
1993, to be one of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia's 
"constructive" initiatives. 
  Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party of Russian 
Unity and Accord, has reaffirmed his intention to run for State 
Duma speaker, because he considers himself one of the few people 
who can ensure collaboration between the legislative and 
executive branches and who "is capable of opposing 
Zhirinovskiy." The Party of Russian Unity and Accord, which has 
twenty votes in the State Duma, intends to preserve its 
organizational and political autonomy in parliament and "is not 
prepared" to enter into a coalition with "Russia's Choice." At 
the same time the Party of Russian Unity and Accord faction is 
ready to cooperate with everyone who in the Duma will adopt "a 
position of unity and accord in Russia" and with whom common 
ground is found during the passage of specific draft laws. Based 
on this position, Shakhray comes out sharply against the "pact" 
between major factions on cadre nominations in parliament and 
defends the rights of all factions as well as "independent" 
deputies elected from single-seat districts. 
  It is well known that the Party of Russian Unity and Accord 
parliamentary faction advocates the submission of the question 
of confidence in the government to the Duma and has already made 
such a proposal to the head of government. Shakhray stated 
that, if such a vote takes place, his faction will support 
Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
  The Democratic Party of Russia faction, headed by 
Nikolay Travkin, is seeking the formation of a 
political "center" in the State Duma to balance the "government" 
bloc and the extreme opposition. However, even now its leader's 
comments can be seen as establishing preconditions for the 
centrists not to play an autonomous role in parliament but to 
become a source from which the Agrarians and the Communists can 
draw additional votes, as was once the case in the Supreme 
Soviet. If a coalition is possible with parties which are 
actually of a democratic persuasion, it will only be so on 
individual questions, and the closest ally will be Yavlinskiy's 
bloc, with its strong social democratic element. 
  Nikolay Travkin, as leader of a small but well-structured 
party, advocates rigid factional discipline and the right of any 
faction to recall a deputy. In Travkin's opinion this rule 
should apply only to deputies elected from electoral 
associations' lists, and it does not violate their rights 
because "this principle is predetermined by the very multiparty 
nature of the elections." 
  The main task of the Federal Assembly's Agrarian faction, 
according to its leader Mikhail Lapshin, will be "to 
prevent land speculation and wastage" and strengthen state 
support for agricultural producers. The Agrarian Party, which 
has secured places for 21 deputies in the Duma from its lists, 
is counting on a large number of deputies joining it from the 
single-seat districts, thus increasing the faction to 60 seats. 
The Agrarians intend to submit to parliament draft laws on land 
and land use, on a switch to plan-regulated market relations in 
the agrarian sector, and on the social revival of the 
countryside. 
  A proposal to set up a commission to investigate the events 
of 3-4 October 1993 will probably be a political initiative of 
the Agrarians in parliament. "Parliament absolutely must make 
an assessment of the events...from the viewpoint of the 
Constitution" (presumably the old one), Lapshin has stated. "It 
is a fundamental matter for deputies.... Nobody must ever again 
be tempted to issue or carry out such commands." 
  The Russia's Choice bloc, in the opinion of its leader 
Yegor Gaydar, first deputy chairman of the 
government, is hoping "to wave goodbye to differences" and form 
a broad democratic coalition in the State Duma. Russia's Choice 
could find allies among antifascist forces of various 
orientations, not excluding the Communist Party of the Russian 
Federation. The Russia's Choice leader does not exclude the 
possibility of cooperating with the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia, thereby taking a position distinct from that of 
Vyacheslav Kostikov and Mikhail Poltoranin. 
  The government, Gaydar believes, deserves criticism for the 
decisions which should have been made earlier, above all in 
relation to the fight against crime. The time has now come to 
reshuffle it, and Russia's Choice activity in the State Duma 
will be aimed at, among other things, identifying potential 
cabinet members. 
  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the electoral 
association and parliamentary faction known by his name, 
believes that the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc will exercise 
the functions of an "independent, democratic, constructive 
opposition" in the State Duma. Defending the "basic values of 
democracy, freedom, and market economics," "Yabloko" advocates a 
tactical alliance with factions of a democratic persuasion, 
above all with Russia's Choice and the Russian Movement for 
Democratic Reforms, but stresses its hostility to 
"unpredictability and explosive measures" in both politics and 
economics. 
  In the State Duma the Yavlinskiy bloc will advocate shifting 
the main emphasis in implementing reforms to the regions, 
developing competition and a competitive environment, 
straightening out the tax system, and pursuing mutually 
advantageous cooperation with the states which were previously 
part of the USSR. Grigoriy Yavlinskiy believes that only 
institutional changes in the economy can lead to stabilization. 
The fight against corruption will also be an integral part of 
the bloc's policy in the Duma. 
  Anatoliy Lukyanov, ex-speaker of the USSR Supreme 
Soviet and a defendant in the case of the State Committee for 
the State of Emergency, elected to the Duma from a single-seat 
district, has been taking a most active part in organizational 
work to prepare for the work of the lower house of parliament. 
His name is on the list of hypothetical contenders for the 
chairmanship of the house. Lukyanov's own opinion on this 
subject is that the candidate for the chair should be sought 
among deputies representing small factions. The speaker, 
Lukyanov believes, "must be a balanced person with a good 
command of questions of politics and juriusprudence, who can 
give balance to such an unbalanced Duma." 
  Materials froim newspapers, telegraph agencies, and 
ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondents have been used in this summary.

<F P=106> [Editorial office feature incorporating commentary by </F>
Gennadiy Kalistratov and Sergey Voskholov, members of the 
organizing committee of the Interregional Association of 
Independent Deputies of the Russian State Duma: "Independents 
Deprived of a Voice. Duma Not Yet in Session, but Confrontation 
Already Growing"] 
  [Text] It looks as if the renewal of parliament is not 
going to bring about a reconciliation. Reports are filtering 
through, little by little, about the maneuverings and dealings 
being conducted by the leaders of political parties and blocs on 
the eve of the State Duma's commencement of work. This was 
discussed in the item headed "Party Sword Hangs Over Duma" 
(ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA for 4 January). Since its publication the 
independent deputies' fears have been confirmed, and they are 
being excluded from the formulation of major decisions on the 
Federal Assembly organizing committee. And now the newly formed 
Interregional Association of Independent Deputies has issued a 
trenchant statement. 
  The editorial office asked Gennadiy Kalistratov and Sergey 
Voskholov, members of the organizing committee of the 
association of "independents," to comment on this move. 
  "The statement was prompted by the fact that, for some 
reason, only the eight parties that crossed the 5-percent 
barrier have voting rights on the Federal Assembly organizing 
committee which is currently in session in the Kremlin making 
organizational preparations for the first steps in the State 
Duma's work. Our association, which was formed back in 
December, not only has no voting rights, but is being totally 
ignored, as if we did not exist. Absurd views are being 
expressed: that the political ideas and guidelines have already 
been formulated by the parties, while the independent deputies 
elected in the regions for single-seat districts are, so to 
speak, deliberately outside politics; your job, they tell us, is 
to work in the committees. 
  "Readers may think that we are inflicting petty 
parliamentary 
squabbles on the public. But no, this is a serious matter. 
This public denigration of the status of independent deputies 
compared with those who got in on the party lists prompts great 
anxiety. 
  "It is ridiculous to hear it said that the 'independents' 
are 
apolitical. True, they did not support a single political 
doctrine, but they are united on another, politically 
significant principle: 'The revival of Russia through the 
revival of the regions.' It is no accident that S. Shakhray has 
begun to show a keen interest in us, with his fundamental 
principle of emphasis on the regions. 
  "The parties' leaders realized that by uniting, the 
independent deputies -- there are 140 of us -- would become an 
influential force that could decide the passage of questions in 
parliament. The subsequent actions, alas, bordered on foul play. 
The parties' electoral associations described themselves as 
factions and declared that all other associations of deputies 
can be nothing more than groups. What a ludicrous initiative! 
It cannot be so, because factions have substantial procedural 
advantages over other types of associations of deputies, 
beginning with the power of diktat in the formation of the 
Duma's leadership organs. And that, of course, is the plan -- 
to secure those advantages. Therefore our association of 
'independents' has firmly declared its intention to register as 
a faction (of course, the faction of 'independents' will be 
distinguished by the absence of any kind of internal discipline 
or compulsion for the deputies belonging to it). 
  "When we 'independents' were elected, we never even thought 
about uniting to form some kind of wing. But in the light of 
this turn of events, more than 50 deputies from the regions (and 
15 more have confirmed their desire to join us) got together and 
decided not to be fragmented in the parliament hall, but 
together to defend the stability of the Duma against unilateral 
party actions. 
  "Hand on heart, we say: This is really no time to engage in 
this struggle. Some 150 laws are already being examined, and 
must be seriously studied and adopted. It is necessary without 
delay to establish cooperation between parliament, the 
government, and the Central Bank, so as to continue to pursue 
economic reform, but without shock. 
  "Hence our statement. We demand that the formation of the 
Duma's leadership and working organs proceed not on the party 
principle, but on the faction principle, and that an obligatory 
secret ballot is used, ruling out the system of voting by 
'packages' of proposals and lists of candidacies, as they are 
now trying to compel us to do."

<F P=106> [Articles by Yuriy Levada, leader of the All-Russia Center </F>
for the Study of Public Opinion on Social and Economic 
Questions, and Nuzgar Betaneli, director of the Institute of the 
Sociology of Parliamentarianism, under general heading: "It Is 
Difficult To Predict Situation in Federal Assembly but 
Sociologists Do Not Fear Difficulties"] 
  [Text] Before the start of the work of the Federal 
Assembly, the IZVESTIYA editorial office asked the leaders of 
well known sociological services to describe their expectations 
in connection with the start of the new parliament's work and to 
predict the possible development of events. 
  [Levada] Will the new parliament reflect the spread of 
opinions in society? How far will it be trusted? Today the 
answers to these traditional questions are uncertain and vague 
because the situation has ceased to be traditional. The type of 
public life which used to exist before and after the frontier of 
1985-1989 no longer exists. Neither in society nor in 
parliament does there exist nor most likely will there ever 
exist a "leading and guiding force" and a people obedient to it. 
The forces seeking to fill the vacuum of trust and order are 
well represented in the deputies' corps. For all the haste and 
even random nature of its formation. How can we tell, perhaps 
the very uncertainty of the boundaries and program aims of the 
future factions will even benefit parliamentary activity: After 
all trial by jury, for instance, presupposes the completely 
random selection of jurors.... 
  The accepted rules of the constitutional game do not promise 
the parliament a long life. But apart from the functions 
prescribed in the Constitution it has one more very important 
function -- preparing elections of the president and the 
permanent, "real," parliament. I have in mind not so much 
legislative as social preparation, the formation of political 
forces and their presentation to society, the definition of 
leaders, authorities, and programs. Virtually all the declared 
contenders for the supreme state post (and a similar number who 
have yet to declare themselves) are now in parliament and they 
will have to constantly assert themselves to deputies and public 
opinion. And that means that the new parliament will have to be 
a school of politics and political struggle. The country's 
future depends to a considerable degree on what subjects are 
learned in this school and by whom. 
  [Betaneli] It is already obvious that the Federal Assembly 
threatens to become a source of at least two tough 
confrontations: confrontation within the legislative organ 
itself and "skirmishes" between the parliament and the president. 
  The institute's many years of study, first in the USSR 
parliament, then in the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet and 
also the all-Russia public opinion polls of voters before the 
recent elections make it possible to understand the nature of 
the future conflicts. They will be based on psychological, 
political, and ideological incompatibility reinforced by the 
traditional lack of parliamentary culture in society and the 
customary orientation toward conflict and force. 
  As before the members of the new parliament are 
distinguished 
by the diversity of their views, positions, and value 
orientations, the lack of an "overall picture of the world." To 
all appearances many parliamentarians will not consider Ambrose 
Bierce's joking warning: "Debate is the best way of confirming 
an opponent in his misconceptions." 
  We may perfectly well expect that either parliament or its 
individual factions will sharply oppose the Russian president. 
The majority of political parties and blocs represented in the 
federal Assembly are geared not so much toward lawmaking 
activity as toward preparation for the presidential elections 
and the creation of a situation which brings these elections 
closer. 
  But perhaps the most dramatic of future events is the 
"Zhirinovskiy effect": Since V. Zhirinovskiy's win at the 
elections many representatives of other parties and blocs will 
deliberately nor unwittingly copy the "winner's" style and his 
arguments and, in borrowing the symbols, run the risk of 
borrowing his orientation and values.

  [Text] "I do not see any prospects in the talks," 
Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba said on Gudauta radio 
referring to the upcoming second round of talks between Georgia 
and Abkhazia in Geneva. "The vanquished do not dictate terms to 
the victors," he said, "Hence, Tbilisi will have to put up with 
the fact that our relations must be based on agreements reached 
between equal subjects of international law. The Georgian side 
is constantly exploiting the problem of refugees. As for us, we 
do not prevent them from returning to their home country." 
Well-informed sources at the Georgian Foreign Ministry believe 
that such statements made on the eve of the upcoming 
Georgian-Abkhazian consultations scheduled for 11 January are 
provocative and may bring about the most undesirable 
consequences.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference given by Defense Minister Georgiy </F>
Karkarashvili at the Georgian Defense Ministry in Tbilisi on 10 
January] 
  [Text] Regarding the recent incident involving the security 
minister, Karkarashvili said an investigation is under way, 
which should answer all the questions. 
  According to the minister the current call-up to active 
military service is going successfully. At the same time, he 
noted that the army should be run along professional lines and 
stressed the importance of further improving the reserve system. 
  With respect to relations with the national guard, which was 
set up during recent events in western Georgia, Karkarashvili 
said those events had justified its existence at that time. 
However, the guards status has still not been clarified. At 
this point the minister stressed that his main aim is to create 
a unified, disciplined, mobile and well armed army as a symbol 
of the independent state. 
  Turning to the development of relations with Russia, 
Georgia's minister of defense stated that they should be defined 
on the basis of a treaty [Russian: na dogovornoy osnove]. As 
for maintaining public order, mercenaries may come into the 
picture but not units from the Russian Federation's ministry of 
defense, as they do not have the appropriate status.

  [Text] According to the state minister Givi Lominadze, the 
chairman of the temporary committee for emergencies in western 
Georgia, the region remains stable. The situation is calm if 
somewhat tense along the line of confrontation, which is marked 
by the Inguri River. The Abkhaz side has given permission for 
power engineers to cross the so-called border to carry out 
repair work at Inguri hydroelectric power station in Gali rayon. 
Units of the Georgian armed forces stationed in the region are 
guarding the area along the river Inguri. 
  The situation in Gali rayon in the border area remains 
critical as Abkhaz separatists and mercenaries from the northern 
Caucasus continue to rob civilians, burn houses, and kill people. 
  Under an accord between the Georgian and Abkhaz sides, 
between 25 and 30 people a day are granted passes and cross the 
road bridge over the Inguri from Zugdidi rayon into Gali rayon. 
However, according to reliable information, mines laid by 
Abkhaz separatists have killed over 60 people attempting to 
cross illegally.

  [Text] Tbilisi January 11 TASS -- The command of the 
"Mkhedrioni" (Horsemen) Georgia's most powerful paramilitary 
organisation, nominally loyal to Eduard Shevardnadze, have 
decided to stockpile their firearms. 
  Longi Chelidze, a "Mkhedrioni" leader, told reporters on 
Tuesday that any member of the organisation refusing to obey the 
order to give up his weapon will be reported to the law 
enforcement bodies of the republic. 
  By January 15, all weapons should be collected and sealed in 
dumps. The operation has been already completed on Tuesday in 
the republic eastern regions of Kakheti and Rustavi. 
  Not long ago the "Mkhedrioni" units, playing a big role in 
the Georgian political drama, got the status of a governmental 
structure called "Georgia's Rescuers". 
  Local observers believe the "Mkhedrioni" leaders decided to 
get rid of weapons in a bid to evade any accusations of illegal 
activities against the members of the organisation. 
  The "Mkhedrioni" were founded in 1989 by Djaba Ioseliani, 
once a supporter of the late ex-president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, 
who later inspired the downfall of the first popular-elected 
president of Georgia. 
  In November 1990, Ioseliani told ITAR-TASS That the 
"Mkhedrioni" had been created to prevent ethnic conflicts and 
preserve the republic's integrity. The "Horsemen" actively 
participated in the Georgian coup d'etat of December 
1991-January 1992, combat operations in Abkhazia and western 
Georgia on the side of the government troops. 
  Experts assess that "Mkhedrioni" consist of some three 
thousand well-equipped gunmen, possess armour and modern means 
of liaison.

"it is necessary to raise this question as soon as possible." 
"I would like to see a strong Georgia which would be able to 
defend itself and a step towards the ruble zone is a chance for 
Georgia's real rescue," he emphasized. 
  Goguadze also declared that he positively assesses proposals 
of several political functionaries to introduce Russian forces 
into Georgia in order to bring order in the republic. At the 
same time, he noted that "this should be done minding genuine 
necessity." 
  Goguadze stated that cooperation with other countries "which 
would not restrict Georgia's sovereignty is always acceptable." 
  The speaker stressed the necessity to render assistance to 
Georgia's law enforcement bodies. "A policeman without money is 
a potential criminal and that is why we need help so we can 
bring order in the country," announced Goguadze.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "If You Behave Yourselves Well, We </F>
Will Help"] 
  [Text] The Cabinet of Ministers has allocated 3 1/2 
billion coupons from the state budget to cover the debts of four 
newspapers to the "Samshoblo" Publishing House where they are 
published and from whom they rent offices. The lion's share of 
this amount -- approximately 1.8 billion [coupons] -- has been 
allocated to the newspaper SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA. 
  As the heads of the publishing house have said, this sum is 
being formally transferred from the budget simply for publishing 
needs. However, to all intents and purposes, this "injection" is 
being allocated specifically to SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA, 
SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA, and two publications appearing in the 
Armenian and Azeri languages. 
  The sum is nothing out of the ordinary and, in general, 
there 
would have been nothing unusual in this had it not been for one 
circumstance. All four newspapers were formerly the official 
organs of the Communist Party Central Committee and Supreme 
Soviet of Georgia. 
  However, following all the state political upheavals that 
started in Georgia three years ago and that have seemingly 
continued to this day, they were reregistered as independent 
publications. Nevertheless, they have continued, in the main, to 
fulfill their previous functions. 
  The problem would not have arisen had the state structures 
admitted that they were openly protecting their own papers. 
Such a draft decision now seems to be in preparation. However, 
this as yet hidden patronage is causing justifiable resentment 
among the mass of other truly independent publications. 
  The overwhelming majority of papers that are not so loyal to 
the authorities are barely managing to make ends meet. However, 
they are regularly paying their debts to the publishing house as 
they fear for their fates. 
  True, even by doing this, they cannot boast that they are 
being regularly published. Objective difficulties concerning 
paper supply, electricity, and many other things encountered by 
the single publishing house responsible for production and 
equipment affects, first and foremost, precisely independent 
publications. Some of them have been hit harder than others. 
  Criminal proceedings have been initiated against the 
"Zviadist" newspapers [IBERIA-SPEKTR, SAKARTVELOS SAMREKLO] and 
their publication has been halted. 
  DRONI employees are still being hauled up before the 
Procurator's Office for publishing an interview with Nodar 
Natadze, chairman of the Popular Front and one of the leaders of 
the opposition in parliament, whose remarks opposing Georgia's 
entry into the CIS were assessed as an incitement to violence. 
  The popular newspaper 7 DGHE, which takes a restrained but 
very critical line against the current authorities, is in very 
bad shape. A few months ago, a group of armed people, who were 
not pleased with certain articles that had been published, raked 
the editor in chief's office with gunfire and damaged a large 
amount of editorial equipment. Then, last week, the remaining 
computers and printers were stolen. 
  In general, when certain independent newspapers have to 
suffer in this way, it is understandable why government help to 
other -- also "independent" -- newspapers is viewed as blatant 
injustice. 
  Meanwhile, the resignation of Archil Gogeliya, chairman of 
the Television and Radio Broadcasting Corporation, has been 
received in Eduard Shevardnadze's office. Certain television 
employees with whom we spoke suppose that it was the result of 
incessant "pressure" applied on the chairman from "above." The 
leaders of opposition forces in Georgia have also pointed out 
that their access to radio and television has been made 
extremely difficult of late. However, Gogeliya's resignation 
has yet to be accepted.

  [Text] Tbilisi, January 11 (SNARK) -- Today the private 
exchange offices stopped the operations of exchanging of Russian 
rubles for Georgian currency because coupons dropped down. The 
high-price goods disappeared from the shops. 
  At the last auction of Interbanking Exchange of National 
Bank 
of Georgia there was the rate -- 100 Georgian coupons for 1 
Russian ruble. Comparing with the previous auction the rate is 
dropped down 20 points. Specialists connect the collapsing 
dropping down of coupons with the recent statement of Vakhtang 
Goguadze, the speaker of Georgian Parliament, about necessity of 
Georgia's entering to the ruble zone.

  [Excerpt] Consultations between the heads of Latvian and 
Russian delegations on the withdrawal of the Russian Army from 
the territory of the Republic of Latvia began at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs at 1000. An hour long break was announced at 
1100, and our correspondent Janis Podins used this opportunity 
and asked to the microphone a member of the Latvian delegation, 
a deputy to the Fifth Saeima, Ilga Grava. 
  [Begin recording] [Podins] Taking into account yesterday's 
incident, what was the first hour of the talks with the Russian 
delegation like? 
  [Grava] Taking into account all that has happened, it should 
be said that the first hour of the talks was very normal. We 
both gave our apologies and some analysis of what has happened. 
The Russian side already understands that thing very well. 
They repeated once again their assessment, understanding that 
that was a provocation and in no way blaming the Latvian 
Government, nor blaming the delegation, nor Latvia as a state, 
but stressing again that that was a provocation and just 
reminded us that such provocations complicate not only relations 
between Russia and Latvia -- if we have no agreements at the 
moment which govern these relations -- but we also have to 
understand that relations between Russia and Latvia also 
determine relations between Latvia and other states, and that 
such [sentence incomplete as heard]. 
  Well, they assessed (?everything) in a very normal way and 
we 
have now their agreement [words indistinct] and we will continue 
our work. 
  [Podins] And what new is, nevertheless, in the stance of the 
Latvian delegation? And whether Russia accepts it? 
  [Grava] We have not spoken yet a single word about the 
agreement, timescale, nor about anything else. Mr. Virsis said 
-- 31 August. Russia said with such a bit of sarcasm that it 
has really had to wait until the middle of January to come to 
this conclusion, [word indistinct] also understood that we have 
to accept that. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] At the Latvian-Russian talks on army withdrawal, 
representatives of the Russian delegation have submitted new 
proposals on the legal status of the Skrunda radar station as 
well as a proposed new five-year deadline for the withdrawal of 
the Skrunda radar. This was told today to reporters by Sergey 
Zotov, head of the Russian delegation. 
  The Latvian side is at the moment acquainting itself with 
the 
new Russian proposals. The Latvian delegation believes that the 
facility should be non-military. Russian representatives, 
however, oppose that. 
  Speaking about the resumption of the talks in general after 
yesterday's incident between the leadership of the Vidzeme 
district of Riga and two generals of the Russian army, Zotov 
explained that one of the aims of the person responsible for the 
provocation was to disrupt the talks and to hinder the effort to 
reach agreement between Latvia and Russia on troop withdrawal. 
With this, suspension of the talks would have been only in the 
interest of the person responsible for the provocation. 
  The talks between representatives of the Latvian and Russian 
delegations on troop withdrawal will continue tomorrow.

<F P=106> [By A. Yakovlev and V. Gorobets; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] [Yakovlev] Russian-Latvian talks, overshadowed by 
the illegal arrest of two Russian generals, began this morning 
and carried on late into the evening. The Latvian delegation 
agreed to Russia's proposed date for the withdrawal of troops -- 
31 August this year. The only fundamental issue on which it has 
hitherto not been possible to agree is the Skrunda missile 
attack early-warning station. It is necessary to define the 
status of this strategic installation, needed to ensure Russia's 
national security, and establish the possibility of 
international supervision, something on which the Latvian side 
is insisting. The opinion is being aired that the station might 
operate as a civil installation. Military experts believe that 
the Skrunda radar does not represent an environmental danger nor 
does it pose a threat as a target on Latvian territory. 
Agreement is being hampered by the impossibility of putting up 
a similar structure on Russian territory in a short period and 
the internal situation in Latvia, which dictates that 
politicians should seek the immediate withdrawal of all troops 
and the elimination of Russian installations on its territory.

<F P=106> [POSTFACTUM report under the "In Brief" rubric: "Arrest of </F>
Generals"] 
  [Text] It has come to light from confidential sources that 
yesterday at 0730 one of the depots and the quarters and 
utilities unit of the Northeastern Group of Forces [NEGF] in a 
Riga suburb were captured by forces of the 13th country defense 
battalion. Major General Vodopyanov, aide to the commander for 
work with personnel; Major General Taylokov, first deputy 
commander of the NEGF; and Major General Yakushev, chief of the 
combat training directorate, arrived at 1030 at the site of the 
incident to investigate. They declared to the head of the 
city's administration who was present there that the actions by 
the Latvian servicemen were unlawful, and demanded that the 
captured installations be vacated. Negotiations were fruitless, 
however, and around 1400 Generals Vodopyanov and Taylokov were 
handcuffed, put into a minibus and taken away to an unknown 
destination. General Yakushev immediately reported the incident 
to the commander of the Northeastern Group of Forces who 
reported the incident to the president of Latvia. The president 
stated that the actions of the country defense forces were 
unlawful and that measures would be taken for an immediate 
release of the Russian generals. POSTFACTUM has come to learn 
that Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev gave orders to put 
on combat alert units of the Pskov Airborne Division, and should 
the hostages not be released, to take adequate measures to free 
them. Normond Beltskis of Latvia's Foreign Ministry press 
service advised, as this NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA issue went to 
print, that an urgent conference to resolve the situation was 
under way at the office of republic President Guntis Ulmanis.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report based on news agency materials under </F>
the "Latvia" rubric: "Riga Authorities Deport Two Russian 
Generals. Latvian Officials Call the Incident `a Provocation'"] 
  [Text] On 10 January, General Nikolay Taylakov, deputy 
commander-in-chief of the Russian Army's Northwestern Group of 
Forces, and General Anatoliy Vodopyanov were arrested and 
deported to Russia at the directive of Andrey Ruchs, chairman of 
Riga's suburb of Vidzem. The arrest followed the Latvian 
territorial defense troops' seizure of a military depot and 
another official building held by Russian troops. Meanwhile, 
local authorities said that the generals were arrested for fear 
that they might attempt to mount armed security guard details at 
the facilities that were to be handed over to Latvia. 
  Ilgonis Upmanis, chief of the Latvian Government's bureau on 
the withdrawal of Russian troops, told BALTFAX that both 
generals returned to Riga and that the republican prosecutor's 
office filed a criminal lawsuit regarding the incident. Mr. 
Ruchs, meanwhile, conceded that he had overstepped his powers. 
Martins Virsis, chief of the Latvian delegation in talks with 
Russia, has called the incident "a deliberate provocation," 
planned for a day when talks between Russia and Latvia were to 
resume in Riga. His Russian counterpart, Sergey Zotov, said 
that the beginning of the next round of the talks was out of the 
question "until light is shed on this incident." 
  Given the situation, Russian Federation Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev ordered that units of the Pskov Airborne Division 
be put on full alert.

  [Text] A news conference has been held at the Council of 
Ministers and our reporter Aivars Tiltins was there. He is in 
the Afternoon program studio. 
  [Tiltins] Yes. So it happened that, just one hour apart, 
news conferences on one and the same incident [detention of two 
Russian generals on 10 January] were held by both the Council of 
Ministers and the Saeima. But this only shows the seriousness 
of the incident. 
  Participants in the press conference at the Council of 
Ministers were Valdis Birkavs, Foreign Minister Georgs 
Andrejevs, and Internal Affairs Minister Girts Kristovskis. All 
the speakers began with apologies, because the incident 
undoubtedly dented relations between Russia and Latvia. 
  Foreign ambassadors took part in the news conference and 
both 
Valdis Birkavs and Georgs Andrejevs stressed that the incident 
and the action by Andrejs Rucs and his sympathizers had nothing 
in common with the government's and the Saeima's policy, and 
that Russia and other foreign countries would understand that. 
  We have already spoken about the decisions which the Council 
of Ministers took at its session last night. So then, Andrejs 
Rucs was dismissed and the Prosecutor's Office started a 
criminal case. At present Rucs' location is unknown. He is 
being sought. At least Girts Kristovskis said so. 
  The main thing which is to be carried out now is to 
determine 
the accountability and duties of each structure. The structures 
in question are the home guards and the municipal police. The 
National Security Council is also working on just that. 
  Girts Kristovskis also noted that the Vidzeme municipal 
police will today hand over weapons to the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. Rucs, however, is not taking part in that procedure. 
  One of the most important issues in perceiving the 
seriousness of the situation is Russia's reaction at the time of 
the incident. It would be worth listening to what Georgs 
Andrejevs said. 
  [Begin Andrejevs recording] I will just explain what the 
president personally heard from both General Mayorov, commander 
of the Northwestern Group of Forces, and President Yeltsin's 
office. Those two sources clearly said that an order had been 
given, first of all to Defense Minister Grachev to carry out any 
necessary [word indistinct] measures, that is President 
Yeltsin's order. Then, obviously, the army commander also gave 
an order to place in combat order several divisions, including 
air force and airborne divisions, stationed near Latvia. Such 
information was not received in Latvia in written form. But 
there are no grounds to doubt this information. And quite a few 
occasions are known from inter-state experience that it has not 
been even necessary to use such physical violence against 
officers of such high rank for some superpower to begin without 
prior (?warning) an attack against the aggressor [words 
indistinct] who was guilty of such violence. I would (?simply) 
like to tell you that it was much more dangerous for Latvia that 
General Mayorov practically gave Latvia half an hour to find out 
where the generals were, and threatened countermeasures here in 
Latvia. It seems to me that there is big enough here, the 
Russian army is stationed. [sentence as heard] 
  So then, if anything had happened, if anything (?even worse) 
had happened when transporting those generals, with an armed 
conflict beginning between units which would have tried to stop 
the transport and guards who had an order from Rucs, he himself 
affirmed that, to shoot at anyone who would have tried to 
(?defend) and stop the transport, in that case it would have 
been difficult to foresee the consequences, because if the 
Russian Army had moved out of its quarters it would 
understandably have also encountered resistance from the Latvian 
side [words indistinct]. [end recording] 
  [Tiltins] In conclusion I would also like to stress the main 
opinion expressed at the news conference: That this incident 
does not correspond to the policy laid down and carried out by 
the government and the Saeima. Foreign ambassadors were invited 
after the news conference to a brief meeting at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Inart Skujins from Riga, including </F>
recording of remarks by Colonel General L.S. Mayorov, commander 
of Northwestern Group of Forces, and V. Birkavs, prime minister 
of Latvia; from the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] Yesterday Latvia and Russia were on the brink of a 
military conflict. Rucs, head of the Vidzeme district of Riga, 
undertook a provocative action. He decided to capture a few 
facilities where for the time being the Russian army is 
stationed. He ordered the deputy commander of the Northwestern 
Group of Forces and the deputy commander for personnel work, who 
had come to the talks, to be arrested and dispatched to the 
Latvian-Russian border in handcuffs. 
  [Mayorov] Gentlemen, I believe that this action pursued 
political aims, and the main aim which the Latvian nationalists 
were pursuing was to disrupt the talks between Russian and 
Latvia, talks which had been proceeding normally, and to disrupt 
the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvian territory. 
  I must report to you that after these events -- and these 
events had been building up from the morning onwards, gradually 
-- on the order of the defense minister, combined units and 
units of airborne troops, including the Pskov Airborne Division, 
combined units and units of the military transport aviation, the 
front aviation, and the navy and, of course, units of the 
Northwestern Group of Forces were brought into combat readiness 
for the liberation of our servicemen and captured facilities. 
We were prepared to liberate our people and our facilities by 
force. 
  I informed Latvia's President Mr. Ulmanis before midday. In 
reply he requested -- well, first, he told me that he was taking 
measures to resolve this conflict, that the organizer himself of 
this action -- well, evidently this is the outside organizer, 
behind him evidently there are other forces of nationalist 
persuasion -- Mr. Rucs would be indicted, and the officers and 
the facilities would be freed. He requested that no strong-arm 
methods be undertaken. We acceded to this request. 
  [Birkavs, shown standing in office with Latvian coat of arms 
on wall] First of all, I express regret in connection with what 
happened, and on behalf of the government I apologize to those 
concerned. The absolutely impermissible conduct of head of the 
district council Mr. Rucs resulted in the Cabinet of Ministers 
immediately relieving him of his post. Criminal proceedings 
have been instituted. Now the police are looking for him in 
order to bring him to book. The official reply of the Foreign 
Ministry with apologies to Russia will be presented today.

<F P=106> [Report by K. K.: "Latvia Has Just Barely Been Joined to the </F>
CIS"] 
  [Text] On Monday paramilitary formations subordinated to 
the Latvian Ministry of Internal Affairs undertook provocative 
actions against Russian military installations, the embassy, and 
certain representatives in Riga. 
  As we have learned from reliable sources, had the situation 
exacerbated, the airborne and military transport aviation forces 
which were put on alert could have accomplished the combined 
employment of paratroopers in Riga. In accordance with plans 
worked out in the last years of the USSR's existence (under 
which the 1991 military actions in the Baltic region were held), 
the troops arriving from Russia would have unblocked and taken 
our installations under guard. All of this would have been 
strongly reminiscent of the evacuation of the Soviet Embassy in 
Afghanistan. 
  The initiator of the military option was Minister Kozyrev, 
who asked General Grachev to take the requisite measures. 
  According to competent sources in the Foreign Affairs 
Ministry, the provocation could be linked to the new round of 
bilateral negotiations on the fate of Russian military 
installations in Latvia as well as to President Clinton's 
European tour. If everything were quiet, then, according to Mr. 
Prikhodko, head of the Baltic Division at the Second European 
Department, one could "hope for a breakthrough." After 
apologies by the Latvian side the talks, scheduled for two to 
three days, went ahead, although later than planned. The 
Foreign Affairs Ministry is still expecting explanations on a 
higher level with a mandatory indication of the organizers and 
perpetrators of the provocation, the punishment meted out to 
them, and so forth. The incident was discussed at a night 
emergency session of the Latvian Government. A couple of minor 
officials were dismissed.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 10, BNS -- The Latvian Environmental 
Protection and Regional Development Ministry established 
successful contacts last year with Denmark and Sweden in waste 
processing and sewage treatment, spokesman Zigfrids Bruvers told 
BNS. 
  Denmark sponsored the Riga city waste processing scheme that 
also provides for sorting of non-industrial waste. Latvia used 
Danish funding to assess the quantity of toxic waste in the 
country, Bruvers said. 
  Sweden allotted 108 million kronor to build sewage 
processors 
in Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. From this, 5 million kronor 
were extended to the Riga municipal water supply and sewerage 
enterprise. 
  Another part of the Swedish Government assignation, around 
40 
million kronor, is needed to reconstruct the Liepaja city 
sewerage. Currently, Liepaja is one of the main polluters of 
Latvian waters in the Baltic Sea. 
  Another 9-million-U.S.-dollar project targets introduction 
of 
efficient and environmentally friendly heating systems in 
Latvia's small towns. The plan is based on transforming regional 
heating systems on local raw materials, like wood or peat. 
  From the project's expenses, 1 million dollars are donated 
by 
the Danish Government, the rest is the Danish Government's loan 
to Latvia. The term of the credit is 10 years, Denmark wants no 
interest from the sum. The Latvian Government, however, still 
has to extend its guarantees to insure the credit. 
  In addition, the Latvian Valmiera district and the Danish 
Velje district environmentalists started to jointly monitor the 
river basins in the Valmiera vicinity, said Bruvers. The Velje 
authorities also presented Latvia with a sea monitoring ship.

Peace," taking a lead among former Soviet states. 
  President Algirdas Brazauskas instructed his government to 
start "immediate preparation" to sign a partnership document 
with the Western alliance. 
  In a statement distributed by the Lithuanian embassy in 
Brussels, Brazauskas said partnership "paves the way to the full 
integration of Lithuania into the NATO political-military 
structures." [passage omitted] 
  Brazauskas said the Baltic republic, which borders Russia, 
would identify "facilities, resources and forces," that could be 
used in the partnership.

  [Text] Interfax Baltic News Service reports that Justas 
Paleckis, the Lithuanian president's foreign policy adviser, 
told an INTERFAX correspondent that the decisions made by the 
NATO summit in Brussels on cooperation of this organization with 
Central and East European countries met the expectations of 
realistically thinking politicians. 
  According to him, following the approval in Brussels of the 
Partnership for Peace NATO program, the rapprochement of 
Lithuania with this organization would depend on the opening 
possibilities: political stability, the economic potential of 
Lithuania, the ability to organize and improve military 
structures according to European standards, and the ability to 
cooperate both with NATO and other Baltic states. 
  Justas Paleckis thinks that a strong incentive to start 
implementing the Partnership for Peace NATO program will be the 
visit to Brussels by Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas, 
due to take place on 27 January. 
  According to the president's adviser, the main objective of 
the visit to Brussels will be to convince NATO leadership that 
Lithuania's commitment to rapprochement with NATO is not 
directed against Russia or other neighboring states.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 10, ELTA -- Fragile Baltic democracies 
should not be ignored, Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas 
warned Western countries in his interview to British satellite 
TV channel "Sky News" on Sunday [9 January]. 
  Russia, of course, is large and influential state, he said. 
But the West should not forget other states of the region as 
well. Processes taking place there are important not only for 
themselves but for the whole world as well. Development of 
democracy in all the countries of the region should be accepted 
with equal responsibility but not concentrating upon Russia. 
  In the end of the report, the journalist made a conclusion 
that, despite reassuring words from Washington and Brussels, 
Lithuania fears a new separating line on the map of Europe is 
being drawn and the newly independent Baltic states are again 
remaining in the wrong side.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan 10, ELTA -- "We are not so naive not to 
understand that after applying to NATO the door of the alliance 
would not immediately open. But as we belong to the West and 
not to the East, we want to get closer as soon as possible", 
Lithuanian ambassador at NATO Adolfas Venckus told a Polish 
daily "Rzeczpospolita" on Monday [10 January]. 
  Venckus said in the interview that the Baltic states were 
ready to give over one battalion to the European peacekeeping 
forces, were proposing centre of medical training, were ready to 
participate in NATO military exercises, paid a lot of attention 
to learning of foreign languages by senior military personnel. 
  "Our wish to join NATO is not directed against Russia. We 
would like to have the best possible relations with that country 
but some fears appeared after the elections in Russia and 
statements of Vladimir Zhirinovsky concerning the Baltic 
states", he said. 
  Asked how Lithuania would react if Poland was the first to 
join NATO, Venckus said that "Lithuania is not harmed by the 
success of others. But, if Poland offered the Baltic states to 
go to NATO together, we would be very happy". 
  Lithuania and Albania are the only states that have formally 
applied NATO for membership.

and older will be able to acquire and carry arms for 
self-defense. According to a law passed by the Seimas today, 
they will be allowed to have one not larger than nine millimeter 
caliber pistol and ammunition. The law states that the pistol 
must not be automatic or have a large magazine. Permits to 
acquire the weapons will be issued by the Internal Affairs 
Ministry and the order of acquiring, keeping, and carrying the 
weapon will be established by the government. According to the 
Seimas instruction, the government will have to do this by 1 
March. 
  Permits to acquire, keep, and carry arms will not be issued 
to persons tried for premeditated crimes and imprudent crimes 
committed with the use of arms, ammunition, or explosives, and 
to those on bail. 
  Persons who have been fined for illegal acquisition and 
keeping of narcotics, for encroachment on public order, and 
other intentional administrative offenses if [words indistinct] 
the weapon can be used for administrative offenses cannot have 
weapons. The law forbids licensing arms and ammunition to 
persons [indistinct word] abusing the use of alcohol and 
narcotics and to persons suffering from mental illnesses. 
  The law contains some other limitations, also. When it is 
published, we will know about them. Persons having illegally 
obtained firearms, ammunition, and explosives must hand them in 
to the police by 1 April. Those who do this voluntarily will 
not be fined and a compensation in cash will be paid to them.

<F P=106> [Fourth article in a series by Virginijus Gaivenis: "Who </F>
Armed National Defense? (4)"] 
  [Excerpts] In the summer of 1992, the German military 
offered four ships to Lithuania's national defense for half 
price. Shortly thereafter, on 30 October, a commission of 
Lithuanian experts arrived in Peenemunde at the invitation of 
the German Defense Ministry to examine those ships and report 
back with their conclusions to Commander E. Nazelskis, first 
deputy national defense minister. The experts found those three 
missile ships, as well as one torpedo detector, well preserved 
and in a good technical state. Germany was ready to transfer 
spare parts and equipment for the ships to our state. True, the 
Germans warned our fellow countrymen that they would do this 
only after the vessels' partial demilitarization, that is, after 
removing all outwardly visible armaments. Lithuania had to 
cover these expenses from its own pocket by paying 30,000 German 
marks [DM] for each ship, or slightly less if they sent a group 
of eight or 10 people for assistance. However, to acquire all 
of those ships, as experts J. Alsauskas and V. Mockus indicated, 
the Lithuanian Government had to send a document to its German 
counterpart whereby the transfer of those ships would be gratis 
and our government officials would pledge to use them only for 
coastal defense and not sell or transfer them to a third party. 
The Germans proposed that we take delivery of all the ships by 
the end of 1992. Back on 19 November, [former] Defense Minister 
A. Butkevicius sent a letter to Lithuanian leaders stating that 
the Lithuanian Government must assign DM90,000 for dismantling 
the three missile ships. Sending a letter to German Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe, former Prime Minister A. Abisala agreed 
with the terms of the transfer and asked the German Defense 
Ministry to act as a mediator in conducting the ships' 
demilitarization at a German shipyard. According to unconfirmed 
information received from officials, the government transferred 
DM90,000 to the National Defense Ministry [KAM]. However, 
neither last year, as the Germans had wished, nor as of this 
very day have the ships donated by the German Defense Ministry 
reached the coast of Lithuania, while military specialists in 
neighboring Latvia took delivery of six ships donated by Germany. 
  Why did the leaders of Lithuania's national defense refuse 
the ships donated to them for half price? Why did they at the 
same time pay 417 million rubles in cash to V. Laurinavicius, 
president of the "Selma" association in Kaunas, for two ships 
received from the Russian Baltic Fleet? Some sources maintain 
that it was more important to the former KAM and government 
leaders to "launder" millions from the state's pocket to 
"Selma," because the Baltic Fleet command did not want the 
German ships to reach Lithuania. The interests of "Selma," 
headed by a three-time convicted person, and its supporters were 
more significant to the KAM leaders for some reason. [passage 
omitted] 
  When the ships were sailed from Kaliningrad to the wharf in 
Klaipeda, V. Mockus, a senior officer of the Naval Department at 
the Armed Forces Staff, noted in his official report to the 
chief of staff that the Baltic Fleet frigates bought through 
"Selma" had arrived without any spare parts. Nor were there any 
secret technical documentation, inventory, fuel, lubricants, 
facilities for emergency rescue, missiles on one frigate, and so 
on. According to the preliminary agreement with the Baltic 
Fleet command, all this was to be nowhere else but on the ships 
sold to the Lithuanian National Defense Ministry. In the 
opinion of Senior Officer V. Mockus, it is practically 
impossible to use the ships without all these facilities and 
armaments. The pumps had disappeared from the ships back in 
Liepaja, and the water removal equipment had been taken away by 
the Russians. As the specialists have noted, some vital valves 
and fire faucets are rusted, they do not turn and are hopelessly 
outdated. Hundreds of such flaws have been found on the 
purchased ships. 
  The KAM leadership of that time was repeatedly informed 
about 
all this disorder. They also knew what items had failed to 
reach Lithuania under the purchase agreement with the Russian 
Baltic Fleet. 
  After RESPUBLIKA had published the first facts about the 
former KAM deals with the Kaunas association "Selma," the 
ministry began an official investigation. As Minister L. 
Linkevicius has told journalists, it should help establish the 
guilty parties and assess their actions. The new minister may 
not know, however, that some direct offenders in this criminal 
story -- former leaders of the ministry and its departments -- 
are acting behind the minister's back. They are forging 
documents and intimidating those ministry employees who refuse 
to claim that RESPUBLIKA is wrong. Undoubtedly, they will 
continue to prove that Minister A. Butkevicius, his deputy E. 
Nazelskis, his adviser I. Stankovicius, and C. Jezerskas are 
linked with the bosses of the Kaunas Mafia only by "business" 
relations. Prime Minister A. Slezevicius blessed the trip of 
all these officials abroad, where they will study and undergo 
training. After RESPUBLIKA had asked the prime minister whether 
such an approval of their studies abroad did not represent a 
"bonus," the premier replied: "Studying is a poor bonus." 
Prosecutor General A. Paulauskas holds a different opinion 
about the departure of these officers. He claims that they 
themselves should be interested in establishing the truth and 
untangling these complicated relations, rather than escaping to 
the West at this crucial moment. 
  Yesterday afternoon, former Minister A. Butkevicius, who is 
back on leave from London, found my colleague R. Grineviciute 
and answered several questions. Mr. A. Butkevicius claimed that 
the Baltic Fleet leaders themselves had proposed "Selma" as a 
partner to them. The ex-minister maintained that he had not 
known anything about the former conviction of the firm's 
president, V. Laurinavicius, and had not been interested in his 
past. He said that the German ships had turned out to be not 
quite suitable because they did not have the necessary loading 
capacity, and so on. 
  As is becoming clear today, the association "Selma" was 
exempt from taxes. Such a decision was adopted by the 
government headed by A. Abisala, who comes from Kaunas. 
Although A. Paulauskas had protested about such a government 
move, the decision was revoked neither by B. Lubys nor A. 
Slezevicius. 
  Another thing is also surprising in this story. No one has 
actually unraveled it. Prosecutor General A. Paulauskas has 
agreed that a large group of investigators should work on this 
case, because the public must know the truth. However, as soon 
as a RESPUBLIKA reporter became curious about who had relieved 
"Selma" from taxes and whether the Prosecutor General's Office 
had issued a protest, R. Bimbiriene, deputy chief prosecutor of 
the Civilian Cases and General Authority Department, stated that 
she would not speak because she guarded state secrets carefully. 
It does not matter that the Prosecutor General himself did not 
see a big secret in the question of which of the former prime 
ministers had made illegal decisions. If it is convenient to 
them, officials may ignore the opinions and instructions of 
their chiefs. R. Bimbiriene has allegedly noticed that 
RESPUBLIKA is stepping up pressure on her. Well, this is how 
things are sometimes....

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 11, BNS -- The Lithuanian Ministry of 
Defense purchased all weapons in accordance with respective 
government resolutions, which provide for "specific mediators, 
prices, and terms of payment," former Defense Minister Audrius 
Butkevicius said in a written statement Friday [7 January]. 
  Recent publications about the Ministry of Defense in the 
RESPUBLIKA newspaper are "irresponsible, biassed and aimed at 
creating sensational news at any cost," the ex-minister said. 
  Butkevicius said he regrets that the timing of a series of 
articles in RESPUBLIKA "coincided with Lithuania's statement on 
its intention to approach West European defensive structures." 
  The former minister said Lithuania had to choose from two 
ways of behaving before it was internationally recognized -- 
either to carry out a policy of doing nothing, or to develop 
national defense. "I and my colleagues chose the second way."

  [Text] As the National Defense Ministry has reported, at 
2155 [1955 GMT] on 28 December, 101 Russian Fleet seamen, two 
warrant officers, and one third rank captain crossed the border 
check point in Turmantas [Lithuanian border crossing with 
Latvia] without a transit permit on a passenger train heading 
from Kaliningrad to St. Petersburg. This train stood for half 
an hour in Kybartai [Lithuanian border crossing with Kaliningrad 
Oblast]. According to the chief of the shift on duty there, 
border guards did not have enough time to check the entire 
train, and the Russian servicemen might have slipped across the 
border in this way.

<F P=106> ["Text" of speech by Seimas Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas </F>
before the Polish Sejm in Warsaw on 17 December 1993: 
"`Although There Might Be Obstacles in Our Way...'"] 
  [Text] Highly Esteemed Chairman of the Sejm of the 
Republic of Poland! 
  Ladies and Gentlemen! 
  It is my great honor, as chairman of the Seimas [parliament] 
of the Republic of Lithuania, to greet the representatives 
elected by the Polish people and the Polish nation itself from 
this high podium. 
  I am even more excited because this is the first address by 
the leader of the parliament of independent Lithuania to the 
Polish Sejm -- an European legislature with a 500-year tradition. 
  I am grateful to His Excellency Jozef Oleksy, chairman of 
the 
Polish Sejm, for his invitation to pay an official visit to the 
Republic of Poland. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen! 
  Poles and Lithuanians are linked by a long and complicated 
history. For several centuries, our nations lived as one state, 
they shared common values and the same religion. They stood 
shoulder to shoulder while defending the freedom of their 
homeland from aggressors and oppressors. They fought together, 
both on the field of Grunwald and in the anti-czarist uprisings. 
We saw the same struggle in the activities of "Solidarity" and 
"Sajudis" which helped preserve the idea of our nations' freedom 
and allowed us to cast off the yoke of totalitarianism under 
favorable conditions. It is symbolic that the first anti-Soviet 
rally in 1987 was held at the monument to A. Mickiewicz [Polish 
19th-century poet] in Vilnius. 
  There have also been difficult and even tragic moments in 
our 
common history. Certainly, every nation has its own historical 
memory. Today, however, we, politicians, must look to the 
future for our common sake and strengthen common issues without 
dramatizing those ones which divide us or which we assess 
differently. This is the only promising policy. 
  The Lithuanian people learned how to overcome such 
historical 
recollections when Pope John Paul II blessed their land this 
last fall. The pope blessed people of all ethnic groups 
residing in Lithuania during his pilgrimage. The Holy Father 
has brought great love to Lithuania, which he kept alive even 
when Lithuania was not yet free. 
  I experienced the bloody Sunday on 13 January 1991 and the 
August coup in Moscow which decided the fate of not only the 
Baltic states but, probably, of all Eastern Europe. During 
those hard days, we felt support from Polish leaders, the 
parliament, and the Polish people for which we are extremely 
grateful. It is to Warsaw that the head of Lithuania's 
potential government-in-exile went in January of 1991. 
  After the restoration of independence, Lithuania had to 
accomplish in a short time the same as what other European 
nations has built over decades. Our neighbors, the Poles, know 
this very well, because this process began in your country 
considerably earlier. Today, Lithuania already has a balanced 
and democratic system of government institutions. In the 1992 
Seimas elections, the people also voted in a referendum on the 
Constitution and approved it. At the beginning of this year, we 
already had the president elected by the nation -- Algirdas 
Brazauskas, who accomplished much in destroying the CPSU 
monster. We also have a functioning Constitutional Court. 
  All of this, as well as the European-type laws on 
citizenship 
and ethnic minorities, created conditions for Lithuania to 
become a member of the European Council this past spring. By 
the way, we felt the support of Polish parliamentarians in 
Strasbourg as well. 
  People of different nationalities have lived side by side in 
Lithuania for centuries. They have created and strengthened its 
statehood. We have not had and, I hope, will never have any hot 
ethnic conflicts. The loyalty of people of other nationalities 
to their state has been a condition for the development of our 
statehood and Lithuania's territorial integrity rather than a 
trait of their cold tolerance or exited adoration. 
  The Polish community in Lithuania is among the largest 
non-Lithuanian minority. Currently, we have over 130 Polish 
secondary schools and 140 kindergartens. There are eight 
publications in the Polish language. Some of them, for example, 
KURIER WILENSKI, are financed from the state budget. Despite 
the current difficulties, folklore groups are operating. 
Shortly, the cultural identity of ethnic minorities will be 
secured in Lithuania. 
  We will continue to support citizens of all nationalities in 
Lithuania, and assist them, including the Polish community, in 
resolving their numerous problems. We hope that other states 
will adopt a similar position toward their ethnic minorities. 
  It is even more difficult to resolve the country's economic 
problems. We have received a difficult legacy. We are forced 
to look for ways of mollifying the negative effects of economic 
reform and restoring what was heedlessly destroyed in the name 
of reform. The first positive tendencies have become noticeable 
in Lithuania's economy today. Following the introduction of the 
litas, inflation has dropped by 4.5 times (in comparison with 
last year). People's real incomes have begun to grow gradually. 
  The key goal of economic reform is to successfully continue 
privatization, particularly of large enterprises, by attracting 
foreign investors. It is only in this way that we can revive 
our flagging production and increase exports. Another extremely 
important task is to overcome the crisis in agriculture. 
  At the same time, we understand perfectly well that these 
are 
common problems which weigh heavily on those post-communist 
countries pursuing the difficult course from totalitarianism and 
a centralized economy to democracy and a market economy -- to a 
free market "with a human face," according to one of your 
politicians. Therefore, we would think that the mutual exchange 
of experience is particularly important. On this occasion, I 
would like to recall and support our President Algirdas 
Brazauskas' initiative to hold a meeting among the leaders of 
the post-communist states. 
  Highly Esteemed Ladies and Gentlemen! The most serious 
recent concern of Lithuanian foreign policy was to achieve the 
immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops from our country. This 
has been realized this year, although with great difficulty! 
Conditions for the implementation of other aspirations have 
emerged. You know that Lithuania's strategic interest is to 
join the European Union, at least as an associate member in the 
beginning. We must also integrate with international security 
systems. By taking an active part in the CSCE process, 
Lithuania is thinking about membership in the West European 
Union and NATO. We realize that this is a long process, the 
stages of which are being discussed only now. On the other 
hand, is not the West too slow and careful in considering 
everything? 
  We seek good-neighborly relations and cooperation with 
bordering countries. We are moving over from declarations to 
definite action in expanding our relations with the sisters of 
the same fate -- Latvia and Estonia. We have set up the Baltic 
Council and signed a trilateral free trade agreement. We have 
also signed and are drafting different agreements with Russia, 
Belarus, and Ukraine. We hope that the results of the elections 
in Russia will not distort its democratic development. The 
decisions on Kaliningrad Oblast will also be of great importance 
in safeguarding regional security. We, as well as you, are 
particularly concerned with the demilitarization of this region, 
which, I think, is a problem for all of Europe. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen! We devote special attention to our 
relations with neighboring Poland. A number of agreements have 
been signed between our countries. However, the most important 
current task is to conclude the drafting of the treaty and the 
declaration on friendly cooperation and good-neighborly 
relations. I would like to express the hope from this high 
podium that this will be accomplished without delay. This would 
assist in expanding economic cooperation between our countries. 
Poland ranks second among those countries which have joint 
ventures with Lithuania. However, the amount of mutual trade is 
not considerable. Therefore, the signing of a bilateral free 
trade agreement becomes particularly pressing. 
  Our parliaments could also show more initiative in 
developing 
relations between the two countries. Closer ties, more frequent 
meetings, and mutual studies of parliamentary experience could 
contribute to this. A constant dialogue is essential. However, 
it is this dialogue that we have lacked thus far. We must 
correct not the very best traditions that we have adopted. The 
current distribution of forces in both legislatures allows us to 
effectively resolve the common problems of the present and the 
future. Eventually, it is important to realize our 
good-neighborly relations as a fundamental mutual need both 
today and tomorrow rather than a short period of warming. It is 
only this interpretation of the current issue that will enable 
us to build firm and reliable bridges in interstate relations. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen! 
  Arriving to Warsaw, I could not forget the fact that my 
father shed his blood somewhere near the Vistula in 1939 when 
fighting against Hitler's aggressors. In conclusion, I would 
like to wish closer cooperation to the Polish and the Lithuanian 
nations, which have experienced much suffering on their common 
path to a new Europe. As A. Mickiewicz wrote: 
  "Although there might be obstacles in our way, 
  We will attain our goal -- brotherhood will prevail, 
  Because we have courage, labor, and unity 
  Written in our hearts." 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for your attention!

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 11, BNS - The Lithuanian oil 
export-import terminal in Butinge and the Latvian terminal for 
the import and export of light oil products in Liepaja will be 
two unrelated energy units, Lithuanian Energy Minister 
Algimantas Stasiukynas said Tuesday. 
  Commenting on the results of the Monday meeting with Latvian 
energy officials, Stasiukynas said the Latvian side expected to 
agree on the joint construction of a huge oil terminal in 
Liepaja, but all hopes failed when it became clear that the 
relief of the sea bottom near the Latvian port is unsuitable for 
the project. 
  The minister said the future terminal in Liepaja would be 
quite small and would handle around 3 million tons of oil 
products each year. But the Latvian terminal could greatly 
contribute to regulating oil prices in Latvia and Lithuania, 
Stasiukynas said. 
  Latvia intends to start building its terminal in spring and 
hopes to complete it by the end of the year. Separate talks will 
be held to discuss Lithuania's possible participation in the 
project. The earlier Lithuanian-Latvian protocol on oil 
terminal construction is void, the minister said. 
  The official confirmed that the main designer of the 
Lithuanian terminal should be known in late January. 
  Stasiukynas said Lithuania suggests Latvians to invest in 
the 
Butinge terminal and the step would mean that a joint project is 
carried out. International financial organizations previously 
pressured Lithuania to build a joint oil terminal, however the 
minister doubts whether Latvia would be willing to invest in 
Butinge.

  [Text] A step forward was made in the negotiations with 
Latvia on the state maritime border, Lithuanian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Vladislovas Domarkas told the Baltic News Service 
correspondent after the meeting in Liepaja yesterday. 
  An agreement in principle has been reached with Latvia that 
the state maritime border will proceed as a continuation of the 
state land border while the boundary of the economic zone will 
run parallel to the sea shore. 
  According to Domarkas, such agreement is a result of 
bilateral compromise. The principle concepts of the agreement, 
however, will have to be endorsed by the parliaments of both 
countries. 
  A possibility to set up yet another special zone next to the 
border of the economic zone in which both parties could exploit 
the sea shelf was also discussed in Liepaja by the 
representatives from the Lithuanian and Latvian Ministries of 
Foreign Affairs. 
  Domarkas hopes that the treaty on the Lithuanian-Latvian sea 
border would be given final coordination by the Lithuanian and 
Latvian prime ministers on 19 January in Riga, where a 
tripartite meeting of the leaders of the three Baltic states 
will be held.

<F P=106> [Article by Neris Germanas, Seimas chancellor and member of </F>
the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party: "The Fever of `Taking' 
Power"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The right-wing opposition 
declares its adherence to the principles of democracy, while at 
the same time it tries to destroy the legally elected government 
by all means. It has one sole goal -- to regain its lost power 
at any cost. However, this cannot be achieved in a democratic 
manner, at least not in the near future. 
  All sociological surveys to date show that, despite all 
proposed populist and socialist slogans, the rating of rightist 
parties is low. 
  Nevertheless, it is very difficult to wait for the election 
date set by the Constitution.... The only thing that remains 
then is to arouse emotions, inspire and often even organize 
different acts of dissatisfaction and strikes, and enhance 
social tension through all possible measures, often by 
objectively damaging the vital interests of the state and 
satisfying egoistical personal or group interests. All this is 
accomplished under the cover of the same well-known 
organizations, and recently even in the name of "the nation" and 
"the working people." 
  How familiar everything is! 
  Turning back to the past and analyzing different facts, one 
can say today that such well-planned and coordinated actions 
began immediately after 25 October 1992, when the Seimas 
[parliament] of the Republic of Lithuania assembled for its 
first session. It was already then, when the bitterness of the 
right wing over its defeat in the parliamentary elections had 
not yet subsided, that a course toward the removal of 
Lithuania's new and democratic power was chosen. If in the 
beginning the right wing had some illusion that the presidential 
elections might change the situation slightly, it became 
absolutely clear to its leaders after the ballot that their 
prestige among the population is hopelessly low. We can judge 
this from the fact that their leader V. Landsbergis refused to 
run for the Presidency, and they had to search for such a 
candidate [S. Lozoraitis] abroad. All this must have encouraged 
them to continue the policy of discrediting and "taking" power. 
It is paradoxical that radicals from the other extreme are 
talking similarly about the necessity of "taking" power. 
  Since the very beginning, the minds of local and foreign 
"strategists" have considered two possible ways of returning to 
power -- armed and unarmed. Conditions have been created for 
both options, without dismissing either one. Recurrent rumors 
about possible coups were not only statements by irresponsible 
people, as sometimes they are presented. [passage omitted] 
  The withdrawal of a volunteers' group to the woods near 
Kaunas also had different goals aside from service and 
accommodation problems. This was not an attempt to rise or to 
raise an armed conflict. Its key goal was to test the reaction 
of the community -- and not only in Lithuania -- to the 
possibility of "taking" power by force of arms. [passage 
omitted] 
  Power seems to be the sweetest and most desired fruit for 
some people. It is no wonder that the first public talks about 
early elections began after this failed armed action. This 
means that another and historically legal way of "taking" power 
was chosen. The scenario is totally clear: To build up a 
feeling of dissatisfaction in the community, organize strikes 
and other actions, put forward and implement the idea of a 
referendum; in other words, to remove the current government and 
return to power. There is no talk about some serious program of 
action because it does not exist. The most important thing is 
to return to power. 
  This campaign began at meetings with constituents in 
different areas back in the summer. [passage omitted] 
  The congress of the Homeland Union (Lithuanian 
Conservatives), held on 11-12 December, clearly mentioned the 
necessity of early elections. 
  It is not enough to put forward an idea. It is necessary to 
root it in "cultivated" soil. 
  What affects the human mood most today? 
  The economy! Therefore, to inspire the citizens' 
dissatisfaction, first of all, it is necessary to make them 
discontent with both the country's economic situation and their 
own financial condition. 
  Of course, this situation is really difficult today. 
However, it has not emerged over the past year alone. For 
example, the highest inflation in Lithuania was between 1991 and 
1992. However, the initiators of new elections keep silent 
about this. 
  Right-wing forces can aggravate the current situation 
through 
their representatives in various government structures by 
"putting spokes" into government policies and fostering relevant 
social moods. Furthermore, it is quite easy to exaggerate 
different threats and inspire suspicion in today's politicized 
Lithuania in personal and political group interests. 
  We can clearly notice all of this in our current life. 
Seeking its own interests alone and discarding long-term state 
interests, the right-wing opposition is pursuing the tactics of 
economic and financial destabilization and government paralysis. 
I could mention the constant blocking of credits to Lithuania 
and the discarding of almost all proposed decisions in the 
Seimas as an example. However, loans from Western countries and 
international organizations link Lithuania firmly with those 
states and help it resolve definite economic problems. However, 
it looks like the right-wing opposition does not need this. 
  In the social sphere, the opposition is constantly trying to 
sustain tension by inspiring and, maybe, organizing strikes and 
supporting the demands of pensioners, disabled people, farmers, 
and practically all other protesters. [passage omitted] 
  Special attention is devoted to the Lithuanian Democratic 
Labor Party [LDDP]. Destroying LDDP unity, causing suspicion 
among its members, and advocating a split, a "hardline" policy, 
and "strong" personalities in the mass media in a peculiar 
manner, the right-wing opposition seeks to undermine the LDDP 
influence in the community, government structures, and the 
Seimas. 
  One could provide many more examples of such obvious and not 
so apparent activities. However, the presented examples may be 
sufficient to draw one conclusion: All of these activities have 
one key goal -- to discredit the party which enjoys the majority 
in the Seimas and its government, and seek early elections by 
all possible means. 
  As the prime ministers of the three Baltic states noted 
unanimously yesterday, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have 
already survived the worst times. Foreign experts also confirm 
this. Thus, what is the aim of this destructive policy of 
negation? Certainly, not to serve Lithuania!

<F P=106> ["Topical Commentary" by military observer Vladimir Klimov: </F>
"Ministry's Green Shoulder Boards"] 
  [Text] Border guards have always been the people's 
blue-eyed boys. I have not seen a single movie or read a single 
book that has been disparaging about the guys in green service 
caps. I have not heard them being accused of links with the 
criminal world, of cruelty, of bullying.... Even when the KGB 
was being abused, they did not touch the border guards, although 
structurally they came under the committee. 
  The nationwide esteem for them is understandable: The guys 
protect the fatherland's borders, the threshold of our home. 
Relations in military collectives there are always normal 
because the border guards fulfill a combat task even in 
peacetime. The service is specific, and they shoulder a 
tremendous responsibility. Their independence was virtually 
predetermined. They have secured it: An edict of the Russian 
Federation president has created the Federal Border Service 
[FBS]-High Command of the Border Troops with the rights of a 
federal ministry. It is headed by the commander in chief of the 
Border Troops. He is Colonel General Andrey Ivanovich Nikolayev. 
  Much is demanded of him to whom much is given. The FBS-High 
Command directs the official combat, operational, 
financial-economic, and other activities of the Border Troops. 
Not all the former links are being broken. The Federal 
Counterintelligence Service is the coordinating organ for border 
guards in questions of operational-investigative activity. The 
previously developed system of supply and material-technical 
backup for both services is not being destroyed either. 
  As previously, the border guards' tasks are immense and on a 
par with Russia's expanses. 
  The new ministry's functions are largely traditional, but 
new 
responsibilities have also appeared -- for example, 
participation in the fulfillment of federal programs for 
ensuring the safety of the individual. The FBS will live not 
only for the present day. On the basis of long-term forecasts of 
the development of the operational situation on the border the 
service elaborates the concept of its protection, conducts 
long-term planning, and organizes information-analytical 
activity. 
  Operational-investigative activity and the ensuring of one's 
own safety will require extensive specialized knowledge and 
painstaking work. Without going into details, I will single out 
just one of the points of interest to the reader at large: 
Henceforth the FBS organizes the conclusion of contracts on the 
performance of military service by border guards. 
  Further. In the edict I have counted 27 points directly 
concerning the commander in chief. Incidentally, each of the 
tasks set before him may be broken down into hundreds more. So 
Gen. Andrey Nikolayev's categorical response to my request for 
an interview became clear to me: "It is not necessary to comment 
on the edict but to carry it out...."

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1815 GMT on 11 January broadcasts in its "Details" 
program a feature by Sergey Dorenko, in which he reviews past 
relations between the Russian president, government, and 
parliament and looks at possible future developments. 
  The program includes recorded remarks from an interview with 
Yegor Gaydar by Dorenko; the place and date of the interview are 
not given. 
  Gaydar says: "The prime minister has consulted me regarding 
proposals on reorganizing the government. Both the president 
and the prime minister have asked me to stay in a new and 
reorganized government. I know certain ideas and alternatives 
that have been formulated in this area." Gaydar refuses to 
divulge any details. 
  Dorenko then mentions that Gaydar's most recent meeting with 
Yeltsin took place on 31 December, and asks Gaydar whether he 
will be held responsible for somebody else's decisions. Gaydar 
replies: "A situation, the ongoing situation, when someone else 
is making decisions for which we have to bear responsibility is 
absolutely intolerable to us. If, for instance, a decision is 
taken against the will and position of our like-minded 
colleagues... [pauses] I will fight to keep our monetary and 
financial policy fairly consistent and will oppose irresponsible 
decisions. I will fight to prevent some members of the Cabinet, 
who are good guys, from making empty and irresponsible promises 
while other members of the cabinet, the bad guys, have to 
explain later why these promises could not be kept." 
  Dorenko concludes the program by saying that power in Russia 
remains shrouded in secrecy, that is why his program contains so 
many conjectures and too few facts.

<F P=106> [Article by Yelena Ovcharenko and Leonid Timofeyev under the </F>
"Ambassadorial Rumors" rubric: "How Diplomats Are Packaged"] 
  [Text] The resignation request from Russian First Deputy 
Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin was submitted to President 
Yeltsin even before the New Year holiday. The reason for this 
was his election to the State Duma as a representative of the 
Yabloko bloc. 
  And he will be replaced as deputy minister by the current 
Russian ambassador to Spain, Igor Ivanov. He is well-known in 
the Foreign Ministry, as he headed that department's general 
secretariat for a long time. 
  An additional two ambassadors will occupy offices in the 
skyscraper on Smolensk Square. They are Aleksandr Panov, 
ambassador to South Korea; and Albert Chernyshev, who has 
represented Russia in Turkey for six years now. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry has made it known that all 
these 
reshuffles are of planned nature and are in line with the 
principle of staff rotation. They do not hide their 
satisfaction there that leading posts will be occupied by career 
diplomats. 
  The fate of the ambassador in London, Boris Pankin, will 
probably be different. For the time being he remains there, but 
the decision to replace him was made long ago. 
  According to our information, the Tetrapak company, which 
intends to pool its efforts in the near future with the French 
company, Alfa-Laval, on learning that Boris Pankin was about to 
leave his post, immediately offered him a job as a consultant in 
"any country" of his choice. He has supposedly opted for 
Sweden, where, we remind you, he was once ambassador. Tetrapak 
produces packaging, including cartons for milk. 
  Some are moving into commerce, others returning to big-time 
politics. When we rang Washington, [Ambassador] Vladimir 
Petrovich Lukin was upbeat. In masterly fashion he parried our 
probing question, "Is it true that you are down to be deputy 
speaker?" "I am ready for anything? Let's see when we get 
there. Incidentally, the job is not that attractive, it's pure 
anxiety and turmoil, particularly if they decide to turn the 
speaker into a lightning rod." Vladimir Petrovich said. "I 
don't envy the speaker--he will have a tough job." 
  While observing that he knew several suitable people who 
could occupy the vacant ambassadorial posts, Lukin was reluctant 
to give their names so as to avoid, as we understood it, 
inadvertently doing them an ill turn. On the other hand, he 
gladly told us about the attributes which they, according to the 
diplomat, should possess. In Washington he would like to see 
someone with considerable experience and knowledge of both the 
language and the country. 
  The Washington Embassy throughtout has been a source of 
alternative information for the president, the government, and 
the Foreign Ministry. A valuable quality for those who know how 
to avoid being in thrall to "convenient" assessments.

<F P=106> [Article by journalist Irina Alekseyeva: "Four Vice </F>
Premiers in New Government. Whom Will the Premier Invite?"] 
  [Text] Boris Yeltsin recently signed an edict on the 
structure of the organs of executive power. The document 
provides for the presence of four vice premiers in the Cabinet 
of Ministers, two of whom should be first vice premiers. Viktor 
Chernomyrdin must give their names within a week. 
  Obviously the premier will choose the new vice premiers from 
the nine who are already working now. Here he will have to be 
guided not only by his personal sympathies and antipathies but 
also by the disposition of political forces and the results of 
the elections to the State Duma. Government analysts, who have 
already run through many options, believe that it is to 
Chernomyrdin's advantage to set out his game of cadres patience 
in such a way that he himself is in the center and can thus 
strengthen his own positions. Otherwise, if a homogenous 
government is formed the premier runs the risk of coming under 
fire from the criticism of the offended side. So that to all 
appearances no radical changes in the government are predicted. 
  The main question is who will occupy the first four seats in 
the government, or rather the two first seats and the two second 
seats? 
  Obviously Oleg Soskovets will not be competing. Today, too, 
he is the first among the first three vice premiers (Soskovets, 
Gaydar, and Shumeyko). Chernomyrdin left him "in charge" when 
he went on vacation. 
  Oleg Nikolayevich's staying power is explained by the fact 
that it is he who in the government symbolizes the large army of 
industrialists and state officials. It will not be without 
interest also to recall the fact that Mr. Soskovets, who had 
been about to run as a deputy, withdrew his candidacy at the 
height of the election campaign. It is entirely possible that 
even then the premier had guaranteed him a leading place in the 
new government. 
  By analogy with Soskovets, the premier will obviously leave 
Aleksandr Zaveryukha among the four vice premiers as well. 
Behind him there is a large and influential Duma faction of 
agricultural experts and the Cabinet of Ministers leader cannot 
disregard him. Through Zaveryukha the premier will be able to 
influence not only the agricultural experts but also some of the 
Communists close in spirit to the collective farms' champion. 
Actually, regarding this candidacy, Viktor Stepanovich will 
probably not have to go through any internal struggles: The 
premier's sympathies toward Mr. Zaveryukha can be felt quite 
clearly. 
  You cannot confidently say the same about Chernomyrdin's 
attitude toward Gaydar. But the premier will hardly dare not to 
leave the young father of the Russian reforms and the leader of 
the largest duma factions among his vice premiers. Moreover 
Gaydar is a very convenient figure who can be blamed for all 
blunders in the work of the cabinet of ministers. You only have 
to use the standard and uncomplicated formula: "The reforms are 
proceeding somewhere in the wrong direction..." -- and everyone 
will immediately understand that Gaydar is to blame. 
  And who will be the fourth? Probably not Shumeyko. It is 
even more likely that Shakhray will not be the fourth. The 
elections showed that there are not substantial enough forces 
behind the party that he conceived. 
  Probably the fourth could in theory be Anatoliy Chubays, 
were 
it not for the powerful and vigorous figure of Boris Fedorov. 
Much now depends on Fedorov. No one can any longer hold the 
budget together -- even Chernomyrdin probably understands that 
now. Removing Fedorov would mean getting hyperinflation within 
three months. 
  But there is a suggestion that even Fedorov could be 
bypassed. And by none other than the present vice premier Yuriy 
Yarov, a politician distinguished mostly for the fact that he is 
the only vice premier who has not managed to distinguish himself 
by any action or if worst comes to worst by any statement for 
the press. Having such a vice premier to hand would be far more 
peaceful for Chernomyrdin than having the irrepressible Fedorov. 
By an irony of fate Mr. Yarov entered the Duma on the "Russia's 
Choice" list so that party formalities will be observed if he 
should be appointed. 
  Who will Chernomyrdin appoint as his second "first vice 
premier?" Most likely Gaydar -- the leader of the "Russia's 
Choice" movement. 
  Actually, it is not out of the question that the matter may 
end most unexpectedly. It is no accident that one high-ranking 
government official who wishes to remain anonymous stated in a 
talk with your correspondent: "If a government that does not 
suit the reformers is proposed, we shall not stay here as 
whipping boys."

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Baturin, the Russian president's </F>
national security adviser, by Andrey Poleshchuk in the "Power" 
column: "Yuriy Baturin: `I Have Been Taught Not To Be Afraid 
of Difficult Problems.' On Christmas Eve He Was Appointed the 
Russian President's First National Security Adviser"] 
  [Excerpts] [Poleshchuk] People in this country have grown 
accustomed to frequent cadre reshuffles and structural changes 
in the upper echelons of power. Still, the introduction of the 
post of the Russian president's national security adviser has 
come as a great surprise. If only because, if I am not 
mistaken, there has not been the slightest leak of information 
about the upcoming event, although such leaks have become almost 
commonplace recently. Was it a surprise to you also? 
  [Baturin] Yes, it was a total surprise to me. 
  [Poleshchuk] You did not undertake any efforts along these 
lines? 
  [Baturin] It had never even occurred to me to work in this 
direction. And, as you have stated quite correctly, there have 
been no leaks. I did not know anything about it. This 
obviously suggests that the decision has been made either by the 
president himself or that he has discussed this matter with an 
extremely narrow circle of people. [passage omitted] 
  [Poleshchuk] Was it a coincidence that a decision to 
introduce the post of national security adviser was made on the 
eve of President Clinton's visit to Moscow? Is there not some 
hidden implication, some "second trunk bottom" here? 
  [Baturin] I cannot respond to this question for reasons I 
have already explained. But I think that indirectly this could 
have produced an impact. In recent days Boris Nikolayevich has 
been making very thorough preparations for the meeting with 
President Clinton. And apparently he has been constantly 
mindful of such an efficient U.S. state structure. In other 
words, this factor could be seen as a general background. But 
again, this is merely supposition. It is not worth trying to 
guess at what the president thinks. It is better simply to ask 
him. 
  [Poleshchuk] Have you been actively involved in preparing 
the meeting with the U.S. President? 
  [Baturin] No, I would say that the president has an aide on 
international affairs, Dmitriy Ryurikov, who has been long and 
thoroughly preparing this meeting. At this point perhaps I 
could join in. But then too little time has passed since my 
appointment to get engaged in this work. [passage omitted] 
  [Poleshchuk] How would you respond to this statement: The 
post of the national security adviser is extremely necessary for 
the country's leadership today amid the dramatic reforms in the 
power departments, in particular the Security Ministry? The 
president needs an absolutely trustworthy man who will oversee 
the power ministries.... 
  [Baturin] This reasoning is quite rational. And such ideas 
have long been expressed to the president, for instance in the 
course of his meetings with Presidential Council members. As 
far as I could see, the president listened to all of that but 
showed no reaction -- either positive or negative. At least, in 
my presence. [passage omitted] 
  [Poleshchuk] And with respect to your personal contacts with 
the "power ministers," are you familiar with them? Have you had 
any contacts? Have you been in conflict? 
  [Baturin] I had not met Nikolay Mikhaylovich Golushko (head 
of the Federal Counterintelligence Service -- A. P.) until last 
August. I first saw him at close quarters during a session of 
the Security Council's interdepartmental commission where I was 
present as a presidential aide. Then there were a few casual 
meetings in the corridors without any conversations. The same 
goes for Stepashin (Golushko's first deputy -- A. P.). I first 
had a detailed talk with him at the end of December, when the 
president tasked me to take part in preparing a statute on the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service. I have known Yevgeniy 
Maksimovich Primakov (director of the Foreign Intelligence 
Service -- A. P.) since the end of the 80's. After all, he also 
comes from the academic world but he belonged to another weight 
category and we had no close contacts. I had an exhaustive 
conversation with Colonel General Andrey Ivanovich Nikolayev 
(commander in chief of the Russian border troops -- A. P.) after 
my appointment. Incidentally, many were wondering whether he 
would be able to command the border guards. I would say that as 
chief of the border service he has produced a very favorable 
impression on me. Just like Golushko, I have met Viktor 
Fedorovich Yerin (internal affairs minister -- A. P.) only at 
various sessions. We were not closely familiar. 
  [Poleshchuk] A new post apparently presupposes the 
existence of a national security concept.... 
  [Baturin] The concept has been there and it continues to be 
developed. Now there is a law on security: It was elaborated 
on the basis of a certain security concept. The law was adopted 
but work on the concept has not stopped: It must change all the 
time to keep in tune with the changing conditions. And 
conditions today are changing very fast. 
  [Poleshchuk] But will a readable text be finally produced? 
  [Baturin] I think so. At any rate, this was done in the 
Security Council. Of course, now I shall be taking part in 
this. And apparently I will somehow influence the content of 
this concept. 
  [Poleshchuk] Does the introduction of the post of national 
security adviser mean that he automatically becomes head of the 
Security Council? 
  [Baturin] No. 
  [Poleshchuk] Up to now the question about adopting a concept 
on the Federal Counterintelligence Service remains open, 
although according to some reports, the text of the document was 
ready by the day of President Yeltsin's 21 December 1993 edict 
abolishing the Russian Federation Security Ministry. When, in 
your opinion, should the concept's approval be expected? 
  [Baturin] I am afraid that you are in a little hurry here. 
The adoption of the Statue on the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service is a kind of foundation. But still there is a lot that 
remains to be done there. It is also necessary to carry through 
the reforms. The options are as follows. Either this concept 
existed before and is now being implemented, but I do not think 
that this is the best hypothesis. Or the building of the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service began not according to a 
detailed plan but according to a general outline proposed by 
someone. In this case this work must be finalized as soon as 
possible. Because a gap in reforms at the center and at the 
local level can be very dangerous. And once the entire 
framework of the Federal Counterintelligence Service has become 
clear and obvious, then we can see how good and effective is the 
concept which existed either in full or as a general outline. 
And then improve on it. I think that this version more 
corresponds to the truth. [passage omitted] 
  [Poleshchuk] You are known as one of the main architects of 
a large number of documents defining Russia's present 
development. How do you envision the country's immediate future? 
What would you say to those who say that Russia is consistently 
moving toward tough authoritarian rule? 
  [Baturin] Indeed, this is so. The adopted constitution 
provides for a model of tough authority. But the strength and 
toughness of authority lies not only and not so much in the 
model that exists in the constitution, in the minds or in public 
consciousness. It is also in how far the plans and decisions of 
this authority can be implemented. And many decisions -- I mean 
not only those by the president but also the government and the 
former Supreme Soviet -- were not obeyed. And this fact 
strongly undermines the version about dictatorship and a tough 
authoritarian hand. But the historical movement, the trend.... 
Quite naturally, after the pendulum has swung toward 
democratization to such an extent when it began to verge on 
anarchy, it has swung to the other side. But the pendulum will 
not freeze at this point and will soon start moving back. There 
is much of what is dangerous and unpleasant but there is nothing 
fatally terrible. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Vladimir Zaynetdinov report: "Can You Count on a </F>
Counterspy? Russian Special Service Leaders Go Public"] 
  [Text] Boris Yeltsin signed the "Statute on the Russian 
Federation Federal Counterintelligence Service" on 5 January. 
The new special service did not keep journalists in an agony of 
suspense but held a press conference straight after the Orthodox 
Christmas holiday. 
  It was stated at the press conference that Russia's Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FCS] is the legal successor to the 
Security Ministry but is in no way "a clone of the disbanded 
ministry since it is a...special service" (and what was it, 
then, we had before?). The FCS' main mission is to detect, 
prevent, or stop intelligence and subversive activity directed 
against Russia by foreign special services and organizations; to 
combat terrorism, the illegal trade in drugs and weapons, and 
illegal armed formations; and to ensure the day-to-day 
protection of Russia's state border. 
  Twenty foreign spies were caught red-handed in Russia last 
year. Several state officials recruited by foreign special 
services have been dismissed from their posts on the submission 
of the former Security Ministry's counterintelligence service. 
  The reorganization of the Security Ministry and the creation 
of the FCS is in full swing: Among other things, the former 
Security Ministry's investigation administration has been 
transferred to the General Prosecutor's Office and the Lefortovo 
detention center transferred to the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs; certain special operations subunits have moved to the 
Federal Government Communications and Information Agency; and 
the fight against organized crime and racketeering (apart from 
corruption in the top echelons of power) has been handed over 
completely to the militia. On the other hand the Alfa and Vympel 
special antiterrorist subunits remain part of the president's 
Main Protection Administration. As FCS First Deputy Director 
Sergey Stepashin stated, "the preconditions for political 
investigation to arise have been completely eliminated." 
However, he did advocate the creation of an internal 
intelligence service (and is that not the same thing?). 
  The FCS' strength will, compared with the Security Ministry, 
decrease by 46 percent and amount to no more than 75,000 
staffers countrywide. However, there will be no cuts in 
counterintelligence operational subunits, which are under 
strength. All the special service reforms will be completed 
within one month of the statute being signed. 
  According to Sergey Stepashin, the special assessment 
commission now operating in the FCS will carry out the 
reassessment of cadres within one month. The central apparatus 
will be slimmed down from 3,500 to 1,500 persons. 
  As Sergey Stepashin observed, President Yeltsin in a 
conversation with him, drew attention to the fact that there 
have been no purges whatsoever in the process of reorganization 
and cadre selection has been carried out on the basis of 
qualities such as professionalism and loyal service to the 
fatherland and the state. As far as staffers who fail the 
assessment are concerned, they will not, as Sergey Stepashin 
stated, find themselves without a job but will be able to 
transfer to the Internal Affairs Ministry, the tax police, or 
the General Prosecutor's Office.

<F P=106> [Viktor Kharlamov report: "The President Will Control </F>
Counterintelligence"] 
  [Text] At his meeting with journalists yesterday, Sergey 
Stepashin described the Russian president's edict abolishing the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Security as an "expected 
surprise." But in a private conversation with me an acquaintance 
of mine, an employee of the abolished ministry, provided a 
different description of this edict -- "a taming of shrews." 
  Who, then, will take the place of the former Ministry of 
Security? To all appearances, Russia's Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FCS], directly subordinate to the 
president, will now become "the motherland's shield." In 
addition to combating foreign special services, it is also 
entrusted with functions such as combating terrorism, illegal 
arms trafficking, the drug mafia, and armed bandit formations. 
Economic and military counterintelligence remains under the FCS 
wing. 
  The investigative apparatus passes to the Russian General 
Prosecutor's Office, special subunits pass to the Federal Agency 
of Government Communications and Information and the Main 
Administration of the President's Guard, while the notorious 
"Lefortovo" passes to the jurisdiction of the MVD [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs]. 
  The Russian Federation Border Guard Troops have also been 
detached and transformed into the independent Federal Border 
Service with the rights of a separate ministry. 
  The staff of the counterintelligence organs has been reduced 
-- to 75,000 employees in the provinces and 1,500 in the 
management apparatus. In the opinion of Sergey Stepashin, first 
deputy director of the FCS, such a reorganization will not 
affect the quality of the special services' work. But those who 
wish to stay will have to undergo recertification at the 
president's request, which will drag on for approximately one 
month. 
  The question of the transfer of the "Alfa" and "Vympel" 
subunits to the FCS has not yet been raised, but, bearing in 
mind the struggle against terrorism, the counterintelligence 
service will still have to acquire its own special-purpose 
subunit. 
  The Main Administration of the President's Guard and the 
MVD, 
which is increasingly turning into a supermonster like the sadly 
memorable GPU-NKVD [State Political Administration-People's 
Commissariat for Internal Affairs], will most likely tackle 
"internal intelligence" or, roughly speaking, political 
surveillance of the opposition and of political parties. 
  There is another "expected surprise." Yuriy Baturin was 
appointed the Russian president's assistant for national 
security. He seems to be becoming one of the most influential 
figures in Boris Yeltsin's entourage as controller of all the 
country's power structures.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Stepashin, first deputy director of </F>
the Federal Counterintelligence Service, by Boris Sopelnyak; 
place and date not given: "Things Will Get No Easier for Spies"] 
  [Text] [Sopelnyak] The time that the president set aside 
for elaborating the statute on the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service [FCS] has expired. What has this period been like for 
you? Have the former Security Ministry apparatus and its 
directorates been working or have they all been waiting for the 
decision on their fate? Have things become easier for 
terrorists, the corrupt, spies, and other of your "clients"? 
After all, for almost three weeks there have been just two 
officials at the Federal Counterintelligence Service -- the 
director of the new service and yourself. 
  [Stepashin] As is well-known, during this period B.N. 
Yeltsin signed three edicts relating to our service -- two open 
edicts and one classified edict. I had a personal meeting with 
the president lasting more than an hour on 5 January. That 
meeting resulted in the signing of the edict setting up the FCS. 
  To be frank, there was a certain element of panic among my 
colleagues -- after all, they are all waiting for 
recertification of their jobs. But we reassured people that 
there would be no purge and that those who fail to come through 
the recertification could resign or be dismissed but would not 
be left jobless -- some would go to the MVD [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs], others to the Prosecutor's Office, others to 
the Tax Police, and so forth. Foreign special services have not 
relaxed their efforts during this period, our former brothers 
from the Baltic and Georgia are making their presence felt, 
corruption is still prevalent, and terrorists have been active. 
So we have no time to sigh and feel sorry for ourselves -- we 
have to do our job. Twenty people have been arrested for 
espionage alone, and several dozen such cases are in the 
pipeline. The entire country was shaken by the abduction of the 
Rostov schoolchildren. The highly complex operation to free 
them was carried out brilliantly and, most important, without a 
single drop of blood being shed -- our operatives definitely 
deserve praise for that. 
  [Sopelnyak] At a 10 January press conference you said that 
the edict of 21 December last year was an expected surprise. 
What do you mean by that? Or did you have wind that an edict 
to abolish the Security Ministry was in the offing? 
  [Stepashin] Of course, I knew nothing about it. But I 
realized that our department needed radical restructuring and 
that we were often doing things that were alien to the security 
service. So the edict was timely. 
  [Sopelnyak] You were given two weeks to draw up the statute 
on the FCS. Is this document ready, and, if so, could you 
comment on its main points? 
  [Stepashin] As far as the statute on the FCS is concerned, 
it is ready and has been ratified by the Russian president. 
  The Russian Federation FCS is a central federal executive 
organ. Its mission includes the exposure, prevention, and 
curtailment of subversive intelligence activity by foreign 
special services and organizations, and of illegal attacks on 
Russia's constitutional system, sovereignty, territorial 
integrity, and defense capability. In its activity the FCS 
should be guided by the Constitution, laws, and other legal acts 
issued by organs of state power, as well as by international 
treaties. 
  [Sopelnyak] To whom will the FCS be subordinate -- the 
Federal Assembly, the government, or the president? 
  [Stepashin] The president. And to him directly, rather than 
any intermediate authorities. 
  [Sopelnyak] Does that mean that your assignments will be set 
by the president? 
  [Stepashin] Our assignments, as I have already said, are 
defined by the Constitution, laws, and the statute on the FCS. 
Our main mission is to obtain intelligence information on 
threats to Russia's security; to combat terrorism, illegal armed 
formations, and illegally created or prohibited associations 
attacking Russia's constitutional system; to expose, prevent, 
and curtail subversive intelligence activity by foreign special 
services against our country; to safeguard the security of state 
secrets and, of course, to provide the president with 
information on threats to the Russian Federation's security. 
  [Sopelnyak] That is a lot of assignments, and you will need 
people to carry them out. At the same time, the president's 
edict states that the size of the FCS' administrative apparatus 
should not exceed 1,500 people, and the total number of service 
and civilian personnel has been set at 75,000. We know another 
figure, too -- the number of FCS staffers will be 46 percent 
fewer than the former Security Ministry staff. Who will you be 
working with? Is it realistic to carry out the aforesaid 
mission with the number of staffers that the FCS will have 
available? 
  [Stepashin] Yes, it is. The personnel cut will be 
substantial, but we have worked out an entire system for 
carrying out this operation without affecting our performance. 
Some directorates will be disbanded, others will be merged -- 
we will be trying to avoid any duplication or overlapping in the 
work of certain subunits. Ultimately we will be left with the 
most necessary directorates. The most important of these are 
the Directorate for Counterintelligence Operations, the 
Directorate for Counterintelligence Provision for Strategic 
Installations, the Directorate for Military Counterintelligence, 
the Directorate for Economic Counterintelligence, the 
Directorate for Combating Terrorism, and a number of others. 
There will be virtually no staff cuts to these subunits either 
centrally or at the local level. But, for instance, there will 
have to be cuts to the Secretariat, the Material and Technical 
Services Directorate, or the Military Organizational Development 
Directorate. Moreover, certain subunits -- including the famous 
"Lefortovo" -- will be transferred to the MVD. 
  [Sopelnyak] Does this mean, to use the words of the 
presidential edict abolishing the Security Ministry, that 
counterintelligence work will not be relaxed? 
  [Stepashin] Under no circumstances! Moreover, our effort 
will be focused in precisely this area. 
  [Sopelnyak] What can you say about the "system of political 
investigation, which has been mothballed but could easily be 
reactivated"? 
  [Stepashin] There can be no question of any political 
investigation -- except, of course, for those cases when we are 
talking about illegally formed or prohibited associations of an 
extremist nature setting up armed formations and attacking the 
Russian constitutional system. 
  [Sopelnyak] The director is now leader of the FCS. Could 
you tell us about his rights and duties? 
  [Stepashin] First and foremost, the director heads the FCS 
and leads its 11-man collegium. Moreover, the director has one 
first deputy and five deputies. The president appoints the 
director and relieves him of his duties personally. The 
president also monitors the activity of the entire Russian FCS. 
As for the director, his rights and duties are not much 
different from those of the head of any other ministry. 
  [Sopelnyak] And, last, perhaps the most important question 
-- has Russia benefited from these transformations and will we 
ordinary Russian citizens benefit from them? 
  [Stepashin] First and foremost, I would like everyone to 
realize that the need to set up the FCS was dictated not by some 
kind of whim but by life itself. I am sure that the FCS, in 
taking what was best from its predecessors and avoiding what was 
"negative," will become a reliable shield for both Russia and 
all Russian citizens.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 11 TASS -- The working group headed 
by Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Shumeyko drafted 
an ordinance by the cabinet of ministers on the mass media. The 
document provides for a three-month suspension of the order to 
revaluate the capital assets of enterprises and organizations in 
its part concerning printing-houses, TASS was told today at the 
Russian Journalists' Union. The sharp rise in printing expenses 
nearly provoked a one-week strike of newspapermen. 
  Furthermore, the draft ordinance instructs the relevant 
agencies to consider the possibility of granting the mass media 
the status of cultural institutions in order to reduce taxes 
collected from them. The document also suggests that the 
publishers of children's books and textbooks be exempted from 
taxes and that socially important publications be subsidized by 
the state. 
  The draft also calls for certain amendments to the 
privatization programme for this year with a view to take a 
proper account of the mass media. Some governmental agencies 
are also instructed to solve other concrete problems facing the 
press. 
  The document is expected to be considered within the next 
few 
days. The working group of its drafters, which was set up as a 
result of the recent meeting of newspaper editors-in-chief and 
heads of journalists' associations with Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, includes head of the Russian Committee for 
the Press Boris Mironov, chairman of the Russian Journalists' 
Union Vsevolod Bogdanov, head of the Association of Publishers 
and Editors-in-Chief Ivan Laptev.

  [Text] Moscow, 12 Jan (ITAR-TASS) -- "I have reliable 
information known at present to very few people about how 
Zhirinovskiy's party was set up, St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy 
Sobchak said. It happened straight after the abolition of 
Article 6 in the Constitution of the day -- one that stipulated 
the CPSU's monopoly on power. 
  Today's issue of LITERATURNAYA GAZETA [LITERARY GAZETTE, a 
Moscow-based weekly] reports that Anatoliy Sobchak made this 
announcement during a ceremony at which he was presenting his 
new book, The Tbilisi Fracture, or Bloody Sunday 1989. 
  A multiparty system is in the offing, so we must act before 
the event, words to that effect were, according to the mayor, 
said by Mikhail Gorbachev at a Politburo sitting at the time. 
We ourselves ought to set up the first alternative party, but 
one that would be malleable. 
  The selection of a prospective party leader was left to the 
then-KGB, Sobchak says. As always, it rose to the task; it 
found among its so-called active reserve a man with the military 
rank of captain, whose name is now widely known. The name of 
the party, Liberal Democratic, was also invented there and then. 
It was a real success: After all, the word liberal has long 
been compromised in this country. Two weeks later the new party 
was officially registered. It was the first registered 
political party in the country, since the CPSU had never 
undergone the procedure; the party of Russian Communists was not 
registered until much later and under a slightly different name. 
  This story, the St. Petersburg mayor said, will be told in 
his next book, which is to be entitled: Once Upon a Time 
There Was a Communist Party.

<F P=106> [Edict No. 2285 of the Russian Federation president, </F>
"Questions of Agreements on the Division of Output From the Use 
of Natural Resources," dated Moscow, the Kremlin, 24 December 
1993 and signed by Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin] 
  [Text] For the purposes of creating legal bases for 
attracting Russian and foreign investments to search for, 
prospect, and extract mineral raw materials on the terms of 
agreements on the division of output during the period up to the 
coming into force of Russian Federation laws governing the 
procedure for applying such agreements and in accordance with 
Points 2 and 3 of the Russian Federation president's Edict No. 
1598 of 7 October 1993, "On Legal Regulation During the Period 
of Stage-By-Stage Constitutional Reform in the Russian 
Federation," I decree: 
  1. It is to be established that the agreement on the 
division of output (hereinafter called the agreement) is one 
form of the state's treaty relations with investors -- utilizers 
of natural resources -- which provides for the division of 
extracted mineral raw materials among the contracting parties, 
which takes the place of the levying of taxes, dues, and duties, 
including customs and excise duties and other compulsory 
payments provided for in existing legislation (herinafter called 
taxes), with the exception of profits tax and payments for the 
right to utilize natural resources, which may be paid, by 
agreement among the sides, both in a cost form and in kind. 
  2. The parties to the agreement are: 
  the state -- the Russian Federation in the persons of the 
Russian Federation Government and the organ of executive power 
of the component of the Russian Federation on whose territory 
the section of the earth is located, or the organs authorized by 
them; 
  the investor -- the legal person, including a foreign one, 
or 
the group of indicated legal persons, with or without the 
creation of a new legal person in accordance with Russian 
Federation legislation. 
  3. The state can authorize an enterprise controlled by it to 
fulfill individual functions associated with monitoring 
compliance with the terms of the agreement and (or) 
participation in implementing it. 
  4. The right to utilize natural resources on the terms of 
the agreement is granted to the investor according to the 
procedure provided for in Russian Federation legislation and is 
endowed with a license. 
  When the investor is a group of legal persons without the 
creation of a new legal person, a license may be issued to one 
of these legal persons, with the license noting that he acts on 
behalf of this group. 
  5. The agreement defines the terms for the use of the 
section of the earth and also includes special points which 
establish the procedure for: 
  defining that part of the extracted mineral raw materials, 
including the maximum part, which is transferred to the 
investor's ownership to compensate him for his production 
expenses; 
  dividing the extracted mineral raw materials between the 
state and the investor, with the exception of payments for the 
right to utilize natural resources and that part of the 
extracted mineral raw materials transferred to the investor's 
ownership to compensate him for his production expenses; 
  handing over to the state that part of the mineral raw 
materials that belongs to him under the terms of the agreement; 
  levying the profits tax and payments for the right to 
utilize 
natural resources. 
  6. The extracted mineral raw materials, which under the 
terms of the agreement, are the state's share are placed at the 
disposal of organs or enterprises authorized by it. 
  The part of the mineral raw materials (or its cost 
equivalent) received by the state as a result of dividing the 
output is distributed on the basis of special treaties between 
the organs of executive power of the Russian Federation and the 
components of the Russian Federation -- treaties that are not 
part of the agreement. 
  The profits tax and the payment levied for the right to 
utilize natural resources are distributed in accordance with 
existing legislation and are entered in the appropriate budgets. 
  7. The mineral raw materials passing to the investor's 
ownership under the terms of the agreement may be exported from 
the Russian Federation by him according to the procedure defined 
for exports of output of his own production. At the same time, 
the agreement lays down long-term export quotas for such raw 
materials for enterprises, which do not have the right to export 
output of their own production outside the Russian Federation 
without a license. 
  8. In accordance with Part 1 of this edict, output with a 
production and technical designation imported into the Russian 
Federation by the investor within the framework of the agreement 
is exempt from value-added tax and customs duties. 
  9. Fixed capital, newly created in the course of 
implementing the agreement, remains the investor's property 
unless the agreement makes other provision. 
  10. The provisions of the agreement retain their force 
throughout its period of validity. Changes are permitted to be 
made to the agreement only with the mutual consent of the 
parties, if no other procedure is provided for in the agreement. 
  11. If during the agreement's period of validity Russian 
Federation legislative acts establish norms tha worsen the 
commercial results of the investor's activity within the 
framework of the agreement, changes are made to it to ensure 
that the investor gets the commercial results,which could have 
been secured if the legislative norms operating at the time the 
agreement was concluded had been applied. The procedure for 
making the aforesaid changes is defined in the agreement. 
  12. On representation from the Russian Federation Ministry 
of Fuel and Energy and the Russian Federation Committee for 
Geology and the Use of Natural Resources, agreed with the 
interested ministries and departments of the Russian Federation 
and the components of the Russian Federation, the Russian 
Federation Government is to ensure the elaboration and adoption 
of normative documents ensuring the implementation of the norms 
of this edict. 
  13. This edict is to be submitted for examination to the 
Russian Federation Federal Assembly. 
  14. This edict comes into force the moment it is signed. 
  [Signed] B. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation

<F P=106> [Georgiy Satarov commentary: "Happy New Year, Comrade </F>
Bureaucrats!"] 
  [Text] Bureaucracy is permanent. Bureaucracy is terrible. 
Bureaucracy is essential. It recognizes no state boundaries, 
has no fear of time, and is absolutely devoid of complexes. We 
are afraid of it and curse it, we struggle and write pamphlets 
against it, but we cannot do without it. 
  However, we have come to terms with the fact that the 
bureaucrat, like any person, has his own interests and that he 
very naturally directs his energies first and foremost into 
defending and implementing his own tasks, and not, as we would 
like, our tasks. It is here precisely that the nub of the 
problem lies: The state and bureaucracy -- which is an integral 
part of it -- are created to act on our interests, but the 
personal and corporate interests of the people constituting the 
state machine prevent this. It is impossible to eliminate this 
contradiction. It can only be reduced to a greater or lesser 
extent and, in as much as it is possible, made to benefit the 
public. Agreed, this is not simple. But in order to do this it 
is necessary to first of all to attempt to understand what 
bureaucracy is, what its interests are, and how it acts on them. 
  Bureaucracy's chief resource is power. In the hands of an 
official this resource is converted into other forms of capital. 
But the most important law governing power is the urge of a 
person or institution possessing power to increase it. Another 
law may be added to this one, which can be called the "law of 
conservation of power." According to it, officials acquire 
power only at the expense of others. 
  In a democratic state -- consequently in Russia also -- the 
people are the source of power. In any case this is what is 
written in our Constitution. As a consequence of elections, 
part of this power is vested in elected politicians -- deputies, 
presidents, governors etc. The chosen politicians depend on the 
people directly through the process of the elections, their 
policies are for the most part public and kept in the sights of 
the mass media. All this limits their power, restrains in some 
measure their urge to increase it, and forces them to fit their 
personal interests in with those of the voters. 
  However, public politicians' power is exercised with the 
help 
of the apparatus. Meaning that part of the power is transferred 
to it. Officials in the apparatus are appointed, which means 
that they depend on those who appoint them and have to work to 
promote the interests, in addition to themselves, of those 
politicians who appoint them. By now we have moved quite a long 
way away from the public interest. Moreover the apparatus' 
power is less public and therefore all the greater. It is 
interesting that from the very first months of the Russian 
Supreme Soviet's existence the habit developed of appointing 
deputies to positions in the apparatus. This was particularly 
widely practised last year. Once a deputy had become an 
official he defended the corporate interest of his organ of 
power and forgot about the voters. 
  Public politicians make up other organs of power (the 
courts, 
the executive branch of power, etc.) and transfer part of their 
power to them. The latter, in turn, form their own apparatuses 
giving rise to an army of state bureaucrats. 
  This is amazing. Every politician and department thinks that 
by increasing their apparatus, the politician's or department's 
power will also increase. But the opposite happens. A 
politician's power is limited by other politicians' power and 
powers. The power of a department (or branch of power) is 
limited by other departments' power and powers. Therefore, a 
politician's or department leader's power passes to his 
apparatus without a change in the total amount of power. 
  An unjustified increase in the apparatus' size leads to 
control over it being lost, which increases its power at the 
expense of public politicians. As a result the power of the 
people, which has temporally been transferred to public 
politicians by elections, is concentrated in the hands of the 
bureaucracy. This process may result in the usurpation of the 
power of the people. 
  Our Russian bureaucracy has two aspects. Its first aspect is 
the section of the old nomenklatura bureaucracy, which is 
regenerating itself. It cannot get enough of adapting, usurping 
power for itself, hiding its power, and strengthening it. It 
religiously guards its corporate interests, makes its own 
"rules," and inculcates them in its new recruits, corrupting 
them with the advantages gained through keeping to them. This 
bureaucracy knows how to be effective when defending its own 
interests or when it has been given no way out and has been 
forced to work in the interests of others, even those of the 
public. 
  The second aspect of Russian bureaucracy is represented by 
the new politicians who appeared at the end of the 1980's as a 
result of the first open elections. The majority of them are 
not politicians (in the Soviet meaning of the word) nor are they 
officials. They are average-grade professionals from other 
fields of endeavor. Having unexpectedly gotten into politics, 
they brought with them a conviction that there are areas of 
human endeavor that anybody can fathom if they add politics to 
pedagogy and medicine. 
  An absence of professionalism may not be very significant 
when coordinating public interests, which is usually what takes 
place in legislative representative bodies. But in any other 
area of power, especially in area of implementing practical 
policy -- and the apparatus needs to handle this in particular 
-- professionalism is essential. 
  For historical reasons, many recently recruited politicians 
have lately been filling positions as officials in the 
apparatus. Skipping the professional training essential to climb 
the professional ladder, they have moved into important 
positions. They have brought the hullabaloo of political 
squabbles to the quiet corridors of power, turning the offices 
of members of the apparatus into party headquarters. To 
counterbalance this, similar processes have been taking place in 
other offices where other officials, instead of performing their 
state duties, have been carrying out political tasks to redress 
the balance. The apparatus has been politicized right through. 
It has begun to live for and tear itself apart over political 
passions and has not only stopped working to carry out its "job 
description" but also even to promote its corporate interests, 
and by so doing has weakened the state power. 
  Politicians holding posts as officials have not become 
officials and have not ceased to be politicians. Meaning that 
they have used their power as members of the apparatus at every 
opportunity to resolve their own personal political problems. 
They have been able to do this all the more effectively because 
the apparatus' power is for the most part hidden from outsiders 
and is shameless in its choice of methods. 
  The overall result is that our bureaucracy with its two 
aspects is extremely ineffective at carrying out socially 
necessary and state tasks. Reforming it is a necessary 
condition for survival. It is encouraging that we heard at the 
Russian president's press conference evidence that these 
problems are understood. Evidence not only of the intention to 
reform the administration and government by reducing its staff, 
but also of the establishment of a lasting dialogue between 
those holding power and society, of the necessity of pursuing 
public policies. Both are extremely important as they prevent 
the bureaucracy from going unchecked and strengthening beyond 
all bounds. No less important is a reliance on professionalism 
in appointments which should reduce the proportion of 
politicized personnel in the bureaucracy and their pernicious 
effect on it. 
  The only problem, however consistent the Russian president 
is 
in putting his intentions into effect, is whether he has 
sufficient power to reform the apparatus using the apparatus 
itself when there is opposition from within it.

  [Text] Beginning Tuesday Viktor Luchin, a judge on Russia's 
Constitutional Court [CC], has announced a hunger strike due to 
the unwillingness of the Constitutional Court's judges to make 
any decision regarding his authority, Luchin's consultant 
Mikhail Moyseyenko reported to Interfax. 
  The authority of Viktor Luchin, as well as that of Valeriy 
Zorkin, was suspended December 1, 1993, due to accusations of 
political activity, which is inadmissible for CC judges. In 
particular, Luchin was accused of his participation in the 
congresses of Russia's communist party, at the congress of 
former People's Deputies, and in the election campaign waged 
last autumn. However, last November 15 Luchin removed his 
candidacy from lists of the Agrarian party, and there have been 
no congresses of the communist party or former People's Deputies 
of the USSR in the course of the previous year. Luchin believes 
that there are no grounds to suspend his authority. 
  According to Moyseyenko, Luchin intends to continue his 
hunger strike until the court passes a decision. As far as 
Valeriy Zorkin is concerned, he disapproves Luchin's decision, 
reported Moyseyenko.

<F P=106> [Article by Eduard Gonzalyez: "IZVESTIYA -- a Full </F>
Joint-Stock Company. That Is the Verdict of the Russian 
Superior Court of Arbitration"] 
  [Text] On the penultimate day of the year, a court of 
arbitration consisting of chairman O. Boykov and judges A. 
Kozlova and I. Polubenina published the main part of its ruling 
on a case in which the joint-stock company "IZVESTIYA Newspaper 
Editorial Office" was a third party. The protagonists were the 
Russian Federal Property Fund (old model) and the IZVESTIYA 
publishing house, which had been trying for nearly a year to 
secure a ruling that all directives of the Russian Federation 
Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for the Management of State 
Property] relating to the conversion of the IZVESTIYA editorial 
office to a joint-stock company are invalid. Their petition was 
rejected. 
  Readers of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, KOMMERSANT, and several other 
publications will doubtless remember that last year from time to 
time they saw reports on the "tug-of-war arbitration" involving 
IZVESTIYA. Admittedly their authors, who still believe to this 
day in the primacy of the material world, represented the case 
as a primordial struggle on the juridical "carpet" over a piece 
of state property. But just before Christmas we received the 
full text of the Superior Court of Arbitration ruling, which 
states "that the subject of the present dispute is an act in the 
sphere of administrative activity, and not a property dispute 
over the use of specific premises." 
  So the court confirmed that it was not a property dispute. 
Frankly, prior to the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet it was 
not a legal dispute either. And the events developed not so 
much "on the carpet" as "under the carpet." The Supreme Soviet 
was using others to fight on its behalf for the newspaper 
IZVESTIYA, while IZVESTIYA was fighting for its independence. 
Remember that first we totally won the case in the 
Constitutional Court. Then the same happened thing at the 
Supreme Court, which overruled certain points in the Supreme 
Soviet decree touching on the IZVESTIYA collective. In November 
the Russian Federal Property Fund totally abandoned its suit. 
We can only speculate what pressure had previously been put on 
the Superior Court of Arbitration -- the last hope of a 
vainglorious and notorious politician in his struggle against 
IZVESTIYA. 
  Well, it seems we are all still here. The arbitration ruling 
declared that the Russian Federation Goskomimushchestvo, in 
issuing directives on the conversion of the IZVESTIYA editorial 
office to a joint-stock company, was acting within its powers. 
That is the main point. It can be assumed that the Russian 
Federation Superior Court of Arbitration has confirmed the 
legality of the formation of the "IZVESTIYA Newspaper Editorial 
Office" joint-stock company of the open type, and its existence 
for the past year and three months. 
  The discursive section of the court ruling ends with a 
reservation: The conversion of the editorial office to a 
joint-stock company must not violate the publishing house's 
rights to the premises it actually occupies. Who is going to 
argue with that? Especially since it goes on to say, in black 
and white: "Where there is a dispute over specific premises, the 
dispute should be examined under the general complaints 
procedure between the editorial office and the publishing house." 
  On the one hand this is reassuring -- the "general 
procedure" 
-- but on the other, does this really mean that as the Superior 
Court of Arbitration ruling enters into legal force we will only 
receive the right to be the protagonist and not a third party in 
the next court case? 
  But time will tell. At the moment the IZVESTIYA editorial 
office is sincerely grateful to Russian Federation 
Goskomimushchestvo expert N. Osokin and the lawyers of the law 
firm "Samsonov and Partners", who upheld the justice of our 
common case in the court of arbitration. 
  One last point: The end of the proceedings in the Superior 
Court of Arbitration coincided with the start of the printing of 
IZVESTIYA at the "Pressa" publishing house's printing plant. 
This timing was no accident. But in order to avoid 
misinterpretations, let us explain: The move to the "Pressa" 
printing plant was motivated solely by technical factors, 
specifically the need (under an international contract) to 
continue to print FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA on our English partner's 
paper and our desire at the same time to produce the television 
supplement on blue paper. Otherwise, there would have been no 
need for the extra trouble for ourselves and some of our readers 
who did not receive the first issues of the newspaper on time. 
For which we offer them our apologies.

<F P=106> [Andrey Nikolayev report under the "Trade Unions" rubric: </F>
"Pilots and Air Controllers Demand Resignation of Air Transport 
Department Director"] 
  [Text] Participants in the trade union conference of air 
crews of the Vnukovo Airlines company have passed an appeal to 
Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin. It points out that in 
recent times, "the state of affairs in civil aviation has 
sharply worsened," while the leadership of Russia's Air 
Transport Department is taking no effective measures to bring 
the sector out of a deep crisis. More, department director 
Vladimir Zamotin and his immediate entourage, the appeal says, 
hamper in every way the work of airlines that have switched to 
new forms of economic development. At the same time, "the safety 
of flights in the sector is at a low level whereas the quality 
of services to passengers has sharply fallen." All this, the 
authors of the appeal think, results from the fact that "the 
sector is being controlled by an amateur, a former party 
apparatchik who had worked for a considerable length of time in 
the Ukraine Communist Party Central Committee and the CPSU 
Central Committee." 
  In this connection, participants in the conference passed a 
demand to the Russian president and prime minister to relieve 
Vladimir Zamotin of the position he fills, and recommended that 
Anatoliy Kochur, president of Russia's Association of Air Crews, 
be appointed director of the Air Transport Department in his 
place. 
  As was intimated at the headquarters of the Association of 
Air Crews, the conference had also passed an appeal to work 
collectives of Russia's civil aviation for support of the demand 
for Zamotin's resignation. At the moment statements supporting 
this demand have come not only from civil aviation air crews and 
aviation technical services of airline members of the 
Association of Air Crews, but also from the Association of Air 
Crews of the Armed Forces and the Federation of Air Traffic 
Controllers of Russia, where they believe that the present 
department director should be fired if only "for actions aimed 
against free trade unions, as well as for red tape."

<F P=106> [Stepan Valentinnikov report under the "Around Lefortovo" </F>
rubric: "Bonus With a Protest"] 
  [Text] An extremely curious document and a short 
commentary on it have been published in the first issue of the 
newspaper MEGAPOLIS-KONTINENT.... 
  Directive No. 2105-r of the Russian Federation Council of 
Ministers-Government dated Moscow, 23 November 1993. 
  1. The Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office shall 
be permitted to provide workers of investigative and operational 
brigades investigating crimes committed 3-4 October 1993 with 
material assistance equivalent to three months' salary. 
  2. The Russian Ministry of Finance shall to this end 
allocate 116.7 million rubles from the Russian Federation 
republic's budget. 
  [Signed] O. Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the Russian 
Federation Council of Ministers-Government. 
  We would like to believe that the government directive we 
have reproduced here is a joke. But the source, which passed 
the document to the editorial office, is entirely trustworthy. 
  Of course, these two short paragraphs of an unclassified and 
seemingly ordinary government decision raise a number of 
questions. For example, why should the government permit the 
General Prosecutor's Office -- an independent state organ -- to 
do something when the actions of government officials are 
subject to scrutiny by this very same prosecutor's office? And 
why should workers at the prosecutor's office investigating 
October's bloodshed suddenly be allocated up to three (!) times 
their normal salary? Have they become destitute? Or are they 
no longer working for money? Or is it perhaps just compensation 
for the moral damage that this sort of investigation inflicts on 
the souls of the sensitive prosecutors? However, let them have 
it, these 116.7 million rubles from a budget that is already 
showing a deficit. The simple fact is that, judging from this 
document, yet another myth has been exploded -- the myth of the 
independence of the General Prosecutor's Office. How sad it is 
to part with our illusions about the rule-of-law state....

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Kaverin: "Justice Ministry Ignored </F>
`Pamyat'"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the Justice Ministry officially turned 
down an application by D. Vasilyev, leader of "Pamyat," a 
well-known monarchist movement, to register his organization. 
The reasons are clear: "Pamyat's" extremist program is at odds 
with Russian laws. 
  In his first public appearance literally two hours after the 
incident, Mr. Vasilyev described this decision by the Justice 
Ministry as "genocide against the Russians" -- "the Justice 
Ministry has been registering all conceivable pornographic 
organizations, but has not registered ours, a national-patriotic 
one!" 
  Vasilyev's words were echoed by V. Bogachev, chief of the 
European Liberal Democratic Party [ELDP] (it turns out that we 
have a party like this, too -- S.K.). V. Bogachev called on all 
patriotic forces to write "an open letter against the Justice 
Ministry." As a matter of fact, the ELDP does not have any 
relation to V. Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia, a fact Mr. Bogachev was swift to confirm by calling the 
latter a fascist party and expressing his astonishment that it 
was registered by that same Justice Ministry.

  [Text] There are no legal grounds for discontinuing 
criminal proceedings against Anatoliy Lukyanov and Vasiliy 
Starodubtsev, who have both been elected to the Russian Federal 
Assembly. This ruling was made today by the court of the 
Supreme Court Military Board, which is in charge of the case of 
the State Committee for the State of Emergency [SCSE]. 
  Lukyanov's lawyer, Genrikh Padva, applied for the criminal 
proceedings against his client and Vasiliy Starodubtsev to be 
discontinued pending the adoption of the law on the status of 
deputies. 
  In the court's opinion, the adoption of the law will not 
free 
the defendants from criminal liability. Nor does the Russian 
Constitution, adopted at the 12 December referendum, free the 
SCSE trial defendants from liability, the court believes. 
  INTERFAX reports that the trial is to be resumed at 0900 on 
13 January.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dmitriy Vasilyev, deputy chairman of the </F>
State Committee for the Management of State Property, by A. 
Yevgenev under the "Privatization Program" rubric; date, place 
not given: "Voucher To Last Another Six Months"] 
  [Text] The state program for the privatization of state 
and municipal enterprises in the Russian Federation (see 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA No. 1, 1994) can without any exaggeration be 
called a document long in the making. For various reasons, 
including political factors, work on it went on for 13 months. 
We asked Dmitriy Vasilyev, deputy chairman of the State 
Committee for the Management of State Property 
[Goskomimushchestvo], to comment on its most important 
provisions: 
  [Vasilyev] The program's main task is to create the 
conditions for the completion of check privatization. At the 
same time we have tried to take account of the lessons of the 
previous stage -- for instance, we have introduced a section 
entitled "Regional Peculiarities of Privatization." That is why 
the Far North, for instance, is seen as an autonomous region. 
The leaders of certain regions where a great deal has been 
accomplished have taken offense: Don't protect us like 
children, they say, give us more autonomy; and we have met them 
halfway. Quite another scheme is adopted in oblasts such as 
Magadan and Chita, which are close to becoming a socioeconomic 
disaster zone. Of course, here it is not a matter of generating 
revenue from privatization: The main thing is to ensure 
employment among the population. A whole section extends the 
regions' rights in the following direction also: They will 
themselves resolve whether facilities of one scale or another -- 
for instance, a city's engineering infrastructure -- should be 
privatized or not and, if so, how. 
  The list of facilities whose privatization is forbidden has 
been increased. In point of fact we did not touch on these 
facilities earlier either, but now we have confirmed this 
documentarily. Well, indeed, what reason is there to privatize, 
say, the maritime transport rescue service? Its work cannot be 
based on commercial principles. 
  But at the same time the register of organizations subject 
to 
compulsory privatization has also grown. It includes not only 
hotel complexes and motels, camp sites, boarding houses, and 
housing and utilities, but also debtor enterprises in all 
sectors. In other words, if you work badly and make losses, seek 
new managers through transforming the forms of ownership; change 
the system of management itself, and your hierarchical system. 
  I hope that the position of those who up to the present time 
have been leasing premises not intended for habitation will 
become more definite. To this day they have been, as it were, 
living out of suitcases: And suddenly, on the expiry of their 
lease term they are asked to leave their cosy nest and sell the 
square meters to someone else, to say nothing of such 
inconveniences as the impossibility of obtaining credit on 
security. Now there is complete clarity in this area: If you 
have bought an enterprise at a competition or auction, you have 
the right to acquire also the premises that you were renting 
before. In the upshot, small-scale privatization will probably 
become more attractive. 
  At long last order has been introduced with respect to the 
bloc of shares guaranteed to the state. All this used to be 
done arbitrarily, by eye. The program's drafters proceeded on 
the basis that the block, strictly defined in size, should 
correspond to this or that state interest. If the state sets 
itself the goal of keeping absolute control over an enterprise, 
it should own 51 percent of the shares (more than that is not 
necessary; the rest can be sold); if it aims at keeping partial 
control (which enables it to prevent a change in the joint-stock 
company's charter), it should be granted 25.5 percent of the 
shares. 
  Like the previous program, the present program contains 
three varieties of perquisites for the employees of privatized 
enterprises. The first two have not undergone noticeable 
changes, but the third has been geared toward the forthcoming 
wave of bankruptcies. People assuming obligations not to allow 
the ruin of an enterprise receive the right to 20-30 percent of 
its incorporation capital. They put down a deposit of 200 
minimum salaries, which is forfeit in the event of failure. 
Already today the new-fledged property class is selling cars and 
apartments in order to be come major owners of industrial 
property and, with the rights of private owners, to dispose of 
enterprises in such a way as to rescue them from collapse. The 
scale here is not limited -- it can be a chocolate factory, or 
the Likhachev Automobile Plant. 
  Investment competitions will be held in a new way. Formerly, 
participants in these competitions swamped those attending with 
the most diverse and tempting programs, including foreign 
programs -- take your pick of which is the idee fixe, and which 
is the goose that lays the golden eggs. Henceforth there will 
be the following criterion: massive investments in the minimum 
time. And the need to contribute real money to the coffers of 
the enterprise directly after the auctions. 
  It is well known that at present incompleted construction 
projects are sold with great reluctance. The owner dies, but 
does not give way -- it's mine! Here the following rule is 
introduced: In the process of privatization an uncompleted 
facility is removed from the enterprise's assets and goes under 
the hammer. Moreover, this is profitable to everyone: The 
owner receives half the proceeds, and the committee for the 
administration of property and the corresponding fund share the 
rest between them. In our view, this incentive should be 
effective. 
  Protection for shareholders has been devised. Should one of 
them conceive a desire to sell his shares, he will pay no tax. 
In addition, no one has the right, without the knowledge of 
Goskomimuchestvo, to dispose of an enterprise's property until 
it has become private. Even before there were a lot of people 
wishing to sell goods on the quiet, while reorganization was 
underway. 
  Restrictions have been imposed on the creation of holding 
companies. Knowing our old love of changing the landmarks and 
raking in the cash, we have written into the program that no 
holding can have more than 10 percent of the shares in any 
joint-stock company. 
  At the same time the purchase of shares by commercial banks 
is restricted. The ruination of enterprises inevitably rebounds 
on banks, and therefore, on their investors. A chain reaction. 
We could become witness to what happened during the Great 
Depression in the United States. 
  I want to bring cheer to the check investment funds: They 
are exempt from dual taxation. Undoubtedly, their influence on 
the affairs of an enterprise will also increase: Whereas before 
the fund could acquire no more than 10 percent of the shares of 
one entity, now it can acquire up to 25 percent. 
  And one more detail that is of no little importance: There 
are strong and weak check funds. We have permitted the strong 
funds to buy up the shares of the weak funds. This has been 
done once again to prevent the bankruptcy of weaklings and, in 
the final analysis, to protect the interests of shareholders. 
  Shareholders are also to have a greater say. It is 
established that only with the agreement of three-fourths of the 
members of a joint-stock company can the charter of a 
joint-stock company be changed, a large part of its capital 
handed over, or a decision on participation in holding companies 
be made. Cumulative voting is introduced, enabling a minority 
to be represented on the council of directors. A mechanism has 
been elaborated for holding assemblies of the joint-stock 
society. 
  Let me say directly that it is not so easy to implement 
everything that is projected. Hence a system of "sticks and 
carrots" has been devised. Financial resources will be 
allocated to regions taking account of fulfillment of the State 
Privatization program. The stakes are high. But the problem 
for the country is also not inconsiderable. 
  Increasing interest is being shown abroad in our 
privatization program. In principle this is no bad thing. But 
will Russian property not end up in the hands of "their" mafia? 
Especially the juiciest morsels: the defense complex, precious 
metals, oil, and gas. We therefore think the following system 
crucial: At the end of a competition or auction the 
organizations are to send the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service information on the winners in these auctions, and the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service is to gather all the 
necessary information within one month and present its 
conclusion to the government. And the government will issue the 
final verdict.

<F P=106> [Report by Vyacheslav Gerasimov: "Sweet Promises Bear </F>
Bitter Fruit"] 
  [Text] Despite the numerous promises made by reformers 
about the imminent onset of a time of plenty, we are very far 
from general prosperity. According to the market economy 
luminaries' estimates, even if stabilization finally starts in 
1994 it will be around 20-30 years before we can start to live 
the Western way. However, we should not hope for stabilization 
this year. Figures from the Russian State Committee for 
Statistics testify to an acceleration in economic decline. 
  Compared with the unfavorable year of 1992, 1993 looks even 
more unfavorable. Indicators on the majority of types of output 
are minus numbers. On some of them, the volume of production 
has fallen by 50 percent. Thus, the output of large electric 
machines, low-capacity electric motors, and trucks made up 
slightly less than half of the output from the same period of 
the previous year year; overhead cranes, bulldozers, mainline 
freightcars -- one-third; forge-and-press machines, automobile 
trailers and semitrailers, and tractors -- less than 10-25 
percent. 
  In ferrous metallurgy, the output of cast iron, steel, and 
rolled metal fell significantly. In comparison with the same 
period the previous year, 54 percent fewer steel pipes were 
manufactured. In comparison with the level of December 1992 
the daily average manufacture of PVC resin, pipes, parts of 
pipelines made of thermoplastics, chemical fibers and threads, 
microbiological feed protein, and tires for agricultural 
vehicles fell by 40-65 percent. 
  The daily production of commercial lumber fell by over 
one-third against the level of the previous December, lumber by 
37 percent, matches and pit props by half, and cardboard by 
one-fourth. 
  The production of woolen fabrics and footwear fell by half, 
silk by 42 percent, linen, hemp, and jute fabrics and jersey 
products by almost one-third, and hosiery articles by 24 
percent. The production of children's shoes fell significantly 
-- by 58 percent. 
  Because of material and financial difficulties, no washing 
machines were manufactured at the Nizhnyy Novgorod Automobile 
Plant or at the GPZ-4 Production Association (Samara city) from 
the beginning of the year; no receiver sets were manufactured at 
the Velikolukskiy "Radiopribor" Production Association, or at 
the "Sokol" radio equipment plant (Moscow), the Kamensk-Uralsk 
radio plant (Sverdlovsk Oblast), and so on. 
  The paralysis in the economy is being especially keenly felt 
in transportation. The volume of freight transportation is 
falling from one month to the next, and the country's 
transportation arteries are coming to a standstill. Thus, in 
comparison with the same period of the previous year the number 
of trips actually carried out by overland transportation fell: 
In Nizhnyy Novgorod by 67 percent, Saransk and Yakutsk by 22 
percent, Pskov by 19 percent, Orenburg by 14 percent, 
Krasnoyarsk by 13 percent, and Astrakhan, Krasnodar, and Barnaul 
by 12 percent. 
  The famine with which we were threatened has proved not to 
be 
a propaganda trick; it is already knocking on our doors. The 
production of fruit and vegetable preserves, macaroni, tea, and 
mineral water fell (by 33-41 percent) against the corresponding 
period of the previous year, and that of whole milk and 
margarine products, meat, butter, and canned meat fell by 13-28 
percent. The production of food concentrates fell by over 
one-half. 
  On the other hand an increase was recorded in the output of 
vacuum cleaners. Evidently the demand for this of equipment has 
risen among the population. That is bad luck. What will be the 
next thing to create a stir? Meanwhile the leadership is moving 
along like a crab. Our economy is moving backward from what was 
achieved during the five-year plans, not accumulating wealth but 
squandering it.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 11 TASS -- The Russian interior 
troops may be subordinated directly to the president following 
the example of the former Security Ministry and the frontier 
troops, according to a planned reform of the Interior Ministry, 
TASS learned on tuesday from well-informed sources in the 
presidential administration which added, however, that no 
concept of reform had been yet submitted to the president. 
  The Interior Ministry will most probably be divided in 
several parts called "operative main departments" which will be 
entrusted with fighting the most serious types of crime. The 
departments will comprise criminal police. 
  Policemen who ensure public order may be united into 
municipal police. 
  Firemen and investigators will become "independent" 
departments, as well as the department which deals with prisons 
and labour camps. 
  The reform scheme is currently being drafted by the interior 
ministry itself, according to the sources. 
  Experts are split in assessing the planned reform of the 
Interior Ministry. Some of them told TASS they are against 
splitting the anti-crime forces while others believe the reform 
of the ministry is necessary to meet the demands of the time.

<F P=106> [Own Information" report carried as part of "Military </F>
Review" feature under the general heading "Everything Changes in 
the Army. Except the Defense Minister's Birthday":"Spare a Word 
for the Poor 'Glavpur' [Main Political Directorate]"] 
  [Text] The Defense Ministry collegium has made another 
decision on another reorganization of the Main Directorate for 
Work with Personnel, the now former the Main Military-Political 
Directorate of the Soviet Army and the Navy. Veteran political 
workers will remember that this is either the fourth or the 
fifth "purge" of the once indivisible ranks of ideologists and 
propagandists. The names, structures, and staffs have changed 
but the department itself has remained, albeit with fewer 
people. Everyone criticized it except the lazy ones: a "bastion 
of stagnation," a "hotbed of deception," and so forth. But in 
the crackle of newspaper crossfire it seemed to have been 
forgotten that there is no other organization capable of taking 
care of the education of soldiers and sailors. There was much 
talk about military chaplains but for some reason priests, 
mullahs, and rabbis did not appear in the barracks. 
  "The army is outside politics" -- that was the main slogan 
of 
recent years. But can that be said today after the events of 4 
October and the elections? Some observers, albeit highly 
cautious ones, connect the latest "purge" of the "Glavpur" with 
the elections in particular. In Russia's political elite people 
believe that the Army made a weighty contribution to Vladimir 
Volfovich [Zhirinovskiy]'s victory. But it voted for the new 
Constitution, too, didn't it? 
  Be that as it may, it is now being said that the 
directorate's staffs will be reduced by two-thirds leaving fewer 
than 50 people in the new structure. What will the trade-off 
be? For the moment there is none. The Armed Forces will 
finally be outside politics and at the same time outside 
education.

  [Text] Nikolay Shapovalenko, chief of the section to 
supervise radioactive security of defense sites, declared to 
Interfax that Russia's Defense Ministry and Navy had occupied a 
non-constructive position with respect to control over the 
storage of liquid radioactive wastes at military facilities on 
the part of the State committee on atomic supervision. 
  In his words, the Defense Ministry refers to the fact that 
civil departments abroad have never supervised such kind of 
military activity. Shapovalenko pointed out that the Defense 
Minister should issue a decree to bring into force a provision 
on the State committee on atomic supervision in the ministry's 
structure because "it is difficult to establish a single state 
system of supervision over radioactive security on Russia's 
territory without this." 
  Shapovalenko declared that last December a working group of 
the Environment and Natural Resources Ministry prepared a report 
for the government to solve the problem with liquid radioactive 
wastes. In particular, it proposes to forward membrane devices 
to re-process nuclear wastes, which have been designed by the 
association Radon, to the Pacific Fleet for test exploitation. 
  In addition, he said, "we have accepted Japan's proposal 
which will hand over a dual-bottom tanker to Russia to store 
10,000 tons of liquid radioactive wastes. However, the 
government must consider the issue on the construction of 
facilities to re-process liquid radioactive wastes on the 
Northern and Pacific Fleets and several regional burial places 
in order to entirely resolve this problem." 
  A feasibility study for a burial place on the territory of 
the former nuclear test range on Novaya Zemlya has been already 
prepared and subjected to state ecological expertise. "The same 
burial place should be created in the Far East, but if we start 
construction this year it will be concluded not earlier than 
1997," said Shapovalenko. 
  He reported that a facility capable of re-processing 8,000 
cubic meters of liquid radioactive wastes annually will be 
assembled on the Kola peninsula on the basis of the water 
purification station of the Murmansk sea steamship line. 
Shapovalenko said that the Murmansk steamship line is ready to 
accept wastes from military crafts assigned to the Northern 
Fleet on a commercial basis.

  [Text] Flight Control centre January 12 TASS -- Five 
Russian cosmonauts -- Vasiliy Tsibliyev, Aleksandr Serebrov, 
Viktor Afanasyev, Yuriy Usachev, and Valeriy Polyakov -- are 
working for the third day running on board the "Mir" orbital 
complex. Today's plan of the joint flight envisages 
geophysical, medical, and biotechnological experiments, and the 
transfer of duties to the crew of the fifteenth main expedition. 
  A cycle of video-filmings and spectrometeric observations of 
separate parts of the earth's continents and oceans are being 
carried out in keeping with the programme of studies of the 
earth's natural resources and the environment. 
  The new crew, brought to the complex a short while ago, is 
carrying out a series of experiments to study in greater detail 
the mechanisms of the human organism's adaptation to the 
conditions of orbital flight, including by the method of blood 
composition. 
  The biotechnological experiment, started on January 10, is 
being continued. Its purpose is to explore the possibility of 
obtaining hybrid cells of plants in conditions of 
imponderability. 
  The old crew of the complex is to check during the day the 
condition of the board systems of the "Soyuz TM-17" vehicle and 
to prepare it for the return voyage to the earth. 
  Reports received from the cosmonauts and telemetric data 
show 
that the flight is proceeding normally.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Lennart Meri to the Riigikogu -- live] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Meri] [passage omitted] Instead of drawing 
objective conclusions from the changing balance of power in both 
the world and in Estonia, and expanding the governmental basis 
resolutely -- if necessary at the cost of his own resignation -- 
the prime minister has aimed at preserving his power and making 
a dangerous compromise. 
  The proposed government reshuffle will retain current 
governmental practices and the current decision-making 
mechanism, which works behind closed doors in a room next door 
rather than around the governmental table. The outcome is a 
more administrative government with a more administrative prime 
minister. Concentrating power instead of delegating it cannot 
be served up as a parliamentary practice, however attractively 
arranged. The reason why I consider it necessary to talk to 
you, esteemed people's deputies, with worry and openness, stems 
from an issue that a year or two ago was not yet topical. It is 
topical today and directly concerns Estonian national security. 
I say this as the top commander of Estonian state defense 
according to Section 16, Article 78 of the Constitution. 
[passage omitted] 
  Having said what I had to say and hoping that at critical 
moments the country's interests would come higher than party 
interests, I will now, before your very eyes, sign the 
resolution, which at the present moment in history must unite 
us, lift us above our differences of opinion, and assist the 
republican government in keeping the Estonian country's 
interests apart from party interests.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Peresada report: "NATO: New Partners?"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, 10 Jan -- A two-day top-level session of 
the NATO Council opened at the North Atlantic alliance 
headquarters here today. The heads of state and government of 
the 16 member countries of the alliance are participating in its 
work. 
  Three questions are chiefly being discussed at this 
conference, the first to be organized since the equivalent 
meeting in Rome two years ago. The most important of these, as 
already reported in PRAVDA, concerns relations with countries 
located in the east of the continent. Having encountered 
insistent demands for NATO membership from a number of these 
countries, particularly Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, 
and at the same time not wishing to "complicate President 
Yeltsin's positions in the face of the Russian conservatives, 
who are opposed to NATO's zone of responsibility coming any 
closer to the borders of the former USSR," the North Atlantic 
alliance has drawn up a "new formula" for partnership with East 
European, Baltic, and CIS countries, including Russia. It is 
this formula, which bears the name of "Partnership for Peace," 
that the conference is to adopt officially. 
  Specifically it is a question of the following. It will be 
proposed that all the East European partners without exception 
sign bilateral cooperation agreements with NATO. It is not 
proposed to grant any security guarantees to these countries. 
Some conditions are being advanced, associated, for example, 
with a pledge not to use force and openness in the planning of 
military budgets, and at the same time it is proposed that the 
"new partners" will be able to hold joint maneuvers with NATO, 
to participate in peacekeeping operations, etc. In other words, 
it is planned to expand the scale of the present ties with these 
partners without applying to them Article 5 of the North 
Atlantic Treaty, which provides for alliance commitments in the 
sphere of collective defense. 
  It is already known from the information materials 
disseminated at the conference press center that the "NATO 
aspirants" are responding adversely to this formula. In 
particular, they accuse the North Atlantic alliance of 
"irresponsibly giving in under pressure from Russia." 
  Another item on the agenda is approval of the West European 
countries' independent defense role within the NATO framework. 
The United States is expected officially to give its consent to 
this. In which case a special command will be created, which 
will be able to provide the Western European Union (a defense 
organization embracing 11 West European countries -- V.P.) with 
armed forces "separate from the alliance's military structures" 
and earmarked, in particular, for conducting "peacekeeping 
operations" outside NATO's zone of responsibility. 
  Finally, the situation in Bosnia will be examined, notably 
with regard to the plan for making air strikes for "the purpose 
of ending hostilities there" -- as has already been discussed 
repeatedly before.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Andrey Vladimirovich </F>
Kozyrev by correspondent Vladimir Beletskiy; place and date not 
given; from the "Novosti" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Beletskiy] Andrey Vladimirovich, what is your 
comment on the results of the NATO conference in Brussels? 
  [Kozyrev] It took a step in the right direction; that is, 
the idea of Partnership for Peace has been approved, something 
which essentially is based also on our proposals. The effect is 
that now, instead of a quantitative membership expansion of NATO 
eastward, one should be occupied with the practical aspects of 
interaction, both between Russia and NATO, and between the 
Central European states and NATO, within the context, say, of 
joint maneuvers, practicing peacekeeping operations in areas of 
conflicts, programs of converting military production. This is 
practical work instead of membership. 
  Of course, there is a small difference of emphasis. NATO 
looks at things from its own viewpoint [NATO smotrit ot sebya] 
-- NATO-centrism--and they say this will be a period of 
preparation for joining NATO. Perhaps that will be the case. 
Let us see at the end of this period, which will be a fairly 
long and eventful one. It is perfectly possible that Russia 
will also decide, in the end, to join NATO. 
  Another scenario is possible, that NATO will be modified and 
merged into some broader European structure.

  [Text] The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry press service 
reports: Despite suffering considerable losses in men and 
material in recent days, Armenia's Army units are not giving up 
their unsuccessful attempts to attack Azerbaijani territory. 
  The enemy launched several futile attacks against our 
positions in Fizulinskiy and Terterskiy rayons through the day 
on 10 January and the morning of 11 January. Our troops bravely 
halted the attacks and inflicted crushing blows on the enemy. 
  According to information obtained from the occupied lands, 
the Armenian troops are abandoning their positions in panic and 
are fleeing toward Armenia. Clashes are taking place between 
those fleeing in disarray and fighters coming from Armenia. It 
appears that Armenia's military command has been left with no 
choice but to institute punishment measures to prevent the mass 
desertions.

departure from the upper chamber of the Russian parliament. 
  He said that shortly he would address a joint session of 
both 
chambers, highlighting Russia's domestic and foreign policies, 
and economic targets for the next couple of years. 
  As the Federation Council has not elected its chairman yet, 
on Boris Yeltsin's initiative the session is chaired by the 
Federation Council's oldest member, Yuriy Chernichenko, whose 
candidacy was supported during an open vote.

  The announcement came shortly after it became known that 
ex-President of Georgia Zviad Gamsakhurdia, an irreconcilable 
opponent of Shevardnadze, is dead. Chechnya was the shelter for 
Gamsakhurdia for two years of his exile from where he commanded 
the anti-Shevardnadze struggle in western Georgia. The late 
Gamsakhurdia who reportedly committed a suicide will most 
evidently be buried in Chechnya, according to the will of his

<F P=106> [Yuriy Stroganov report under the "Nearby Foreign Countries" </F>
rubric: "Lithuania Knocks on NATO's Door"] 
  [Text] Vilnius -- The stance adopted by Lithuanian 
officials on the issue of joining NATO has, as we know, been 
defined. President Algirdas Brazauskas announced that he has 
sent a letter to NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner which, 
referring to the 23 December 1993 resolution by the Lithuanian 
Seimas, officially requests that the Lithuanian Republic be 
admitted in NATO. 
  Obviously this decision has crystallized under pressure from 
opponents of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party and by 
Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the right-wing forces. Day 
after day he has harshly criticized the country's authorities 
for the vagueness of their stance in respect of joining NATO. 
  But they reacted to this with caution. Talk centered more on 
the need to agree positions with Latvia and Estonia, where 
Russian troops are still present, and on a well-balanced 
political process. Lithuanian Seimas Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas 
declared recently that the issue of the country's membership any 
political or military organization should be decided by the 
people via a referendum, and not by the president or the Seimas. 
  Obviously, the results of the elections to the Russian State 
Duma have forced amendments. 
  It was on the back of an anti-Kremlin feeling that V. 
Landsbergis once managed to gain significant political advantage 
in Lithuania. Now, against a background of the strengthening of 
those very same feelings, right-wing political parties and 
movements are again gaining strength. At the third congress of 
the "Union of the Fatherland" party, led by V. Landsbergis, it 
was stated outright that the main threat comes from Russia and 
the ruling party is prepared...to fall into its embrace 
economically at first, and then politically. 
  Actually, on many political issues the authorities and the 
opposition in Lithuania follow one and the same lead. If 
nothing else, proof of this is offered by the letter from the 
republic's Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys, sent, evidently in 
support of the statement by A. Brazauskas, to U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher. 
  P. Gylys expresses the thought that NATO is a guarantor of 
Lithuania's security. The minister's concern is roused in 
particular, in his words, by the large concentration of Russia's 
Army in Kaliningrad Oblast. Lithuania would like to draw the 
international community's attention to the need to demilitarize 
this region. P. Gylys is also concerned that, in the wake of 
Russia's parliamentary elections, its foreign policy may become 
"more nationalistic and aggressive toward the Baltic states...." 
  Certain forces in Lithuania do not conceal their 
geopolitical 
sympathies. A curious episode occurred not so long ago during a 
meeting in the small city of Skaudvile between its inhabitants 
and officials from the "Union of the Fatherland" and "Sajudis." 
It voiced in particular the idea of the threat to Lithuania's 
interests if its officers are trained in Ryazan. A proposal 
emerged: Surely it is better to send them to NATO countries or 
directly to the Pentagon. But then somebody asked: And what 
will happen if they are recruited by the CIA? "So be it," 
exclaimed the leader of the Skaudvile branch of "Sajudis." 
  Incidentally, on the subject of the CIA, the Lithuanian 
press 
has revealed a sensational discovery that a CIA residence 
operates semi-legally in Vilnius, and a specific address has 
even been named. 
  Emotion aside, Lithuania's political will has been 
expressed. 
Admittedly, it is doubtful whether NATO will give a positive 
response straight off, without considering the interests of 
Russia itself.

  [Text] Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, who also belongs to 
the Party of Russian Unity and Concords faction in the State 
Duma, says he is unhappy over the presidential decree on federal 
government restructuring Yeltsin signed on Monday [10 January]. 
Some of its points are ill-thought, Shokhin told Interfax. 
  He described as ill-conceived the decision to scrap the post 
of Vice Premier for trade cooperation with CIS states given that 
they introduced similar posts following Moscow's suit. Shokhin 
says this is a sudden diversion from the scheme that Russia has 
itself introduced. 
  Attempts to try to saddle the First Vice Premier with that 
duty in addition to his responsibility for areas of the economy, 
finances and other macroeconomic matters is tantamount to 
pushing CIS cooperation into the background which is 
unacceptable, he said. 
  Shokhin said that though the Vice Premiers were at odds 
about 
the pace of CIS integration, the possibility of letting Yeltsin 
and his Prime Minister know about them would no longer exist. 
  Nor is it clear, he said, why the Russian agency for 
international cooperation and development is to be merged with 
the ministry for foreign economic relations as a government 
body. Shokhin said he would seek the repeal of the decree's 
point on the agency and a new resolution on that body designed 
to attract foreign investment. 
  He does not rule out being offered a Vice Premiership for 
agrarian or social matters in the new government. However, he 
says Aleksandr Zaveryukha, Yuriy Yarov, Yegor Gaydar and Oleg 
Soskovets responsible for agriculture, social security, 
economics and industry respectively may retain their jobs. 
  Shokhin believes other changes may take place if First Vice 
Premier Vladimir Shumeyko fails to be elected as Speaker of the 
Federation Council, the upper house of parliament. 
  It is most likely that new appointments will announced 
piecemeal rather than in a matter of one day, he said.

  [Excerpt] Estonian President Lennart Meri, Latvian 
President Guntis Ulmanis, and Lithuanian President Algirdas 
Brazauskas have circulated a joint statement in which the 
invitation for the Baltic states to participate in the NATO 
program, Partnership for Peace, is valued positively. 
  The statement stresses that the program offers concrete 
possibilities for the development of cooperation between NATO 
and the Baltic states. The presidents also express hope that 
the armed forces of the Baltic states would be transformed so 
that they would be able to cooperate with NATO. 
  [Second announcer] The statement also says that the task to 
secure the status of a member state will not be easy, and it 
should be carried out by all the East European states together. 
In addition, mutual trust and cooperation on the whole 
continent and in the Baltic Sea region will strengthen in the 
framework of the Partnership for Peace program of cooperation 
between all European states. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by V. Gromak: "Admiral Kravchenko's Five Proposals"] </F>
  [Text] The Baltic Institute of Strategic and International 
Research has held in Tallinn a conference on cooperation and 
security in the Baltic Sea region. You must admit that the 
subject is very important to all the countries located on the 
Baltic Sea. The conference was attended by delegations from 16 
countries. Also a delegation of seven NATO representatives 
headed by Brigade General Tom Lennon, deputy chief of the 
program for military relations at the Joint Chiefs of Staff of 
the U.S. Armed Forces in Europe, arrived to Tallinn, including 
German, Finnish, and Norwegian ambassadors to Estonia. Since 
the organizers "had forgotten" to invite the Russian envoy, 
Russia was represented by Vice Admiral Viktor Kravchenko, first 
deputy commander of the Baltic Sea Fleet. Among the participants 
were also Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis, Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas, and Estonian President Lennart Meri. The 
latter delivered the opening speech at the conference, the merit 
of which was boiled down to an analysis of the results of the 
elections in Russia. 
  Only Zhirinovskiy's victory was discussed at the conference, 
summarized one of the participants. According to the Estonian 
president's speech, the electoral victory of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia is a factor threatening the security 
of the Baltic states. Therefore, NATO should become a guarantor 
for their security. I have repeatedly emphasized in my 
statements and in numerous conversations, said Vice Admiral 
Kravchenko, that neither electoral victory of a separate party 
nor even a change of the government would mean a significant 
change in the political course. The more so, since democratic 
parties and movements will have a majority in the new 
legislature. Personally, I believe that our elections have come 
in very handy for the Baltics... 
  The first deputy commander of the Baltic Sea Fleet is not 
alone in his opinion on this issue. One does not have to be a 
great politician to understand that the representatives of 
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania replaced a serious discussion on 
solving real security problems of the Baltic Sea region, with 
their ambitions to obtain international support for imposing on 
Russia ultimate terms for troop withdrawal, as well as to 
receive the moral right to introduce openly discriminative 
measures against the Russian- speaking population of the Baltic 
states. Moreover, this was done in a rather rough and primitive 
manner, which generated negative reaction even among the NATO 
representatives. One should seek Russia's advice. No matter 
what difficulties it is currently experiencing, Russia is a 
large state, and one should talk with respect with a large 
country, they stated in their official speeches and private 
conversations. In response, Lennart Meri commented that the 
United States sacrificed the interests of the Baltics to the 
global peace problems and the continued reforms in Russia. 
  This way, a conference on very important issue was converted 
by its organizers into a strictly propagandist meeting. Only 
the speech by Vice Admiral Kravchenko and concrete proposals of 
Baltic Sea Fleet navy men brought some fresh air into it. 
  What did Vice Admiral Kravchenko exactly propose? 
  First. To draft an agreement on the free traffic of navy 
vessels, in accordance with the international law on navigation 
and the existing system of marine traffic control in the Gulf of 
Finland. 
  Second. To legalize and establish a permanent connection 
between the command of the Baltic Sea Fleet and the commands of 
the Baltic states' navies; to coordinate plans for naval 
training; and to establish regulations on emergency procedures. 
  Third. To provide security within economic zones of Latvia, 
Lithuania, and Estonia during naval maneuvers, the Russian side 
is willing to take into account reasonable economic interests of 
ship owners and fishermen of these countries. 
  Fourth. To establish cooperation between the hydrographic 
services of the Russian Federation and the Baltics, including 
the establishment of a system of mutual exchange of navigational 
and meteorological data. 
  Fifth. The issue of cooperation in emergency situations 
remains unsolved, since Russia does not have an appropriate 
agreement with the Baltic states. This problem must also be 
solved. 
  Unfortunately, the vice admiral took the floor at the end of 
the conference, and these concrete proposals were not officially 
approved. Estonia's Defense Minister Juri Luik advocated 
development of a joint defense policy of the Baltic states, 
considering Russia the only enemy. He appealed to establish a 
military-political union of the Baltic states, although without 
Russia's participation, but with the possibility of Ukraine's 
participation. Judging from the Estonian defense minister's 
speech, the leaders of this country prefer cooperation with the 
West and the Baltics in the field of establishing a security 
system, and they intentionally attempt to create a suspicious 
atmosphere around Russia, which would resemble the "cold war" 
spirit. 
  Although no concrete discussion on security of the Baltic 
Sea 
region was held in Tallinn, the Baltic Sea Fleet did not waste 
time. The fleet's command one more time demonstrated its good 
will to enhance cooperation with the Baltic states. Although 
certain circles in the Baltics did not get the message, Brigade 
General Tom Lennon did. He came with a proposal to establish a 
direct connection between the Baltic Sea Fleet and units of the 
U.S. Armed Forces in Europe. This year, such a connection was 
established with a division of the Privolzhskiy Military 
District. Life has already testified to the fact that such 
cooperation, including visits, joint solving of various issues, 
and collective work on certain undertakings, has very good 
prospects.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>
  [Text] Geneva, 12 Jan -- The prospects for a full-scale 
political settlement in Abkhazia are the main topic of 
discussion at the Georgian-Abkhaz talks here. They have been 
organized under the aegis of the UN with Russia's assistance. 
The possibility of concluding an agreement is being discussed, 
reflecting the key areas of a settlement, especially the 
resolution of the problem of refugees and the future political 
status of Abkhazia. 
  The Georgian delegation is headed by Jaba Ioseliani, 
chairman 
of the Provisional Committee for the State of Emergency. The 
Abkhaz delegation is headed by Sokrat Dzhindzholiya, chairman of 
Abkhazia's Council of Ministers. Taking part in the 
consultations are special representative of the UN Secretary 
General Edouard Brunner and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Boris Pastukhov. 
  Mikhail Ukleba, Georgian deputy foreign minister and member 
of the Georgian delegation, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent 
that several draft agreements presented by the delegations have 
been submitted for examination. The participants are also 
discussing the proposals of the Russian delegation and the 
Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, OHCR, on the 
return of the refugees to Abkhazia. M. Ukleba said that on the 
first day of the talks, 11 January, it was decided that on 8 
February a group of experts, which is engaged in drawing up 
proposals on the political status of Abkhazia, would meet again 
in Moscow. The first sitting of this group took place in Moscow 
on 15-16 December. 
  In a conversation with the ITAR-TASS correspondent, S. 
Dzhindzholiya said: "The main question is strengthening peace. 
We therefore propose the creation of a disengagement corridor 
along the Inguri river and and the introduction of peacekeeping 
forces there. We say -- and the Georgian side agrees with this 
-- that Russian troops could fulfill the role of peacekeeping 
forces." The second issue of the talks, the political status of 
Abkhazia, "is so complicated that it is impossible to expect any 
decision to be taken today." Its discussion will be continued 
by experts in Moscow. 
  S. Dzhindzholiya said the participants in the round are 
devoting a great deal of attention to the problem of refugees. 
It is not ruled out that as a first step, recommendations will 
be drawn up for the return of the refugees to one area of 
Abkhazia. It is intended that discussions on this matter will 
be continued in Moscow in February by the representatives of the 
sides within the framework of the working group with the 
participation of OHCR specialists.

<F P=106> [Report by Yelizaveta Leontyeva: "Police Join Forces"] </F>
  [Text] The Bureau To Coordinate the Fight Against 
Organized Crime and Other Dangerous Forms of Crime on CIS 
Territory has started work in Moscow. 
  The decision to create it was adopted by the Council of CIS 
States' Heads of Government. As a preliminary step a decision 
was made on joint measures to combat organized crime. There is 
no time to waste -- despite differences in mutual relations 
among the republics, a unified crime-conducive space has 
survived in the CIS. Moreover, there is information that 
criminal formations have "spread out" across the whole of the 
former Union. Almost one-third of permanent criminal groups -- 
and 3,500 of them have been uncovered in Russia -- have 
interregional links. 
  Commonwealth countries have a common problem in the shape of 
"illegal" business in such lucrative fields as the export of 
various kinds of raw materials and cultural treasures; 
large-scale bank fraud and the theft and resale of cars; and 
extortion, thefts, and attacks on means of transport. A 
particular danger is posed by gangs engaged in the illegal 
distribution of drugs and firearms and in foreign currency 
dealings. 
  Criminals have "staked out" their own areas in each 
Community 
state. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, for example, are 
"distinguished" for weapons sales and foreign currency dealings. 
All the Transcaucasus republics are famous for their 
concentration of bandit formations and also for weapons sales. 
And raw materials illegally transit the Baltic states. 
  The newly created Bureau is a prototype "Europol." Its work 
will be much more practical than that of Interpol, which is more 
reminiscent of a police mail box. The Bureau's main task will 
be precisely to combat crime in the CIS (particularly in its 
organized forms). This is a task which is intended to result in 
a decline in social tension, an improvement in the socioeconomic 
situation, and the regularization of the consumer market. It is 
also important to ensure that the dangerous processes of the 
merging of criminal and economic crime do not gather momentum 
and that criminal gang leaders and corrupt officials do not find 
a common language. And how is drug addiction and the drugs 
business to be eliminated? All this will undoubtedly fall on 
the new Bureau's shoulders. 
  The Convention on Legal Aid and Legal Arrangements in Civil, 
Family, and Criminal Cases signed in Minsk 22 January last year 
provides a good legal basis for the matters which the Bureau 
will tackle. But first the Convention has to be ratified. This 
is a task for the new [Russian] parliament, which will be faced 
with a whole series of legislative acts.

<F P=106> [Report by Shakhabutdin Zaynutdinov: "Presidents Resolve </F>
Aral's Problems"] 
  [Text] Nukus -- A representative conference devoted to 
comprehensive issues of the protection of the Aral Sea ended in 
Nukus with the signing of a statute on an interstate council on 
the problems of the Aral Sea basin and the approval of a 
long-term program for the region's socioeconomic development and 
the improvement of the ecological situation in the Aral region 
in the next few years. 
  Official delegations from the following took part in the 
work 
of the conference: Kazakhstan, headed by President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev; Kyrgyzstan, headed by President Askar Akayev; 
Tajikistan, headed by Emomali Rakhmonov, chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet; Turkmenistan, headed by President Saparmurad Niyazov; 
Uzbekistan, headed by President Islam Karimov; and the Russian 
Federation, headed by Vice Premier Yuriy Yarov. Representatives 
of international organizations also took part. 
  Opening the conference, the head of Uzbekistan noted that 
much has been done to supply the inhabitants of the Aral Sea 
region with drinking water and medical supplies. Fewer 
chemicals are now being used in agriculture. Thanks to the 
efforts of the leaders of the countries of the region the 
decline in the water level in the sea has been halted but the 
tragedy of the Aral Sea is affecting the health of people far 
beyond the sea basin. All this is directly connected with the 
uneconomic use of water resources and the shortage of money. To 
rectify the situation joint efforts are needed by all Central 
Asian states with the assistance of the international community. 
  This idea was supported by Kazakhstan President N. 
Nazarbayev, chairman of the international fund to save the Aral 
Sea, who informed those present that messages of support had 
been received from the leaders of the United States, France, 
Britain, Spain, Belgium, and Turkey. Khalid Malik, Uzbekistan's 
permanent UN representative, gave an assurance that 
international organizations are prepared to render every support 
in this common cause.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 13 ITAR-TASS -- Newspapers focus 
their attention today on the visit of U.S. President Bill 
Clinton to Russia. 
  An official part of the visit begins today, ROSSIYSKIYE 
VESTI 
writes. It will be the continuation of the dialogue on a summit 
level, started in Vancluver, Canada, last April. The newspaper 
points out with reference to Russian experts that "the 
discussion of the programme of partnership and cooperation 
between Russia and the United States for the late 90s and the 
beginning of the 21st century will be the feature event of the 
meeting of leaders of the two countries." 
  An article by Dr.Anatoliy Prokhorovsky, deputy director of 
the Institute of U.S. and Canadian Studies under the Russian 
Academy of Sciences, published by the same newspaper, says that 
the U.S. is doing its utmost for "promoting rapprochement with 
Russia." 
  IZVESTIYA stresses in the headline to the article, dealing 
with the visit of the American president, that "Clinton will not 
have much spare time in Moscow." Touching upon the meeting at 
the Spaso- House (the residence of the U.S. Ambassador) between 
Clinton and Russian politicians and business people, planned to 
be held today in the evening, the newspaper points to the 
absence of V.Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic 
Party, among those invited to the meeting. Quoting American 
sources, IZVESTIYA writes that "he is evoking apprehension in 
the Washington circles, and not only because of his political 
views, but also because of his manner of behaviour. They are 
afraid that his eccentricity will put Clinton in a very 
embarrassing position." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries articles about the visit of the 
honoured American guest under the headlines "Russian President 
-- Best Friend of American President" and "Importance of Talks 
To Begin in Moscow is Enhanced by Compromise, Reached by Moscow, 
Washington and Kiev." As was reported, representatives of 
Russia, the United States and Ukraine agreed in principle about 
a possibility of signing an accord on the dismantling of 
Ukrainian nuclear missiles. The newspaper calls in question the 
correctness of this step made by Ukraine. In its opinion, 
Ukraine "could imposed its terms on others for a long time to 
come, showing a nuclear fist from under the table." 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA writes about President Clinton's visit 
to Moscow: "It is expected from the Russian president that he 
will share with the U.S. guest his personal observations over 
the progress of the economic reform in the country, especially 
after the parliamentary elections. They are sure to bring up 
the question about the role of international financial 
institutions in the building of capitalism in Russia and in 
giving a 'human touch' to it." 
  According to PRAVDA, the Russian part of clinton's visit to 
Europe is described by local observers more and more often as 
the demonstration of support for Yeltsin. 
  Commenting on the U.S. plan "Partnership for Peace," 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA writes that "it was drawn up and adopted with 
due account for Russia's lawful interests in the sphere of 
security." It is quite probable that Moscow will express the 
desire to take part in it, the newspaper points out. 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, TRUD and other newspapers give wide 
coverage to the work of the Federal Assembly (the Russian 
parliament). It is pointed out that a more constructive stand 
assumed by members of the Federation Council enabled them to 
make a far greater progress than that of the State Duma. 
SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA compares the first days of the work of the 
State Duma and the first congress of the former Russian people's 
deputies. According to the newspaper, they were characterised 
by "verbal attacks on Georgiy Lukava, a pilot and the doyen of 
the State Duma, representing the Liberal Democratic Party, and 
an ordinary adjustment to each other. The behaviour of many 
members of parliament showed that they have no idea of the ABC's 
of the parliamentary work." 
  TRUD carries a full text of the interview with Professor 
Aleksandr Stoyan, chairman of the Ukrainian Trade Union 
Federation. He recognised that Ukrainian trade unions were not 
ready to take effective action in defence of working people in 
conditions of market-based relations.

  [Text] Yerevan, 12 Jan (ARMENPRES) -- Following a brief 
lull, the Azerbaijani Army committed yet another provocation on 
the Armenian border yesterday evening. It used tanks, armored 
cars and firearms to shell the Tavushskiy Rayon center Berd, a 
number of villages, and defensive positions in that rayon at 
around 1600. The Armenian border guards retaliated. The armed 
formations in Nakhichevan also became active on the same day. 
The border positions in Megrinskiy Rayon came under periodic 
shelling from howitzers and other weapons. There were no 
casualties on the Armenian side in Tavushskiy and Megrinskiy 
rayons. 
  The Azerbaijani troops opened machine gun fire today on the 
defensive positions around Kirants in Idzhevanskiy Rayon. The 
Armenian side retaliated in kind. The exchange of fire was 
still continuing at 1700. 
  There is no end to the military operations in Karabakh 
conflict zone. Having halted all the attacks of the enemy and 
successfully completed a military maneuver, the Karabakh Defense 
Army subunits surrounded an Azerbaijani battalion near 
Hakob-Kamari in Mardakertskiy Rayon yesterday evening and killed 
46 soldiers. The Armenian fighters took control of a number of 
strategic heights previously occupied by the enemy. 
  According to the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army 
press 
service, the Azerbaijani troops also suffered huge losses in 
other sectors of the front extending from Mardakertskiy Rayon to 
the Iranian border, where their losses amounted to three 
battalions -- that is, 270 soldiers and officers killed. 
  Six were killed and 15 injured on Karabakh side during the 
combat operations on 11 January. 
  Despite huge losses, the Azerbaijani Army resumed its 
attacks 
today all along the war front.

  [Text] Yerevan, January 12 (SNARK) -- Today the Armenian 
Parliament accepted the 1994 privatization program suggested by 
the Armenian Government. There will be privatized the units of 
the uncompleted construction, agriculture, trade and public 
service. 
  Speaking to the extraordinary session of the Armenian 
Parliament the Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan accepted 
the fact that the Republic is essentially behind of the 
privatization process. "Armenia did only two serious `steps' in 
privatization -- there were privatized only flats and land", 
Levon Ter-Petrosyan declared. 
  According to Levon Ter-Petrosyan, "the expected 1994 
privatization of the state enterprises won't influence the 
Armenian economy because of the small volumes".

  [Text] Yerevan, January 11 (SNARK) -- Confidential sources 
told SNARK tomorrow at the extraordinary session of the Armenian 
Parliament the Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan will 
suggest new candidature for the position of the head of the 
Central Bank of Armenia. He wants his fellow-fighter Bagrat 
Asatryan, one of the active doers of the leading Armenian 
National Movement [Armenian Pannational Movement] party, [to] 
hold a post instead of the existing Chairman of the Central Bank 
Isahak Isahakyan. Armen Darbinyan, a representative of the 
Armenian National Movement, deputy Head of the Economic 
Department, is expected for the position of the deputy head of 
the Central Bank of Armenia. 
  Experts are of the opinion that in many respects the 
political reasons caused changes in the Central Bank directors. 
Isahak Isahakyan holds the position for a period of 10 years 
and is the only representative of the old, the so-called 
communist nomenclature within the new leadership. His 
experience -- the experience of professional and often an 
obstinate banker -- was necessary till the Republic was in 
direct dependence on Russia. The national currency 
introduction brought to no necessity of such a dependence. 
Besides, the last-week debates on the Central Bank's submission 
to the Armenian Government showed that the Armenian Government 
wants to control over the Central Bank's activity.

Nagorno-Karabakh at the end of the last year".

  [Text] Moscow, 12 Jan -- After a long break, Azeri Air 
Force assault aircraft today again appeared in the skies above 
Stepanakert. The ITAR-TASS correspondent was told on the phone 
by the press service of the headquarters of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
Defense Army that in the afternoon, two assault aircraft tried 
to bomb Stepanakert, but after response actions by Karabakh 
antiaircraft forces, they were forced to leave the airspace of 
Nagorno-Karabakh. But today the Azeri forces' offensive on most 
sections of the front continued. 
  According to a report by the press service of the military 
department, on Tuesday evening [11 January], subunits of the 
Karabakh Defense Army repulsed all attacks and maneuvered 
successfully, managing to surround a group of the Azeri Army in 
the area of the village of Akop Kamari in the north of 
Mardakertskiy [Mardakert] Rayon. Forty-six Azeri soldiers were 
killed and control was reestablished over a number of heights 
previously seized by the enemy. In the course of repulsing the 
attacks on other sections of the front, three infantry companies 
(up to 270 men and officers) of the Azeri National Army were 
destroyed, mainly by well-aimed artillery fire. 
  The Karabakh side's losses amounted to six killed and 15 
wounded.

  [Text] Karabakh troops killed 46 Azerbaijani soldiers on 
Tuesday after it surrounded an Azerbaijani unit in the Mardakert 
region, northern Karabakh. 
  A spokesman for the Army of the self-proclaimed 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic has told Interfax that yet another 270 
Azerbaijani servicemen have been put out of action on other 
fronts. 
  Meanwhile, Karabakh has regained control over a number of 
strategic heights, earlier captured by Azerbaijan. 
  The Karabakh Army's casualties on Tuesday were estimated at 
6 
killed and 15 wounded. 
  By latest reports from Stepanakert, Azerbaijani troops 
mounted an offensive virtually on all fronts on Wednesday. 
Bitter fighting is under way. 
  Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's Defence Ministry has refuted as 
false 
Armenia's reports about Azerbaijan's heavy casualties in the 
fighting. 
  It contended that last week's Azerbaijani losses in both man 
power and material were much smaller than Armenia's damage. 
  A ministry spokesman estimated Armenia's losses in the 
Mardakert region where Azerbaijani troops ringed two Karabakh 
battalions on Tuesday at 30 men and three tanks. 
  Yet another 35 Armenian soldiers reportedly lost their lives 
in fighting on the Askeran and Agdam fronts and in the Fizuli 
region, Azerbaijan. Several tanks and artillery guns were 
smashed.

  [Text] The Defense Ministry press service reports the 
following for 12 January: 
  The Armenian military units tried to launch an offensive on 
11 January in the Hakop-Kamari [Lulasaz] sector of the front 
that lies towards Terter. The enemy, who launched three attacks 
during the day, suffered considerable losses in men and material 
and had to withdraw. 
  Our brave soldiers have brought to naught every Armenian 
offensive in Agdamskiy and Beylagan rayons. 
  The high command of the Armenian Armed Forces, whose attacks 
towards Beylagan and Terter were defeated, is now working to 
exacerbate the situation on our republic's northwestern borders. 
The settlements in our republic's Tauzskiy, Kazakhskiy, and 
Kedabekskiy rayons came under unceasing long-range artillery 
shelling at 1830 on 11 January from Armenia's Berd, 
Idzhevanskiy, and Krasnoselskiy rayons. Our army units took 
countermeasures to silence the ferocious enemy.

  [Text] Baku, January 12 (AZERTAC)--One of the key officials 
of President Aliyev's team, 43 year old Lala Shovket Gadzhiyeva, 
M.D., who has held a position of the state secretary for the 
last half year, was given a position of permanent representative 
of Azerbaijan to the United Nations. [Baku Azerbaycan Radio 
Televiziyasi Television Network in Azeri at 1600 GMT on 12 
January, in a similar report adds: "The Azerbaijan president's 
decree conferred on her the diplomatic rank of ambassador 
extraordinary and plenipotentiary."] 
  A number of analysts from opposing political currents 
consider this appointment exclusion from power, as the former 
secretary of state has not been agreed with the personnel 
policy. The same analysts suppose that Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Gassan Gassanov and chairman of the National 
Independence Party of Azerbaijan Etibar Mamedov are two possible 
candidates to the state secretary vacancy. Gassan Gassanov is 
known as president's comrade-in-arms, and the national harmony 
might be the major factor dictating Etibar Mamedov's 
appointment. The state secretary position was offered to Etibar 
Mamedov last summer.

  [Text] Thursday, January 13 -- "We cannot express our 
disappointment with the NATO summit. We have done too little to 
attract the interest of the NATO," head of the Riigikogu 
[parliament] defence commission Rein Helme said. 
  He added that Estonia has problems with regional cooperation 
and pointed out the border issues with Russia. Admission to the 
NATO is impossible in case of such problems, which will have to 
be either solved or frozen, Helme said. 
  As for the appeal of the Lithuanian president, Helme 
commented that consultations between parliaments and governments 
would have been necessary, since the issue concerns the entire 
nation. 
  The Riigikogu foreign affairs commission is waiting official 
documents from Brussels, commission chairman Vello Saatpalu 
said. Saatpalu expressed his amazement at Prime Minister Mart 
Laar's announcement that Estonia is ready to appeal to Brussels 
in the nearest future, complaining that the foreign affairs 
commission had again been excluded from the making of vital 
decisions. Saatpalu added that this and other incidents 
indicate a movement from the rule of law to a state of 
administration.

  [Text] The Estonian president has appointed Juri Luik, the 
country's former defense minister, as foreign minister. His 
post has been taken by Indrek Kannik, hitherto an adviser to the 
foreign minister. Evidently Juri Luik will leave his post as 
head of delegation at the talks with Russia, since, according to 
the Estonian side, his new post will not allow him to conduct 
talks with "a mere ambassador of the Russian Federation." 
  Luik and Kannik are recent graduates from the Tartu 
University Journalism Faculty and members of the Estonian 
student community; they are 27 years old, and have not yet 
settled down to married life.

  Kranich said that the Ministry of Finance had achieved "a

  Kranich said that no parallels could be drawn with the work 
of the Ministry of Economics, which, in spite of "great fuss"

Riigikogu [parliament], both of them causing certain problems. 
  Kranich said that the coming weeks would be needed to

  [Text] Tartu, Estonia, Jan 12, BNS - The Estonian State 
Court today ruled to declare null and void the government 
regulations and amendments to the police law which legalized the 
usage of special means of surveillance by the country's security 
police. 
  The State Court in the ruling says such means of police 
surveillance and their usage as stipulated by the government 
regulations may restrict the citizens' constitutional rights and 
freedoms. 
  The police law amendments allowed for special means, such as 
phone-tapping and reading of citizens' letters, to be used by 
the Defense Police in some cases. The amendments law, however, 
also stipulated that such means could be used only following a 
respective permission from the head of the State Court or a 
State Court member to whom the court's head has referred the 
powers to issue such permission. 
  The amendments, originally meant to remain in effect until 
the adoption of a separate law, left it largely with security 
police officials and one State Court member to determine what 
means of investigation and police surveillance were to be 
regarded as special measures and in which cases these were to be 
used. 
  The Estonian parliament passed the police law amendments on 
April 21, 1993. 
  The chancellor of law, Eerik-Juhan Truuvali, first referred 
to constitutional stipulations and requested that the 
parliament annulled the amendments. Truuvali sought a State 
Court ruling on the issue after the parliament made no move 
toward bringing the law into accordance with the constitution. 
  Both rulings adopted by the State Court today are effective 
immediately on adoption, final, and cannot be referred to any 
other court of appeal. 
  The Defense Police on several occasions recently has 
obtained 
from the State Court the right to use extraordinary means of 
surveillance. For instance, Defense Police tapped the phones of 
some members of the so-called Pullapaa volunteer infantry 
company during last summer's crisis, when the unit had announced 
its independence from the defense forces Main Staff. 
  The prosecution service law, a legislation designed to 
finally regulate the usage of special means of police 
surveillance, has by now passed the first reading in the 
parliament. According to the draft, permission to use 
phone-tapping in investigation has to be sought from

  [Text] Estonia's Riigikogu [parliament] on Wednesday 
adopted amendments to law on compensating illegally expropriated 
property which will enable people who owned property at the 
other side of Estonian-Russian administrative border receive 
compensation for Soviet-time nationalisation. 
  Votes in the parliament split 35:4 with 12 abstentions. 
  Until now, Estonia did not pay compensation for property 
that 
was illegally expropriated at territories that under 1920 Tartu 
Peace Treaty between Estonia and Russia belong to Estonia, but 
are now under Russian jurisdiction, Liia Hanni, the Minister of 
Reform, said. 
  Under Estonian ownership reform law, properties that lie in 
Petserimaa and across Narva river will be assessed by land 
commissions of Viru and Ida-Viru counties respectively.

<F P=106> [From 13 January PAEVALEHT, p 1] </F>
  [Text] Thursday, January 13 -- The Moderate faction of the 
Riigikogu [parliament] held a news conference yesterday on the 
recent crisis around the appointment of ministers. 
  Rural Centrist Ivar Raig, Social Democrat Ardo Ojasalu and 
faction member Heiki Nestor claimed that President Lennart Meri 
is provided with false information. They explained their claim 
with the president's opposition to the replacement of former 
Economy Minister Toomas Sildmae. Raig claimed that the actual 
situation was exactly opposite to what Meri had said, stressing 
that the ministry had not submitted a single original draft law 
to the Riigikogu. He also rejected the president's accusations 
that the prime minister was building an administrative state. 
The presidential chancellery has placed the president in an 
unpleasant situation, he said. 
  Heiki Nestor claimed that economic circles are exerting 
pressure on the president, while Ardo Ojasalu regretted the 
descent "on the level of everyday politics". Raig added that 
Toomas Sildmae was the only winner in the conflict. 
  The Moderates also commented on the possibility of a breakup 
of their faction, claiming that an agreement had been achieved, 
according to which no breakup will take place in the nearest 
three months. This was done as a favour to the independent 
faction members who would have had to make their choice in a 
short time otherwise.

Talk About Russia: U.S. President Bill Clinton's Four-Day State 
Visit to Moscow Begins Today. In Connection With This Event We 
Are Publishing Comments on Russia by Well Known American 
Politicians and Public Figures"] 
  [Text] Strobe Talbott, special adviser to the U.S. 
secretary of state [title as published]: 
  We are encouraging forces seeking integration with the whole 
world. 
  An extremely important event for the whole world -- that is 
how Strobe Talbott, ambassador at large and special adviser to 
the U.S. secretary of state on the new independents states, 
described U.S. President Bill Clinton's forthcoming visit to 
Moscow. 
  Answering journalists' questions during a TV linkup 
organized 
by the USIA, he noted that during this visit President Clinton 
will confirm that the United States "intends to firmly maintain 
its leading position in the international effort to support 
reform in Russia." These transformation, in S. Talbott's words, 
"can be considered the most important event of the present day." 
  During the visit to Moscow President Clinton will also state 
that "Russia must have its own powerful voice" in determining 
how the "situation in the sphere of security in Europe and 
Eurasia in the post-cold war period" will work out. "If Russia 
continues its course of integration...and continues to pursue a 
policy based on respect for neighboring states and their 
sovereignty and independence it will be able to join in the 
process of integration and the expansion of NATO," S. Talbott 
noted. After touching on the question of the prospects of 
relations with Russia, S. Talbott remarked that the Clinton 
administration looks to the future with "great optimism" because 
"Russia has a strong president." "President Yeltsin was and 
remains the leader of the reform process," he stressed. "We are 
trying," S. Talbott added, "to encourage those forces in Russia 
which are actively striving to ensure that the country makes the 
transition from communism to integration with the rest of the 
world."

  [Text] Russia's Fuel and Energy Ministry has not drafted 
any special document for President Clinton's visit to Moscow, 
Interfax was told by a ministry official, commenting on 
speculation about possible initiatives during the visit on 
cooperation in the sphere of fuel and energy. Although he did 
not rule out some urgent requests from the government, he 
emphasized that usually departments were asked to prepare 
applicable documents in advance. 
  Nonetheless, he suggested that Russian and American 
negotiators might discuss cooperation in the field and air 
appropriate "intentions". 
  As Interfax has learned, the sides have several big projects 
at various stages of readiness, which could place U.S. firms 
among the biggest investors in Russia's fuel and energy complex. 
According to one plan to get under way within the next few 
weeks, Russia will receive a $2 Bn loan under U.S. export-import 
bank guarantees to buy American oil and gas extracting 
equipment. Besides, a project to develop two oil fields on the 
Sakhalin shelf is in the final stage of preparation. The deal 
is estimated at $10 Bn and involves three U.S. firms. Russian 
officials are also considering a possible lucrative contract 
with Texaco to extract oil in the Archangelsk region and advance 
its infrastructure. The project could take 50 years to 
implement at the cost of over $50 Bn.

  [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS -- A contract to use highly 
enriched uranium, obtained from dismantled nuclear weapons in 
Russia, may be approved by the presidents of the Russian 
Federation and the United States during their summit in Moscow, 
experts of the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy hope. 
  According to a document, signed last February, and the 
contract, which was discussed by representatives of the two 
countries in September, Russia is to process 500 tonnes of 
weapon uranium over a period of twenty years. This uranium, 
after proper treatment, will be delivered to the United States 
as fuel for that country's nuclear power plants in amounts worth 
twelve billion U.S. dollars. Russia will use the obtained money 
for switching its defence enterprises to civilian rails, 
enhancing the safety of its nuclear power plants, supporting 
fundamental sciences, and cleaning the environment in polluted 
areas. 
  Moreover, the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy expects the 
participants of the summit to sign an agreement allocating 75 
million U.S. dollars to Russian organisations from the 
Nunn-Lugar Fund. They will be used to build storages for weapon 
plutonium. The point in question is an additional allocation of 
75 millions, preliminarily negotiated by the Russian Ministry 
for Atomic Energy and the U.S. Defence Department to pay for the 
work done by building organisations, to grant subsidies to the 
region, where the storages will be held, and also to finance 
social requirements. 
  Two such storages are to be built in Russia -- one in Tomsk 
region and the other in Chelyabinsk region. The Ministry for 
Atomic Energy is looking forward to U.S. assistance in the 
construction of one of these storages. The construction of the 
other one will be financed by Russia. 
  Russian specialists also believe that the presidents of the 
two countries will discuss the earlier signed agreements and 
will conclude other bilateral agreements on new areas of 
cooperation in using atomic energy for peaceful purposes. These 
areas include nuclear power sources for space vehicles, joint 
efforts of Russian and American weapon laboratories to develop 
more effective procedures and technological means for the system 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency's guarantees against 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.

  [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS -- "The very fact of the U.S. 
President's visit to our country shows what place Russia has in 
the U.S. foreign policy plans and priorities," Sergey 
Stankevich, head of the temporary secretariat of the State Duma, 
said on Wednesday. 
  "A personal meeting between the presidents of the two 
countries after a new constitutional and political reality has 
emerged in Russia is very important," he said. 
  Stankevich believes that until recently the United States 
had 
supported the most radical variant of economic reform in Russia. 
However, the "October-December crisis" (October revolt and 
December 12 elections which he also considers as a crisis) has 
shown that such variant has clear-cut social limits. Judging by 
many statements of American officials, the United States is 
ready to introduce considerable changes in its relations with 
Russia and stop supporting radical reform based on shock 
therapy, he added. 
  Stankevich stressed that such corrections will constitute 
the 
subject of discussions during President Bill Clinton's upcoming 
visit.

  [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS -- "I am sure that Clinton's 
security will be fully taken care of while he is in Moscow", a 
Russian security official declared. 
  Indeed, three security agencies are ready to guard American 
President Bill Clinton during his visit to Russia: the Chief 
Security Department of the Russian Federation, the Russian 
Presidential Security Team, and the United States presidential 
Guard. The number of people who are going to be directly 
involved in the protection of Clinton, who arrives late 
Wednesday evening, will exceed several hundred, according to 
First Deputy Director of the Russian Security Department Yuriy 
Krapivin. 
  If one counted up the number of auxiliary people somehow 
involved in the massive security effort, the numbers would run 
into the thousands. According to Krapivin, the Russian Interior 
Ministry will secure the U.S. President's travel routes and the 
sites which are included in the programme of his visit. The 
interior troops will also protect the "Radisson Slawjanskaja" 
hotel where President Clinton is scheduled to stay. 
  The Russian Federal Counter-Espionage Service is responsible 
for up-to-the-minute information, including reports about 
possible extremist conspiracies and criminal activity in Moscow. 
Even the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service took part in 
preliminary steps to guarantee Clinton's complete security. 
  Krapivin said that an advance group from Clinton's personal 
guard, which arrived with their armored cars and weapons a week 
ago, worked out a plan of cooperation with their Russian 
colleagues. The group thoroughly scouted out the president's 
hotel and the sites of his visits.

<F P=106> [From the "Details" program; by presenter Nikolay Svanidze] </F>
  [Text] Russia will shortly have one more president. Air 
Force One is currently in flight. In 90 minutes, it will land 
at Vnukovo- 2 Airport. By the aircraft steps, Bill Clinton will 
be met by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and this 
will mark the start of the American President's official 
three-day visit to Russia. 
  On his way to Moscow, President Bill Clinton visited Prague. 
Incidentally, he is flying on his own at the moment, without his 
family. His wife, Lady Hillary, no less well known than 
himself, and, possibly, his daughter Chelsea as well, will join 
him the day after tomorrow. Two-and-a-half hours ago, he should 
have had a brief conversation with Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk at Kiev's Borispol Airport. One day earlier, President 
Bill Clinton attended the NATO Council session. [Video shows a 
meeting in progress with an inset of a statue of an angel; 
Russian troops talking; man presenting a box of candy to a 
little girl; NATO Secretary General Woerner meeting Czech 
President Havel, then Polish President Walesa]. 
  Apparently, the North Atlantic bloc advertizes itself so 
well 
in its publicity material, and Russia so dubiously in its 
elections, that our neighbors in Eastern Europe and the Baltic 
area are knocking on NATO's door like piglets running away from 
the wolf. Unlike the bold piglets, though, the Europeans won't 
hide from us anywhere: we'll get them wherever they are, if we 
want to. Both Clinton and the NATO leadership are well aware of 
that. 
  The December elections in Russia frightened world public 
opinion with the prospect of a communist comeback or the reign 
of national- fascists -- the most unpredictable and, 
consequently, alarming consequences. There was also another 
apprehension. 
  And then a man appeared who just talked, and that talking 
was 
enough to resurrect many old suspicions since the cold war and 
to excite politicians, and I do not rule out that now, like a 
tuning- fork, he says that's how one should be, and many rather 
unprincipled politicians may also follow that path. [Video 
shows Svanidze talking to Kozyrev] 
  [Begin recording] [Svanidze] Are President Yeltsin and you, 
as foreign minister, not tempted now to strike a statuesque 
pose, adopt a facial expression that is as patriotic as possible 
and talk far tougher to Clinton than he talks to Russia? 
  [Kozyrev] We shall do the same has we have been doing. We 
have always talked quite tough, it must be said. [end recording] 
[Video shows Yeltsin inspecting troops] 
  Both Boris Yeltsin and the leaders of Western countries have 
displayed resilience in the situation that has arisen. The 
Russian president has raised his eyebrows. Everything is under 
way. There is no reason for hysterics. If the West adopts a 
fair attitude toward Ukraine's attempt to revise nuclear 
agreements and toward the massive panic-stricken exodus of the 
former brothers-in-socialism towards NATO, he, Yeltsin, won't 
understand that. [Video shows EC meeting; Kravchuk speaking; 
Lithuanian President Brazauskas talking to Yeltsin; Clinton 
joking with Havel] 
  The subtle hint was taken. Clinton and other Western 
leaders, who were under intense pressure last week from those 
who favor a change in policy toward Moscow and, above all, 
toward Yeltsin, kept their nerve. In fact, the West was facing 
a dilemma. Either to throw the doors open to all-comers and 
thus build up a strong defensive cordon on Russia's western 
borders right now, in case the Russians want a bit of a fight. 
These tactics threaten to stiffen militarist sentiments and to 
bolster the extremist radical wing in Russia itself. Or to 
relax, not make a fuss, and realize that, if the Russians go mad 
and move their tanks in, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, 
and Slovakia can't be saved anyway. And so, whoever is accepted 
into what, there will be no stable Europe without a stable 
Russia. Eastern Europe itself probably understands that and is 
relying more on monetary than on military assistance. But the 
West doesn't have a bottomless pocket. [Svanidze is seen 
talking to Kozyrev] 
  [Begin Kozyrev recording] NATO has not been intimidated by 
the hasty demands for a quantitative expansion of its ranks. We 
were against that, and it must be said that the American 
"Partnership for Peace" blueprint actually envisages a lengthy 
stage, as they see it, of preparing the new states for entry to 
NATO. Here there is some difference of emphasis between us. We 
do not put the emphasis on preparation for entry to NATO, 
although we do not rule out the possibility that, at some stage, 
Russia itself may become a member of NATO. Why not? But the 
main thing is not that we shall be in some kind of preparatory 
class. The main thing for us is the actual period, a 
sufficiently lengthy and substantive period, of partnership. 
What is meant by that? Joint maneuvers, training of 
peacekeeping troops, let's say, for areas of conflict, and so on 
and so forth. [end recording] [Video shows Clinton next to 
Delors and other EC leaders] 
  At the NATO session, the partners proceeded from the view 
that the hasty acceptance of East European countries into the 
organization would lead to the destabilization of Europe. This 
was reflected mildly in the adopted program "Partnership for 
Peace," which is open to Russia so long as we have the good 
fortune to observe one of the program's principles -- civilian 
control of the military. [Video shows Clinton at EC meeting; 
ship's guns firing; Georgiy Arbatov, academician, Russian 
Academy of Sciences, appears] 
  [Begin Arbatov recording] Today we have less civilian 
control 
of the army than we had even before perestroyka. [end recording] 
[Video: another sequence from the Kozyrev interview] 
  [Begin recording] [Svanidze] Has the influence of the 
military on the drawing up of foreign policy not grown stronger 
recently? 
  [Kozyrev] No. People have usually said that ever since, 
let's 
say, the tragic events in October. Now they say that the 
president or the whole government are dancing to the tune of the 
military because they are obliged to them, and so on. No, 
there's no such thing. That's wrong. 
  [Svanidze] There's no dancing? 
  [Kozyrev] No. As for bearing them in mind -- yes. We bear 
them in mind. [end recording] 
  It is beyond doubt that this whole collection of issues 
connected with Eastern Europe and NATO will be among the most 
important at the Moscow talks. A second substantial item is the 
problem of nuclear security and relations with Ukraine. The 
third is the problem of aid. President Boris Yeltsin will 
undoubtedly insist that it should be spelled out in detail. 
There will also undoubtedly be discussion here of the 43,000 
million dollars that were earmarked for us by the G-7 and which 
are essential to the continuation of reform in Russia. [Video 
shows more of the Kozyrev interview] 
  [Begin Kozyrev recording] We shall raise the question of its 
being in the form of help for our emergence on to the 
international market, and for the activation of our own economy, 
while we concern ourselves with our unemployed. [end recording] 
[Video shows back to Arbatov] 
  [Begin Arbatov recording] I get the impression, quite 
frankly, and I think the Americans will think of it too, 
perhaps: was the game worth the candle? [end recording] 
  Western Europe and the United States are following our 
reforms closely. But today, exactly a month after the 
parliamentary elections in Russia, the U.S. President is flying 
to see us, and it can confidently be said that one change in the 
American and Western approach to events in Russia has already 
taken place. Today they are more interested in our stability 
than in the pace of our reforms. [Video shows more of the 
Kozyrev interview] 
  [Begin recording] [Svanidze] Do you equate the work of the 
president with work for Russia, work for democratic...? 
  [Kozyrev, interrupting] Yes, because this president was 
elected by the people, and his mandate was confirmed by the 
people. Will the people vote for a different president? I 
don't know whether I will. It will depend on what that 
president's character is like. But, at any rate, he will 
personify Russia. The constitution says that the president is 
the head of state, and he determines foreign policy. [end 
recording] [Video shows Kozyrev standing beside Yeltsin] 
  In fact, Kozyrev has recently been operating hand in glove 
with President Yeltsin, which is rare. He clearly has a subtle 
understanding of Yeltsin. [Video shows Clinton addressing an 
audience; brief clip of German President Kohl] 
  Clinton seems to understand him, too. At the meeting in 
Brussels, when greeting Chancellor Kohl, a man of solid build, 
Clinton said: Helmut, I thought of you all night as I watched 
sumo wrestling on television. I wonder what Bill Clinton 
associates with President Yeltsin.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Kuznechevskiy report: "Bill Clinton's Visit to </F>
Moscow. NATO Is Not Approaching Russia's Borders at the Moment"] 
  [Text] The North Atlantic alliance summit has ended in 
Brussels. The main subjects discussed were questions of 
security in Europe and worldwide, which in practical terms took 
the form of the problem of expanding the alliance by including 
East European countries and certain former republics of the 
Soviet Union. 
  On a U.S. initiative the NATO leadership adopted the 
"Partnership for Peace" program, within which framework Poland, 
the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia are invited to 
collaborate with the North Atlantic alliance in creating a 
collective security system, but not as full members. The 
question of nuclear weapons on Ukraine's territory was discussed 
equally intensively. 
  According to news agency reports, U.S. President Bill 
Clinton 
called the approval of the "Partnership for Peace" plan and the 
fact that it proved possible to persuade Ukraine to adopt a 
treaty stipulating that Kiev should give up nuclear weapons "two 
gigantic steps in the direction of universal security." 
  It was not easy for Bill Clinton to press for precisely 
those 
results in the summit. As we know, proceeding on the basis that 
"the Western defensive alliance is faced with the historic task 
of extending the existing security system to East Europe," NATO 
Secretary General M. Woerner expressed the opinion that NATO 
should open its doors to all the former Warsaw Pact countries 
"since they are culturally and historically closely linked with 
the West and should restore these ties with it." But Russia, as 
we know, objected to this pretty resolutely, and on the eve of 
the meeting, Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
proposed that NATO and Russia should jointly guarantee European 
security. 
  The U.S. president managed to incline his partners to 
accommodate Moscow's wishes, although he had to take a fair 
amount of criticism for adopting this stance. Covering the 
results of the summit, the Western press was full of reproaches 
against him on the premise that, although Russia continues to be 
a great power despite its present economic weakness, the West 
should not adapt ad infinitum to its interests alone in security 
questions. 
  The question of the talks with Ukraine proceeded equally 
dramatically. The Ukrainian president, unable to withstand the 
combined pressure of the U.S. and Russian presidents, agreed to 
sign a document on 14 January in Moscow on the complete transfer 
to Russia of the nuclear weapons located on Ukraine's territory. 
  Beyond the shadow of a doubt, Leonid Kravchuk has decided to 
ignore the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet decision dated 18 November 
which de facto enshrined Ukraine's status as a nuclear power. 
In all likelihood, on his return home from doing his Moscow 
penance, he will come up against big problems in his 
relationship with the parliament. But those are ultimately 
Leonid Kravchuk's own problems. 
  The main event is happening elsewhere. The U.S. President is 
arriving for a meeting with Boris Yeltsin today with big 
achievements in his foreign political activity, which will 
doubtless be very highly assessed in Moscow. 
  In a word, the first meeting between the Russian and U.S. 
presidents promises to be very productive.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Abarinov report in the "Visit" column: "Doomed to </F>
Cooperation. Moscow Believes that Russian-U.S. Partnership Has 
Entered a `Stage of Maturity'"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Russian Foreign Ministry 
believes that the message that Clinton will bring to Moscow is 
that the reforms need "social cushions," and expects the U.S. 
side to offer its assistance in this field. Diplomats are 
recommending to President Yeltsin to raise the question of the 
United States' increasing its influence in international 
financial organizations with a view to unfreezing the funds 
earmarked for Russia. At the same time, in Russia's opinion, 
the economic effect from the abolition of discriminatory 
limitations in trade substantially exceeds the scale of any 
existing aid programs. 
  Deep in their hearts U.S. officials have presumably 
understood that they are incapable of influencing the 
development of the situation in Russia. Even so they continue 
to support Yeltsin in the interest of global security. The 
level of confidence achieved by the leaders of Russia and the 
United States indeed has no precedent. During the visit the 
presidents are expected to sign a document tentatively called 
the Moscow Declaration. Although its final text has not been 
coordinated yet, it is known to contain a number of new ideas in 
the sphere of disarmament and nonproliferation of mass 
destruction weapons, also defining the sides' general approaches 
to the concept of Partnership for Peace. It is not ruled out 
that in the near future Moscow will announce its intention to 
acquire the status of an associate NATO member state 
[strana-partner NATO]. The agenda for the talks on security 
will include such topics as prohibiting the production of 
fissionable materials for military purposes, a comprehensive ban 
on nuclear tests, and the retargeting of strategic nuclear 
forces. According to a high-ranking Russian diplomat who spoke 
confidentially, Moscow is "advancing the idea" of Russia and the 
United States making available special units for peacekeeping 
operations under the aegis of the United Nations and the CSCE. 
On the Russian side such a unit will be the 27th Motorized 
Infantry Division and on the U.S. side the 3d Infantry Division. 
  The Foreign Affairs Ministry regards President Kravchuk's 
consent to arrive in Moscow and fully reaffirm Ukraine's 
obligations under the Lisbon Protocol as a major breakthrough. 
Russian diplomats believe that thereby an end has been put to 
debates on the fate of the Russian nuclear weapons stationed on 
Ukrainian territory. 
  At the same time, the Russian-U.S. strategic partnership 
which, according to a highly placed Russian diplomat, has 
entered a "stage of maturity," is far from ideal. In particular 
Moscow is not happy over Washington's attempts to 
internationalize the conflicts on CIS territory. Russia 
considers this territory to be the zone of its special 
interests. Moscow is also unhappy with the fact that it is not 
being admitted to talks on creating a new international 
organization which is to replace the defunct Cocom. [passage

  [Text] Esteemed Mr. President of the United States of 
America, it gives me great pleasure to welcome you as an honored 
guest of the Russian Federation. Your day is beginning in our 
famous and legendary St. George's Hall in the Grand Kremlin 
Palace, in which the names and historic deeds of our great 
ancestors are reflected. This setting does, as it were, provide 
the starting point for our talks. 
  I well remember our first meeting in Vancouver. I remember 
how we laid the foundations for a U.S.-Russian partnership and 
how personal friendship arose between us. I am sure that this 
is a basis for ensuring that the talks this time will be even 
more in- depth, more practical, and more global in nature. 
  I think that you will retain a good memory of people in 
Russia, of Muscovites, and that you will sense this fully in 
your meetings with people. Welcome to Russia. Welcome to 
Moscow.

  [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS--The Russian-American summit 
talks began in the Kremlin today in the morning immediately 
after the official greeting ceremony. 
  After the beginning of the talks both presidents expressed 
confidence that the dialogue between Russia and the U.S. would 
promote the consolidation of world peace and tranquility, as 
well as the deepening of cooperation between the two countries. 
  On the first stage the talks are held in a narrow format at 
the Green Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace. Aside from Yeltsin 
and Clinton, they are attended by Dmitriy Ryurikov, assistant to 
the Russian president, and Strobe Talbott, special adviser to 
the U.S. secretary of state on the new independent states. 
  According to the information from reliable sources, during 
their first one-hour meeting the Russian and U.S. presidents are 
expected to discuss issues dealing with economic and political 
cooperation between the two countries, the implementation of the 
Russian reform, the consolidation of international security, 
specifically, the settlement of regional conflicts and the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Probably, they will touch 
upon the mechanism of putting into effect Ukraine's decision on 
the withdrawal of nuclear warheads from its territory.

reliable sources on Thursday [13 January] that Russian and U.S. 
Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton discussed broad range 
of issues at the Kremlin's Green Hall in a narrow format.

Russia on December 12, progress in Russian reforms as well as 
questions of strengthening international security and nuclear 
non-proliferation.

Ukraine's readiness to sign, together with Russia and the United 
States, a document on the withdrawal of nuclear warheads from 
its territory. The document will be signed in Moscow on Friday. 
  The sides also discussed the situation with a Russian radar 
station in Latvia.

after the first round of talks. 
  Following the tour, the talks will be resumed in a broader 
format.

  [Text] Moscow, 13 Jan -- Russian Federation Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev met today with U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher in the yellow reception room of the Great 
Kremlin Palace. The heads of the foreign policy departments of 
the two states examined a package of Russian-American documents 
to be signed in the course of the visit to Moscow by the U.S. 
President. 
  Galina Sidorova, the Russian minister's political adviser, 
told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that three agreements have been 
made ready for signing: Air traffic; health and biomedical 
research cooperation; and cooperation in the area of studying 
the effects of radiation on people's health and on the 
environment. A memorandum of intentions and cooperation in the 
sphere of export controls is also ready for signing. A joint 
Russian-American statement on the Near East will also be adopted. 
  Galina Sidorova said that the Russian and the U.S. 
Presidents 
will sign the main document -- the Moscow Declaration. They 
will also issue a statement on human rights and a statement on 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. 
  Andrey Kozyrev and Warren Christopher focused especially on 
the examination of the results of the NATO summit meeting in 
Brussels, the range of issues concerning mutual relations with 
Ukraine, and the position of the two sides on the eve of the 
trilateral Russian- American-Ukrainian summit meeting on 14 
January, Galina Sidorova noted. The heads of the Russian and 
U.S. foreign policy departments discussed in detail the problems 
of achieving a settlement in Bosnia. 
  Andrey Kozyrev emphasized in the course of the conversation 
that "approval of the Partnership for Peace program was the key 
result of the NATO session in Brussels." The formula is 
completely to Russia's liking. Andrey Kozyrev stressed: "We 
understand it to mean a broad and equal cooperation among all 
the interested sides."

  [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- After the end of the first 
round of Russian-American summit talks, press secretary of the 
Russian president Vyacheslav Kostikov told journalists that, 
from the point of view of Russia, the meeting is taking place 
"in a new political situation for the first time since the 
adoption of the Russian Constitution." 
  "Russia has joined the club of constitutional democracies, 
and this cannot but influence the talks," Kostikov stressed. 
  "The role played by the great powers in the world will 
steadily grow," he believes. Kostikov reminded that the hope 
for stabilisation in the world, cherished by people quite 
recently, has not come true in a number of regions, speciically, 
Yugoslavia, the transcaucasian region and Latin America. He 
said "the world needs a strong new order, and Russia will play 
the role of a great power in it." 
  Speaking about the content of the first round of talks 
between Yeltsin and Clinton, Kostikov pointed out that "they 
began in an atmosphere of genuine partnership." In his opinion, 
both sides proceed from the assumption that nothing can be done 
in the world without Russia and the United States. 
  Kostikov said that during the first round of talks the sides 
discussed the problem of the correlation of power of the 
president and the parliament. Yeltsin told the U.S. President 
about the situation in the country after the December elections 
in Russia. They also mentioned the recent summit meeting of the 
NATO member states in Brussels. 
  Clinton set forth the main ideas of his "Partnership for 
Peace" initiative. According to Kostikov, the initiative is 
still little known in Russia. "So far it has been an attractive 
formula which should be thought over carefully and thoroughly," 
he said. 
  Kostikov said as well that the problem of a possible 
expansion of NATO was also mentioned during the first round of 
talks. Yeltsin and Clinton stated the need, as well as their 
intention, for promoting the elimination of all dividing lines 
in Europe. The two presidents discussed as well the 
implementation of the agreements, reached at the Tokyo summit 
meeting of the seven main industrially developed countries.

  [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- The second session of the 
Yeltsin-Clinton summit today lasted longer than scheduled - more 
than ninety minutes instead of the appointed 70 minutes. 
  National Security Council Secretary Oleg Lobov, who took 
part 
in the discussions, said the session mainly centered around 
economic cooperation and U.S. assistance to Russian reform, 
including financing and closer contactes with the interantaional 
financial organisations. 
  According to Lobov, Yeltsin spoke in detail about positive 
shifts and stressed that a slackening of pace is out of the 
question. 
  Bill Clinton said the United States is set to render maximum 
support to Russian reform and said his country should extend 
more active support to Russia in the social sphere. 
  Discussions are scheduled to resume on Friday morning after 
the tripartite summit in which Yeltsin, Clinton and Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk will work towards "the historic 
agreement to make the world a safer place with fewer nuclear 
weapons". As Presdient Clinton put it on Thursday morning. 
  Later today, Clinton will join President Yeltsin for private 
dinner in Novo-Ogarevo, the Russian president's dacha.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Vladislav Chernukha; from the "News and </F>
Views" program] 
  [Text] On Thursday [13 January] the Russian-American talks 
at the highest level are to open in Moscow. The United States 
President, Bill Clinton, arrives in Moscow on Wednesday evening. 
What does Moscow expect from the talks between President Boris 
Yeltsin and President Bill Clinton? Vladislav Chernukha, 
accredited to the summit, got the following information at the 
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and this is what he writes: 
  The first official visit of Bill Clinton to Russia, in the 
first instance, should confirm the progress that has been 
achieved in bilateral relations between the two countries in the 
past year. Second, it is expected that concrete ways of tuning 
the relationship between these countries, and also the 
perfecting of the cooperation mechanism and joint actions on the 
international arena will be worked out. 
  It is difficult to conclude that the bilateral relationship 
between Russia and America are developing smoothly, without 
hitches. Naturally, there are complications and problems. But 
at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the view is that the 
most important thing is that both Russia and America are 
embarking on a new stage, a stage of mature relationship and 
mature strategic partnership. 
  The difficulties on the road in these matters are connected, 
first of all, with all those problems of the world that Russia 
and America are called upon to solve. By the way, the problems 
are not only global but (?uncommon), (?for the) developments in 
the world have entered a new stage. Since we run into new 
problems and are meeting new challenges, specific differences in 
approaches do sometimes appear. It is necessary to add that 
these problems and underestimation in certain issues [as heard], 
had led to unnecessary waste of time in the establishment of 
Russian-American partnership. 
  Besides, as two great powers, Russia and America have their 
specific interests that do not always coincide, and this is 
natural. The most important thing is that both countries should 
aim at further development and perfection of their partnership. 
  According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, this will become 
clear and will be elaborated at the impending summit. Taking 
into consideration the fact that both Russia and America are 
powers, potentially great in significance and influence in the 
world, and taking into account how their bilateral relationship 
develops to a great extent to such a level, (?that) development 
in the world is accordingly affected. [sentence as heard] 
  Vladislav Chernukha sought the views of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry about the reported meeting planned for Friday between 
Russia, America, and Ukraine in Moscow, and the expected signing 
of a three-sided document. The Russian Foreign Ministry said 
that the most significant thing about the document was the 
confirmation by Ukraine of its intention to become a nuclear 
free country, and the elimination of all the strategic nuclear 
weapons on its territory and its readiness to join the accord on 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. 
  In the opinion of the Russian Foreign Ministry, this step 
will strengthen security, not only in Europe, but, more 
importantly, in the whole world.

<F P=106> [Vitaliy Portnikov report under the "Stage" rubric with the </F>
general headline: "Russian President Is American President's 
Best Friend. The Importance of Talks To Begin in Moscow Today 
Has Been Enhanced by a Compromise Between Moscow, Washington, 
and Kiev"] 
  [Text] The prolonged discussion of the possibility of a 
Russian-American-Ukrainian rendezvous in Moscow has produced a 
compromise option: the U.S. President makes a brief stopover in 
Kiev's Borispol airport and later -- after the Russian-American 
talks are over -- Leonid Kravchuk arrives in Moscow to join Bill 
Clinton and Boris Yeltsin. Thus, each side can point to the 
tractability of the other two. Anatoliy Adamishin, an 
experienced diplomat, was probably the closest to the truth as 
he described this in a brief interview for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
as a process of trilateral concessions. Let us try, however, to 
see how the trilateral talks may influence the views and images 
of each of the three participants. 
  The United States. After James Baker [as published], who was 
called "the last Union president," Bill Clinton is reaffirming 
America's stabilizing role as the main arbiter among the former 
Soviet republics. Russia's ambitions as a sovereign master of 
the post-Soviet geopolitical space have not been substantiated: 
Moscow will have to share the space with Washington. In 
addition, Clinton has once again demonstrated that it is he, not 
Yeltsin, who is capable of pressuring Kravchuk into making 
concessions -- although Kravchuk depends on Yeltsin much more 
than he does on Clinton. 
  Ukraine. Kravchuk managed to arrange Clinton's arrival in 
Kiev. In exchange, however, Ukraine will still have to give up 
its nuclear arms. But in fact it never really planned to keep 
them. Apparently, Clinton's arrival was the price the Ukrainian 
chiefs may see as sufficient. Not the arrival itself, but its 
consequences as well, that is, joint Russian-American guarantees 
of Ukrainian security, something that will insure Kiev against 
the ambitions of unpredictable Russian politicians, such as 
Zhirinovskiy, should they continue to triumph in the future. 
Ukraine obtains a status that is to a certain extent comparable 
with that of the Baltic states. 
  Russia. Boris Yeltsin managed to demonstrate the role his 
country is playing in the former Soviet Union: Leonid Kravchuk 
and Bill Clinton will negotiate on his territory and he himself 
will be involved in the talks. At the same time, Moscow had to 
move over a little to let Washington into the post-Soviet 
geopolitics. Moscow succeeded in forcing Kiev to give up 
nuclear weapons, though, but it was known in Russia as well as 
in Ukraine that the latter will be unable to keep the weapons 
all the same. 
  Hence, the Russian-American-Ukrainian talks may in the end 
bring about changes in the post-Soviet space that have not been 
expected in Moscow, Washington, or Kiev. For the time being, 
however, each of the three sides is celebrating its expedient 
victory.

<F P=106> [Article by observer Aleksandr Golts: "Russia and United </F>
States: Is Mature Partnership Taking Over from `Breakthroughs'"] 
  [Text] Journalists are well acquainted with the situation: 
The people who prepare the latest summit meeting try to "boost" 
it, to lend it more importance than it actually has. It looks 
as though something like the opposite has happened with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's visit to Russia. On the eve of the 
visit Russian and U.S. representatives warned very frankly that 
no special sensations were to be expected. And this despite the 
fact that the program for the visit envisaged very important 
events. They included the signing of the Russian-U.S. 
declaration containing, informed sources in the Foreign Ministry 
assert, provisions on the nontargeting of the two states' 
strategic forces against each other. They also include the 
sensational meeting with the Ukrainian president's participation. 
  In brief, there were many opportunities for "boosting" the 
visit. But they decided to refrain from doing this. And it was 
not a question of the modesty of diplomats and politicians. In 
my view the point is that U.S.-Russian relations have indeed 
reached a level when they do not need breakthroughs. That is, 
they do not need risky political decisions based on the 
intuition of leaders and the degree of their trust in each 
other. These relations to all appearances have indeed reached a 
stage which can be called, as the documents which have been 
prepared call it, a mature strategic partnership. 
  Some people may say that this is also an attempt to make out 
what is desired as reality. Our countries' positions are too 
different now and their clout in the world is too different. 
That is true, just as it is true that over the past few months 
and weeks each side has had the opportunity to take a realistic 
look at its partner and to rid itself of unjustified hopes. 
Whether they are illusions of the creation of a new world order 
with the United States' undoubted leadership. Or hopes for a 
rapid way out of the crisis in Russia as a result of aid from 
abroad. 
  As a result of this sober assessment the sides concluded 
that 
we need each other. And Washington needs Moscow no less than 
Moscow needs Washington. Take questions of economic 
cooperation, which have become central in bilateral relations. 
On this score you can hear diametrically opposed views. It 
would be wrong to say that the United States is not rendering 
aid to Russia. Approximately $2 billion a year are being 
assigned for this purpose -- more than to any other foreign 
state. Yet after all this aid is simply insignificant if you 
bear in mind the scale of the reforms undertaken in Russia. It 
has now finally become clear to everyone that to implement them 
Moscow needs not credit, still less humanitarian aid. It needs 
honest partnership, whose aim would be to emerge onto the world 
market with its own output, already entirely competitive today, 
be it aluminium or space high technology. The aim of this 
partnership is to ensure conditions for the broad investment of 
private business funds in our economy. 
  But for that to happen it is not enough simply to repeal 
COCOM [the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export 
Controls] or to renounce discriminatory legislation of the cold 
war times. We must start to remove trade and customs barriers. 
Russia also expects the United States to influence those 
international financial institutions which are so far very cool 
toward the need to support our reforms. 
  But does that mean we expect charity from the United 
States? Obviously not. I think the Clinton administration 
realizes that whether Russia remains a democratic, peace-loving 
state depends on the success of the reforms, and it is that 
which will determine whether or not global stability will be 
successfully ensured on our planet or not. After a number of 
painful defeats in foreign policy the U.S. Administration seems 
to have agreed that this global stability is possible only on 
the basis of a new Russian-U.S. partnership. Only by joint 
efforts is it possible to respond to the threats which have now 
appeared in the security field. 
  For instance we must ensure a regime of the nonproliferation 
of nuclear weapons. Here too we cannot fail to mention the 
forthcoming meeting in Moscow between the presidents of Russia, 
the United States, and Ukraine. It is believed that documents 
will be signed which will finally determine Ukraine's movement 
toward nuclear-free status. The voices of skeptics are already 
being heard: It has become the Ukrainian leader's style to 
review agreements that have already been concluded. But one way 
or another it remains a fact that the United States and Russia 
are persistently moving together toward the solution of this 
complex issue. 
  One more confirmation of the level of this cooperation: The 
American "partnership for peace" plan. One cannot fail to see 
that it was born and was adopted primarily with a consideration 
for Russia's legitimate interests in the field of security. It 
is entirely possible that Moscow will announce its participation 
in it. Here Russia sees in partnership for peace not an end in 
itself but one element of the architecture of European security 
that is taking shape. 
  Peacemaking still has to become a notable element of 
cooperation between Russia and the United States. There is not 
yet complete clarity here in approaches, there are different 
views of how to implement the settlement of local conflicts 
particularly in the post-Soviet area. But the fact that the 
question has already been raised of assigning Russian and U.S. 
troop formations to carry out emergency peacekeeping operations 
under the UN mandate says a lot. In general Moscow believes that 
our strategic partnership is a good basis for discussing 
problems of the fundamental restructuring of the entire system 
of international relations. 
  And these are just a few of the problems which are to be 
discussed during the Russian-U.S. meeting. And in addition 
there is a very broad agenda: from agreements on human rights 
to documents on cooperation in eliminating chemical weapons, 
from problems of banning the production of fissionable materials 
for military purposes and banning nuclear materials to the 
coordination of actions in a Near East settlement. 
  It is not simple to earmark the main, key problem and we 
should scarcely do so. I very much liked the working term 
"comprehensive" which is used in our day with regard to 
Clinton's visit. It is not only that during the visit the 
entire complex of bilateral and global problems is being 
discussed. It is also that the importance of each of these 
problems can only be understood in combination with others. And 
only in this way, by assessing what is happening as a package, 
can we reach the conclusion that our states really do need close 
cooperation with each other.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy article: "President Clinton -- the Main </F>
Lobbyist for the Program of Partnership"] 
  [Text] The NATO Council session which approved America's 
"Partnership for Peace" program has just ended, and literally 
the very next day U.S. President Bill Clinton left for state 
visits to countries in Eastern Europe. It is not hard to guess 
that the purpose of his meetings and talks with the leaders of 
the region's states is to explain and publicize as much as 
possible the new NATO initiative. Therefore to some extent 
Clinton may be regarded as the major lobbyist for the idea of 
East-West partnership. 
  The meetings that the U.S. President has already held on 11 
and 12 January with the leaders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, 
Poland, and Hungary -- the countries of the so-called Visegrad 
group -- confirm that idea. During the talks with Czech 
President Vaclav Havel, Clinton stated that although the program 
of partnership does not guarantee the new allies complete 
protection from external aggression it does nevertheless offer 
the possibility even before the end of this year of joining in 
the process of common combat training with the NATO armies and 
of participating in joint exercises. 
  According to information from sources close to the U.S. 
President, the aim of Clinton's meetings with Polish President 
Lech Walesa, Hungarian President Arpad Goncz, and Slovak 
President Michal Kovac is to hold similar talks. 
  The first impromptu action has occurred during Clinton's 
European tour. I am talking about the U.S. President's 
unscheduled brief stopover in Kiev and the talks with Leonid 
Kravchuk. In Kiev, according to White House press service 
spokesmen, the sides are to discuss questions connected with the 
Ukrainian President's final resolve to renounce the strategic 
nuclear weapons deployed on Ukrainian territory and agree to 
their dismantling and shipment to Russia. The U.S. side is 
ready to grant $175 million from the Nunn-Lugar fund to finance 
this action. Ukraine is also being promised its share of the $1 
billion which it is thought will accrue from the sale of 
weapons-grade uranium to the West. 
  Although it is believed in the United States that Ukraine is 
simply obliged to do this -- in order to fulfill its own 
commitments under international treaties -- Washington is ready 
in principle to offer Kiev a number of additional inducements. 
Specifically, there is mention of a figure of around $1.8 
billion to develop (or more accurately to maintain the viability 
of) Ukraine's power industry and achieve at least a minimum 
stabilization of its national currency. For the time being, 
however, all these are just suggestions.

<F P=106> [Aleksey Pushkov article: "Bill Clinton and the `Z Factor'"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. President will be going to Moscow 
immediately after his meeting in Prague with leaders of Poland, 
the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia, with respect to whom 
he did not think it necessary personally to explain the meaning 
of the decision made in Brussels. As is known, it did not quite 
satisfy these countries. The reasons for this lie both in 
foreign and internal politics: The United States has a large 
Polish population. They constitute a powerful political and 
electoral lobby which is closely watching the administration's 
approach to Poland's admission to NATO. It was not accidental 
that on the eve of Clinton's European tour, U.S. Vice President 
Al Gore offered an explanation of U.S. policy in Milwaukee, of 
all places, with its large Polish community. 
  Reading Clinton's speech (the president had to give the text 
of his speech to Gore following the unexpected death of his 
mother), Gore laid special emphasis on the fact that the 
Partnership for Peace is a real step toward the admission of 
Poland and other East European countries to full NATO 
membership. This argument presumably became the main one in the 
course of Clinton's meetings with the East European leaders in 
Prague. 
  In Moscow, on the other hand, it would be most logical for 
Clinton to present the "second face" of NATO's two-faceted 
initiative and insist that the United States has fully taken 
Russia's interests into account and has sought to avoid such 
decisions that might be perceived as attempted geopolitical 
isolation. Incidentally, there is a considerable grain of truth 
in this: It was the U.S. Administration that initiated the idea 
of partnership, having been confronted with an extremely 
complicated problem of simultaneously taking into account the 
interests of East Europe and Russia and also its own interests 
and the interests of its bloc allies as well as NATO's real 
capabilities. The authors of the idea are apparently General 
John Shalikashvili, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and 
Strobe Talbott, until recently in charge of the entire Russian 
policy in the U.S. State Department, who was then appointed 
first deputy to Secretary of State Christopher. 
  The Clinton administration should be given its due: In a 
fairly complex and extremely conflicting situation it has chosen 
apparently the sole correct option. It was also dictated by the 
fact that politically Bill Clinton is almost inseparably linked 
to Boris Yeltsin and his fate. Up to now Russia's relatively 
successful advance down the path of democratic development has 
been seen as one of the major success stories for the 
administration -- which, incidentally, have been few and far 
between on the foreign political scene. Clinton has invested 
such political capital in Boris Yeltsin that should Yeltsin 
collapse, Clinton will suffer a colossal defeat. Along with the 
failures in Somalia and Bosnia, this could drastically undermine 
the positions and authority of his administration not only in 
international affairs but in America itself. 
  Already now Clinton's unqualified support for President 
Yeltsin is drawing sharp criticism in the United States, which 
is rising as the situation in Russia destabilizes. Therefore it 
is not ruled out that as a result of the trip the 
administration's line will be adjusted somewhat. Prior to the 
visit the White House announced that the president intends to 
meet with representatives of broad political forces, including 
communists but excluding Zhirinovskiy. Strobe Talbott also made 
it clear that the administration intends to expand contacts with 
representatives of the democratic opposition and stop focusing 
on Yeltsin alone. 
  Meanwhile the "Z factor," as Western journalists have dubbed 
Zhirinovskiy, is turning for Clinton into a perennial headache 
and a major element in political decisionmaking. Practically 
the entire U.S. press is talking about the revival of imperial 
nationalism in Russia, finding confirmation for this even in 
deeds and statements by Yeltsin and Kozyrev. Clinton is being 
called upon to do away with the legacy of Yalta, that is to say, 
with consideration for Russian interests with respect to Eastern 
Europe. The intensity of debate in the United States in fairly 
high. Moreover, there is no unity within the administration 
itself: According to some reports, even prior to Zhirinovskiy's 
victory Secretary of State Christopher spoke in favor of the 
NATO Council session in Brussels giving a clearer signal to the 
East Europeans that they would soon be admitted to NATO. 
  Thus, Russian-American relations are again being subjected 
to 
a very serious test of durability, when the public background in 
the West in clearly unfavorable for Russia. Will Clinton manage 
to find that solely correct note that will allow him to avoid 
the traps and dangers involved in supporting such a leader as 
Boris Yeltsin and at the same time preserve the existing capital 
of relations and links? For the U.S. side it will apparently be 
especially important to avoid a fundamental and at the same time 
fairly probable mistake -- to take Russia's aspiration to 
maintain its legitimate national interests for the consequence 
of a sharp strengthening in the positions of Zhirinovskiy and 
hard-line forces. Such a temptation in the United States and 
the West as a whole today is extremely great. Yet there can be 
no better aid to Zhirinovskiy and company than to deny Russia's 
right to its own policy and its own national priorities.

  [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS -- "No doubt, the visit of 
U.S. President Bill Clinton to Russia will strengthen political 
interaction between the two countries. One would like to hope 
it would also promote technical and economic cooperation", 
Vladimir Shcherbakov, president of the International Foundation 
for Assisting Privatisation and Foreign Investment, told 
ITAR-TASS. "It is wrong when potential of the two countries is 
used to one tenth of a per cent". 
  Shcherbakov expressed perplexity that COCOM restrictions on 
the granting of new technologies to Russia have not yet been 
lifted. "It is not easy for Russia to receive technologically 
perfect products from the United States. Russia needs such 
products for economic development, for market development. U.S. 
companies do not use sufficiently vast opportunities for 
investment in Russia that brings mutual advantage". 
  Shcherbakov said that his foundation and the Lemont Brothers 
firm secured a tender for a feasibility study for the 
development of the Moscow aviation junction. Considerable 
advantage is promised by a private telecommunications network in 
Russia that is being created by joint effort of the foundation 
and the U.S. Andrew company. 
  Shcherbakov said there are plans for joint utilisation of 
missile silos jointly with several U.S. companies. Large amount 
of equipment, valuable metals and materials remain during the 
elimination of strategic missiles in silos. All this will be 
extracted and used. 
  U.S. firms are offered to participate in the implementation 
of the Russian programme for the utilisation of radioactive 
waste from submarines that completed their service. "This 
problem is encountered by Russia and the United States and form 
the point of view of ecology by the whole world", he said. 
"Russian scientists are far advanced in the working out of the 
technology for the utilisation of radioactive waste. It is now 
for the Russian and U.S. Governments to finance the works", he 
said.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Platkovskiy: "Russia Suffering First </F>
Losses in Uranium War With United States"] 
  [Text] Thousands of tonnes of Russian uranium are ready 
for dispatch to the United States, but the opponents of the 
multimillion deal are trying to thwart it. 
  Our exporters lost at least $200 million last year because 
of 
tough restrictions on the export of Russian uranium to the 
United States. A number of U.S. uranium extracting enterprises, 
supported by the Department of Commerce, have accused Russia of 
dumping and virtually forced the signing of a discriminatory 
agreement whose terms reduced to a minimum the sale of natural 
and slightly enriched uranium on the U.S. market. 
  Our experts believe that this is only the first eruption of 
the trade war between the two largest producers of this output. 
It looks as though Russia has little chance of victory despite 
the fact that it may gain some indulgences in the next few days 
for the import of its uranium to the United States. 
  In late January the agreement initialed during U.S. Vice 
President Albert Gore's visit to Moscow should enter into force. 
Russia will be able to dispatch to the U.S. market up to 3,000 
tonnes of natural uranium and 1,000 tonnes of slightly enriched 
uranium. It will be used as fuel for U.S. nuclear electric 
power stations. Supplies to a total sum of $200 million are 
planned for two years. In the opinion of THE WALL STREET 
JOURNAL the agreement pursues a purely political aim -- helping 
Russia financially. 
  But Russian exporters expect that the opponents of the 
uranium contract will be able to block it. IZVESTIYA was told 
by Aleksey Grigoryev, director of the Russian "Uranservis" firm, 
who has had gruelling talks on the subject for two years, that 
the Americans are prepared to stand to the death to bar Russian 
competitors from their market. The head of our firm is very 
skeptical about the indulgences which we have now managed to 
achieve. The new agreement, in his opinion, is still 
discriminatory. The United States will buy from Russia just as 
much uranium as U.S. producers can sell of this energy carrier 
on the domestic market. The "linkage" principle makes talk on 
free trade an empty sound, Aleksey Grigoryev believes. 
  The "Uranservis" director said it was unfair to accuse 
Russia 
of dumping. He said that our raw material has never been sold 
in the United States at prices below prime cost. But the U.S. 
Department of Commerce, which spent a year carrying out an 
antidumping study, has refused to recognize the Russian side's 
information as authentic, on the grounds that it comes from a 
country with a nonmarket economy. 
  The uranium extracting sector remains a top secret one in 
Russia and U.S. experts believe that the labor of prisoners is 
still used at the mines. That is how the low cost of mining is 
ensured. 
  The "Uranservis" director does not have information about 
the 
annual extraction volume of this strategic raw material but he 
announced that stocks in Russia are sufficient for many years. 
Storehouses have been full since 1989 when the sector stopped 
working for defense needs, Aleksey Grigoryev said. 
  According to unconfirmed Western assessments total stocks of 
enriched uranium alone in Russia are 50-70 percent more than the 
total stocks of all other countries. With this resource Russia 
has nonetheless been deprived of selling even a small proportion 
because of tough competition, primarily from the United States 
which, according to THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, controls half the 
world market in uranium products. Russia controls only 5 
percent.

<F P=106> ["Article Received Through RIA-Novosti Exclusively for </F>
ADEVARUL" by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev: "Russia and NATO"] 
  [Text] The tendency to establish a democratic Europe as a 
whole is being thwarted by the tendency to break it up and the 
appearance of new threats and dangers. Which of these 
tendencies is going to prevail? This greatly depends on the 
decisions that will be adopted in Brussels and by the CSCE in 
Budapest. 
  Toward what goals should the general security system that is 
going to be established be directed? What criteria are to be 
used to establish this system? What possible ways are there for 
this system to come about? 
  One cannot say that there is a crisis of solutions -- 
apparently with "only one way" that is effective -- to European 
security issues. These solutions are based on two myths that 
are believed by their supporters as being axioms of current 
European policy. First, we talk about the thesis that there is 
a "security vacuum" and a "gray zone" in Central Europe, which 
is condemned inevitably to become Russia's sphere of expansion. 
And second, we talk about the thesis of "Russia's move toward a 
nationalistic, imperialist policy" after the recent 
parliamentary elections. 
  By putting the two affirmations together, one can conclude 
that NATO must defend Central European countries from the 
imminent pressure coming from the East. 
  To accept the thesis of the "security vacuum" would mean to 
reject precisely the essence of the general European process, 
the way in which it is described in the Paris Charter, namely 
the unity of democratic peoples in Europe. This would be the 
greatest failure of the orientation of the entire European 
policy, which, apparently, in spite of unavoidable difficulties, 
brought about the unification of Germany and ensured the 
destruction of the totalitarian monsters of the 20th century. 
  If we consider the worst-case scenario -- the revival of 
Russian imperialism -- then we should start, not from the 
hypothesis of "Soviet tanks" pouring into the West, but from a 
replay of the Yugoslav drama in the former USSR. The result 
would be tens of millions of refugees, catastrophe in great 
industrial complexes, and the danger posed by the use of 
tactical nuclear weapons. What will NATO be able to do in such 
a situation to defend its Eastern members? Two Chernobyls would 
be more than enough for all of Europe. The "guard on the 
[River] Bug" would not be able to save anybody. 
  Among other things, this scenario -- the worst possible -- 
might be provoked precisely by a hasty expansion of NATO. It 
would serve the extremists in Russia as the most convincing 
argument in favor of a revival of the Russian empire to reject 
the "pressure of the West." Thus, the strategy of "the most 
evil scenario" is dangerous because it carries in itself a 
forecast that can very easily become reality. 
  The fear of a new "Russian threat" can be eliminated first 
of 
all through a partnership with democratic Russia, which has 
embarked on a path of establishing a rule-of-law state and a 
market economy. The foreign policy promoted by Russia's 
president has already proved its orientation toward achieving 
the national interest of the country through partnership and not 
through confrontation with the surrounding world. This foreign 
policy is sanctioned in a democratic Constitution. Russia does 
not have territorial claims on any country in the word, and thus 
no claims on Central or Eastern European countries either. 
Russia's new military doctrine directs its armed forces 
exclusively toward defending the country and its allies and 
toward peace operations in accordance with Russia's 
international engagements. 
  As far as the results of the parliamentary elections are 
concerned, I am convinced that there can be no fertile ground 
for any real fascist outbursts in Russia, a country that in 
World War II took more sacrifices than any other country in the 
world to the shrine of the victory over fascism. The electorate 
cast their votes not for a "campaign against the West" or "to 
set out for the South Seas" and not for the forced restoration 
of the Soviet Union or of the socialist camp. They voted 
against the ambitions and arrogance of certain reformers, 
against their lack of ability to explain to the people the goal 
of reform in simple, human language, and against the current 
lack of social protection for the population and the inadequacy 
of the fight against crime. The Russian democrats have already 
started to draw the necessary conclusions from the awakening 
lessons administered to them by the parliamentary elections. 
But there is not and will never be any "flirtation" with 
right-wing extremism. We condemn all overt or covert forms of 
extremism, aggressive nationalism, and fascism. 
  The West in turn must also draw conclusions and correct the 
tone and the manner of its dialogue with Russia. Advice and 
recommendations have no room in this dialogue. The partner 
starts off on the wrong foot by presenting certain proposals 
that we must either adopt entirely or reject entirely, without 
the right to make certain adjustments to it, in accordance with 
our own interests. 
  Now is the time when Russia should feel more strongly 
foreign support for its reform process. An accurately worked 
out, detailed strategy of cooperation between Russia and its 
democratic allies in the West is required now. We need new 
strategic schemes and mechanisms to implement them that would 
thoroughly reflect the current degree of maturity in our 
relations. And most important: One should proceed from promises 
of large scale cooperation made to Russia in Tokyo to the 
fulfillment of those promises. 
  In the process of establishing a new architecture of Europe 
it is important to take into account a number of criteria, such 
as: 
  -- a balanced approach, in subsequent stages to the European 
security system. The methods of "shock diplomacy" and the 
policy of the "fait accompli" should be excluded. The Russian 
side is in favor of broad consultations with all the interested 
states. 
  -- the open nature of regional organizations and 
institutions 
as a guarantee of their appropriate adaptation to the current 
European realities. Russia has no right to dictate who should 
and who should not join NATO, but we have the right to count on 
the fact that the North Atlantic Alliance will take into account 
the particularities of the transition period, which is 
inevitably a long-term process. And if we were to talk about a 
longer term process, it should confirm the position included in 
the documents through which NATO declares itself open to accept 
all democratic states in the Euro- Atlantic region. One should 
not exclude a priori that in the future Russia will also request 
to be accepted into NATO. It is important to ensure an 
effective partnership, based on equal rights in the period of 
transition and of mutual adaptation. 
  -- ensuring an equal level of security for each European 
state. The emergence of "first degree security and second degree 
security," of "gray zones," of "special spheres of influence," 
of "isolated regions," or of "cordons sanitaires" in Europe are 
inadmissible. 
  -- the preservation of a contract-juridical base for 
European 
security. 
  -- the elimination of territorial claims in interstate 
relations in Europe. 
  The major goals of the strategy of partnership that we are 
proposing in the political sphere and in the area of security 
must be the following: 
  -- first: to develop Euro-Atlantic cooperation. The CSCE 
should be turned into a political organization for all the 
regions (a general regional organization), and the North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council into an organization of independent 
political and military cooperation, but closely connected with 
the CSCE. Their goal should be to coordinate the efforts of 
NATO, the Western European Union, and the CIS on international 
security, achieving peace, and ensuring the active defense of 
the European ethnic minorities' rights to their language and 
other rights. I believe that a great step in this respect would 
be to adopt at the Rome session of the CSCE a declaration on 
fighting aggressive nationalism. 
  -- second: to create a system of mutual guarantees for the 
security of Central and Eastern European countries. The 
stronger interstate relations are, the more durable the nature 
of their relations will be. 
  -- third: I welcome the proposal of my German colleague 
Kinkel to conclude certain conventions of cooperation and 
consultation between NATO on the one hand and Central and 
Eastern European countries, Russia, and Ukraine on the other. 
The opening of a NATO- CIS communications channel would also be 
useful. 
  -- fourth: to increase the capacity of European countries to 
ensure peace. For the time being, we should say it openly, East 
and West have not found a common way to respond to local 
conflicts in Yugoslavia or the former USSR, although meanwhile 
these conflicts have become a great problem for European 
security. 
  -- fifth: to ensure the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons 
in Europe. It is not correct to present the Russian-Ukrainian 
dispute around the issue of strategic missiles as an episode in 
the process of dividing the Soviet inheritance. Here we are 
talking about ways to prevent the creation of a breach in the 
regime of nuclear nonproliferation. The strategy of European 
partnership should foresee strong encouragement for the strict 
observance of the accord on nonproliferation of nuclear weapon. 
  Certainly, separate discussions are required by the economic 
component of the partnership and the essence of those 
discussions would be to move from the stage of certain 
chronically delayed programs to moves to include Russia in the 
international division of labor on an equal basis and without 
discrimination, and to facilitate its access to European markets. 
  The dialogue on the issue of partnership for Europe is 
already actively developing. I hope that the NATO summit, 
through its balanced and farsighted decisions, will mark a 
useful contribution to the development of this dialogue. The 
members of the North Atlantic Alliance can find in Russia an 
interesting and responsible partner for drafting this strategy.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Bogachev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS -- It seems that strong 
emotions expressed by some politicians from East-European 
countries and the Baltic states demanding to immediately admit 
them into the North Atlantic military alliance have failed to 
shatter the position earlier assumed by the NATO member-states. 
  Documents pertaining to the "Partnership for Peace" 
programme 
signed by the heads of state and government of the NATO 
member-states in Brussels on January 10 confirm provisions of 
the 1949 Washington Treaty to the effect that NATO remains open 
for other European states to join it. Participants in the 
session of the North Atlantic alliance reiterated that the 
expansion of the NATO to the east will be carried out on the 
basis of an evolutional process and that countries claiming NATO 
membership must first prove their capacity to "contribute to 
ensuring security of the North Atlantic region." 
  The documents neither set any term for admitting new members 
into the alliance, nor name probable candidates. 
  On the eve of the Brussels summit the U.S. president's aide 
for National Security Anthony Lake declared that hasty admission 
of new member-states into the alliance might lead to the 
destabilisation of the situation in the European region, which 
meets neither NATO's interests nor the interests of the states 
of Central and Eastern Europe. 
  The U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher expressed the 
opinion that none of the NATO member-states considers new 
applicants to be prepared for membership in the alliance. 
  It seems that both the United States and other NATO 
member-states are interested in maintaining existing tendencies 
in countries, which formerly belonged to the Warsaw Treaty 
Organisation, as well as Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic 
states, and seek to fortify the current situation by military 
and political measures. However, participants in the Brussels 
summit realise that the immediate admission of new members into 
the alliance will cause a negative response in Russia, since in 
the long run, military alliances are usually targeted against 
some state or a bloc of states. 
  The immediate admission of former Warsaw Treaty 
member-states, with Russia being left out, might be seen as a 
discriminatory and unfriendly step against the Russian 
Federation. Such developments are not likely to strengthen 
stability in Europe or democratic processes in Russia. 
  "Partnership for Peace" adopted at the NATO session in 
Brussels is, perhaps, the best option of resolving uneasy 
problems of the European security. This programme envisages a 
number of measures of a military and political character for 
ensuring security of the programme participants and maintaining 
stability in the European region. These measures include joint 
military operations with NATO member-states, joint planning and 
joint military exercises, and envisage consultations with NATO 
by any member-state of the "partnership" if it decides that it 
is being threatened.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read commentary by Yuriy Solton] </F>
  [Excerpts] In this commentary, Yuriy Solton examines the 
results of the NATO Council session at summit level, which 
concluded its work in Brussels this Tuesday [11 January]. 
  The NATO countries' leaders have outlined the landmarks of 
the new strategy. Of course, not all their plans can be 
adopted, but the intention to continue the East-West dialogue 
and to develop further cooperation with the East European 
countries to strengthen European security, should be appraised 
as a positive initiative. It can be noted with satisfaction 
that the Brussels declaration supports economic and political 
reforms in Russia. The declaration emphasizes that the Russian 
leaders' firm intention to follow the course of democratic 
reforms, is extremely important in maintaining stability and 
security in Europe. [passage omitted] 
  The NATO leaders' apprehension about the appearance in 
Europe 
of hotbeds of instability and armed conflicts is understandable. 
The most classic example is former Yugoslavia, especially the 
war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, that has now been raging for the past 
two years. 
  The heads of state and government of NATO are right in 
concluding that the war in Yugoslavia can only be resolved 
through peaceful means. Their readiness to assist the peace 
process in Yugoslavia can only be welcomed. But it seems to me 
that it is hardly advisable nor perhaps appropriate to issue 
military threats. 
  In Brussels, it was announced that NATO was ready to use air 
strikes in Bosnia, even though it's true that this would only be 
done with the corresponding decision and control by the Security 
Council of the United Nations. 
  Here, I share the opinion of the leader of the Bosnian 
Serbs, 
Radovan Karadzic, who said that the NATO threats were 
unproductive and that they would only complicate the situation 
at a time when hope for signing a peace agreement on the Bosnian 
issue still existed. 
  Other decisions concerning the rejuvenation of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization were taken in Brussels. As a 
whole, the impression is created that the NATO leaders are 
waking up to the conviction that it is necessary to establish 
such a system of common European security that will prevent a 
return to a Europe of political blocs.

<F P=106> [Sergey Sidorov report: "Where `Humanitarian' Bombings Will </F>
Lead"] 
  [Text] NATO countries' heads of state and government would 
be better off leaving the topic of the war in the former 
Yugoslavia, and in Bosnia and Herzegovina in particular, well 
alone. Once again the North Atlantic alliance has demonstrated 
its powerlessness and internal discord over this problem. This 
is how a Berlin newspaper evaluated the results of the NATO 
Council emergency session. 
  On the other hand, a number of French and British mass media 
sources believe the time is ripe for more resolute action by the 
bloc. The "France-3" television company and THE DAILY 
TELEGRAPH, for instance, reported with reference to Western 
officials that air strikes against targets in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina will in fact be carried out over the next few days. 
Mention is made in particular of the allegedly blockaded 
humanitarian route into Srebrenica and the Serb positions around 
Sarajevo. 
  So what has actually happened? Has the North Atlantic bloc 
really made direct moves toward open military intervention in 
Bosnia? Naturally, there is no direct reference to air strikes 
or the decision taken in the concluding document of the NATO 
Council session. The NATO partners merely confirmed their 
"readiness to participate in launching air strikes in the event 
of continued gunfire by Sarajevo and attacks on servicemen from 
UN forces." At the same time, important changes have occurred 
in the approaches to the decision on the use of air power. 
Whereas previously the main ringleader militating for the use 
of air power was the United States, while France and Britain 
expressed opposition, believing that were this to happen their 
"blue helmets" would become targets for partisans, now both 
Paris and London favor strikes from the air. As for the United 
States, Washington seems to have swapped roles with its allies. 
Commenting on the outcome of the session, President Clinton 
noted cautiously that "NATO could be embarking on a very risky 
path." 
  Most experts are inclined to assess the declaration on the 
readiness to carry out bombings as pressure tactics on the 
Bosnian sides prior to the new round of talks to be held in a 
week's time. That is, it is basically a matter of a peculiar 
military-diplomatic game. However, there is in this game a 
highly important factor which often remains outside observers' 
field of vision. 
  Military figures like General Jean Cot, commander of the 
French "blue helmets" contingent, often get carried away with 
purely military logic. Let us recall the general's highly 
debatable conviction that "only force will stop the war in the 
Balkans." Civilian officials from the UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] in their turn suggest that direct military action 
will signify an end to humanitarian operations and hopes of a 
peaceful settlement. The conflict between General J. Cot and 
Cedric Thornberry, leader of the civilian mission, escalated a 
short while ago and led to the latter's recent resignation. It 
is J. Cot who has repeatedly submitted the issue of deploying 
air power for discussion at UNPROFOR headquarters, striving to 
attain the right to take a decision on this autonomously. The 
chaos which would arise if this right were used even once is 
obvious even to the uninitiated. UNPROFOR would then appear to 
the warring parties not as neutral but as a warring side, an 
ally for some and an enemy for others. The line between bombing 
raids "for the purpose of facilitating humanitarian operations" 
and air strikes aimed at weakening the potential of one or other 
side is too fine.

  [Text] Talk about Kiev's debts to Russia for fuel supplies, 
which, according to experts, surpass one trillion rubles, being 
covered as compensation for the nuclear arms to be withdrawn 
from Ukraine is out of the question, a high-ranking member of 
Russia's Foreign Ministry told Interfax. 
  As he said, Ukraine's pledge to remove nuclear weapons from 
its soil and Russia's willingness to pay "an appropriate" 
compensation will be stipulated at Friday's meeting between the 
presidents of Russia, Ukraine and the U.S.A. in Moscow. "The 
size of such a compensation is yet to be fixed. Groups of 
experts will deal with this," he noted. 
  When determining the size of compensation the experts will 
take into account fuel supplies for Ukrainian nuclear-power 
plants from Russia. "Participants in the trilateral Russian- 
Ukrainian-American consultations conducted in Washington worked 
out a plan, under which the nuclear arms withdrawn from Ukraine 
to Russia would be dismantled and their highly concentrated 
uranium be deconcentrated to serve as fuel for nuclear-power 
plants. This fuel will be partly left in Russia for its own 
needs, partly supplied to Ukraine, and partly sold to the 
Americans," he said. 
  According to the diplomat, the question of writing off some 
of Ukraine's debts to Russia may arise only if the cost of the 
fuel for nuclear-power plants Ukraine will get from Russia 
proves to be lower than the value of the enriched uranium from 
the nuclear arms to be withdrawn from Ukraine to Russia. "The 
possible "difference" is not likely to be great, since the price 
of the fuel will include the cost of transporting the nuclear 
arms, storing, dismantling and deconcentrating them. These 
complicated operations cost a lot of money," he concluded.

  [Text] Russia's Gasprom, the leading gas producer in the 
CIS, "will never, nor will the Russian Government agree to 
compensate the cost of nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine by 
writing off the Ukrainian debt for fuel, especially gas imports 
from Russia," a senior company official told Interfax. He was 
commenting on the prospects of such a deal being struck during 
the a forthcoming summit in Moscow between the Presidents of 
Russia, the U.S. and Ukraine. 
  In his words, though the company has vested interests in 
Ukraine, these have nothing to do with the dismantling of 
nuclear weapons. More importantly, said the official, Gasprom is 
not a state but stock company and that is why all crucial issues 
linked to its financial standing are subject to discussion by 
its shareholders. 
  Kiev's debt for gas imports from Russia runs at more than 
Rbs 
1 Tn, about a third of its total debt to Moscow. But it owes 
only Rbs 30 Bn for oil imports. 
  However, one other company official in an interview with 
Interfax did not rule out the possibility of a gas-for-weapons 
swap following "a decision on the highest level." In this case, 
he said, the government will have to compensate Gasprom for 
financial losses which is very problematic given that it has no 
such money. The official says a mere write-off of Kiev's debt 
without compensation to Gasprom will cause anger in Russia's gas 
producing regions and result in "several Nadyms". 
  The country's large gas producing region of Nadym was almost 
brought to a standstill at the end of last year after local 
workers went on strike because of not being paid wages for 
several months due to defaults by Gasprom customers.

  [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev is scheduled to visit China at the end of 
January, according to Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday Panov underlined 
that, after the Russian president's historic "break-through" 
visit to Beijing, Russia is now engaging in a wide, dynamic 
range of cooperation with China both on the international scene 
and in their bilateral relations. Panov said China is a high 
priority in Russia's foreign policy. 
  The deputy minister reported that Kozyrev's visit will 
include preparations for a return visit to Moscow by the Chinese 
chairman. 
  Panov thinks that the fact that Russia's new year is 
beginning with visits by the American President to Moscow and 
then the Russian foreign minister to Beijing is symbolic. 
Although these delegations are in different "weight 
categories", the two visits will maintain equilibrium in 
Russia's foreign policy, which is directed to the east as much 
as it is to the west.

  [Text] Moscow, Jan. 12 (YONHAP) -- A foreign press report 
Wednesday [12 January] that Russia has signed a contract to sell 
four fox-trot class submarines to North Korea is "nearly 
accurate," a Western military source said. 
  The TOKYO SHIMBUN reported that North Korea had signed a 
contract with the Russian Far East-Pacific fleet headquarters to 
buy four fox-trot submarines in the Vladivostok naval yard. 
  The source said that a North Korean naval delegation visited 
the naval headquarters in Vladivostok last September. Another 
North Korean high-level naval delegation secretly visited Moscow 
in November, apparently in connection with the submarine 
purchase. 
  The source said he believes that the Russian Far 
East-Pacific 
fleet has recommended sale of the submarines to naval 
headquarters in Moscow. 
  The fox-trot class submarine is generally classified as an 
attack vessel and therefore, if Russia proceeds with the sale, 
Moscow will be reneging on its promise to South Korea that it 
would not offer any offensive weapons to North Korea, the source 
said. 
  President Boris Yeltsin, during his visit to South Korea in 
December 1992, had affirmed that Russia would never supply 
offensive weapons to North Korea. 
  North Korea was understood to have explained to Russia that 
it planned to buy the submarines and disassemble them to use 
scrap iron. But since the submarines are still in usuable 
shape, the North Korean explanation is unconvincing, the source 
said. 
  The price of the submarines and other conditions of the 
sales 
contract are being kept secret, he said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>
  [Text] Riga January 12 TASS -- The Russian delegation is 
satisfied with the constructive tone of the talks going on in 
Latvia on the withdrawal of Russian troops from that republic, 
according to delegation head Sergey Zotov. 
  The latest round of talks began on Tuesday [11 January] in 
Riga, one day later than originally planned. The delay was due 
to a provocation undertaken against representatives of the 
Russian Army and embassy in Latvia. The Russian delegation 
agreed to sit down to talk again after the Latvian leadership 
apologised and took the appropriate steps against the 
provacateurs. 
  Zotov called the event "an attempt not only to break up the 
negotiations, but a sort of rehearsal for the seizure of Russian 
military sites". Because of this, the Russian delegation is 
insisting on military status for the radar station in Skrunda, 
not the civil status that the Latvian side proposes. The 
Russians want to keep the station for another five years, while 
the Latvians think three years are enough. 
  Zotov did not name the concrete sum of money which Latvia 
expects in return for allowing the Russians to continue using 
the radar. He said the Latvian-proposed amount was considered 
by the Russians as a joke. 
  Overall, Zotov mentioned, "our positions are getting closer 
on key points. We are counting on drafting an agreement on the 
radar by the end of the next session, as long as the political 
will is there". The last day of the talks has not yet been 
determined.

  [Text] A briefing on the current foreign policy issues and, 
in particular, on the program of U.S. President Clinton's visit 
to Moscow, was held for Russian and foreign journalists at the 
Russian Federation Foreign Ministry Press Center today. 
  Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry 
Press and Information Department had this to say on this issue: 
  [Begin Karasin recording] The U.S. President, accompanied by 
his spouse, will arrive in Moscow late this evening. 
  On 13 January, and following the official ceremony of the 
Russian Federation president welcoming the U.S. President, 
Russian-U.S. talks will take place with only a few officials 
present and subsequently more officials will join in. 
  In the second half of the day it is planned that the U.S. 
President will meet Aleksiy, patriarch of Moscow and all the 
Russias, in St. Daniil's Monastery. In the evening there will 
be a cocktail party for Russian public and business circles. 
This will be followed by an unofficial and private dinner given 
by Boris Yeltsin. 
  On 14 January, the second working day of the visit, 
following 
the wreath-laying ceremony at the Unknown Soldier's Tomb, the 
Russian-U.S. talks will continue with delegation members 
present. A trilateral meeting is planned between the Russian, 
U.S., and Ukrainian leaders. Documents are to be signed, too. 
  Then joint Russian-U.S. documents will be signed. The 
Russian and U.S. Presidents will hold a joint news conference. 
In the second half of the day the U.S. President will appear at 
the Ostankino TV concert studio, and the Russian Federation 
President and Mrs. Yeltsin will then give an official dinner in 
honor of the U.S. president and his spouse. 
  On 15 January, following a meeting between the U.S. 
President 
and U.S. embassy staff in Moscow, an official ceremony of 
farewell will take place in St. George's hall of the Great 
Kremlin Palace. 
  It is expected that the following bilateral documents will 
be 
signed in the course of the visit: The presidents of both 
countries will sign the Moscow Declaration -- the main political 
document concerning the results of the summit meeting. It is 
expected that joint statements on human rights and on the 
problems of nonproliferation will be adopted on behalf of both 
presidents. 
  The Russian foreign minister and the U.S. secretary of state 
will sign an air traffic agreement between Russia and the United 
States, and an agreement on cooperation in the area of health 
protection and bio-medical research. 
  A joint statement on export controls, a joint statement on 
the Near East, and a joint statement on the issues of 
eliminating chemical weapons are being adopted on behalf of the 
Russian foreign minister and the U.S. secretary of state. 
  Interdepartmental accords will be signed within the 
framework 
of the summit. Among them are: An agreement on cooperation in 
the area of studying the effects of radiation on people's health 
and the environment, a package of documents dealing with the 
implementation of the second stage of the Minsk 1989 memorandum, 
and an executive contract on sale of low grade uranium. 
  So, this is the main, the chief preliminary outline as it is 
now, on the first day of the U.S. President's official visit to 
our capital. [end recording]

  [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS -- Russia welcomes the 
renewal of negotiations in Egypt between delegations from Israel 
and the Palestinian Liberation Organization. Russia is hoping 
for the successful outcome of the talks, which concern an 
agreement on the Gaza Strip and Jericho, according to Grigoriy 
Karasin, the director of the information and press department of 
the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, speaking in the 
ministry's press centre. 
  Karasin expressed his regret about several interruptions in 
the Israeli-PLO talks on specific measures to implement their 
declaration on principles, signed in September of 1993. 
  "In our contacts with both Israeli and Palestinian 
representatives we always point out to them the necessity of 
concentrating maximum constructive effort and good will on 
overcoming differences and following the spirit and the letter 
of the September agreements", the Russian representative stated.

  [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS -- "The Partnership for 
Peace" plan approved by NATO leaders at the recent meeting in 
Brussels will be "attentively studied" in Russia with the focus 
laid on boosting relations with NATO, Russian Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Grigory Karasin told a briefing on Wednesday. 
  He added that the plan is an alternative to the expansion of 
NATO which East European nations want to join. "An approach has 
been selected which is oriented towards the development of 
partnership relations and practical cooperation with all 
European CSCE member-states, including in the East of the 
continent, and which provides equal possibilities for all 
potential partners," Karasin said. 
  Russia plans to hold a detailed exchange of opinions with 
all 
European states on the results of the NATO meeting in Brussels 
in order "to determine the optimal ways of maintaining a truly 
pan-European cooperation in the field of stability and 
security," according to the spokesman who added that prospects 
of such cooperation will be discused during the Russian-U.S. 
summit. 
  Karasin however explained that "the Russian-U.S. dialogue on 
the issue has nothing in common with any separate agreements 
between the two powers." This is only a search for such 
instruments of strengthening the European stability which would 
reliably guarantee the interests of all European states without 
exclusions, regardless of their size, georgraphic situation, 
economic or military potential."

  [Text] Vladikazkaz, 12 Jan -- "The Federation Council, 
consisting mainly of the leaders of executive organs of power in 
Russia's republics, krays, and oblasts, must learn from the sad 
experience of the working of the former Russian Congress of 
People's Deputies and prevent confrontation with the president's 
staff and the government," an ITAR-TASS correspondent was told 
today by Akhsarbek Galazov, head of the Republic of North 
Ossetia, on his return from the first sitting in Moscow of 
Russia's new parliament. 
  Galazov thinks that the Federation Council will accomplish 
its historic role if it resolves the artificially created 
problems associated with the confrontation of the regions. "It 
is the republics that form the basis for Russian federalism and 
reducing them to the level of the other components of Russia may 
lead to an intensification of separatist sentiment and the 
disintegration of the Russian Federation," the head of North 
Ossetia declared.

<F P=106> [Sergey Snopkov report under the "North Ossetia" rubric: </F>
"Dzasokhov's Initiative"] 
  [Text] The elections for president of North Ossetia will 
take place on 16 January. The election race has shown that the 
voters' preferences will depend on how convincing a presidential 
candidate's plan is on the two main problems: the conflict with 
Ingushetia and a political status for South Ossetia acceptable 
for the northerners. 
  There are six presidential candidates in the race today. 
They are Akhsarbek Galazov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of 
North Ossetia; Prime Minister Sergey Khetagurov; Taymuraz 
Batagov, the deputy internal affairs minister; Ilya Bekmurazov, 
chief of the republic's tax inspectorate; Mukharbek Kisiyev, 
chairman of the Pension Fund; and Georgiy Kodzayev, rector of 
the Highlands Agricultural Academy. Akhsarbek Galazov and 
Sergey Khetagurov stand better chances. True, Galazov's rating 
dropped somewhat in the wake of Boris Yeltsin's visit to the 
Northern Caucasus. He is being accused of a compromise approach 
to the Ingush-Ossetia problem. Galazov's opponents try to blame 
him for President Yeltsin's edict, which rescinded the local 
parliament's decision on the impossibility of Ossetians and 
Ingushi living together and caused an explosion of 
dissatisfaction in Ossetia. At the same time, Akhsarbek Galazov 
secured 138,000 votes in the elections for the Federal Assembly. 
This is an impressive showing if one considers that the 
elections were taking place right on the heels of Boris 
Yeltsin's visit to the Northern Caucasus. 
  The other contender -- Sergey Khetagurov -- also has high 
chances to win. He is a new-wave politician, a pragmatist. He 
is supported by local economic managers, directors, and 
entrepreneurs. Even the economic troubles worsened by the 
conflict with Ingushetia and the republic's active part in the 
South Ossetian problem have far from dismayed the North Ossetia 
premier. On the contrary, they have only made his authority 
stronger. One piece of evidence is an unofficial dialogue with 
Chechnya President Dzhokhar Dudayev, held on Khetagurov's 
initiative. The result: After these negotiations Groznyy has 
repeatedly confirmed its noninterference in the Ingush-Ossetia 
conflict. The North Ossetia prime minister's positions became 
even stronger after Boris Yeltsin's visit to the state of 
emergency zone. Sergey Khetagurov spoke sharply against 
Moscow's stance. He thinks that as an arbiter the Kremlin 
gambles on force whereas one should give a possibility and time 
for Ossetians and Ingush themselves to agree. The fact that 
Khetagurov swims against the stream, never fearing for his 
career, secures him additional votes. 
  Aleksandr Dzasokhov, former CPSU Central Committee 
secretary, 
was seen as the third main candidate for presidency of the 
republic. However, the "Styr Nykhas" public organization asked 
Dzasokhov to pull out of the election marathon. He complied, 
announcing that a radical change of leaders threatens the 
republic with tipping the fragile political balance. Another 
argument given by "Styr Nykhas" is that the victory for 
Dzasokhov, for example, may cause a repetition of the Chechnya 
variant. A power struggle against the backdrop of the South 
Ossetia problem and the dispute over Prigorodnyy Rayon may split 
North Ossetia. 
  Evidently only Sergey Khetagurov is trying to outdistance 
Akhsarbek Galazov. According to unofficial information, one of 
the four remaining candidates, or all of them, might do on the 
last day before the elections what Dzasokhov did.
