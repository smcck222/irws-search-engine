<F P=106> [Major Vladimir Gilyuk and Sergey Prokopenko report: "State </F>
of Emergency Zone: Law-Enforcement Agencies and Russian 
Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs Servicemen Have Their 
Work Cut Out"] 
  [Text] In spite of the peacemaking efforts of the Russian 
Federation Government, a Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs 
[MVD] forces command group, and the temporary administration, 
the situation in the state of emergency zone on the territory of 
the Republics of North Ossetia and Ingushetia is still fairly 
complex. 
  In the opinion of several experts it will still take much 
time for the conflict to be finally settled; after all, it is 
not for nothing that people say that it is enough for there to 
be a single shot for a war to last 100 years. 
  But nevertheless, in spite of the difficulties, a Russian 
Federation MVD operational inquiry group investigation team is 
working fairly fruitfully. It is taking measures to search out 
criminals, people who have disappeared without trace during the 
conflict, to establish the identity of unidentified corpses, 
free hostages, and establish the possible sites where dead 
citizens have been buried. In the space of only one month the 
group has established the fate of 25 citizens who disappeared 
without trace, operations to detain particularly dangerous 
criminals have been mounted, and possible locations where 
hostages are being held and dead citizens are buried have been 
checked. For example, acting on fresh information, the 
investigation team led by Lieutenant Colonel of the Militia Petr 
Baranov discovered two illegal burial sites containing 11 
corpses in the region of the settlement of Oktyabrskiy. They 
were all identified and handed over to the relatives of the 
deceased. 
  Staffers of State Motor Vehicle Inspection Administration 
subunits have also had their work cut out in the state of 
emergency zone. Suffice it to say that they have examined more 
than 10,000 motor vehicles at checkpoints, and have checked 
serial numbers on the units and assemblies of more than 3,000 
vehicles against the Russian MVD Information Center data base. 
Some 43 vehicles have been impounded, mostly of foreign 
production, which were being sought. 
  While checking and examining motor vehicles, 46 rifles, two 
live grenades, as well as 17 cold-steel weapons were discovered 
and confiscated. 
  In order to step up preventative and preemptive work in the 
fight against hijacking, a raid was carried out on the territory 
of the Republic of Ingushetia 6 January. In the space of six 
hours, eight vehicles were impounded, which were being sought. 
Upon examining them, various firearms and cold steel weapons 
were discovered and confiscated.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Khetagurov, chairman of the Council </F>
of Ministers of the Republic of North Ossetia, by Lyudmila 
Beldyugina; place and date not given: "Patience and Time Will 
Heal the Wounds"] 
  [Text] In the Russian Federation today there is no region 
more complex or potentially explosive than that of the 
Ossetian-Ingush conflict and the zone where the state of 
emergency is in force. 
  Whether the situation will subside or tend to intensify will 
depend to a considerable extent on the leaders of the national 
republic and its old and new politicians, those who are in the 
structures of administration today and those who will replace 
them after the elections to the local organs of power: A 
presidential election is due on 16 January, parliamentary 
elections 27 March. 
  Our correspondent's interlocutor is Sergey Valentinovich 
Khetagurov, chairman of the Republic of North Ossetia Council of 
Ministers and a deputy to the Federation Council. 
  [Beldyugina] About the elections. You are taking part in 
the election race, but at the same time it is well-known that 
you are an opponent of the very institution of presidency in the 
republic. How do you reconcile these two facts? 
  [Khetagurov] I cannot imagine a more inappropriate 
occupation for an anxious republic preoccupied with quite 
different concerns and problems than yet another political 
campaign accompanied by the fueling of public passions, 
struggles among different teams and groups, scandals, 
intrigues... 
  In short, all this tends to split a society, which more than 
ever before needs consolidation, a pooling of efforts to 
stabilize the situation in the state of emergency zone and give 
help to refugees and those who have suffered during the 
conflict, and the restoration of a national economy badly 
damaged by the war with our neighbors. 
  For example, 28 people have contested three Federal Assembly 
seats! Eight candidates are now running for the presidency. I 
do not think that any of the contenders for the presidency is 
entirely suited to the role, and that includes myself. But in 
the republic's present government and in my team there are many 
people who are simply irreplaceable today. However, my defeat 
will mean the inevitable resignation of the whole team. 
  Under the Republic of North Ossetia Constitution the 
president is both head of the republic and chief executive. 
There is no equivalent in any fundamental law. 
  [Beldyugina] I attended one of your election meetings with 
the voters in the village of Olginskoye. For the most part 
people were interested not in politics but in social problems -- 
the bad roads, communications, the lack of heat in people's 
homes, and other problems. 
  [Khetagurov] That is the point. For the government the 
social sphere is indeed the priority. The appalling 
psychological tension can be defused by improving the 
population's well-being and by combating unemployment and 
poverty. Not only have we prevented the social sphere from 
disintegrating but we have even made some real progress. North 
Ossetia today has one of the highest per capita incomes. In the 
North Caucasus at least we are in first place in that regard. 
The slump in production in the republic has been halted and 
overall production volumes are increasing. 
  [Beldyugina] Nevertheless, the tension in the state of 
emergency region is high and could erupt. People seem to be 
expecting the worst. The intention to return Ingush refugees to 
four settlements in Prigorodnyy Rayon has caused a storm of 
protests from the population. You also consider this step 
hasty. Why? 
  [Khetagurov] Because you cannot reconcile by force people 
who yesterday were enemies and who lost their near ones in 
bloody battle. How can you make people live together when their 
predominant feeling today is one of fear? 
  [Beldyugina] What is your relationship like with the 
leadership of the interim administration of Ingushetia? 
  [Khetagurov] It is a normal, businesslike relationship. We 
seek a path of mutual understanding and cooperation in the 
solution of any question. The main thing is to avoid a head-on 
confrontation and harm caused by intolerance or harsh and 
ill-considered actions. But the military presence in the region 
must be reduced. For three years the republic has been living 
in a state of emergency. This is too long and has traumatized 
people's psyche. 
  [Beldyugina] In that case who will ensure their security? 
  [Khetagurov] There are teams of internal troops and a border 
regiment quartered in North Ossetia -- these forces are 
sufficient to maintain law and order in the republic. 
  [Beldyugina] Nevertheless, people must return to their 
homes. Especially those who were not caught up in the bloody 
events of 1992. After all, the situation cannot be maintained. 
Perhaps you know of another way out? 
  [Khetagurov] I am convinced that events cannot be forced. 
This is a question of the security not just of the Ossetian 
population but also of the Ingush. Furthermore, there is the 
problem of preserving an already too fragile peace throughout 
the North Caucasus and in southern Russia. Time is the best 
healer. It is necessary to use popular diplomacy, the laws, 
traditions, and the custom of reconciliation typical of the 
mountain people. People must become reconciled with one another 
-- neighbor with neighbor. Conciliation commissions have been 
created in all our population centers.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Eduard Ergartovich Rossel by Lyubov </F>
Tsukanova; place and date not given: "Good Laws Are Our Field, 
Deputy Eduard Rossel Believes"] 
  [Text] [Tsukanova] The removal of a "good" governor came 
as a surprise to many people. What about you? 
  [Rossel] We foresaw this turn of events. Although, in 
campaigning for a real regional policy, we acted strictly within 
the framework of the then-Constitution and were aware that this 
would meet with opposition from certain people and political 
structures at the center. What is the result? A quite 
successful Oblast Soviet was dissolved. The population was 
disappointed. And this disappointment resulted in just 49 
percent of the oblast's inhabitants turning up at polling 
stations in December. 
  [Tsukanova] How do you explain the president's decision? 
  [Rossel] I think that the president has not hitherto been 
given any logical and complete information about our initiatives 
and actions. We have even encountered a situation where 
officials who came along to investigate acted in accordance with 
the well-known principle: "We have not read your constitution, 
but we condemn it." But, to be serious, I am convinced that 
there are people who were very interested in capturing 
Sverdlovsk Oblast from the president. And they attained their 
objective.... 
  [Tsukanova] Why did you decide to stand for the Federation 
Council? 
  [Rossel] I supported the idea that leaders of the executive 
should not be part of the legislature. We have already endured 
that situation and nothing good came of it. And, after I was 
removed, I decided to take part in the elections in order to 
bring the idea of regional autonomy to its conclusion via the 
Federation Council. It is not only a matter of our oblast, it 
is a question of all 68 Russian oblasts, which still have even 
fewer rights than the republics. That must not be, just as 
there should not be loved and unloved children in a family. 
  [Tsukanova] For various reasons public opinion is now more 
occupied with the situation in the State Duma. The Federation 
Council is somewhat in the background. How do you see the work 
of the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly? 
  [Rossel] The Federation Council is not politicized and that 
really counterbalances the Duma. It includes people from the 
localities who are not so much skilled speakers as responsible 
for the fate of the regions. People confronted with the 
territories' specific problems. They come face to face with 
all manner of obstacles and lack of laws, making it impossible 
to organize normal activity. I think that the Federation 
Council will have a sobering effect on the Duma deputies if the 
laws they formulate are adopted to suit the short-term political 
situation or if they fail to take regional interests into 
consideration. 
  The Federation Council's standing orders and the 
organization 
of its apparatus are important (the apparatus does not now make 
provision for a structure tackling regional policy), what we 
need is a scheme for cooperating with the Duma, the president, 
and the government. All this has to be worked out. Standing 
orders should envisage total autonomy for the Federation 
Council. I am opposed to the Federation Council forming a bloc 
with the Duma, the government, etc. 
  I think that everything that the Supreme Soviet did must be 
analyzed as a matter of urgency and the priorities determined -- 
which draft laws should be tackled first. The question of the 
Constitution, adopted in breach of the existing law on the 
referendum, will inevitably come up. It will either be 
necessary to adopt amendments to the law or seek another 
solution to the situation. Other matters of urgency include the 
laws on the fight against crime and precisely targeted social 
security for the population. These are laws necessary to ensure 
tranquillity in the country and stability in the state. 
  [Tsukanova] You mentioned the autonomy of the Federation 
Council. However, many State Duma deputies think differently; 
they want to cooperate as actively as possible with their 
colleagues in the Federation Council or seek a common field of 
activity. In particular, as far as regional interests are 
concerned. Especially since a considerable proportion of Duma 
deputies have been elected by the territories. Do you intend, 
say, to cooperate with your Duma colleagues who were elected by 
Sverdlovsk Oblast? 
  [Rossel] I don't see any difficulties or conflict in doing 
this. Not only do I intend to do so, but we have already begun 
to cooperate: We have founded the Ural deputies' assembly and 
intend to register it with the Ministry of Justice. This 
assembly is to comprise both Federation Council and State Duma 
deputies. We will have our parliamentary center equipped with 
its own computer system: Given that each deputy may have one or 
two assistants, we will select specialists. And the entire Ural 
region will know that that it can submit proposals and plans in 
need of legislative confirmation. This will be a center for 
public discussion of the draft laws being prepared by the 
parliament, a feedback mechanism. This kind of work is far more 
effective than hovering around microphones. There is sufficient 
intellectual potential in the Urals to provide legislators with 
effective aid. 
  [Tsukanova] Moscow is always -- particularly now -- accused 
of focusing on elitist political problems and showing little 
interest in provincial life. What is life like now for the 
"rest" of Russia? What does it expect from deputies first and 
foremost? 
  [Rossel] I would say that in terms of its political behavior 
Moscow has itself become a province. In terms of their view of 
economic reform and reform of the political authority the 
regions are now ahead. Not to mention their understanding of 
the crux of regional policy. There are simply not the people in 
Moscow to tackle this. Incidentally, Boris Yeltsin said this at 
an enlarged session of the Council of Ministers in November. 
There is nothing surprising in components of the Federation 
trying to change their status -- that is the result of 
government omissions in the regional sphere. 
  What is life like for the provinces? As a candidate deputy I 
met a lot of people. The number-one question was social 
security. The weakest people -- and there are plenty of them in 
our country -- must not feel abandoned. Question number-two is 
how are we going to escape from the economic crisis. I am 
certain that we initially adopted the wrong way of reforming the 
economy. We took the political rather than the economic road, 
across the board. But I also know that we cannot interfere now 
and make any drastic changes. The worst thing would be for us 
to now start sharply twitching to the left, right, and 
backwards. Because we have taken this route, we must see it 
through to the end. Privatization cannot be halted. The 
efforts to stabilize the ruble must continue. The economy must 
be demonopolized and small and middling business developed: The 
steps now being taken to do this are patently inadequate. As 
for stabilizing decisions, I repeat, the first thing is to 
provide precisely targeted social security and then invest in 
individual capital construction, i.e., in housing. This must be 
done immediately. We must undoubtedly think over the state 
program for food safety. And the state security program as a 
whole: It is necessary to have it out with the Army and all the 
relevant structures. 
  [Tsukanova] Do you think that society can count on the 
parliament's working fruitfully? If you had a chance to appeal 
to your deputy colleagues, what would you say to them? 
  [Rossel] I would urge them to abandon politics and tackle 
the real problems facing society today. I would urge that there 
be no confrontations. We now have a legislative vacuum. We 
must tackle in earnest laws that would make it possible to 
advance economic and political reforms. It is this legislative 
work that will bear real fruit. [Rossel ends] 
  Our Information: The Oblast Soviet was disbanded 10 November 
1993 by edict of President Yeltsin shortly after the Oblast 
Soviet adopted the constitution of the Ural Republic, the 
constitution was revoked, and the governor of the nonexistent 
republic -- officially head of the Sverdlovsk Oblast 
administration -- Eduard Rossel, removed from his post. A 
routine planning session of the economic association of the Ural 
region that met the following day elected Rossel its president. 
He was previously the voluntary head of the association. And on 
12 December, 61 percent of the oblast's population who turned 
out to vote elected the former head of the administration as 
their representative to the upper chamber of the Federal 
Assembly -- the Federation Council.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Todres report under the "Territories" rubric: </F>
"`Siberian Agreement' To Be Headed by Omsk Governor. Creation 
of `Siberian Faction' in Parliament Postponed, But Apparently 
Not for Long"] 
  [Text] Chiefs have changed in "Siberian Agreement." From 
now on the association's council will be headed by Leonid 
Polezhayev, chief of the Omsk Oblast administration, not Vitaliy 
Mukha, who was fired by Boris Yeltsin from the post of 
Novosibirsk governor for disloyalty. 
  Mr. Polezhayev promised that under him the association will 
continue to work "for the benefit of Siberia and all of Russia," 
but at the same time "new opportunities" that opened up after 
the elections would be used. The official creation of a 
"Siberian faction," however, has so far been postponed: Too 
many disgruntled members turned up on 10 January for the 
association's council meeting. According to Vladimir Shumeyko, 
he "would like supraparty deputy groups to operate at the Duma, 
while at the upper chamber there should be no factions at all." 
Newly elected Duma members from Siberia, having realized that 
even deputy seats will not save them from their local bosses' 
control, on the contrary advised that "such a group should be 
set up precisely at the Federation Council" and that independent 
Duma deputies should be left alone. 
  Nonetheless, "Siberian Agreement" is seriously intent on 
setting up a "Siberian cohort" that would operate in both 
chambers of the Federal Assembly and is even ready to assume all 
expenses of this deputy group's staff. 
  It seems that this lobby will be formed at an accelerated 
pace precisely at this stage until next year's budget is drawn 
up. "We are as yet unable to get anything either from this 
Fedorov or from this Central Bank," Buryatian Prime Minister 
Vladimir Saganov exclaimed. Currently, the association is 
summarizing all demands voiced by Siberian regions so as to 
present them to the government, and what all of them want is to 
resolve the nonpayments crisis while avoiding bankruptcies of 
enterprises. 
  Aleksandr Shokhin, who attended the council meeting, 
confided 
that "taking the regions' demands into account in the budget 
will be a difficult task." Nonetheless, the place of "the 
regions' advocate" on Staraya Ploshchad has never been empty, 
and Vladimir Shumeyko is apparently going to replace the 
outgoing Sergey Shakhray in this capacity. At any rate, it was 
he who suggested on Monday that "Siberian Agreement" determine 
"an amount required for priority Siberian programs -- and we 
will back it at a government meeting." 
  Apparently, it is precisely Leonid Polezhayev's push-through 
qualities that landed him in the seat of the head of an 
association of raw material and military-industrial regions, 
although his purely agrarian Omsk Oblast has no bearing either 
on raw materials or the military-industrial sector. Even 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy indirectly confirmed his reputation of a 
"strong manager" by announcing recently his intention to 
nominate Mr. Polezhayev to the government from his party. The 
Omsk governor himself, however, told your SEGODNYA correspondent 
that he was hearing about this for the first time and did not 
have any connections with the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
leader.

<F P=106> [Mircea Dascaliuc report from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] The parliament of the self-styled Dniester Republic 
intends to request the support of the deputies of the Russian 
Federal Assembly, the Chisinau-based INFO-TASS news agency 
reported today. We hope that our proposal referring to the 
setting up of a confederation of republics in the Republic of 
Moldova will be received with understanding, a special appeal 
adopted by the most recent session of the Tiraspol Supreme 
Soviet says. The Dniester deputies are complaining about the 
fact that the Chisinau authorities do not wish to agree to 
settle the conflict in a mutually acceptable way, INFO-TASS 
mentions. The document also asks the Russian parliamentarians 
to recognize, under such circumstances, the Moldovan Dniester 
Republic as an independent and sovereign state that is a friend 
of Russia. 
  Victor Puscasu, the deputy speaker of Moldova's Parliament, 
assessed that the text of the aforementioned appeal expresses a 
lack of willingness and the inability of the Tiraspol leaders to 
settle the Dniester problem at the negotiating table. The 
setting up of a federation or a confederation of states on the 
territory of the republic of Moldova is totally out of the 
question, Puscasu asserted. The Dniester problem can and has to 
be settled by keeping Moldova united, by granting a special 
juridical status to the rayons on the left bank of the Dniester 
River, Puscasu emphasized adding that this position is also 
supported by the UN, CSCE, and the leadership of Russia and 
other states. 
  Today Mr. Slavomir Dabrova, the head of the CSCE mission to 
the Republic Moldova, taking the floor during the meeting of the 
Unified Control Commission that had been set up for the Dniester 
security zone, presented the final decision of the recent Rome 
meeting of the ministerial council of the CSCE member countries. 
The document recommends that the Dniester region should be 
granted a special juridical status, but remain a constituent 
part of the Republic of Moldova. The Tiraspol members of the 
unified commission reacted to Dabrova's statement with aloofness 
saying that the decisions of the CSCE missions are not mandatory 
for them, MOLDOVA-PRES news agency informs adding that by recent 
orders of the so-called Dniester Ministry of Interior, the 
representatives of the CSCE mission are prohibited to travel 
freely on the territory of the Dniester Republic, including the 
security zone instated on both banks of the Dniester River.

  [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- Chairman of the Russian 
Government Viktor Chernomyrdin is going to announce next Monday 
the make-up of the government due to be reformed in accordance 
with the presidential decree of 10 January. This is what he 
said in an ITAR-TASS interview after the ceremony of an official 
meeting of Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton. 
  "All versions have already been discussed," Chernomyrdin 
said. He made it clear, however, that a final decision on the 
candidatures would be taken after the steering bodies of the 
Federal Assembly are formed. "I am very much worried about the 
formation of the steering bodies of the State Duma," he added. 
  Responding to the ITAR-TASS supposition that Oleg Soskovets 
and Yegor Gaydar will be appointed first deputy prime ministers, 
and Yuriy Yarov and Aleksandr Zaveryukha -- deputy prime 
ministers, Chernomyrdin said: "You are almost right." 
  The prime minister commented angrily on the open letter, 
sent 
by leaders of the Democratic Russia Movement Gleb Yakunin and 
Lev Ponomarev to President Yeltsin on Wednesday. They opposed 
the appointment of Aleksandr Zaveryukha to the post of deputy 
prime minister. "It is not these people who will determine the 
government make-up," he said. 
  According to Chernomyrdin, professionalism and personal 
business qualities were the main criteria for choosing 
candidates to the top posts in the government. "The most 
important thing is that people working in the government should 
share our ideas and realise the depth of the processes taking 
place in the country... The government is formed not for the 
purpose of meeting the requirements of certain individuals, but 
for fulfilling specific tasks," Chernomyrdin said.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Razin: "Will Gaydar Resign?"] </F>
  [Text] The president has again issued an edict to 
reorganize the government. A large number of officials of 
various kinds have been laid off right up to the level of vice 
premiers -- their number has declined from nine to four. And 
only two of them will be first deputy heads of the cabinet. 
Only 20 ministries, 24 state committees, and 20 departments 
are left. 
  At first glance these figures confirm the official story of 
the latest government reshuffle: The inflated apparatus must be 
dealt with. But behind this reduction one can discern a 
tactical gain for the agrarian and industrial lobbyists and 
their leaders at the helm of power. 
  Premier Chernomyrdin has been given a week to personally 
appoint his deputies and ministers. Already observers are 
united in the opinion that it will be suggested that O. 
Soskovets and Ye. Gaydar become the first vice premiers and A. 
Zaveryukha and Yu. Yarov mere vice premiers. Of course this 
layout could be different. If only because at a recent press 
conference Gaydar dropped a transparent hint that he might not 
join the government. It is true that he did not say everything 
about his doubts. But the absence of his comrades in arms A. 
Chubays and B. Fedorov on the list of vice premiers needs no 
special comment. If the reformers' key figures are deprived of 
their powers then Gaydar will yet again be in the unenviable 
role of "whipping boy." 
  With this selection of vice premiers inflation will go 
sky-high by the spring and the future of privatization will look 
vague to say the least. With this disposition of forces Gaydar 
and "Russia's Choice" will most likely join the hidden 
[glukhaya] opposition.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with IZVESTIYA commentator Otto Latsis </F>
by Moscow correspondent Hans Geleijnse in Moscow; date not 
given: "West Must Not Exaggerate Danger Posed by Zhirinovskiy -- 
Political Clown Will Make A Poor Show"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- Ever since the Russian elections last 
December, the alarm bells have been ringing around the world, 
especially in the West. The reason is the march into parliament 
of media clown and agitator Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of a 
group that bears the misleading name of the Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia [LDPR]. 
  Otto Latsis, the cautious, and probably for that reason 
alone 
already highly influential, 60-year-old commentator of the 
Russian newspaper IZVESTIYA is extremely concerned about 
Zhirinovskiy's surprising election victory. However, it is not 
the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon itself that frightens him, but the 
reactions to it, which he considers exaggerated. 
  NATO, which has experienced a serious identity crisis since 
the disappearance of its enemy, the Soviet Union, is being given 
an unexpected stimulus to survive by Russia. New members, the 
countries of Central Europe and the Balkan states, want a place 
under the alliance's umbrella. 
  In the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands, the 
so-called Zhirinovskiy factor is providing ready ammunition for 
bringing the defense cuts under fire. In short, the 
reincarnation of the Red Peril of communism as a poisonous 
black, fascist threat is being taken extremely seriously. 
  Latsis has always been a party journalist. However, as a 
qualified economist, he opted for reforms right from the start 
and also became a strong opponent of Stalinism. He left the 
party in 1990. "The danger in overestimating Zhirinovskiy lies 
in setting off a chain reaction. I dread to think that NATO 
might welcome neighboring countries like Poland, the Czech 
Republic, and the Baltic republics into the club. The militants 
here would then immediately cry: `You see, the West is still 
our rival.' That would not only prove fatal to reaching further 
arms reduction agreements, but would also kill off Yeltsin's 
reform policy." 
  That nearly 24 percent of the vote went to the man who 
intends to drop atomic bombs on Germany if necessary, propagates 
the idea of a Greater Russia, and commands considerable support 
within the Army, may well give cause for something more than 
raised eyebrows in the West. According to Latsis, "I would be 
the last person to say that there is no reason to remain alert; 
the question is how to do so. And above all, based on what 
assessment?" 
<H5>  Wrong Track </H5>
  According to Latsis, anyone comparing the present situation 
in Russia with the situation in Germany during the 1930's, who 
regards Zhirinovskiy as a new Hitler, is entirely on the wrong 
track. Zhirinovskiy has managed to get this far not only because 
his democratic opponents not only underestimated him, but also 
because of the population's dissatisfaction with the economic 
chaos and impoverishment, and its dented national pride in a 
country that was once so powerful but is now in decline. 
  According to Latsis, the votes for Zhirinovskiy are 
absolutely no proof whatsoever that fascism and extreme 
nationalism are rampant in Russia. "Under such circumstances, I 
would even go so far as to say that the Russian population is 
less nationalistic than the U.S. population. However, there is 
more. According to my estimates, a maximum of 8 percent of the 
electorate could be considered hard core militant Zhirinovskiy 
supporters. The rest voted for the LDPR as a protest." 
  Zhirinovskiy gained his victory entirely from the national 
party list for the National Duma, the new parliament. His 
victory was a direct consequence of his personal charisma: He 
has humor on his side, and is someone who "dares to speak the 
truth to the motley crew in the Kremlin." 
  However, in the regional lists, which determined over half 
of 
the seats in the Duma, Zhirinovskiy and his LDPR did not make a 
breakthrough there. "The regional candidates were familiar to 
the people and were judged far more on the content of their 
platform. That [fact] alone proves that the electorate did not 
vote `for fascism,'" says Latsis. 
  "The protest was also reflected in the 48 percent [of the 
population] who did not go to the polls. I believe that half of 
these people are totally indifferent, while the other half would 
vote for democratic candidates under better circumstances. Why? 
If they had wanted to make their protest known, they would have 
gone to the polls to support Zhirinovskiy. That did not 
happen," Latsis continued. 
  He sees both the leader of the LDPR and the forces 
supporting 
him (Latsis claims that both Zhirinovskiy and his party are an 
invention of reactionaries from the former KGB and the Army -- 
GAZET VAN ANTWERPEN correspondent's note) losing ground when 
things actually have to be done in the parliament. Latsis 
predicts that in 1996 Zhirinovskiy will play a major role in the 
presidential elections, but that he certainly will not win. 
"You cannot play the clown for two years. He will now have to 
make grotesque promises. We must also wait and see which kind 
of people his party attracts, and how much support he will 
receive in daily political practice," he says. 
<H5>  Remedy </H5>
  According to Latsis, the only remedy against Zhirinovskiy is 
to throw overboard any idea of shock therapy. Reforms are 
necessary, but they must be well-considered and cautious. A 
second correction must entail the recognition of the 
dissatisfaction with the fate of the 25 million Russians who 
have been living outside Russia for generations. 
  According to Latsis: "The democrats have simply given this 
issue to Zhirinovskiy. I am glad that in his New Year's 
address, Yeltsin announced that he would respond sharply to 
discrimination--or even worse--against Russians living outside 
Russia. A man like Foreign Minister Kozyrev should have done 
that much earlier, exerting diplomatic pressure on countries 
that are attempting to force their ethnic Russian citizens into 
a second-class position, like the Baltics. That policy should 
also have been presented better to the people. In that way, 
Zhirinovskiy would have been deprived of an important weapon." 
  The situation will only become dangerous if the democrats 
continue to refuse to draw the right conclusions from the 
election result. The West must merely now show its willingness 
to help Russia in its reconstruction, and realize that the 
economy of this gigantic country cannot make a 180-degree 
turnaround from one day to the next, Latsis argued. 
  As for NATO, Latsis advised Yeltsin to first allow some time 
for guiding Russia inside a joint alliance. Subsequently, the 
membership of neighboring countries will no longer pose a 
problem. The opposite is impossible, Latsis warned, because in 
that case the democrats--and not only they--can probably forget 
all about it.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1555 GMT on 12 January carries a 30-minute 
documentary program "Portrait Against a Swastika" reviewing the 
rise to prominence of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, 
LDPR, its leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, and two other right-wing 
groups, Pamyat and Russian National Unity. 
  The program begins with a claim that it would avoid a direct 
comparison of Zhirinovskiy with Adolf Hitler, although film of 
Zhirinovskiy reviewing young uniformed volunteers was spliced in 
with footage of Hitler reviewing the Hitler Youth. An 
unidentified moderator notes that: "We are a long way from 
comparing him with Hitler, although, come to think of it, Hitler 
also started with a small party of dissatisfaction." 
  However, at this point, the moderator notes there is a 
comparison between Zhirinovskiy and Mussolini, stating that: "If 
we are to speak of an external resemblance, we do not recall the 
Fuehrer of the Third Reich, but his great Italian friend, Benito 
Mussolini." 
  At this point there are several minutes of spliced film 
clips 
of Zhirinovskiy and Mussolini speaking. Clips from 
Zhirinovskiy's election campaign are shown, with commentary 
repeatedly suggesting that his election promises are not 
realizable. At one point the moderator states that "He promises 
everybody everything...but only one thing is missing from each 
promise: an explanation of how exactly he plans to do it all." 
  Alongside clips of LDPR election campaign material, 
Zhirinovskiy is repeatedly shown in an excited and incoherent 
state, including two scenes apparently shot in a nightclub. In 
one clip Zhirinovskiy states: "Yes, yes, it's a wolf's life." 
"Generally my favorite activity is howling like a wolf. People 
have different hobbies, like playing the recorder, but my 
activity is howling like a wolf." He then states: "I can try to 
howl like a wolf if you like, I'd be happy to." 
  The final sequence of the program shows a campaign clip of 
Zhirinovskiy commenting on the overseas involvement of Soviet 
forces. He says: "Wherever our soldiers may have been, in the 
Soviet-Finnish war, or the troops in Afghanistan, or in any 
other area, in Africa or Cuba, they did everything correctly. 
All the soldiers and officers who fought, everything they did 
was legal and correct." His final comment is: "If all that was 
legal and correct, what awaits us tomorrow?"

<F P=106> [Olga Bychkova report: "Court Leaves for Chamber"] </F>
  [Text] The fourth estate in Russia receives a new 
counterbalance--the Judicial Chamber for Information Disputes, 
created by the president's edict. 
  The Chamber, in fact, appears in the place of the 
Arbitration 
Information Court, which oversaw information guarantees of 
participants in the election campaign. The composition of the 
new body remains almost the same, with Anatoliy Vengerov, law 
professor, as its chairman. But members of the Chamber will 
work in it on a permanent basis and with no right to combine it 
with work for the media. 
  The formulated main objective of the new structure is to 
assist the president in exercising his constitutional powers as 
a guarantor of the rights and liberties of citizens, and 
primarily the right to freedom of speech. The Chamber has 
gained great powers in resolving disputes that involve 
distribution of air time on television and radio among the 
Federal Assembly factions. A totally new type of activity is 
"the protection of moral interests of children and adolescents 
in the mass media." 
  In practical terms, the Judicial Chamber will be able to 
give 
official warnings to publications for breaching the principles 
of "authenticity and objectivity" of information, and even to go 
to court to withdraw licenses. In the case of officials' 
violating the press law the Chamber can only reprimand them. 
This "inequality of rights," Anatoliy Vengerov thinks, is 
explained by the fact that a reprimand for an official is a 
terrible punishment threatening the ruin of a career, whereas in 
the case of a newspaper the last word belongs to the ordinary 
court. It it underscored separately that the Chamber's sphere 
is a public, rather than a legal, assessment of information. 
Still, as far as warnings go, the Judicial Chamber gains the 
functions of a press ministry. 
  The question of "authenticity and objectivity" so far 
appears 
one of the most debatable. Vengerov cites as an example the 
recent incident where Boris Yeltsin was ascribed the authorship 
of a personal letter to Anatoliy Lukyanov regarding the latter's 
deputy status, whereas the letter addressed all deputies in 
general. "Had the press secretary failed to deny the claim 
right away, we would have had to do it. And we would also have 
had to find out who and why presented the fact in a distorted 
way," the head of the Judicial Chamber explained. But he noted 
there his deep conviction that similar cases often involve 
elementary professional negligence rather than ill design. 
Making such instances public, Vengerov thinks, is the most 
powerful sanction of moral impact first and foremost. 
  How precisely the Judicial Chamber for Information Disputes 
will function is yet to be determined by special regulations. 
Members of the Chamber have been instructed to elaborate them 
by mid-January. Only then will it become clear what these 
innovations mean for the freedom of speech.

  [Text] At a meeting with members of the Agrarian faction in 
the State Duma, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said that the 
Deputy Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha, who is responsible for the 
agro-industrial sector, would retain his post in Russia's new 
Cabinet. Interfax learned this from the leader of the Agrarian 
faction, Mikhail Lapshin. 
  According to him, in the near future his faction intends to 
prompt the State Duma to demand that the government pay its 
debts to the farmers under its last year's commitments, "in view 
of the catastrophic situation in farming." According to the 
farmers' calculations, the government owes them about one and a 
half trillion rubles, Lapshin said. "The situation in the 
countryside is very hard, and it will become simply 
catastrophic, unless we give the industry financial support by 
the coming spring," he stressed. 
  With reference to the problem of electing the State Duma 
speaker, Lapshin said: The Agrarian faction believes that his 
candidacy should be considered in a package with his deputies. 
Lapshin thinks that if a representative of small factions is 
elected as speaker, his four deputies should be elected from the 
four biggest factions: Russia's Choice, the Agrarians, the 
Communists and the Liberal Democrats. According to Lapshin, the 
fifth deputy should be elected from a faction of independent 
deputies or from the representatives of autonomies. 
  He confirmed that his faction still intended to propose Ivan 
Rybkin for the post of the speaker or one of his deputies. 
  According to Lapshin, at 16:00 on Wednesday the leaders of 
all parliamentary factions are to meet in the State Duma 
building to reach a final agreement on the candidacy of the 
speaker and his deputies.

<F P=106> [Report by Yelena Yakovleva: "President Repeals Incorrect </F>
Decisions on Land Reform"] 
  [Text] A president's edict has been signed "on bringing 
Russian Federation land legislation into line with the Russian 
Federation Constitution." 
  "This is an entirely natural procedure: to remove the 
restrictive norms of the old legislation after the adoption of a 
new Constitution," Doctor of Economic Sciences Yevgeniya Serova, 
adviser to the minister of agriculture for economic questions, 
comments on the situation. 
  And so what has this edict repealed? It has transferred all 
powers of the abolished Soviets connected with the regulation of 
land relations to the local administrations. It has removed 
from the Land Code the concept of the "holding inherited for 
life," which was once introduced as a palliative under 
conditions when it was impossible to legalize land ownership. 
  In addition, Article 7 of the edict "on the regulation of 
land relations and the development of agrarian reform in 
Russia," which grants committees for land resources and land use 
the right to trade in land which, as IZVESTIYA wrote, is fraught 
with the danger of the emergence of a monopoly trader, has been 
repealed. Although this has no direct bearing on the 
Constitution it does correct an erroneous preceding decision. 
The decree and statute on holding competitions and auctions for 
the sale of land plots, which enshrined the unjustified rights 
of the Russian Committee for Land Reform and Land Resources, 
which followed the edict, are also being repealed. 
  In Yevgeniya Serova's opinion, from the viewpoint of legal 
technique, the amendments could have been done more 
punctiliously. 
  By mechanically repealing the concept of the "holding 
inherited for life" and failing to explain the terms under which 
this right is turned into property, millions of people have been 
plunged into an area which is not governed by law. And by 
depriving the Russian Committee for Land Reform and Land 
resources of the right to do deals involving land plots on the 
state's behalf (what they have in mind here is most likely the 
purchase of land for federal needs) they have removed competent 
people from this business. The "organ of state management," 
which will engage in this and which according to rumors should 
be created by the State Committee for the Administration of 
State Property, could be not very professional.

<F P=106> [Rustam Narzikulov report under the "Money" rubric: "The </F>
Dollar Comes Closer to the 1300-Ruble Mark. An End to a 
Currency Paradox?"] 
  [Text] At yesterday's trading session of the Moscow 
interbank currency exchange the dollar reached its highest rate 
against the ruble since 23 September 1993 -- 1,293 rubles [R] 
per dollar. The September record the dollar hit two days after 
the parliament was dissolved was R1,299 per dollar. 
  Experts attribute the R19 increase in the currency exchange 
rate on Tuesday (following Monday's R15 rise) to "uncertainty 
over the government's economic policy and the possibility of a 
government reshuffle." What is noteworthy are the pace of the 
ruble's slide and the Russian Federation Central Bank's line of 
conduct at the two latest trading sessions. 
  Compared with the first trading session in the new year on 5 
January, the ruble dropped 3 percent. The speed of the currency 
exchange rates' movement was effectively in line with last 
year's typical inflation rate, which was determined by the scale 
of the creation of credit and money. 
  Hence, there would have been nothing extraordinary in the 
dollar's behavior on the Russian currency market after the New 
Year, had the country's population not become used to the fact 
that the exchange rate fluctuates regardless of how many rubles 
are printed. 
  But the situation of the second half of 1993 -- a stable 
ruble accompanied by a 30-percent semiannual inflation in 
July-December -- is characteristic only of economies in 
transition at a time when prices change significantly and 
currencies' purchasing power parities come closer to their 
exchange rates. This paradox was bound to end sooner or later, 
and it cannot be ruled out that the ruble's fall yesterday was a 
symptom that a normal, quantitative interrelation between 
inflation and currency exchange rate dynamics was finally being 
restored. 
  If this is so, the general political and economic background 
to the events at the Moscow interbank currency exchange 
("uncertainty of economic policy" and the possibility of a 
reshuffle) is merely a pretext for reversing the currency 
trends. Maybe the Central Bank, too, has a similar view on the 
situation as it nodded agreement to the dollar's new exchange 
rate figures (according to some banks, yesterday the Central 
Bank offered for sale a meager $16.5 million).

<F P=106> [Report by Ivan Zhagel: "Dollar Has Increased in Cost by 42 </F>
Rubles in One Go"] 
  [Text] The routine 12 January auctions at the Moscow 
interbank currency exchange reflected a drastic destabilization 
in the situation on the currency market. The ruble exchange 
rate fell to a record low and was 1,335 rubles [R] per a U.S. 
dollar, while at the previous auctions the rate was R1,293 per 
dollar. 
  Analyzing the reasons for such a drastic surge in the 
exchange rate, A. Zakharov, general director of the Moscow 
currency exchange, noted that one of the main reasons for the 
increased demand for dollars is the ban on currency trade 
introduced at the start of the year. In this connection trade 
organizations buying food and goods abroad have been obliged to 
start converting their ruble profit through the exchange. And 
so far market mechanisms and the efforts of the Central Bank are 
unable to neutralize and even out the increased demand or 
currency. 
  In addition, in A. Zakharov's opinion, the uncertainty of 
the 
political situation and the lack of clarity as to what economic 
program the Russian Government will implement are also having an 
effect. Incidentally, it is worth recalling here that the 
previous drastic decline in the ruble exchange rate was in 
September last year, that is when the Russian president's edict 
on the dissolution of parliament. So that political instability 
remains a very important factor determining the state of the 
national currency. 
  Finally, we cannot discount either the fact that in 
accordance with the president's edict "on financing state 
expenditure from the Russian Federation republican budget in the 
first quarter of 1994" money has begun to enter all spheres of 
the economy. And since control over its passage and expenditure 
remains at a low level, a considerable proportion of these 
financial resources is starting to surface at the exchange, 
putting adverse pressure on the ruble exchange rate.

<F P=106> [Interview with economist Pavel Bunich by A. Yevgenyev under </F>
the "Point of View" rubric; place and date not given: "The Man 
Who Does Not Hurry Is Always on Time"] 
  [Text] [Yevgenyev] Pavel Grigoryevich, do you not think 
that, in its uncertainty, the current situation resembles the 
situation that we had a year ago? You remember: Parliament 
flew into a rage, Gaydar left, and the premier's chair, it 
seemed, was occupied by a man of a different mettle -- a "gas 
magnate." No one could say then what awaited the country. Even 
the commentaries of analysts were somewhat timid and 
inarticulate. 
  [Bunich] At that time I, too, would not have undertaken to 
make forecasts. Chernomyrdin was unknown and not understood. 
Hence everyone was possessed by great alarm over whether we 
would continue with the reforms, or retreat back to the command 
economy. Right now, things are calmer in this sense. The 
premier's intentions are clear. The same goes for the general 
direction of movement toward the market. The question is, how 
to move forward. We can continue to do what we did before -- 
then it will be just as difficult as now, but will not become 
worse. The other option is acceleration. We will get to the 
goal quicker, but at the cost of maximum exertion of energy, 
which society might not have in sufficient supply on the home 
stretch. And finally, we could try a more sparing regime -- 
extended in time, and not so socially austere. All these are, 
in general, questions of tactics. Not one of these genuinely 
market-oriented models is a retreat to the past. 
  [Yevgenyev] On the other hand, the State Duma is a pig in a 
poke. 
  [Bunich] I hope that we will never again see the naked 
extremism that lately characterized the Supreme Soviet. I 
somehow think that the parliament of the present convocation 
will be "fluid" -- that is to say that there will not be 
draconian discipline. Just because a man is elected from one 
bloc or party or another, he will not be deprived of the freedom 
to think and make decisions independently. The democrats will 
most likely squabble among themselves over secondary issues, but 
when it comes to crucial issues they will find in themselves the 
strength to unite. I do not know Zhirinovskiy's program, but I 
am not quite convinced that he will blindly follow the 
communists with their naivete toward everything to do with the 
market. Thus the outlook looks to me at least no worse than one 
year ago. 
  [Yevgenyev] But the Duma will gather and raise a hue and 
cry: Industry is perishing, everyone to the rescue of industry! 
  [Bunich] The slump in production is indeed great. According 
to some statistics, there has been a 52-percent downturn in 
production since 1989. Although this process is not simple. 
Some enterprises are commonly acknowledged to be doomed, and 
should expire on the road to a normal economy -- they are 
superfluous! Others are so unprofitable, labor-intensive, and 
nontechnological that there is no sense in reviving them. I am 
more worried by something else: While losing enterprises, we 
are creating nothing in their place. 
  [Yevgenyev] With an annual inflation rate of 1,000 percent? 
  [Bunich] This is the very premise on which the Cabinet 
proceeds: Whatever the cost, inflation must be squeezed. But 
what is the result? It is still harder to cut expenditure, and 
you do not especially increase revenues -- production shrinks, 
and tax revenue into the state coffers with it. The jacket 
shrinks to fit the wearer. Hence the delays over settling debts 
to the military-industrial complex and the countryside and over 
payments to the budget-financed sphere. I am afraid that 
stabilization achieved at such a cost would prove unstable. 
  At one time we loved to talk about production reserves. 
Today there are almost none left. Fixed capital is 50 percent 
worn out. The volume of investments in industry has fallen by 
two-thirds since 1989. Enterprises do not have the funds for 
simple reproduction, let alone development. 
  I am not calling for trillions of rubles to be poured 
wholesale into industry again. But I do think it necessary to 
aid through reasonable allowances those who are ready to take 
risks, who have the ability and knowledge to escape from the 
clutches of the crisis, and have a promising business plan. 
Picking out such enterprises is work of a special kind. 
Piecework, if you like. We have somewhat gotten out of the 
habit; from the pinnacles of power it looks to some people 
almost shameful. What is an individual little plant, pit, or 
building, on the scale of Mother Russia! The time will come 
when these things will get back on their feet by themselves. 
Reliance on this "by themselves" could prove illusory. Credits 
and taxes acceptable to all on the strength of which we might 
get back on our feet will not appear in our country quickly, if 
we undertake nothing. At the same time, labor collectives are 
realizing more and more clearly that no one is going to come 
along and wave a magic wand for them or cross their palms with 
silver, and are ready to go without some things today in order 
to reap the profits tomorrow. An example that is near to home 
for me: Right now in the Academy of the National Economy we are 
building a facility that will bring in hard-currency revenue, 
and have told our staff that we could pay them far more, but 
then the construction work would be delayed. Choose the one or 
the other. They all decided that we would be patient for three 
years and then let the facility. But on the other hand, 
inflation is snapping at our heels: Better a bird in the hand... 
  [Yevgenyev] Nevertheless, without major investments, you 
will not get far. 
  [Bunich] Well, first, we are getting wiser after all. How 
many joint-stock companies of the closed type appeared in the 
initial period. Now they have got accustomed to their new 
surroundings, looked around, and are gradually "opening up." 
They are issuing shares and increasing capital. 
  It is said that loans at the market rate are dear. But why 
not take them on security? Bankers do not especially trust 
promises to pay through future output -- maybe it will exist, 
maybe not. But industrial property, land -- that is reliable. 
And advantageous to the industry itself. You keep the money, 
and you even get more in the form of handsome credits. That is 
how it is done the world over. But in our country people are 
still apprehensive: As if you were removing your underwear and 
taking it to the pawnbroker's. What it is, I do not know: 
Either the general atmosphere of uncertainty is taking its 
toll, or directors have insufficient grasp of the basics. 
  Investment auctions could be more widely practised, selling 
shares advantageously to those who guarantee investment 
contributions -- these also amount to assets of a kind. 
  But look what is happening with depreciation payments. They 
were deliberately exempted from taxation in order to ensure the 
revival of production. But enterprises are constantly plowing 
them into pay. Since the new year, following the revaluation, 
the value of fixed capital has grown thirtyfold. But what is 
the benefit of this, if we continue to squander funds set aside 
for depreciation [amortizatsiyu proedat]? That being the case, 
you might as well tax it, if you cannot put things in order. 
  [Yevgenyev] But you say we should start helping industry. 
But it will once again throw everything to the four winds. 
  [Bunich] What I mean is: He who seeks is capable of finding 
something. But this is not enough. On the other hand, we 
should help only those who know how to make use of this help. 
And not, of course, state enterprises. Even in the current 
difficult times privatized facilities look far healthier than 
state facilities. Among the former only 9 percent are 
unprofitable, against 20 percent in the state sphere, and 
profitability is on average 10 percent higher. But of course, 
they were not allocated sufficient time to recover. 
  [Yevgenyev] Nevertheless, Ukraine has clearly shown what 
happens when you try with all your might to preserve industry. 
  [Bunich] I think that we have already passed this station. 
Also the station at which it was justified to pay any price for 
victory over inflation. Now we should look ahead and learn to 
optimize our decisions, while not forgetting about the old rule 
of thumb: "The man who does not hurry is always on time." Let 
the budget temporarily lose out somewhat over relatively low 
taxes and cheap credit for a chosen few -- at reasonable levels, 
this is not so terrible. Some inflationary indulgences quickly 
become a powerful anti-inflationary factor -- this is what 
should be kept in mind. Tomorrow's gains will cover today's 
losses many times over. He who takes his opportunity will not 
only pay back his debt a hundredfold, but also will become a 
reliable support for the new economy, which quite simply has no 
chance of developing in the present conditions.

<F P=106> [Valeriy Konovalov report: "Growth of Private Farming </F>
Stops"] 
  [Text] An alarming trend has recently been noted in 
Russia's private farming movement: The growth in number of 
private farms has come to a halt and a noticeable exodus of 
private farmers has begun in a number of regions. There have 
been hundreds of announcements by private farms in the Far East 
and Russia's south that they are ceasing their activities. 
  However, it would be a mistake to regard these facts as 
evidence that private farming in Russia has no future, as 
supporters of collective farming were quick to do. If you look 
more carefully at the statistics, you can see that even in 
regions where the reduction in the numbers of private farmers is 
most significant, reaching 3-4 percent, there is at the same 
time an increase in the area of land used by private farmers. 
Private peasant farms are being enlarged, land is being 
redistributed, and economic management of private farms is being 
optimized. 
  This process is absolutely natural and to be expected. More 
than a year ago Agriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun forecast in 
this newspaper an imminent slowdown in what was at that time 
rapid growth of private farming as the potential for such growth 
is limited, and forecast the optimization of private farming's 
share in the rural economy for a protracted period. On the 
other hand, the development of private farming through the 
reform of collective farms, turning them into joint-stock and 
cooperative farms, as is happening at present, should have 
proceeded much more intensively. 
  But individual, family farms in the hands of private farmers 
are also proving their viability. They have approximately a 
5-percent share of agricultural land today. But according to 
what are for the moment preliminary figures for last year's 
results, private farmers' production of basic types of 
agricultural output was significantly higher than 5 percent. 
Private farmers sold more than 2 million tonnes of grain alone 
to state resources while the state purchased in all about 26 
million tonnes. 
  Nevertheless, problems in the private farming sector have 
gotten more acute recently, as, incidentally, they have in the 
agricultural sector as a whole. This is first and foremost 
linked to the financial situation. In the opinion of Vladimir 
Bashmachnikov, chairman of the Association of Russian Peasant 
(Private) Farms and Agricultural Cooperatives [AKKOR], the 
fairly massive exodus of peasants from private farming is due to 
the fact that a "financial bottleneck" arose at the end of last 
year: The state dragged its feet paying for output which had 
already been delivered, and the banks harshly demanded the 
return of credits. Many peasant farms found themselves on the 
verge of bankruptcy and ruin. 
  According to Bashmachnikov, the situation has changed today. 
Some of the state debts have been paid off and credits have been 
extended, although at high interest rates. A search is under 
way to find sensible types of relations between private farmers 
and banking structures.

<F P=106> [Ivan Generalov report under the "In Brief" rubric: "Boris </F>
Fedorov's Fate Sealed?"] 
  [Text] It has come to light that V. Chernomyrdin's 
entourage is discussing a future candidate for finance minister. 
B. Fedorov's track record in this position has not only been 
coming under fire recently, but he is also being blamed for the 
results of the recent Russian parliamentary elections where the 
votes of the "marginals" bloc "formed" by the finance minister 
were of decisive importance for the defeat of Russia's Choice. 
  Few in the Russian Government dare to ignore Russian 
Federation presidential edicts the way B. Fedorov regularly 
does. The latest such example is B.N. Yeltsin's decision on 
repaying last year's debts to the defense complex in the first 
quarter of 1994. Judging by the reaction to the Russian 
Federation edict by the Finance Ministry under B. Fedorov, 
military enterprises will have to whistle for their 3 trillion 
rubles as they continue to go hat in hand. While the Defense 
Ministry is once again going to be singled out as the one to 
blame, the Finance Ministry stays in the shadows. 
  Moscow military men are known to have recently pinned on him 
the label of an "unsinkable aircraft carrier of the United 
States of America!?" 
  But now there have emerged serious signs of dissatisfaction 
with B. Fedorov also on the part of the United States. Strobe 
Talbott, "the top man in the United States in charge of 
stability of relations with Russia," has admitted to a narrow 
circle of people around him that the gamble on B. Fedorov was a 
mistake. Things have reached a point where his seat in the 
World Bank, regarded until recently as being "reserved for good" 
for him, was taken by someone else, and the Americans seem no 
longer to be trying to pitch direct links with B. Fedorov, as 
they would not like to take part of the blame for the state of 
the Russian economy. 
  It is not ruled out though that Fedorov has simply become a 
fall guy in the clash of two economic strategies residing 
together in the Russian Government. To fell this guy would be 
90 percent of his opponents' victory.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- On the eve of Russian 
Press Day, the government took steps to alleviate the worsening 
financial situation of the printed mass media. In particular, 
the government ordered a halt to the implementation of its own 
order issued on 25 November, "On the reassessment of the fixed 
assets of enterprises and organizations," in as much as the 
order concerns printing plants. In addition, instructions have 
been sent to federal ministries and departments with the aim of 
resolving the press's economic problems. 
  The 25 November order upset Russian journalists and editors 
because it led to an immediate sixfold raise in printing costs. 
  In particular, the Russian Federation Press Committee was 
given a month to draft proposals containing tax breaks for 
papers and journals, and children's, academic, and other 
socially significant literature. The committee must also 
prepare proposals on state subsidies for the printed mass media. 
  Another order instructs the Press Committee, the State 
Property Committee, and other involved departments to present to 
the government within two months proposals on the means of 
privatising printing plants with the participation of editorial 
and book publishing staff. 
  The November order on reassessing fixed assets almost led to 
a powerful protest action by Russian journalists, which would 
have been expressed in a temporary strike by the majority of 
publishing collectives. The order was the "last straw," which 
would have broken the financial back of the Russian press. In 
addition, the threat of strike forced the government to consider 
other problems, which have gone unsolved for years. The 
journalists' proposals were accepted by Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin during their recent meeting. 
  Judging by the latest order, the government will gradually 
lower the tax burden placed on periodicals and socially 
significant literature. As far as the system of state subsidies 
for newspapers and journals go, it will probably be meaningfully 
altered. Journalists do not like the current financing system 
because it makes them dependent on the government. The new 
financing system will probably include the proposals from 
editorial offices, which suggest that the government subsidize 
paper, printing, and communication needs. 
  The long-debated question of the participation of editorial 
staff in the privatisation of publishing-printing enterprises, 
if it is resolved in the affirmative, could enable journalists 
to be their own bosses instead of being hired labor. The most 
important accomplishment would be the destruction of the 
government monopoly on the country's printing base. 
  Naturally, all of this will come into being only if the 
instructions given to the government departments are really 
carried out.

<F P=106> [Report over video of Russian nuclear submarines introduced </F>
by journalist Aleksandr Ostrovskiy; from the "Poligon" program] 
  [Excerpt] [Ostrovskiy] Thoughts about the future of the 
Russian Navy are on the minds of naval servicemen, and they are 
not alone in this. Here are two reports by Igor Kondo and Jim 
Stuart, a U.S. military observer. 
  [Kondo over video of submarines in bay, attributed to 
VoyenTV] Because of the sharp reduction in Russia's military 
arsenals, the Navy's responsibility for ensuring Russia's 
security and sovereignty has increased. This applies in 
particular to our nuclear submarine fleet, since, in the near 
future, around 50 percent of Russia's strategic nuclear 
potential will be based on submarines. This nuclear potential 
will essentially be concentrated on the latest Typhoon-class 
submarines armed with strategic missiles. It is possible to 
claim with confidence that these submarines embody the best 
achievements of our modern science and technology. Saturated 
with modern electronics and armed with various types of missiles 
and torpedoes, designed to protect both underwater and surface 
targets from enemy attacks, these submarines are fitted with 20 
strategic missiles. They can strike from any position, from any 
part of the world ocean, and against any target. They have no 
fear of ocean depths or Arctic ice. These submarines are 
constantly in alert duty mode, irrespective of whether they are 
at sea or moored at base. Despite their huge dimensions -- they 
are more than 180 meters long and around 30 meters wide -- they 
have excellent maneuverability and their survivability is some 
40 percent higher than that of similar NATO-country submarines. 
In short, the Typhoon-class strategic nuclear missile-armed 
submarines are the pride and joy of our Navy and the guarantor 
of Russia's security. No other country in the world has such 
powerful modern submarines in its arsenal. It is no accident 
that foreign intelligence services watch these submarines 
closely. A Typhoon only has to put to sea and, in addition to 
enemy ASW ships, two U.S. Los Angeles-class multirole strike 
submarines immediately mount a search. 
  The Navy has more than enough problems at the moment. They 
include fuel and spare part shortages and expired overhaul 
deadlines. The very future of the Russian Navy is uncertain. 
New ships are not being built. All this is affecting 
navigational safety and places an additional burden on naval 
servicemen. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel I. Ivanov (according to footnote, "The </F>
author of these remarks is a colonel with the General Staff. 
For obvious reasons, we have decided to change his name") under 
the "Letters from Garrisons and Staffs" rubric: "In the 
Corridors of Military Power: General Vanity" -- from issue No. 
1 of "People's Army" section, described as "special issue for 
Russia's soldiers"] 
  [Text] Arbat Square. A high white-marble building with 
oak doors, a large contingent of armed guards. Few people have 
an opportunity to take a look here. And even fewer have the 
slightest general idea of what is actually happening here, what 
processes are under way, and where they might lead. Meanwhile 
our fellow citizens -- the taxpayers, in the West's parlance -- 
are entitled to know all this. 
  Right from the first few weeks of the Russian defense 
department's existence, the incumbent minister took a fancy to 
repeating that its apparatus would be significantly cut back. 
But what do we actually have today? The following figures were 
published not so long ago: Whereas in Yazov's time the Union 
Ministry of Defense had about 6,000 staffers, under Grachev 
their number has increased by a factor of 1.5 to almost 9,000. 
But even these "official" data are hardly credible. Because 
the numerical strength not just of the Ministry of Defense, but 
also of the Army as a whole is so secret that, in all 
likelihood, neither the minister, not his deputies, nor the 
president's advisers have any precise information. 
  Some six or eight weeks ago, presidential adviser D. 
Volkogonov said in an interview with ARGUMENTY I FAKTY that the 
Russian Army's numerical strength was 1.8 million men. In the 
last few days of last year, Colonel General M. Kolesnikov, chief 
of the Armed Forces General Staff, claimed in the newspaper 
SEGODNYA that our Army numbers 2.1 million men. At a press 
conference held literally the next day, General P. Grachev cited 
what he described as absolutely accurate figures -- 2.341 
million men.... You must agree that this difference of 241,000 
is quite a serious matter. It appears that the minister of 
defense has "found" 24 divisions somewhere, while the chief of 
General Staff has "lost" them.... You must agree: When there 
are such blatant discrepancies in the data used by the Army's 
top men, where is the certainty that they have accurately 
counted their apparatus? Thus, instead of 9,000, there might be 
10,000 or even 12,000.... 
  How was the concept of the current Ministry of Defense 
conceived and implemented? It was planned that, in 
organizational terms, the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense 
would comprise the General Staff and command and control organs 
subordinate either to deputy ministers of defense or directly to 
the minister. It ought to be specifically mentioned at this 
point that the process of forming the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Defense was left almost entirely at the military 
department's discretion. This gave a completely free hand to 
the top generals (who resurfaced in the wake of the August 1991 
events), enabling them not only to retain as many subdivisions 
as possible but also to create new ones. Even when the 
expediency of doing so was doubted by individual functionaries 
of the presidential or government apparatus or the Security 
Council. Incidentally, the control they exercised over the 
creation and reformation of the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Defense proved to be formal and ineffective. 
  Grachev launched "cutbacks" in the Ministry of Defense by 
increasing the number of his deputies. Never before in the 
Russian Army's entire history has the military minister had as 
many direct deputies as Pavel Sergeyevich has today -- seven, to 
be precise! Each one of them, of course, has his own apparatus. 
  Back in the past, Andrey Kokoshin's appearance in the 
ministry with the rank of first deputy minister of defense 
prompted sharp debates among the professional military. 
According to logic, this appointment should have symbolized a 
"weakening of the militarist spirit" and the stepping up of the 
military department's openness to civilian society. Kokoshin 
was assigned responsibility for implementing a new 
military-technical policy, organizing research and development, 
and ordering arms and military equipment. Since time 
immemorial, these matters have been decided by the General Staff 
in its capacity as the Armed Forces' "think tank," which 
actually determined the nature of the Army and the way it ought 
to be armed. The separation of these two functions was absurd 
from its very inception. 
  Many top generals in the military department admit that, 
during the 18 months of its existence, the influence exercised 
by Kokoshin's lot on military-technical policy in the Armed 
Forces has been identical to "the influence of a fly on the 
speed of a train rushing downhill." The reason is that 
virtually all projects of military-technical policy concerning 
the planning and coordination of research and development, the 
planning of series-production orders and long-term research in 
the sphere of new technologies, and mainly the actual 
implementation of plans, have been swept aside like houses of 
cards by the gigantic avalanche of financial shortages and the 
downfall of the defense industry and its scientific and 
technical potential (to almost 50 percent of its former level!). 
  Judge for yourselves: How can we talk of work efficiency in 
view of the facts that not a single ship's hull was laid last 
year, that only one of the almost 40 latest combat helicopters 
that the troops need so badly has been delivered, that the 
Russian Federation Air Force has not been allocated even 20 
percent of the combat craft it needs, and that the manufacture 
of aircraft for the Military Transport Aviation has come to a 
virtual halt? The ministry does not even have the money to pay 
for the reconditioning of old equipment. Everything that 
Kokoshin showed to journalists during his publicity trips to 
test sites and design bureaus had been conceived and implemented 
long before he arrived at the Ministry of Defense. 
Unfortunately, during the 18 months of its existence, the work 
efficiency of this newly formed apparatus has not undergone a 
single in-depth audit, and it has been mainly bogged down in the 
preparation of many hundreds of papers, instructions, and 
directives, most of which have remained unimplemented due to the 
agonizing state of the military-industrial complex. 
  The duplication of functional duties is typical of the 
organization of many of the present ministry's structures. 
Hence the excessive inflation of their staffs. The authors of 
the Ministry of Defense table of organization applied a flawed 
principle: They first created the directorate and only 
afterwards defined its tasks. Moreover, they lost sight of the 
logic of building up all the department's "stories." 
  The General Staff, for example, has a specialized 
directorate 
that is in charge of nuclear policy problems. It also has the 
Center for Military-Strategic Studies, whose attention is also 
focused on "nuclear" questions. But the Ministry of Defense 
structure also incorporates the National Nuclear Risk Reduction 
Center. The absurdity of such parallelism is obvious. It is 
also very expensive for the state, since all the aforementioned 
subdivisions employ a total of about 300 staffers -- several 
dozens of whom are generals. And yet, according to the opinion 
of competent specialists from the General Staff, the tasks of 
these structures could be tackled with equal efficiency by just 
one directorate with a total staff of some 60-70 officers. 
  There are quite a few examples of parallelism between 
Ministry of Defense and General Staff structures. We have 
already said that the General Staff includes the Center for 
Military-Strategic Studies. Its very name indicates that the 
subdivision in question -- by dint of the fact that it is part 
of the Armed Forces' "think tank" and by the nature of its 
activity -- cannot disregard questions of military 
organizational development or, consequently, questions of 
military reform. This is because reform is a strategic question 
of military organizational development at the present stage. 
But a Directorate of Military Organizational Development and 
Reform, directly subordinate to the minister, was also created 
on the initiative of the minister himself. Incidentally, it is 
as secret as the General Staff's Main Intelligence Directorate 
[GRU] when it comes to monitoring by structures of state power. 
It is no accident that it is also dubbed a ministry within the 
ministry. Many people in the military department today have 
realized with absolute clarity that this directorate is nothing 
but a decorative superstructure. The General Staff's scientific 
potential is sufficiently high to enable it to resolve with much 
greater efficiency the selfsame tasks that the minister has seen 
fit to assign to an "alien" structure. 
  Colonel General Boris Gromov, deputy minister of defense, is 
in charge of the Directorate for Implementation of Military 
Cooperation Programs with CIS member states. Another deputy 
minister of defense is, in parallel, in charge of the 
Directorate for International Military Cooperation which, in its 
turn, comprises an impressive number of directorate staffers. 
The selfsame deputy minister is also in charge of the 
International Treaty Directorate. A total of, once again, 
several hundred highly paid staffers who very frequently resolve 
identical tasks.... All these numerous directorates, 
duplicating one another, justify their existence by means of 
constant frenetic activity, which boils down to useless 
shuffling of cadres, offices, and subdivisions. 
  Ask any staffer of the Ministry of Defense or the General 
Staff what he has found most tiring in the recent past. You 
will get a unanimous answer: The endless organizational and 
cadre reshuffles. One main directorate chief admitted that 
people are already fed up with moving from one office to another 
and compiling sundry statutes, job descriptions, and 
instructions. Over the last 18 months, some Ministry of Defense 
directorates have undergone three or even four changes of their 
structure, name, job descriptions, subordination, and numerical 
strength. 
  The Russian Federation Ministry of Defense Main Directorate 
for Work with Personnel is in the throes of its umpteenth 
fundamental reformation. This time, evidently, due to the fact 
that quite a few Army votes were cast for Zhirinovskiy. But 
this is not the sole reason for the perceived need to disband or 
reduce this directorate. There is also the following reason: 
"Soldiers cannot be educated from Moscow." By extension of 
this logic, it can also be claimed that troops cannot be 
commanded from Moscow. 
  Here is another interesting question, often asked by 
taxpayers: Why is it that, despite the constant claims by 
military authorities that the Army and the Ministry of Defense 
are being cut back, the number of generals in the Armed Forces 
and the military department itself is steadily growing? There 
have been reports that Russia's 2 million-strong Army today has 
500 generals more than the 4 million-strong Soviet Army. Do you 
recall how, literally a few days before the April referendum, 
the president signed an edict awarding general's rank to almost 
150 officers.... Not a single army in the world today has so 
few soldiers per general as the Russian Army. 
  Today it can be boldly asserted that the absence of real 
reforms in Russia's Ministry of Defense, the mindless piling of 
some structures' functions onto others, and the unjustified 
inflation of staff strengths and the number of generals are the 
direct consequence of the lack of monitoring of the Ministry of 
Defense leadership's actions. The Ministry of Defense has 
remained, just as it has always been, "a law unto itself," a 
mysterious and inaccessible fortress in the heart of Moscow and 
Russia. It remains in the grips of cadre and management 
overstaffing, with generals manning the telephones of top 
chiefs, reading official mail, and being in charge of desk 
allocation, carpets, and light bulbs. This can be seen in the 
apparatus of Pavel Grachev himself, where the chief of 
secretariat (his office, in common parlance) wears a general's 
stars. And yet his work could be successfully tackled by an 
ensign or even a civilian employee. Or the office of secretary 
of the Ministry of Defense Collegium. Do you actually need a 
general to telephone all Collegium members and notify them of 
the time of the next session and then compile an account of its 
proceedings? 
  So far there has not been even a hint, as the saying goes, 
of 
proper reforms in Russia's Ministry of Defense. This is what 
has happened so far: The military department's table of 
organization has been redrawn on several occasions, the names of 
various structures have been changed, unsuitable men have been 
displaced and "their own" have replaced them. Incidentally, it 
ought to be especially emphasized that a primitive purge of 
unsuitable men from the apparatus is taking place under the 
guise of the ministry's reformation. Dozens of most experienced 
professionals -- colonels and generals -- have been taken off 
the ministry's strength in 1993 and subsequently dismissed. A 
similar purge is also expected now, in view of the fact that the 
Army and many honest officers -- cadre military men -- 
demonstrated their scorn for the incumbent reformers at the 
elections.

  [Text] Kiev -- Volodymyr Klymchuk, the chairman of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Ukraine [LDPU], assesses a 
Ukrainian-Russian-American meeting in Moscow to be a Ukrainian 
diplomatic success. Talking with a UNIAN correspondent, he 
pointed out that future negotiations testified to the fact that 
Ukraine was recognized as a partner possessing equal rights. 
The fact that negotiations were being held, in Volodymyr 
Klymchuk's view, means that the United States and Russia agree 
to make concessions, and it is quite possible that a decision 
will be made that will be favorable for Ukraine. "Anyway, 
political trading is better than war," the LDPU chairman said.

to comment on the expected meeting between the Ukrainian, 
Russian, and U.S. Presidents, Oles Shevchenko, the deputy 
chairman of the Ukrainian Republican Party and people's deputy 
of Ukraine said: "He who finds opportunities for talks and

added that he welcomed Leonid Kravchuk's decision to meet 
William Clinton in Kiev and take part in negotiations in Moscow. 
"I hope that decisions taken by the Ukrainian Parliament -- and 
that on the ratification of the START I Treaty in particular -- 
will be complied with in possible agreements," he noted.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuliya Mostovay: "Leonid Kravchuk's Meeting With </F>
Bill Clinton Is Likely To Be Held in Kiev Tomorrow"] 
  [Text] Bill Clinton will pay an official visit to Moscow 
between 12-15 January to meet Boris Yeltsin and try to determine 
what Russian power is like following the elections and the 
adoption of the new Constitution. These days, as a reward for 
exemplary behavior with regard to nuclear arms, the U.S. 
President will also visit Belarus. One can only guess why 
Ukraine was not included on the list of states to be visited by 
Clinton during his European tour. When and where Kravchuk and 
Clinton will meet is still unclear (as is unclear whether they 
will meet at all). There are many urgent issues demanding 
immediate resolution, the fate of Ukrainian nuclear arms being 
the most pressing one. 
  Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, who led the 
Ukrainian delegation at tripartite Ukrainian-Russian-U.S. talks, 
returned from the United States on 10 January. He said that the 
text of a tripartite agreement should have been drafted as a 
result of intensive negotiations, stipulating a formula for 
eliminating strategic missiles deployed on Ukrainian territory. 
The same agreement should have resolved the issue of security 
guarantees for Ukraine and of compensation for the nuclear arms 
to be eliminated. 
  However, according to CNN, U.S. Vice President Albert Gore 
stated in Washington on 10 January: "There is no such agreement. 
For a long time we have been trying to reach this kind of 
agreement with Russia and Ukraine. Right now, active work is 
under way, but the agreement has not been drafted, and there is 
no concrete plan for its signing." 
  The point is that a compromise has been achieved on some 
issues of contention, while other, quite serious ones, remain 
unresolved. There is no assurance that the text of the agreement 
will be ready by 12 January as a result of quick diplomatic work. 
  In this case, the question arises regarding the expediency 
of 
Leonid Kravchuk's visit to Moscow. Massandra has demonstrated 
that the Ukrainian president is not very good at playing it by 
ear. Thus, it may not be the best solution to sign a vitally 
important document not having coordinated all its aspects. 
Neither is it advisable to fill in the gaps in the document 
under pressure from the two other presidents. Even if the text 
of the agreement drafted by experts is ready, is it really 
necessary to sign it in Moscow? In world practice, such 
documents are signed on neutral territories following bilateral 
meetings of all signatories. 
  Thus, it is quite possible that if the final draft is not 
ready Bill Clinton will still find a couple of hours to meet 
Kravchuk in Kiev on 12 January. The more so that aside from 
nuclear issues the two presidents have things to talk about. 
Work on preparing the basic document for bilateral relations, 
the Ukrainian-U.S. Charter,is nearing completion. There are 
issues of economic cooperation, European and global security, 
and developing the ideas of "Partnership for Peace" to discuss. 
  This variant does not rule out the possibility of resolving 
still unresolved issues. In this case, the signing of the 
tripartite agreement is possible both during President Clinton's 
visit to Moscow and in a neutral state in the immediate future. 
It may take a couple of hours to make the decision, and a 
couple of minutes to change the schedule of President Clinton's 
visit. However, taking into account the importance of possible 
consequences, it would be very undesirable to have Ukraine sign 
the agreement under pressure or under time constraints. This 
would be too high a price that Ukraine would pay for the triumph 
of Bill Clinton's CIS policies. After the fiasco of the latter's 
foreign strategy in Somalia and former Yugoslavia, this triumph 
might come in handy.

<F P=106> [Report by Mariya Starozhitskaya of UNIAN under general </F>
heading: "Russia Pleased With NATO's Decision, Ukraine Pleased 
With Clinton's Arrival, East Europe Disappointed"] 
  [Text] Kiev -- The accord on a meeting in Kiev with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton 12 January and on a 
Ukrainian-Russian-U.S. meeting in Moscow 14 January was a 60th 
birthday gift for President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  Citing THE SUNDAY TIMES, Ukrainian television reported a 
U.S. 
Christmas present -- $12 billion in compensation for the 
complete elimination of nuclear weapons from the republic's 
territory. 
  With this turn of events -- the sums offered previously did 
not exceed $500 million -- Ukrainian politicians of both the 
right wing and the left wing have, on the whole, approved of the 
prospect of signing the agreement. "A document on such a level 
could play an important role in stabilizing public opinion, but 
the interests of the three sides will hardly coincide in the 
details," A. Moroz, head of the Socialist Party of Ukraine, 
believes. 
  Given such compensation, according to V. Filenko, leader of 
the democratic opposition, the Ukrainian Supreme Council should 
not have any complaints against the treaty. "Finances sober up 
politics," he said. "Economically, we cannot now afford nuclear 
weapons, and the hryvnya needs a stabilization fund, which can 
no longer be gotten anywhere." According to some data, there 
was talk in Washington of a considerably smaller sum, and the 
agreement of Congress is still needed to issue it. In the 
opinion of V. Chornovil, leader of the Ukraine People's 
Movement, President Kravchuk does not have powers to sign 
international documents on nuclear disarmament. "After the act 
of full and unconditional disarmament Ukraine would be thrust 
into the backwoods of the world community, and interest in it 
would be lost forever," he said. "There is hope, however, that 
parliament -- the future agreement is subject to compulsory 
ratification by it -- will not give its consent to this." 
  Kiev regards the change in the original plan of Bill 
Clinton's European tour as almost the most significant victory 
for Ukrainian diplomacy over the past year.

  [Text] During the meeting between Ukrainian President 
Kravchuk and U.S. President Bill Clinton, a wide range of issues 
concerning bilateral Ukrainian-U.S. relations will be discussed. 
This was stated by Viktor Stelmakh, head of the Ukrainian 
Council of Ministers' and presidential press service on 12 
January in an interview with the NOVYNY Television and Radio 
Agency. He pointed out: It is not difficult to predict that 
both issues of bilateral economic relations and nuclear problems 
will prevail at the meeting. As has been underlined by the U.S. 
and Ukrainian sides, it is time the dialogue was expanded and 
not reduced to problems of nuclear disarmament. Attention 
should be paid to economic cooperation and bilateral ties. 
Viktor Stelmakh emphasized that given the importance of issues 
to be discussed on 12 January by Presidents Kravchuk and 
Clinton, the Ukrainian-U.S. summit will be of great importance 
for building mutual understanding between the two states and for 
the entire world community.

<F P=106> [Opening remarks by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk at </F>
joint news conference with U.S. President Bill Clinton from the 
Borispol airport near Kiev--live] 
  [Text] [Kravchuk] Esteemed ladies and gentlemen: I am glad 
to welcome the President of the United States of America, Bill 
Clinton, and the persons accompanying him in Ukraine. Of 
course, I am sorry that this visit is brief, however, I hope 
that the U.S. President will visit Ukraine on a full-scale 
basis, appropriately, and we shall be able to show him Ukraine 
as it is. I invite you, Mr. President, to visit Ukraine 
whenever this is most convenient for you. This was a short 
visit which had lasted only several hours but, in my opinion, it 
was worth several-day long negotiations because those problems 
which we discussed and what has just been mentioned by Mr. 
President are really worth the world's interest in what we 
agreed on and in the documents which we are to sign in Moscow. 
  I believe that the most important issue for Ukraine, for 
Europe, and for the entire world is the nuclear issue. We have 
approached its solution in concrete terms. I am convinced that 
this day and the coming days open the way before the world for 
disarmament and nuclear armaments elimination. Ukraine will 
fulfill its obligations, Ukraine will not be in the way of 
nuclear disarmament. 
  Naturally, the major part of our consultations was devoted 
to 
discussing various aspects of Ukrainian-American relations. I 
am pleased to note that the American side, the U.S. President, 
support our state's sovereignty and independence in the 
difficult time of our formation as a nation. I believe that 
such assistance is a specific form of partnership for the sake 
of developing democracy in Ukraine, for the sake of democratic 
processes on the territory of the former Soviet Union. I am 
convinced that the charter of partnership, friendship, and 
cooperation whose text is being worked up by our experts and is 
near completion, will become a very important stage in the 
development of our mutual relations. Very important for us is 
the understanding on the part of U.S. President of the problems 
facing the economy and the problems of the economic reform and 
support of the economic reform in Ukraine. I am satisfied with 
the fact that the U.S. President will support our state at the 
international financial structures, such as the International 
Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development. 
  We are aware of the fact that resoluteness and 
responsibility 
for the implementation of the economic reform are required, and 
we are ready for this. We are also satisfied with the fact that 
trade relations between our countries are developing today and 
that new prospects for their development will open up. 
  We support the U.S. initiative concerning its formula called 
Partnership for Peace. We believe that this is a universal 
formula involving all states and providing them with an 
opportunity to participate. We understand that this program 
cannot solve all the security problems, but it provides an 
opportunity for all the states to take an active part in the 
program. 
  I would like to welcome, once again, the President of the 
United States of America to Ukraine and express satisfaction 
with the fact that we reached relevant understanding and common 
points of view on all the issues which we discussed. Although 
brief, today's meeting was very important and productive. It 
opened up a qualitatively new page in Ukrainian-American 
relations which from now on, I am sure, will have a stable and 
reliable future. 
  I thank everybody for their attention.

  [Text] Kiev January 12 TASS -- Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk confirmed that he would fly to Moscow to sign on Friday 
[14 January] an agreement with Russia and the United States 
which will oblige Ukraine to give up its nuclear weapons 
inherited from the former Soviet Union. 
  "Ukraine will carry out its obligations and will not stand 
in 
the way of nuclear disarmament", Kravchuk told a press 
conference on Wednesday after talks with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton. 
  The U.S. President stressed that the Ukrainian decision to 
become nuclear free opens wide prospects for it in getting 
economic aid from various international financial institutions. 
  The "Partnership for Peace" plan provides Ukraine with a 
possibility to cooperate with the armed forces of the United 
States and NATO which will also promote Ukrainian security, 
according to Clinton. 
  The agreement will enhance the security of the three parties 
and the entire world, Clinton said. 
  Kravchuk thanked the U.S. President for his active promotion 
of cooperation between the two countries.

<F P=106> [Question and answer session during a joint news conference </F>
by President Leonid Kravchuk and U.S. President Bill Clinton 
with domestic and foreign correspondents at the Borispol airport 
near Kiev -- live; Clinton speaks in English with 
passage-by-passage translation into Ukrainian; processed from 
the English] 
  [Excerpts] [Kravchuk] Mr. President, I will allow myself to 
play the role of press secretary. I give the floor--an 
opportunity to ask a question--to our guests, to journalists 
from the United States of America. 
  [Correspondent, in English] (?Walt Lister) of CNN. What 
exactly must your parliament now do to ratify this agreement, 
and exactly how long will it take for Ukraine to become a 
non-nuclear nation? 
  [Kravchuk] Philosophers say everything is changing in this 
world. Life is changing. One cannot even step twice in the 
same place in a river. This is why our parliament, as life goes 
on, is becoming wiser. Our parliament, as life goes on, sees 
the realities. I am convinced that it will understand the 
essence of the great problem that is facing the world today, the 
essence of our relations. With the mutual desire of the three 
states--the United States of America, Ukraine, and Russia--we 
will fulfill our obligations, and the parliament will support us. 
  Now, a question from the Ukrainian side, please. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Kravchuk] On the American side, please. A lady there. 
  [Correspondent, in English] Thank you, and happy birthday, 
President Kravchuk! [passage omitted] 
  [Kravchuk] Thank you for your congratulations, and I would 
like to express my satisfaction with the gentlemanliness of our 
correspondent here, who mentioned Mrs. Clinton. Of course, I 
would be glad if she were here, and we all could see her. 
  Now, again I give an opportunity to a lady. Maybe I will 
receive yet another greeting from her. 
  [Correspondent] I echo the previous greeting, and I would 
like to ask this question: There is a shortage at times of 
those who are supposed to fulfill programs. In other words, 
they are unwilling to go to Ukraine because of the uncertain 
situation there. Where are the guarantees that the agreements 
that were achieved today will be implemented? 
  [Kravchuk] If I were to answer this question, I would say 
that the guarantees are here in Ukraine. We will receive the 
attitude that we deserve according to the results of our work. 
Abstract guarantees do not exist. 
  [Clinton] If I might add just one point: Sometimes in 
discussions with nations, some actual guarantees do not 
materialize because they are dependent on decisions made by 
other parties--usually the World Bank or the International 
Monetary Fund. In this case, every part of our agreement 
depends only upon the three presidents and their governments to 
keep their word. And I told-- the first thing I said 
to--President Kravchuk tonight is that I would do everything I 
could to make sure that all three of us did exactly what was in 
the agreement, and I am confident that we will. 
  [Kravchuk] I have the greatest responsibility. I feel it as 
a press secretary--that there is a protocol. However, this is 
the last question, and I must allow you to ask it. 
  [Correspondent, in English] Mr. President. Mr. President 
Clinton. You mentioned the PFP--the Partnership for Peace--and 
there are some people who say that Russia has been using a type 
of passive imperialism in order to keep countries of Eastern 
Europe and Central Europe out of NATO for the time being by 
threatening destabilization. Do you agree with that? And I 
would be very interested in what President Kravchuk has to say. 
  [Clinton] No, I don't. I think.... [interrupted by 
interpreter who translates question into Ukrainian] The short 
answer to the question is that I do not agree with that, 
although President Yeltsin himself has expressed reservations 
about NATO membership for other countries if Russia is excluded. 
He, you know, he has expressed an interest in being a member 
himself. The leaders of NATO concluded that they should not 
offer membership at this time to any country because they 
weren't sure any country was ready to assume the 
responsibilities of membership and because they did not want to 
exclude anyone else. [passage omitted] 
  [Kravchuk] Mr. Clinton came to my help, and I give the right 
to the Ukrainian side to ask one more question. 
  [Correspondent] Which security guarantees will be provided 
by the United States and Russia to Ukraine after it acquires a 
non-nuclear status? [passage omitted] 
  [Kravchuk] Esteemed ladies and gentlemen. I would like to 
use yet another opportunity to say that we will compensate for 
our brief meeting with additional meetings, where we will begin 
to fulfill our obligations. You will contribute to this with 
unbiased coverage of the events in Ukraine and Ukraine's role in 
Europe and in the world. It would be best now to wish President 
Clinton a good journey. Good-bye. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kiev, 13 Jan -- A brief visit by U.S. President Bill 
Clinton to Ukraine ended late at night. A consultative meeting 
between Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Bill Clinton 
took place at Borispol airport. 
  They discussed a wide range of issues connected with the 
present state and prospects for the development of the 
Ukrainian-American relations. In parallel, Ukrainian-American 
talks were held in which Acting Prime Minister Yefim 
Zvyagilskiy, Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and other 
officials took part on the Ukrainian side. 
  At night, when the talks ended, the U.S. president flew to 
Moscow. 
  Earlier the presidents held a press conference at the 
airport. Answering questions from journalists Bill Clinton said, 
inter alia, that Ukraine's decision to become a nuclear-free 
state opens for it broad possibilities of getting economic aid 
from different international organizations. The fact that 
Ukraine understands the "Partnership for Peace" formula provides 
it with a possibility of cooperation with U.S. and NATO armed 
forces, something which will promote Ukraine's security, too. 
  During the meeting with journalists, the heads of two states 
told them about various aspects of the talks that had taken 
place. Kravchuk thanked Bill Clinton for his active assistance 
in the cause of developing cooperation between the two states. 
  After the press conference Kravchuk announced that he was 
prepared to give a television interview to national television 
and CNN.

"Bill, would you disarm if you were in the same cage as the 
Russian bear?"

  [Text] Regarding the meeting in Kiev between the 
presidents of the United States and Ukraine scheduled for today, 
Yuriy Sergeyev, head of the information service, stated at a 
news briefing at Ukraine's Foreign Ministry that it will be 
devoted to discussing the final text of a document on the future 
of Ukrainian nuclear weapons. This document is expected to be 
signed in Moscow on 14 January by the Presidents of the United 
States, Ukraine, and Russia. According to Sergeyev, there is 
still no final text of the document, and it is still unknown 
whether it is going to be an agreement, treaty, statement, 
communique, or declaration of three sides. As is known, a 
treaty and an agreement are subject to ratification by the 
Ukrainian parliament, whereas a communique, statement, or a 
declaration do not need this. 
  Yuriy Sergeyev also stated that should the text of the 
document not be agreed on in Moscow, the tripartite meeting will 
be of a consultative nature, the same as recent similar talks in 
Kiev, Moscow, and Washington. Responding to a question about 
possible condemnation by the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet of Leonid 
Kravchuk's activity, Yuriy Sergeyev said that the signed 
document should take into consi.... [apparent line drop in

  [Text] Kiev, 12 Jan -- As Anatoliy Matviyenko, a member of 
the Supreme Council presidium told a UNIAR correspondent on 11 
January, Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch urgently 
interrupted his holiday to return to Kiev. He held a meeting 
with the participation of presidium members of the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council and the leadership of the secretariat. They 
decided to hold on 12 January a joint meeting of the Supreme 
Council standing commissions. 
  As Matviyenko noted, the urgent convening of the meeting is 
connected with the Kravchuk and Clinton meeting and in 
particular with the possibility of signing, on 14 January in 
Moscow, a document on issues of disarmament. Since, in the 
opinion of some deputies, the signing of such a document by 
Kravchuk is a direct violation of current legislation and 
Ukraine's Constitution and contradicts many points of the 
conditions to the ratification of the START Treaty of 18 
November, Ukraine's Supreme Council should draw up a single 
position on these issues.

  [Text] Kiev -- As Borys Bazylevskyy, head of the Supreme 
Council Foreign Affairs Commission Secretariat, told a UNIAN 
correspondent on 12 January, "the meeting between the presidents 
of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia should be ponderable, 
but the decision reached could contradict a decision by the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council. Everything depends on whether the 
United States will have an understanding attitude to Ukraine's 
position and its economic situation. In Ukraine the attitude to 
this meeting is not unequivocal." 
  Borys Bazylevskyy added that today members of the commission 
are working on the ratification of conventions and international 
agreements that will be discussed at the next session.

  [Text] Kiev -- On 11 January, acting Prime Minister Yukhym 
Zvyahilskyy gave a private dinner, where he discussed numerous 
issues concerning bilateral economic cooperation with members of 
the Israeli delegation. In an interview with a UNIAN 
correspondent, Moshe Shahal, minister of police, energy, and 
infrastructure, noted: "With regard to our state's participation 
in the structure of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation meeting 
[ChES] on the basis of an associate member as Ivan Plyushch, 
speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, had proposed during a visit 
to Israel, Tel Aviv believes in such interaction, and considers 
that real grounds exist for fruitful regional cooperation in the 
Black Sea basin. [no closing quotation mark as received] 
  Israel took part in the last ChES that was held in December 
in Sofia. As competent persons from Ukraine's Foreign Economic 
Relations Ministry added, the foundation of the ChES 
international community is still in an organizational stage of 
being founded, and participation in it by new members, apart 
from the 11 real members (Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, Greece, 
Bulgaria, Azerbaijan, Albania, Georgia, Armenia, Romania, 
Moldova) in particular, of Poland and Israel, is highly 
probable. At the end of January a consultative meeting is 
planned between the Ukrainian and Turkish side, possibly with 
the participation of other states that will ascertain this and 
other prospects for continuing cooperation in the region. 
  According to preliminary information from Ukraine's Foreign 
Affairs Ministry, the Ukrainian initiative on creating a coastal 
trade zone will be put on the agenda. At the moment, this is 
being discussed by the appropriate structures of the ChES member 
countries.

  [Text] Beijing January 12 TASS -- The Chinese Armed Forces 
will never act as an aggressor. But they will not tolerate any 
aggression against China either, Deputy Chairman of the Chinese 
Central Military Council, Zhang Zhen, said. 
  The statement was made at Zhen's [as received] meeting with 
visiting Kazakh Defence Minister Sagadat Nurmagambetov. Zhen 
said the Chinese Army is based on the concept of active defence 
and bears full responsibility for the preservation of the 
socialist system in China. 
  Nurmagambetov praised the achievements of economic reform in 
China. The XINHUA news agency quoted him as saying that "we 
should learn Chinese experience." 
  The minister expressed satisfaction with the results of his 
visit the aim of which he formulated before his departure to 
Beijing as follows: "The establishment of personal contacts 
with Chinese colleagues and development of friendly relations 
between the armies of the two countries."

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by Kazakh State adviser Tulegen </F>
Zhukeyev on 12 January; place not given] 
  [Text] State advisor Tulegen Zhukeyev held a news 
conference on 12 January. He informed Kazakh and foreign 
journalists about state of developments in political and 
military ties between Kazakhstan and Russia. Zhukeyev noted in 
particular that last year the two countries signed at various 
levels a package of key documents on broadening military 
cooperation. Touching upon the use of Baykonur, the state 
advisor stressed that this important strategic object after the 
forthcoming summit talks would be likely to be let to the 
Russian military department [defense ministry]. 
  All work connected with the exploration of space will be 
conducted in future in the interests of Kazakhstan and Russia. 
A research space company is intended to be set up in future to 
work for the benefit of both states. A first step has been 
taken in restructuring the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing site, 
which has some unique equipment. In addition, the idea of 
organizing a national nuclear center in Kazakhstan was discussed. 
  Zhukeyev said that between Kazakhstan and Russia a complete 
mutual understanding has been reached concerning building of 
military and political ties. This once more vividly shows that 
our two countries do not have a single problem which it were not 
possible to tackle on the basis of good will.

<F P=106> [Anatoliy Ladin report: "Still No Dual Citizenship in </F>
Kazakhstan, but Society Already Split in Disputes Over It"] 
  [Text] The question of the possibility of some 
Kazakhstanis' acquiring dual citizenship is still a subject of 
discussion in the republic's mass media. The newspaper ABC 
[literally ABV -- first three letters of Cyrillic alphabet], 
published by the "Karavaninform" Joint-Stock Company, reports 
that the Sokolovsk-Sarbay Production Association collective sent 
an appeal to Kazakhstan's president which, in addition to 
economic demands, raised the questions of dual citizenship, the 
recognition of Russian (a language of international 
communication) as a state language together with Kazakh, and the 
appropriate amendment of Kazakhstan's Constitution. 
  Yermukhamet Yertysbayev, secretary of the Socialist Party of 
Kazakhstan Political Executive Committee, answering questions 
asked by the sociopolitical newspaper RESPUBLIKA's [as 
transliterated] correspondent, stressed the need for state 
bilingualism in Kazakhstan. At the same time he voiced the view 
that the dual citizenship initiative should come from Russia and 
Kazakhstan at once. "If Russians living in Kazakhstan want 
this," Yermukhamet Yertysbayev believes, "Kazakhs living in 
Russia should be accorded similar rights." 
  However, there is also a totally different view of the 
matter. Some experts predict that dual citizenship could prove 
not an advantage but grounds for restricting rights. By 
becoming a Russian citizen a person, as it were, ceases to be a 
"committed" Kazakhstani. Hence the authorities' attitude to him 
may be that of a potential "foreign visitor." And problems may 
crop up at work: Should a person, say, be allowed access to 
state secrets and his career rise encouraged if he is also a 
citizen of another state? 
  During the election campaign in Kazakhstan the questions of 
state bilingualism and dual citizenship will most likely be used 
by candidate deputies to win over voters.

  [From the "Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] The question of Baykonur has come up again. In Almaty 
today, Kazakh State Secretary Tulegen Zhukeyev held a briefing 
on the problem of the Baykonur cosmodrome. During the briefing, 
Zhukeyev said Kazakhstan was prepared to lease the Baykonur 
cosmodrome and three military test sites to Russia for seven 
billion dollars per year. He said Russia has not yet responded 
to this proposal. 
  It is much easier to reach agreement with the United States 
and Iran than with Russia, Zhukeyev said. Efforts to resolve 
the Baykonur problem were begun during the recent visit to 
Almaty by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The 
construction of a new cosmodrome is not a realistic option for 
Russia, and Kazakhstan spends up to three billion [currency not 
specified] on Baykonur every year. Therefore, Zhukeyev 
considers, it would be a good idea to receive from Russia 
military equipment at prices acceptable to our ally in 
compensation for this money. 
  In regards to the Russian military departments that are 
seeking to legitimize the permanent stationing of their units in 
Kazakhstan, the republic's leadership considers that this is 
incorrect. How can we explain this to Kazakh citizens, who are 
still afraid of the Russian empire, Zhukeyev asked. He 
acknowledged, however, that Russia was the center of the CIS and 
that its strategic interests should be taken into account.

  [Text] On Wednesday the Latvian Foreign Ministry handed 
over a note addressed to the Russian Foreign Ministry and 
containing apologies for the incident with Russian servicemen 
and diplomats to the Russian Embassy in Riga. 
  The document says that "with the sanction of several 
officials of Riga's local government bodies and under their 
direct participation, on January 10, 1994, illegal actions were 
undertaken with respect to Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh 
and Major Generals Nikolay Taylakov and Anatoliy Vodopyanov who 
serve in the Northern-Western Group of Forces." 
  The generals were detained by the municipal police and, 
accompanied by the guard, were sent in the direction of the 
Russian-Latvian border to be deported from Latvia. The generals 
were freed according to the private order of the president of 
the Latvian Republic. 
  Latvia's Foreign Ministry offers its apologies for this 
action. 
  The Foreign Ministry explains that a preliminary 
investigation was conducted due to the above mentioned incident; 
as a result, the Cabinet of Ministers passed a decision to 
release chairman of the local government body in Riga's 
Vidzemskiy region Andreis Rucs from his post; the Prosecutor's 
Office of the Latvian Republic has launched proceedings due to 
abuse of official authorities on the part of Rucs. 
  Given the fact that these actions were committed on the eve 
of the inter-state talks, the Latvian party views this event as 
an attempt by Latvian circles to hinder process of the 
negotiations and to worsen Russian-Latvian relations. 
  The document says that the Government of the Latvian 
Republic 
will do its utmost to prevent identical acts of provocative 
nature and notes that in the future all issues related to the 
Russian forces' withdrawal will be solved by means of 
negotiations. 
  Rita Aksenoka, aide to Latvia's Prosecutor General, told 
Interfax that on Wednesday Andreis Rucs voluntarily came to the 
prosecutor's office. At present he is being interrogated. 
  Speaking at a briefing in the Russian capital some time 
earlier, spokesman of Russian Foreign Ministry Grigory Karasin 
declared that Moscow "awaits an expanded official answer of the 
Latvian party regarding our demarches." 
  "Taking into consideration that the January 10 events were 
the most serious, though not the first one, provocation of 
Latvia's extreme nationalist forces it is important that all 
concrete organizers of this action will be punished and Latvian 
authorities will undertake necessary measures to prevent similar 
dangerous incidents in the future," emphasized Karasin.

  [Text] The Foreign Affairs Ministry Press Center of the 
Republic of Latvia reports that the Foreign Affairs Ministry has 
submitted a note to the Russian Federation embassy in Latvia. 
  In the note, the ministry apologizes for the incident of 10 
January, and explains that preliminary investigation has been 
made into the case and the person guilty of it was dismissed 
from office. As the above-mentioned incident happened on the 
very eve of the interstate talks, Latvia considers it as an 
attempt by certain circles in Latvia to hamper the progress of 
the talks and complicate interstate relations. 
  The note says that the Latvian Government will do everything 
possible to ward off such provocations in future, and stresses 
that in future all the issues related to the withdrawal of the 
Russian Army will also be tackled by way of talks.

<F P=106> [Report by Irina Litvinova: "Latvia and Russia Were on </F>
Brink of Armed Conflict. Arrest of Two Russian Generals: 
Analysis and Consequences"] 
  [Text] Riga -- "The likelihood of an armed conflict was 
very real indeed," Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs stated in 
an interview with Latvian television regarding the seizure in 
Riga 10 January of two Russian generals and several military 
installations. 
  The order to arrest Major Generals Anatoliy Vodopyanov and 
Nikolay Taylakov, who had arrived to investigate illegal 
activities involving the seizure of Russian military 
installations, was issued by Andrejs Rucs, leader of Riga's 
Vidzeme suburb. That evening Latvian television viewers were 
able to watch the moment of the arrest on television: Guards 
led away the handcuffed Russian servicemen to a minibus. Then, 
escorted by the municipal police, the "prisoners" were taken to 
the Latvian-Russian border. They were held somewhere in a 
forest where they were threatened and insulted. The area where 
this incident took place was cordoned off by armed personnel who 
would not even let through a car bearing the diplomatic license 
plate of Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh, who was 
threatened with an assault rifle. A protest note about this 
incident was later sent to the Latvian Foreign Ministry. 
  "The damage done to Latvia today, on the eve of the NATO 
conference in Brussels and the Yeltsin-Clinton meeting and at 
the start of another round of talks with the Russian delegation, 
cannot be overestimated," Foreign Ministry head G. Andrejevs 
acknowledged. 
  A delegation headed by Special Envoy Sergey Zotov flew to 
Riga from Moscow 10 January in order to clarify the position 
regarding the treaty on the withdrawal of Russian troops from 
Latvia. It seemed that a rapprochement of positions was 
possible which would finally have allowed both parties to sign 
documents that are important for both countries. At the airport 
Colonel General Leonid Mayorov, commander of the Northwestern 
Group of Forces, informed the Russian delegation about what had 
happened. After shaking hands with Martins Virsis, head of the 
Latvian delegation at the talks, Sergey Zotov informed him that 
the negotiations would be postponed until the situation had been 
fully investigated, the servicemen released, and explanations 
received from the Latvian leadership. 
  Colonel General Mayorov, commander of the Northwestern Group 
of Forces, said that what had happened "is not an incident, it 
is an unprecedented provocation." He announced that some 
Russian subunits had been moved up to Riga. Defense Minister 
Grachev had been notified of what has happened, and he in turn 
had informed President Yeltsin of the events in Riga. According 
to Mayorov, airborne troops, transport and combat-zone aviation, 
and naval units stationed on Russian territory had been placed 
on combat alert. Mayorov announced that Latvian President 
Guntis Ulmanis, with whom the commander has been in contact in 
order to settle the situation, had assumed a constructive 
position. Consequently both generals had been released. 
  President Ulmanis received news of the arrest of the 
servicemen during the latest session of the National Security 
Council -- this was announced in a statement circulated by the 
president's press service. The session was interrupted, and all 
security services were issued with a directive to find and 
release the detainees. The statement says that A. Rucs had 
ordered the guards to resist all attempts to free the generals, 
even if the attempts were made by Latvian security services. 
The statement terms Rucs' actions "provocative" and says that 
he exceeded his powers. It is acknowledged that the conflict 
could have resulted in casualties. The Latvian Foreign Ministry 
statement gives a similar assessment of the actions taken by 
Latvian officials. It is indicated that issues concerning the 
withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia should be resolved 
through negotiations.

Foreign Ministry for eastern affairs, today summoned to the 
Foreign Ministry Valeriy Nesterushkin, counsellor to the 
ambassador of the Russian embassy in Latvia, to express 
bewilderment in connection with the statement by Russian 
Presidential Press Secretary Kostikov; the statement declared 
that in the future, when responding to incidents like that in 
Riga on 10 January, Russia will act taking into account American 
experience. 
  Vovers stressed that the ministry expressed bewilderment 
over 
this statement, because Latvia has already officially apologized 
to Russia, and the Latvian Government has categorically 
condemned the action by the guilty party and a criminal case has 
been started by the Latvian prosecutor's office.

  [Text] Participants in today's session of the Saeima 
foreign affairs commission concluded that the detention of 
Russian army generals and an attempt to detain Russian 
Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh by Andrejs Rucs, head of the 
Vidzeme district council, have dented the country's image. As 
members of the commission stressed, the incident revealed 
several shortcomings in the Latvian legislation and the defense 
system. This action was to a great extent facilitated by the 
ill-sorted legislation of the country. 
  Rucs formally acted in accordance with the law on local 
government property, which provides for taking over the army 
property situated on the territory of local governments, but 
there are no rules as to how the takeover should proceed. 
  The chairman of the commission, Aleksandr Kirsteins, had 
been 
informed about the planned takeover of military installations 
belonging to the Russian army in Vidzeme district of Riga, but 
he did not know how it would proceed. In addition, the plan of 
that action was not discussed by the foreign affairs commission, 
as Rucs has claimed in an interview to the ATMODA ATPUTAI 
newspaper. 
  Latvia's Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs for his part 
expressed indignation that the government had not been informed 
about such an action, because the Latvian Government has to take 
all responsibility now. 
  Martins Virsis, head of the Latvian delegation for talks 
with 
Russia, admitted at the commission's session that Russia's 
reaction to that incident was nevertheless much sharper than is 
internationally accepted. According to Martins Virsis, Rucs' 
actions were not serious enough to cause the mobilization of the 
Pskov division near the Latvian border.

Latvian-Russian interstate talks on the issue of the definition 
of the status of the Skrunda radar station. This was reported 
today by the head of the Russian delegation, Sergey Zotov. 
  Zotov explained that disagreements in the opinions of the 
two 
delegations on draft agreements on the status of the Skrunda 
radar, and the period for which it will remain in Latvia, as 
well as on social security for the Russian military personnel 
are the only obstacles that hamper the signing of the joint 
agreement on the withdrawal of the Russian Army.

place and date not given: "P. Gylys Welcomes `Shadow' Cabinet"] 
  [Text] "People are currently most concerned with the 
indexation of savings, compensation, and benefits," said 
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys sharing his 
impressions after a meeting with his constituents in the Utena 
region. However, the audience also asked numerous questions 
about our relations with Russia after Zhirinovskiy's success in 
the elections. Even rural people were interested in whether we 
would join NATO, as well as other foreign policy issues. 
Journalists Violeta Gaizauskaite and Algimantas Zukas also had 
some questions for the minister, who is celebrating his first 
anniversary in office. P. Gylys "had a session" with 
journalists at the Foreign Ministry Collegium. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] How could you assess the past year in 
politics? Do you think, as foreign minister, that you have 
fulfilled all commitments? 
  [Gylys] Well, I am, probably, supposed to demonstrate severe 
self-criticism now .... Assuming this position, I understood 
perfectly well that I would not manage to accomplish everything 
I wanted. I do not want to underrate the work of Mr. A. 
Saudargas [former minister]. I see, however, that the formation 
of the system will continue for several years. When the 
International Relations Institute releases its first 
"production," we will have more young people who know several 
West European languages. If we succeed in creating a state 
machine that works in a new style in some five years, the state 
will remain stable even when ministers change. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] However, many Foreign Ministry employees 
have found other, often better-paying jobs. Do you not think 
that such "migration" results from the fact that people do not 
see a prospect for making a good diplomatic career? What 
decides the appointment of one or another official to important 
diplomatic positions? 
  [Gylys] I would not like to agree with you, because it is 
over recent months that we have tried to show people that their 
work is valued. They know that those people who work in the 
ministry and Lithuania's diplomatic missions abroad will rotate. 
A large group of our employees has gone to work in our missions 
in Washington, Vienna, and Helsinki. We invite people from 
other offices because it is difficult to find those of an 
ambassadorial scale. Neither the president nor I put any 
"political" questions to appointed ambassadors. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] One can notice that former high-ranking 
suppliers and traders usually go to the East. With what is such 
"economic" tendency associated? 
  [Gylys] The press mocks us by saying that nothing has come 
out of "economization," while you notice that real economists 
become ambassadors. However, this was not some deliberate 
selection. I would not stress the diplomats' former occupation. 
"Economization" is an unfinished process: We wanted to achieve 
much more, but I could not assess everything as damaging. By 
May of 1994, we must draft a free trade agreement with the 
European Union. We have prepared a program on joining GATT. 
These agreements must be drafted with the smallest painful 
effect, because the opening of the Lithuanian market implies 
competition, which is not always gentlemanly. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] What should be the role of the Foreign 
Policy Coordination Council, the existence of which is not 
projected in the Constitution, by the way? 
  [Gylys] I would like to be frank. However, I would not be 
pleased if my sincerity was used against me.... The president's 
office was a new institution, and I was a new minister. 
Therefore, the "circulation" of information between this office 
and the ministry was not too good in the beginning, but things 
have improved now. Political strife is often waged in the 
Seimas [parliament] Foreign Affairs Committee, thus, the latter 
is more difficult to communicate with. By the way, information 
about the committee's activities that reaches the Foreign 
Ministry is insufficient. The new council will help to know 
better who does what, and to take joint action. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] Both journalists and Seimas deputies 
were quite surprised by the idea of establishing a position of 
the minister for relations with Western countries. Would you be 
"minister for the East" in that case? 
  [Gylys] Representation plays a great role in interstate 
relations, and it would be good to have such a minister as J. 
Mejerovics in Latvia. The Foreign Ministry will not split and 
will deal with all geographic latitudes. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] Lithuania has disbanded its former 
delegation for negotiations with Russia. However, Russia has 
not changed the status of its delegation. Its leader V. Isakov 
is urging the expansion of dialogue on the delineation of state 
borders and the establishment of border crossings. However, 
does Lithuania's new delegation include any specialists in these 
issues? 
  [Gylys] The current delegation is only a core, while experts 
will be invited from all offices. For example, the group headed 
by Deputy Foreign Minister V. Domarkas will contribute to the 
delineation of the borders. I would like to go back to the 
conversation between Presidents A. Brazauskas and B. Yeltsin, in 
which they exchanged opinions about the necessity of changes in 
the negotiating delegations. I think that nothing exceptional 
has occurred after the appointment of the group for negotiations 
with the CIS. I would like to draw your attention to the fact 
that this group includes state officials rather than 
politicians. Russia did this in the very beginning, while we 
did not preserve the principle of solidarity and state interest. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] RESPUBLIKA was surprised by the statement 
of G. Karasin, chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry Information 
Service, that Russia had been informed about the visit of the 
Chechen delegation to Lithuania in advance, and, therefore, this 
visit "did not exceed any permissible limits." What could this 
mean? 
  [Gylys] I learned about this visit a few days ago. As far as 
I know, none of our employees informed Moscow about it in 
advance. According to my understanding of diplomacy, however, 
the preparation for this visit seems strange. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] You assessed the opposition's 
no-confidence vote against you as an integral part of the 
operation "Fall." Do you think that the opposition is plotting 
a "Spring" operation? 
  [Gylys] I imagine that the operation "Spring" will be much 
weaker than the "Fall" one. The oral battle will continue until 
the next elections. However, this is not enough. There is a 
slight possibility of assuming power through illegal means. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] How would you comment on the words of 
opposition leader V. Landsbergis that the Lithuanian Democratic 
Labor Party's foreign policy has failed? Could the opposition 
participate in conducting the policy of the ruling party? What 
constructive proposals of the opposition could you remember? 
  [Gylys] Like Mr. V. Landsbergis, I would have to strain my 
memory very much.... I could discern a conceptual, although a 
critical, assessment in the address of Social Democrat V. 
Pleckaitis before the Seimas. Sometimes it looks like some 
people in Lithuania are displeased with our considerably quiet 
relations with Russia, or with the withdrawal of Russian troops. 
They need strife and enemies, and possibly large ones. 
However, such an evolution of international relations has no 
perspective. I believe that it is high time for the opposition 
to think about a "shadow" cabinet, because it is useful for the 
people to know what government will come after the next 
elections. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] One "shadow" cabinet has already declared 
itself.... [reference to young politicians' conference which 
elected a 'government of the 21st century'] 
  [Gylys] If you have in mind the Lithuanian Government of the 
21st century, its representatives also work in the Foreign 
Ministry. However, as soon as I learned about its existence, I 
calmed down. They are allowed to act freely, and their 
"orientation" toward the 21st century is welcome.

<F P=106> [Interview with Seimas opposition leader Vytautas </F>
Landsbergis by ELTA correspondent Arturas Mankevicius; place 
and date not given: "The Year of the Dog Will Also Be Devoted 
to Politics"] 
  [Text] [Mankevicius] In what way has the past year 
been successful to you as a politician? 
  [Landsbergis] I am happy that two most important tasks begun 
by my colleagues and myself have been accomplished successfully 
-- Lithuania's admission to the European Union and the 
withdrawal of Russian troops. 
  [Mankevicius] What have been the greatest failures in 
the opposition's political strife this year? 
  [Landsbergis] I do not think that we have suffered any final 
defeats. However, we have had a few failures: To influence the 
Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] leadership or its 
extreme forces. The latter's pressure on the LDDP leaders 
allows for more cooperation with the opposition. 
  [Mankevicius] The congresses of Sajudis and the 
Homeland Union (Lithuanian Conservatives) proposed that early 
elections to the Seimas [parliament] be held already this year. 
Would not this be another mistake of the right-wing forces? 
  [Landsbergis] First of all, I do not agree with the 
assumption that we made a mistake then. Our political rivals 
were assuming power without any elections by taking over control 
in the former Supreme Council. The elections were understood as 
a possibility for testing whether the Lithuanian people really 
agreed with this. People may have believed that such an outcome 
would bring better results, and, therefore, a few more people 
voted for the LDDP than for other parties. We, as well as the 
LDDP, did not predict such results. 
  However, we see similar processes in neighboring countries, 
where Landsbergis or Sajudis have no influence. These are the 
specific regularities of the transitional period, mass 
psychology, and the influence of communism. 
  It is very difficult to hold early elections against LDDP's 
will. This can be determined only by the LDDP itself and the 
president if the latter decide that it is more favorable for 
them to hold new elections now rather than in a few years.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 12, BNS - The Lithuanian parliament 
prohibited gambling and casinos Tuesday [11 January] by adopting 
several amendments to the law on enterprises. 
  The step earned sizable support from the rightist opposition 
but was sharply criticized by some members of the ruling 
majority. Kestutis Jaskelevicius, chairman of the parliament's 
Budget and Finance Committee, ironically remarked that the next 
step would be to impose a ban on short skirts. 
  A special commission of the Lithuanian Finance Ministry said 
the move would eliminate possibilities to root out illegal 
casinos by applying economic methods and to get additional 
budget receipts. 
  A similar view was expressed by Finance Minister Eduardas 
Vilkelis. 
  The parliament ignored the commission's arguments because 
"believers pray for such a decision." The law will come into 
effect if it is signed by the president. 
  The regulations of establishing casinos and gambling rules 
were approved by the Lithuanian government only a half year ago.

<F P=106> [Interview with Swedish firm SKB Director (Bo Gustafsonn), </F>
German firm GNB representative (Dieter Schonfeld), and Gennadiy 
Negrivoda, chief engineer of the Ignalina nuclear power plant, 
by Ruta Skatikaite under the "Economy" rubric; place and date 
not given: "Forty Years for Contemplation"] 
  [Text] Each country with a nuclear power plant faces the 
problem of storing and burying the radioactive fuel waste. 
However, few such countries fail to take care of its storage in 
advance. 
  Lithuania has been forced into a situation where no storage 
facilities for particularly radioactive fuel waste have been 
built at the Ignalina nuclear power plant over the 10 years of 
its operation. The space left in the special water reservoirs, 
where waste fuel cassettes have been stored for 10 years, is 
enough to last the plant for only a year. If no new storage 
facilities are built over this time, the first block will have 
to be shut down. It is not difficult to imagine what an energy 
crisis may hit the country receiving even 90 percent of its 
electric energy from the nuclear plant. However, this danger 
has been removed by the government adopting a decision on the 
storage of radioactive waste in special dry containers. 
Currently, the so-called intermediate "wet" (water) nuclear 
fuel storage is more common in the world. The government based 
its decision on the conclusions of Lithuanian nuclear energy 
specialists and the Swedish firm SKB. A contract with the 
German firm GNB is nearing completion today. SKB Director (Bo 
Gustafsonn) has actively participated in this work. We have 
asked him to detail how the issue of storage choice was settled. 
  "Sweden concluded a contract with the Lithuanian Energy 
Ministry on this matter more than a year ago," said Bo 
Gustafsonn. "Two- thirds of the expenses were covered by 
Sweden, and the remaining part -- by Lithuania. In the 
beginning, six countries participated in the tender, but later 
there remained only three -- Germany, Canada, and the United 
States. Assessing their projects, we primarily considered their 
security, the fact whether the production of a firm has already 
been used and what the response is, and whether a firm will 
manage to manufacture the necessary amount of containers in 
short order. Certainly, we also thought about the price. The 
production of the German firm GNB met all of these requirements, 
except the last one." 
  [Skatikaite] It is the price that encouraged the 
Canadians to raise objections to the commission's choice. Are 
their containers really $100 million cheaper? 
  [Gustafsonn] This sum is concocted. (We have learned from 
other sources that the price of one GNB container is 600,000 
German marks [DM]. The decision endorses the purchase of 60 
containers for DM36 million. Thus, even the total sum is only 
around $20 million -- the author). The containers of the 
Canadian firm "Ontario Hydro" are really cheaper, however, they 
weigh an even 100 tonnes, and their transportation requires 
special vehicles. Their unloading and the purchase of shipment 
containers would require a special building. If we add all 
these expenses to the price of the Canadian containers, the 
latter will differ little from those of the German production. 
  [Skatikaite] What countries have bought GNB containers? 
I am addressing this question to the German firm GNB 
representative (Dieter Schonfeld). 
  [Schonfeld] Our firm has sold 500 containers to Canada, the 
United States, Sweden, France, the Czech Republic, and South 
Africa. Currently, we have a contract for another 100 
containers. Our firm has engaged in this business since 1978. 
We perform the design work, while containers are manufactured 
at different enterprises. 
  [Skatikaite] Currently, there are 800 tonnes of HM 
[expansion unknown] stored at the Ignalina nuclear power plant, 
while Russia has 3,900 tonnes, that is, 1,000 tonnes less than 
in special storage facilities. Does Russia plan to begin 
production of its own "dry" containers? 
  [Negrivoda] A plant in Izhora is planning to start such 
production. According to primary estimates, one container would 
cost DM210. Even if the price climbs to DM300, it would be 
twice cheaper than the GNB containers. If the Izhora plant 
speeds up the realization of its project, we will have a broader 
choice. As long as the Ignalina nuclear plant operates, we will 
need 40 containers annually in the future. Radioactive fuel 
waste is stored in dry containers for 40 years. Lithuania must 
decide over this period of time what is to be done with such 
waste -- to bury it for good or to recycle. Whatever the 
decision, this will be a costly process. Thus, those 40 years is 
a time not only for contemplation but also for the accumulation 
of finances.

  [Text] The rumors about the blockade of the roads leading 
to the city of Dushanbe by Regarskiy and Gissarskiy fighting 
groups have been confirmed. 
  According to the report by Sharif Rrahmonpur, a KHORASAN 
news 
agency correspondent in Dushanbe city, the confrontation between 
the government and Safarali Kenjayev, the former parliament 
speaker, who is at the head of Regarskiy and Gissarskiy 
formations, is growing day by day. 
  The blockade of the roads leading to the capital and clashes 
between these formations and Kulyab fighters are evidence of 
that. 
  The correspondent reports that a clash took place between 
the 
fighting sides near the village of Almaasi of Gissarskiy Rayon 
on Monday. 
  According to available information, the fighters of 
Regarskiy 
and Gissarskiy demand the resignation of Abdulmajid Dostiyev 
[first deputy chairman of the Supreme Council], Yokubjon Salimov 
[internal affairs minister], and [Saydamir] Zukhurov [National 
Security Committee chairman], the representatives of Kulyab 
Oblast, and restoration of Safarali Kenjayev to his former post 
[Supreme Council chairman].

the Tajik-Afghan border have become much more frequent, first 
and foremost, in the assigned area of responsibility of the 
Moscow and Pyandzh detachments of the Russian border troops. 
Posts and outposts periodically come under unprovoked fire from 
Afghan territory. 
  In the last five days the border guards of the Pyandzh 
border 
detachment stopped three attempts of armed groups of mojahedin 
of the Tajik opposition to break through the border from 
Afghanistan. Fortunately, there have been no losses among the 
Russian servicemen.

  [Text] A letter by Imamali Rakhmanov, the head of state, to 
the UN secretary general is at the center of attention of 
workers. 
  In my opinion, the concern of Imamali Rahkmanov, the head of 
state, which is described in his letter is clear to everyone, 
said Shukur Zuhurov, the minister of labor and employment, in 
his interview to a KHOVAR news agency correspondent. 
  According to our available information more than 30,000 of 
our compatriots who have had to flee their places of residence 
are in the territories of neighboring Afghanistan. It should be 
said that the present situation in Afghanistan is very 
complicated. The armed clashes between the different political 
forces are continuing here. These clashes are taking place in 
those areas where the Tajik refugees live. That is why their 
situation is very difficult. 
  In addition to this, the situation on the Tajik-Afghan 
border 
is not calm. Is it possible to return home in such a situation? 
That is why I think that Imamali Rakhmanov has sent the letter 
to the UN secretary general at the right time. The authority of 
the United Nations is high all over the world. And we hope that 
thanks to the active assistance of this organization the 
bloodshed will be stopped in Afghanistan and the return of the 
Tajik refugees will be possible.

<F P=106> [Shakhabutdin Zaynutdinov report: "Uzbekistan and </F>
Kazakhstan Form Single Economic Area"] 
  [Text] Tashkent -- Talks between President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and President Islam Karimov of 
Uzbekistan have ended in Tashkent with the signing of a package 
of eight joint declarations aimed at surmounting obstacles in 
trade and economic relations and deepening and expanding 
bilateral economic cooperation. 
  In particular, a treaty on the creation of a single economic 
area (all existing barriers will now be removed) and 
intergovernmental agreements on regional banks -- a foreign 
currency bank and a clearing bank -- were signed. These and 
other documents, as the two leaders pointed out at a news 
conference, are designed to ensure the free movement of goods, 
services, capital, and manpower, as well as the implementation 
of a concerted credit-clearing, budget, tax, price, customs, and 
currency policy between the two states. 
  A special agreement records Uzbekistan's debts to 
Kazakhstan, 
amounting to more than $39 million, as a state credit. It is 
envisaged that this debt will be repaid this year by means of 
additional deliveries of natural gas, electricity, and textile 
products. Kazakhstan in turn will sell to its neighbor 2 
million tonnes of grain, 600,000 tonnes of coal, and 260,000 
tonnes of rolled metal, cast iron, ferroalloys, and refined 
copper.

  [Text] Federation Council members have elected a House 
Chairman by secret ballot. During a break, an Interfax reporter 
asked several lawmakers to forecast election results. 
  The Kemerovo Region's Governor Aman Tuleyev believes that 
First Vice-Premier Vladimir Shumeyko will be elected Speaker of 
the House, "even though I voted against him." He explained his 
belief by the fact that administration chiefs and other House 
members had come in for too much pressure from the executive 
branch. 
  Tuleyev voiced fear that if Shumeyko were elected Chairman, 
the House "would turn into a Presidential Council." He remarked 
for this reason that regions were at odds with the central 
government on both political and economic issues. At the same 
time, he argued that Shumeyko's victory meant overall regional 
support for the president and government. 
  President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov of Kalmykia believes that the 
Federation Council should mirror the interests of voters rather 
than cow tow the government, "a line being sought to be imposed 
on House members." He noted in this connection that the 
government's policy had not been reflecting the interests of 
constituents in recent time. That, in his words, was borne out 
by the parliamentary elections on December 12. "If the nation 
had backed up the government's course, there wouldn't have been 
the Zhirinovskiy's phenomenon," he remarked. 
  According to Ilyumzhinov, the nomination of Shumeyko means 
presidential pressure on deputies. He admitted that he himself 
had voted for Peter Romanov. 
  Ex-Speaker of the House of Nationalities of Russia's former 
Supreme Soviet Ramazan Abdulatipov declared that he had no doubt 
about the endorsement of Shumeyko as Speaker. In his opinion, 
the election of the First Vice-Premier meant that the House 
"extends a hand of cooperation to the country's president and 
government." "It is important that the Federation Council's 
position be appreciated by the Head of State and Council of 
Ministers," he said. 
  The Nizhnyy Novgorod Region's Governor Boris Nemtsov feels 
that if Shumeyko is elected, the Federation Council will have 
proper relations with the president. However, he noted that 
"the interests of the lawmakers, representing Federation 
Territories, must not suffer from personal attachments of 
Shumeyko and Yeltsin." 
  Nemtsov agreed that the Council could become a buffer 
between 
the president and State Duma. However, neither the president 
nor Duma can desire a mediator, he added.

  [Text] Speaker of the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko, 
elected to the post Thursday, has told the deputies that he 
intends to do his best for the Federation Council as the supreme 
body of state power. By Shumeyko's proposal, it was decided to 
make nominations for the post of the deputy speaker on Friday 
morning. 
  Before that he intends to hold consultations on candidates 
with different deputy factions. 
  In line with the earlier approved regulations, the speaker 
of 
the Federation Council will have three deputies. 
  Shumeyko said that all deputies, despite their posts, will 
have equal rights. 
  One member of Shumeyko's team has described as a convincing 
victory Shumeyko's election to the post of the speaker. No one 
can reproach Shumeyko for victory due to pressure groups. 
Ninety-eight votes were cast by convincing supporters of 
Vladimir Shumeyko, he said.

<F P=106> [Ravil Zaripov article under "Topic of Day" rubric: "You </F>
Cannot Become Speaker Without a Voice"] 
  [Text] Yesterday's work of the Federation Council acquired 
a scandalous, sensational complexion. Vladimir Shumeyko, for 
whom the chair of Federation Council chairman had already been 
prepared, failed to get it by one vote, having secured the 
support of 85 deputies (it is noteworthy that one voting paper 
was not dropped into the box but was taken away). The previous 
day Shumeyko had been thought sure to win, since in the secret 
nomination of candidacies he had collected 78 votes, whereas his 
closest rival in terms of the number of votes had just 13 (Petr 
Romanov, general director of Krasnoyarsk's "Yenisey" Chemical 
Combine Production Association). 
  Meanwhile, Shumeyko had been confidently answering any 
questions, not being diffident. "My daughter is working in the 
United States, and my grandson is a U.S. citizen. This is how 
it has worked out." At the same time another candidate -- 
Eduard Rossel -- was posing as someone "humiliated and 
insulted," persecuted by the central power. According to the 
deputies' reaction, he did not win any sympathy with this. 
Moreover, the senators categorically disliked the allusion that 
he made: What has happened to me is just the beginning, and you 
will see there is worse to come. Rossel did not forget to make 
digs at Shumeyko, getting at his moves from one branch of power 
to another. As a result, in the admission of deputies, some of 
the votes "flowed" from Rossel to Romanov. 
  Nobody doubts that Shumeyko will be elected. But what will 
such a choice mean? That the majority of the regions 
(voluntarily or compulsorily) will go along with the president 
and the government and will support its policy. Deputy Aman 
Tuleyev believes that in this situation the Federation Council 
is being turned virtually "into a presidential council." Can 
they, however, vote differently when 54 percent of the deputies 
are administration heads, to whom are added people on the 
president's team and economic planners dependent on the center? 
According to Aman Tuleyev and Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, there was 
strong individual pressure [obrabotka] on deputies. Since the 
budget for 1994 has not yet been adopted, and the majority need 
subsidies, direct investments, and quotas, it is obvious what 
the subtext of such talk is. Let us not forget that the 
administration heads who received deputies' mandates from their 
voters had, at the same time, been appointed by the president. 
Boris Yeltsin appointed them and can also remove them: The 
Bryansk "experience" of former Administration Head Yu. Lodkin 
will be remembered for a long time. According to Karelian 
Supreme Soviet Chairman Viktor Stepanov, it is important that 
the Federation Council does not turn into an ideological 
department or tool of the president. Not that the threat of 
this is that great, since, when the talk turns to specific 
questions -- the budget, for example -- the administration heads 
might be transformed. The reason? If contradictions arise 
between the regions and the center, their actual responsibility 
to their own district could outweigh the pressure from the 
government. I have ascertained from conversations with 
administration heads that they also want Shumeyko to be elected 
because "he is the only person who will be able to control us. 
If Romanov is elected, the same situation as with the former 
Supreme Soviet will be repeated." 
  The second round of the secret vote intensified the 
sensation 
which had become apparent. Petr Romanov got 79 votes and 
Vladimir Shumeyko 81 votes. The reason for this was Yu. 
Chernichenko in the chair and...Shumeyko himself. 
  After the results of the first round of voting were 
announced, the former attempted to "quash" an additional vote 
for Vladimir Shumeyko, referring to a telegram received from 
North Ossetian Supreme Soviet Chairman Askharbek Galazov. The 
deputies objected categorically. It unexpectedly came to light 
that the telegram had been sent not to the chairman of the 
tellers commission but to the president of Russia and directly 
to Vladimir Shumeyko. Instead of getting up and removing the 
tension which had arisen in the hall, Vladimir Shumeyko stayed 
silent and so lost votes.

<F P=106> [Reports on interviews with Federation Council members </F>
during the 11 January session by Sergey Kaverin: "Federation 
Council: The Process Is Under Way"] 
  [Text] In the Federation Council's lobby our correspondent 
managed to strike up a conversation during yesterday's meeting 
with some of the "key figures" of the current political Olympus. 
<H5>  Kalmykian President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov </H5>
  [Kaverin] How do you assess the parliament's lineup? 
  [Ilyumzhinov] I think that the Russian president has gotten 
a mirror reflection of our society, which is actually entirely 
natural... after the October shooting of Russians. 
  [Kaverin] Your attitude to the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia leader? 
  [Ilyumzhinov] It is normal, despite the press' hysteria 
about an onslaught of the browns. I do not see that. 
  [Kaverin] That is, you agree with his concept of a unitary 
and indivisible Russia, where all entities will be territorial? 
  [Ilyumzhinov] No, we are not going to be part of anything. 
<H5>  Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev </H5>
  [Kaverin] Is Tatarstan planning to take part in the next 
elections for the Russian parliament? 
  [Shaymiyev] Everything will depend on whether we will be 
able finally to straighten out our relations with the Russian 
Federation. If these relations are straightened out and a treaty 
is signed, the elections will undoubtedly take place in 
Tatarstan. 
  [Kaverin] Are you sure that this treaty will be signed? 
  [Shaymiyev] I think that both sides are presently interested 
in it. 
  [Kaverin] What is your status at this forum? 
  [Shaymiyev] I am a guest. 
<H3>  Ramazan Abdulatipov, Chairman of the Council of the 
Nationalities of the Former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet </H3>
  [Kaverin] According to what principle do you think factions 
will be formed in parliament? 
  [Abdulatipov] According to their interests. For example, 
those who call for the Federation Treaty to be observed. In 
other words, we should join forces on substance, not according 
to formal characteristics. 
  [Kaverin] What problems do you think the upper chamber may 
encounter in the near future? 
  [Abdulatipov] I think these are primarily relations between 
the Federation components and the federal authorities. As for 
the substance of the federal structure, I think that the form of 
Federation components' joining the Federation should be retained 
and the rules of the game should be the same for all. So that 
regardless of the status of a Federation component people who 
live there will feel as equals. 
  [Kaverin] Are there "hidden snags" in the parliament's work? 
  [Abdulatipov] Control over the budget, in the first place. 
The current state authorities are out of control from top to 
bottom. 
  [Kaverin] What are your impressions from the president's 
address? 
  [Abdulatipov] He returned for yet another time to the 
principle of the separation of the powers of the Center and the 
Federation components. I think that this effectively amounts to 
Boris Nikolayevich's return to the Federation Treaty. I can 
give you an absurd example where half the seats in the Duma are 
held by parties that operate only in Moscow. 
<H5>  Peasants' Party Leader Yuriy Chernichenko </H5>
  [Kaverin] What is the main area of the Federation Council's 
activity? 
  [Chernichenko] It must discuss bills coming from the State 
Duma. This is why the Council itself will not be much of a 
problem. The most important thing for it now is to create a 
democratic staff, approximately 10 committees, that would make 
it effective. We also need to do it so as to put a deputy above 
the staff, not the other way around. 
<H5>  Former Moscow City Soviet Chairman Nikolay Gonchar </H5>
  [Kaverin] What is your reaction to Yeltsin's speech? 
  [Gonchar] A positive one. I liked the idea that there is no 
alternative to searching for accord.

"Governors Begin To Feel at Home in Parliament. Some Federation 
Council Members Advocate Territorial Factions; Others, Party 
Factions"] 
  [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod Governor Boris Nemtsov, elected a 
Federation Council deputy, termed as utopian the idea of 
dividing the upper chamber into regional factions. "No strong 
politician who really represents the interests of local elites 
-- like myself, for example -- will have a part in any such 
thing," Mr. Nemtsov assured your SEGODNYA correspondent. 
According to him, regional leaders, who have but once come up 
against the problem of sharing out budget funds, would 
"immediately see the extreme danger and ruinous nature of such a 
road for the whole of Russia." "We on the contrary are 
interested in creating conditions where representatives of the 
regional elites could more easily come to terms and establish 
links between the regions rather than focus on dividing the 
pie," he said. 
  Besides, Eduard Rossel's promise to bring together everyone 
regardless of their "stripes" according to regional interests, 
in Boris Nemtsov's phrase, "is almost the same as if I would 
want to make Russian National Unity activists my deputies, or to 
put representatives of the Communist Party in `top' positions." 
For the successful work of the Federation Council it would be 
much more interesting, according to him, to see which of the 
senators is "red" and which is "white," and "maybe to give that 
an organizational form." 
  Aleksandr Belyayev, chairman of the disbanded St. Petersburg 
City Soviet, who has also become a member of the upper chamber, 
believes that most probably there will be no official division 
in the Federation Council either on a territorial or party 
basis. He is convinced that "the entire previous 
behind-the-scenes horse-trading is not going to played out at 
all on the Federation Council scene." 
  Interregional associations are being formed even if they are 
not given official status, and the interests of various regional 
elites will be composed either outside parliament or in its 
lobby. Aleksandr Belyayev thinks that understandings reached in 
such a "natural way" will only be taken note of in the 
Federation Council proper.

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Vyzhutovich: "Federation Council. 11 </F>
January, 1000 Hours. No Sensation"] 
  [Text] Despite the tradition which has become rooted in 
the style of young Russian parliamentarianism, the first sitting 
of the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly began in a calm and 
organized manner with no sensations. 
  As planned, the sitting was opened by Boris Yeltsin. While 
paying ritual rhetorical tribute in the form of congratulations 
to deputies on their "great personal and political success" and 
expressing his intention to cooperate with the legislators and 
conduct consultations with parliamentary faction leaders, the 
president also identified a number of points of principle in his 
speech. 
  First and foremost he noted that most Federation Council 
members are "experienced political figures who have learned the 
secrets of power and are capable of distinguishing real politics 
from petty politicking." This could well have been a passing 
allusion to the composition of the State Duma, which as yet is 
frighteningly unpredictable, unlike the Federation Council, 
which is dominated by the heads of the executive branch in the 
republics, krays, and oblasts -- firm pragmatists who are 
prepared for dialogue with the Kremlin and, equally importantly, 
are capable of controlling the situation in their regions. The 
president thereby made it plain that he sees his parliamentary 
support primarily in the Federation Council, which has the right 
of veto over highly important decisions from the lower chamber 
and is able to bring the Duma legislators to their senses as 
necessary. 
  The appeal to "forget revolutionary terminology and jettison 
relapses into morbid suspicion and political maximalism" had an 
extremely timely ring and was maybe the first time it had been 
heard from the president's lips. 
  Boris Yeltsin also stated that the president's annual 
message 
to the Federal Assembly, which is stipulated by the 
Constitution, will be presented in the very near future after 
the organizational matters relating to each of the chambers' 
work have been resolved. The message will propose a program of 
political and economic transformations for 1992 and the basic 
guidelines of domestic and foreign policy. 
  There is one sentence which should probably be regarded as 
the key fragment in the president's speech: "No matter who our 
voters voted for, they were unanimous that the Russian 
Federation must continue to be an integral state, a solid 
federation. It is out obligation to fulfill this wish." 
  The president is indubitably aware that the specter of 
separatism looming over the Federation has by no means been 
exorcized by the adoption of the new Constitution. Having 
received a nationwide mandate to pursue a more autonomous, more 
independent policy, regional leaders, it goes without saying, 
will not pass up the chance of making use of it. And the 
Federal Assembly [as published] hall of sessions will become an 
arena of struggle to coordinate the interests of the center and 
the provinces. Giving a foretaste of this struggle, the 
president recalled the precise constitutional delimitation of 
the areas of responsibility of the Federation and its 
components, noting at the same time that "strong regions are a 
condition of Russia's prosperity." 
  Then, in accordance with constitutional procedure, Yuriy 
Chernichenko, the oldest deputy in the upper chamber, took the 
chair for the first sitting of the Federal Assembly [as 
published], calling on Kaliningrad Oblast Administration Head 
Yuriy Matochkin and Sakhalin Governor Yevgeniya Krasnoyarova to 
act as his assistants. 
  The draft standing orders for the first day of the sitting 
stipulated the election of the credentials commission, which has 
already happened, and also the approval of the agenda, which 
presupposes a most important matter: the election of the 
Federation Council chairman and his deputies. 
  In reply to my question about which candidacy for the post 
of 
head of the upper chamber seems preferable to him, Bashkortostan 
President Murtaza Rakhimov noted that he has no personal 
antipathy toward, say, Vladimir Shumeyko, but in his view the 
Federal Assembly [as published] should be led by a person with 
experience of leading a republic, kray, or oblast. Here Murtaza 
Rakhimov stressed that the Federation Council chairman must be 
"someone with a Russian surname," from which it an be inferred 
that, for example, Ramazan Abdulatipov and Eduard Rossel, who 
figure among the contenders for this post, should not 
particularly count on being successful. 
  On the other hand, Krasnodar Kray Administration Head 
Nikolay 
Yegorov assessed Vladimir Shumeyko's chances as pretty high 
("the whole of the North Caucasus is for him"), while at the 
same time noting the "anti-Kremlin mood" of a considerable 
proportion of the Federal Assembly. 
  The first sitting of the upper chamber of parliament is 
continuing. After the procedural warm-up, it is likely that 11 
January will also see the beginning of substantive debate.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Gamov: "Zhirinovskiy Advised Lukava To </F>
Call Militia"] 
  [Text] From the first minutes of the Russian State Duma's 
work the auditorium's attention was focused on a short, skinny 
man in a civil aviation pilot's uniform who has temporarily, 
until a speaker is elected, taken the main parliamentary seat -- 
the oldest deputy, 68-year-old Georgiy Lukava. 
  [Gamov] Georgiy Grigoryevich, are you in the hot seat? 
  [Lukava] I certainly am.... 
  [Gamov] When you opened the Duma session many people drew 
attention to your slight Georgian accent... 
  [Lukava] I am indeed a Georgian by nationality. 
  [Gamov] Since Stalin not a single Georgian has held such a 
high post in Russia. 
  [Lukava] To be frank, I am very calm when it comes to such 
idle talk. 
  [Gamov] Georgiy Grigoryevich, forgive me, but it is said in 
the corridors that Zhirinovskiy specially nominated Lukava, a 
member of an "alien party," as a deputy on "his own" list. 
  [Lukava] Certainly not... Although I am in reality a member 
of the Russian Communist Party I was nominated to the Duma by 
the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia on the grounds that in 
July last year I took part in that party's scientific and 
practical conference at which I delivered a report entitled 
"Spiritual Readiness and Its Role in Overcoming the Crisis." 
But having found myself in the chair I am trying to be 
absolutely impartial and I am giving all deputies irrespective 
of party allegiance the opportunity to speak. [Lukava ends] 
  Yesterday several deputies suggested that Georgiy Lukava 
surrender his seat to a more competent deputy. But Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, from a 
microphone, gave the provisional speaker categorical 
instructions not to go anywhere, to turn off the microphones, 
and not to allow anyone onto the platform and if necessary to 
"call the militia."

  [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS -- Russian nationalist leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who was said to be planning to become the 
chairman of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the State Duma is 
now running for the post of the speaker whom the lower chamber 
plans to elect Thursday. 
  He is among eight candidates to the post nominated by seven 
party factions and independent deputies. The Russia's Choice 
keeps its candidate in secret so far, Sergey Stankevich, head of 
the interim secretariat of the Duma, said on Wednesday after a 
meeting of faction leaders. 
  Other candidates are--Vladimir Medvedev from Independents, 
Ivan Rybkin from Agrarians, Sergey Glazyev from the Democratic 
Party, Alevtina Fedulova from the Women of Russia Bloc, Sergey 
Shakhray from the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, Vladimir 
Lukin from the Yabloko Bloc, and Mikhail Lapshin from Communists. 
  "Although the Russia's Choice has a candidate it does not 
name him," Stankevich said.

  [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS -- Leaders of all 
parliamentary factions and groups issued the first warning to 
nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on Thursday and 
threatened to block his representatives from State Duma ruling 
bodies in case he continues to speak out without an official 
request to take the floor. 
  The warning appeared after three factions stormed out of the 
conference hall where faction leaders were meeting in protest 
against Zhirinovskiy's demand that he himself should chair the 
meeting because his Liberal Democratic Party was the first in 
the parliamentary elections. 
  He proposed that the next meeting of the leaders can be 
chaired by the faction, which ended second in the polls, i.e., 
the Russia's Choice. 
  Lawmakers opposed and offered a representative of the "Women 
of Russia" bloc to chair the meeting, but Zhirinovskiy was 
against it. 
  The Russia's Choice, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, 
and the Women of Russia left the meeting in protest. 
  A compromise was reached in their absence that Nikolay 
Travkin, the leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, which was 
the last in the elections, would chair the meeting. 
Zhirinovskiy also agreed with the proposal. 
  Travkin then convinced the three factions to return to the 
meeting. 
  After that representatives of all factions and groups in the 
State Duma, natrurally excluding the Liberal Democratic Party, 
agreed that in case Zhirinovskiy continues to speak out without 
officially requesting to take the floor they will jointly block 
his faction and would not allow his representatives to work in 
the ruling bodies of the lower chamber.

  [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS -- Twenty independent members 
of the State Duma (lower chamber of the new Russian legislature) 
have decided to join the centrist parliamentary faction of 
Sergey Shakhray's Party of Russian Unity and Accord (PRES). 
  All the volunteers represent interests of Russia's new 
financial and industrial sector, Aleksandr Kotenkov, acting 
executive committee's chairman of the PRES, told ITAR-TASS on 
Wednesday. 
  According to him, the PRES faction would enlist about 40 MPs 
and is due to be registered on Thursday.

<F P=106> [Report by Robert Minasov and Yevgeniy Skukin: "Lower </F>
Chamber Has Taken Time Out"] 
  [Text] The logical result of the absurd and sometimes -- 
from the viewpoint of the standing orders and parliamentary 
procedures -- illiterate actions of Georgiy Lukava (LDPR) 
[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], who is chairing the first 
session of the State Duma was that the lower chamber from the 
first day of its work took enforced time out. (Incidentally, 
Georgiy Lukava has composed a dissertation entitled "Dialectic 
of the Solution of Conflicts in War Through the Use of Weapons 
of Mass Destruction.") 
  The outburst of emotions, which continued throughout the 11 
January evening session, was caused by the seemingly, not that 
important, question of the numerical strength of the deputies' 
groups to be registered. The minor political movements and 
parties were, naturally, interested in the lowest possible 
threshold (12-14 deputies), while the larger ones (the LDPR, the 
Russian Communist Party, the Agrarian Party) wanted to raise the 
threshold to 50. "Russia's Choice" offered a compromise -- 20 
deputies. 
  A real fight developed over these figures. The deputies 
returned repeatedly to vote. And only the figure of 35 received 
the largest number of votes. Only by having that number of 
members can a group count on registration. 
  What is the thrust of the problem? Why did deputies from 
political parties and movements defend their proposed options so 
zealously? 
  We received a reply to this question from Sergey Shakhray, 
leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord. 
  "There are eight political parties represented in the State 
Duma. If they had settled on the figure of 50 the largest could 
have acquired decisive votes in the State Duma Council while the 
small ones would essentially have been jettisoned or obliged to 
join some group even if they did not want to." 
  "Sergey Mikhaylovich, please share your impressions of the 
first day," we asked our interlocutor. 
  "They are very sad. From the first minutes of the session 
the Liberal Democrats, Communists, and Agrarian Party members 
made what I would call a ferocious attempt to take control of 
the chamber. After all, the Council of Elders had assigned 
Georgiy Lukava only the opening of the session and the procedure 
for the election of the State Duma working organs. The session 
was then to be led either by the secretariat or by a provisional 
presidium. You realize that this attempt to impose his will on 
the chamber split it into two parts. Exactly half of its 
members were elected to the State Duma from political movements 
and parties while the other half consists of deputies from 
single-seat territorial districts. So is it seemly to infringe 
on the interests of a minority? We suggested compromise 
versions: Let us say conditionally one deputy from the parties, 
one from the one-seat districts, and so forth. But without 
success. The methods used to conduct the session were very 
reminiscent of the worst times in our former parliament...." 
  Alas, Sergey Shakhray was far from the only person to assess 
the first day of the State Duma's work as depressing. 
  Alevtina Fedulova, leader of the "Women of Russia" faction: 
  "I should like more political culture, a more economical use 
of parliamentary time. But on the other hand I do not lose hope 
that after the necessary familiarization we will manage to make 
headway in resolving organizational questions and an atmosphere 
for lawmaking will be created. I am satisfied that we have 
settled on the 35 option. That is a controllable group or 
faction, it does not matter what you call it, with which other 
associations can deal." 
  With what did the "Women of Russia" come to the State Duma? 
  [Fedulova] First, we will take part in the work of virtually 
all committees. For us it is fundamentally important not to 
concentrate only on questions of women, the family, and 
children. Also, we shall work most seriously in various 
directions. We believe we must provide not only for equal 
rights for women and men but also, most important, for equal 
opportunities. Nonetheless, we believe the interests of man to 
be the priority for parliament. We are interested not in a 
problem in itself but in close connection with the improvement 
of people's lives. The laws must be socially oriented....

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1800 GMT on 12 January in its 
"Novosti" newscast carries a report by television correspondent 
Sergey Suntsov on the work of the State Duma today. Suntsov 
briefly interviews deputy Georgiy Lukava. He says the view 
among deputies is that the present State Duma will find it 
difficult, if not impossible, to reach agreement. 
  Deputy Anatoliy Lukyanov makes the following comments on the 
situation: "This is not a puppet parliament for the 
authorities, but I am quite convinced it has the potential to 
understand the situation, and I think it is capable of 
agreement." 
  Suntsov goes on to speak briefly about the session of 
factions and the talk about the formation of deputies' groups. 
All are united in the opinion that organizing the work of the 
Duma is the key issue, Suntsov says. He says the faction heads 
appear to be intent upon taking charge of this themselves. In 
an interview with Suntsov, Nikolay Travkin, leader of the 
Democratic Party of Russia, stresses that the leaders or 
representatives of the factions are taking fundamental political 
decisions. They are doing the ground work, including drawing up 
the agenda or questions for discussion. He concludes that only 
this can make parliament's work predictable. 
  Suntsov further reports that this evening the first session 
of the party leaders of the deputies' groups took place. They 
were to discuss the agenda for tomorrow, he says, and determine 
the nominations for the post of chairman, deputies, and a number 
of others. Suntsov comments: "Once again Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
was the initiator of a conflict who demanded that he should have 
the right to take the session as the leader of the major 
parliamentary faction. Nikolay Travkin issued an ultimatum. If 
Zhirinovskiy does not change his behavior, the faction will 
resort to the tactics of completely blocking the Liberal 
Democratic Party." 
  Suntsov concludes with an interview with Gennadiy Zyuganov, 
leader of the Communist Party, who states he is convinced a 
common-sense party will be formed that will vote in favor of 
professionalism and will listen to the opinions of authoritative 
persons. Zyuganov concludes that there are very many 
authoritative, professional deputies in the auditorium to whom 
people will listen. 
  Announcer Pavel Ogorodnikov winds up the report with the 
following comment: "After today's fuss, in the corridors of the 
State Duma, journalists have given Zhirinovskiy the nickname of 
the `incident man who cannot take even 20 steps without 
declaring war on someone.'"

<F P=106> [Indira Dunayeva, Ivan Rodin report in the "Parliament" </F>
column: "Factional Arithmetic in the Duma. PRES (Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord) Has Consolidated Its Ranks and 
Russia's Choice Has Not Split"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, which was declared a break in the work 
of the State Duma, was in fact fairly strained as partisan and 
independent deputies were hastily organizing parliamentary 
factions. Yesterday the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] 
faction was joined by a financial and industrial group of 
independent deputies of approximately 20 people. All in all, as 
of yesterday the faction numbered some 40 deputies. 
Interestingly, this is the first coalition created by 
independent and partisan deputies. Independent deputies, mainly 
including entrepreneurs and bankers who have joined the PRES, 
will constitute a section within the framework of this faction 
and their representative will become part of the faction's 
leadership. Addressing yesterday's press conference, PRES 
leader Sergey Shakhray stated that the faction is conducting 
talks with deputies from republics and autonomies. In his 
opinion, however, the "process of factional growth will not be 
explosive." Shakhray said that the faction is nominating his 
candidacy for the post of chairman of the State Duma. "Wherever 
I am, I shall be working on regional policy," Sergey Shakhray 
stated in concluding his press conference. 
  Yesterday Liberal Democratic Party deputy Aleksandr 
Vengerovskiy told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent that apart 
from the party list six people have affiliated with the faction. 
The faction is headed by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, of course, and 
its cochairmen are Aleksandr Vengerovskiy and Sergey 
Zhibrovskiy. The Liberal Democrats have the largest number of 
those wishing to work in the committee on education, science, 
and culture and also in the committee on organizing the Duma's 
work. In addition to cochairmen, the Liberal Democratic Party's 
faction council includes leaders of intrafactional groups 
(lawyers, economists, youth, and women). 
  Sergey Baburin yesterday tried to create a deputies group 
called Russian Way that, however, has not as yet gathered the 
requisite minimum of 35 members. The group includes Anatoliy 
Lukyanov, Aleksandr Nevzorov, Vladimir Tikhonov, and Yuriy 
Vlasov (it was decided to nominate the latter to the post of 
speaker of the State Duma). 
  Yesterday the emerging factions of deputies groups were 
counting their real and hypothetical votes and discussing rumors 
as to who will be elected chairman of the State Duma, his 
deputies, committee chairmen and their deputies. Furthermore, 
they discussed the principle to be used in filling these still 
vacant posts. 
  In the lobby of the Duma assembly hall, in cozy leather 
armchairs the deputies of the emerging Russian Way group held a 
meeting -- Anatoliy Lukyanov, Sergey Baburin, Yuriy Vlasov, 
Vladimir Tikhonov, Aleksandr Nevzorov, and others. Mr. Lukyanov 
briefed them on the progress in factional bargaining. Thus, 
according to some reports, a large coalition is nominating 
Agrarian Party leader Mikhail Lapshin as speaker and Alevtina 
Fedulova from Women of Russia and Vladimir Medvedev from the 
"independents" as his deputies. 
  Incidentally, the latter are divided into several groups: 
the above mentioned Russian Way with an ideology of 
traditionalism, according to Sergey Baburin; and yet another 
group, fairly close to Russia's Choice, which will possibly be 
headed by Irina Khakamada, general secretary of the Economic 
Freedom Party. The creation of this group, however, has been 
postponed for the time being. On the other hand, the group 
headed by oil businessman Vladimir Medvedev has attracted 
deputies from the republics and autonomies led by A. Dzasokhov, 
and it will apparently try to register today. 
  As for the reports about a split within Russia's Choice, 
according to a source within this faction, the bloc's leadership 
has so far not accepted the idea of splitting into two groups as 
a way of removing the internal tension and ensuring freedom of 
maneuver for itself. 
  Yesterday at 1600 a meeting began between leaders of the 
Duma 
factions. Its agenda was as follows: procedure for conducting 
sessions prior to the election of speaker; provisions on the 
temporary rules of procedures; sequence of questions slated for 
discussion at Duma sessions; and the formation of the leadership 
of the lower chamber. According to some reports, the election 
of the entire Duma leadership is to be carried out 
simultaneously -- in a package. The formation of the package 
will be based of how many conventional points particular 
factions have gathered. These are calculated on the basis of 
simple arithmetic: Each post is assigned a certain number of 
points and then the aggregate number of elected deputies is 
divided by their sum total, which gives the number of deputy 
mandates per point (for instance, seven and a half mandates). 
Next a discussion is held as to what exactly each faction can 
get for its points. This method, however, is not known in 
detail yet, although it is already raising objections from those 
factions that are not among its authors. 
  The beginning of yesterday's consultations was marked by a 
scandal when the Liberal Democratic Party leader voiced 
suspicions with respect to his negotiating partners. It was 
decided that today the elders will take turns conducting the 
session and that elections of the speaker will also begin today.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Yabloko group leader Grigoriy </F>
Yavlinskiy by Pavel Kozlov in Moscow on 11 January: "Reforms To 
Launch True Democracy"; first paragraph is L'UNITA introduction] 
  [Text] Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, the 41-year-old economist and 
leader of the Yabloko (apple) group, has brought 26 deputies to 
the Duma. 
  [Kozlov] What do you think of the Duma's first day? 
  [Yavlinskiy] After 3-4 October there was no alternative but 
to go to the polls, even with all their faults, of which we were 
aware from the outset. I think that this Duma will do its job 
if it acts basically as a constitutional body. It must create 
items of fundamental importance for Russia, such as the 
electoral law and the civil code; it must prepare Russia to 
elect a real parliament, the president, and local governments. 
  [Kozlov] But, as of today, is it capable of getting on top 
of 
this job? We have already seen how the first few hours went by 
in a state of tumult... 
  [Yavlinskiy] The Duma today represents a normal parliament 
in 
a country riddled with conflict. If you paid a visit to the 
parliament in, say, South Korea or Taiwan, you would come away 
with the conviction that, in comparison, today's session went 
off perfectly smoothly. If this Duma will keep people from 
shooting at one another, it will have achieved its goal. 
  [Kozlov] Is serious conflict likely to emerge between the 
deputies and the president? 
  [Yavlinskiy] It is to be hoped that this can be avoided. The 
Constitution is drafted to confer full powers on the president, 
so the Duma hardly ever debates issues that impinge on the 
president's functions. At the same time, however, the president 
is responsible for what happens in the country. 
  [Kozlov] How long might this Duma be expected to last? 
  [Yavlinskiy] It was elected for a fairly short term, two 
years. I do not know if it will last the full course, but in any 
case I do not want to make pessimistic forecasts. If you think 
that dissolution would be followed by a better Duma, I have 
grave doubts on the subject. Moreover, we have had extremely 
tranquil parliaments, a prime example of peace and quiet being 
the Soviet Parliament, where even votes against the regime were 
cast in a predetermined scenario. 
  [Kozlov] What would you like your role in the Duma to be? 
  [Yavlinskiy] I want the Duma to perform tasks that I regard 
as extremely important. Actually, many things in the situation 
that we are in invite objections and doubts, and these could be 
handled in one of two ways. A number of inquiries could be 
opened into a multitude of events and issues, or the situation 
could be accepted as it is, bearing in mind that, however you 
look at it, over the next two years Russia must prepare for free 
democratic elections of both the president and a new, authentic, 
parliament.

<F P=106> [Interview with Communist Party Chairman Gennadiy Zyuganov </F>
by Pavel Kozlov in Moscow on 11 January: "Everyone Must Seek 
Allies"; first paragraph is L'UNITA introduction] 
  [Text] In numerical terms, 49-year-old Gennadiy Zyuganov, 
with almost 60 deputies from the Communist Party chaired by him, 
represents the third-largest force in the State Duma after 
Gaydar's and Zhirinovskiy's. 
  [Kozlov] Right from the first day, all signs point to a 
struggle between Gaydar's "Russian Choice" favoring the 
government and the president, and an intransigent opposition, 
represented primarily by you and your supporters. 
  [Zyuganov] As I see it, "Russian Choice" does not seem 
capable of fully appreciating the results of the 12 December 
elections. That grouping did not win 60 percent of the votes, it 
only collected 15 percent, and it does not control the political 
process. It can block no constitutional decision on its own, so 
it will have to work with other groups, and it has no internal 
homogeneity: There are elements that fully appreciate that the 
bombing of the White House put an end to democracy in Russia, 
and there are those who are ready to launch the country once and 
for all along the road to dictatorship. No group is 
homogeneous, and in a short time we shall see the formation of 
the classic pattern of left wing, right wing, and center. 
  [Kozlov] Will this parliament be even more critical of the 
executive of the disbanded Supreme Soviet? 
  [Zyuganov] The tone adopted by any parliament depends on 
what 
is happening in the streets and the mood of the electorate. The 
worse the situation in the country, the more critical and rigid 
will be not only the parliament, but the social, and even 
governmental, structures as well. 
  [Kozlov] Do you intend to bring the issue of a revision of 
the Constitution up in the Duma? 
  [Zyuganov] Our experts are busy studying the text of the 
Constitution. In accordance with our election manifesto, we 
insist that the Constitution be approved by a two-thirds 
majority, otherwise it will not be the law of consensus but the 
law of division and deterioration. 
  [Kozlov] Who is your candidate for the position of speaker? 
  [Zyuganov] The idea is to appoint the speaker of the Duma 
from one of the minor parliamentary parties, a widely respected 
figure but one without extreme ideological beliefs, while each 
of the larger parties would delegate a deputy speaker and a 
committee chairman to satisfy the interests of the political 
forces. 
  [Kozlov] What is your view of the forthcoming 
Yeltsin-Clinton 
summit? 
  [Zyuganov] It will be an important meeting because it 
involves a visit by the president of a major power. After the 
downfall of the USSR, the field of geopolitical forces has 
shifted in favor of the United States and NATO, so these talks 
have great significance for Russia, especially in view of the 
state that we are in.

<F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Kamin: "Federal Assembly Begins Work. A </F>
Package of Presidential Edicts Submitted to the Duma for 
Consideration"] 
  [Text] The government is ready to use the most 
constructive elements from programs of the parliament's 
political factions when adjusting its economic policy. This was 
said yesterday by Viktor Chernomyrdin in his opening address to 
the State Duma. No specific proposals of the factions were 
mentioned, however. At the same time, the legislators' starting 
positions with regard to the executive authorities may become 
clear in the very near future -- yesterday the Duma received a 
package of 64 presidential edicts, the legitimacy of which must 
be confirmed by the Federal Assembly. Apparently, the 
parliamentarians' reaction to the president's lawmaking activity 
in the period of the "phased Constitutional reform" will be the 
first step in establishing a new relationship between the two 
branches of power. 
  At the first Duma meeting, which was devoted to procedural 
matters, coordinated actions of the communists, agrarians, and 
members of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia did not allow 
"Russia's Choice" to push through a decision reducing the 
minimum number of deputies required for setting up a 
parliamentary faction. Thus, the "Russia's Choice" plan to 
increase its clout in parliament by fragmenting the bloc into a 
number of smaller factions did not materialize, which may give 
the parliamentary opposition a shot in the arm. 
  Given this, the results of the State Duma's review of the 
package of presidential edicts holds particular interest, 
because the negative influence of the opposition has so far been 
minimized by a lack of actual mechanisms of appealing against 
presidential edicts -- there is no procedure for ruling them 
unconstitutional, whereas a direct challenge to the president is 
dangerous for the Duma's current lineup: Three incidents of 
disagreement may give grounds for dissolving the chamber. In 
addition, the presidential edicts may find serious support in 
the influence of parliamentary lawyers and economists who are 
presently analyzing the practice of their application, while the 
opposition has concentrated its efforts on political tussles. 
  For instance, State Duma Deputy Aleksandr Pochinok (former 
deputy finance minister, earlier chairman of the Supreme Soviet 
planning and budget commission) is certain that splitting profit 
tax revenues between the federal and local budgets and 
establishing new tax rates for individuals were "progressive 
steps" taken by the president. On the other hand, the increase 
in value-added tax, in his view, may elicit disgruntlement, "and 
the essentially progressive change in the procedure of bank 
taxation (in which profits, not incomes, are taxed) requires 
that the practice of its application be analyzed." Nonetheless, 
Pochinok believes that the bulk of the presidential edicts from 
the package, including the edict on benefits granted to domestic 
banks, "need to be approved as quickly as possible," because 
this will speed up drastic changes in the budget, taxation, and 
banking sectors, an effort that will require another 60 or so 
new laws. Among priority steps he also mentioned enactments on 
audits, on the securities market, and on indexing deposits. 
  It is worth noting that the president's Commission for 
Legislative Proposals may just as well accelerate the passage of 
presidential edicts through the Duma -- a lack of serious expert 
appraisal structures in the new parliament may render the 
former's recommendations decisive.

<F P=106> [Sergey Parkhomenko report under the "First Night" rubric] </F>
  [Text] The list of organizational matters the Fifth 
Russian Duma managed to resolve on its first work day boils down 
to the creation of purely technical commissions, the election of 
a provisional secretariat (under Sergey Stankevich's 
chairmanship), and also determining the minimum number of 
parliamentarians required to set up a new deputy faction. 
  Only the last of these problems seemed more or less 
significant, because establishing the lower limit for a deputy 
group's strength may give "Russia's Choice" extra advantages in 
the future: It is this faction that has so far managed to win 
over more deputies elected in majority districts as 
"independents" than anyone else. With the emergence of a number 
of groups "Russia's Choice" may see its replicas of sorts appear 
in parliament -- each of them with the rights of a full-blown 
party faction regarding a guaranteed representation in the State 
Duma's ruling bodies, the right to be given the floor in 
discussions, and so forth. A multistage voting procedure 
finally enabled the Duma to set the minimum number at 35 people. 
  To make this decision, however, took nearly six hours of 
painful efforts (including two hours of consultations during the 
lunch break), when the State Duma posed as an entirely 
unprecedented farcical show both comical and absurd in nature. 
This came as no surprise to anyone, though. On the contrary, 
we should rather say that our preliminary expectations and 
suspicions were strikingly confirmed: Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia [LDPR] leader Zhirinovskiy was indeed obnoxiously 
scandalous and the deputy corps' doyen, Georgiy Lukava, who was 
elected on the LDPR ticket, actually appeared as a barely sane 
personality. 
  Sprinkling his speech with thoughtful absurdities, like 
"developing the potential at the level of a factor" or "bringing 
addresses within the framework of collaboration," Mr. Lukava 
easily and quickly brought the Duma to a scandal bordering on 
collective hysterics with disorderly shouts into the microphone 
and a threateningly multitudinous babel in front of the 
presidium (where deputy Shabad was noticed a number of times). 
In the end, 190 deputies, threatening to refuse to register and 
to boycott the meeting, demanded that Lukava be relieved of the 
unbearable burden of chairmanship, because the Constitution 
calls for the first meeting only "to be opened" by the oldest 
deputy, not to be steered further. Mr. Zhirinovskiy, 
overstraining his voice, guided his subordinate from the 
audience, and in one moment demanded that "an order be given to 
switch off all microphones, to call security to protect those on 
the podium, and to continue the voting without any discussions." 
Mr. Lukava was willing to hand over his powers only to Anatoliy 
Ivanovich Lukyanov in person. 
  In the end, the Duma managed to cut Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
and 
his comrades down to size. From now on, meetings will be 
chaired by members of the Council of Elders. The Duma took a 
timeout for forming factions until noon, 13 January. 
  Aleksandr Kotenkov appears to have summed up the results of 
the first day of deliberations in the best possible way: "This 
brouhaha is unbearable. It cannot last for long. And it 
won't..."

<F P=106> [V. Yermolin and A. Pelts report: "Federation Council </F>
Elects Speaker. State Duma Ruled by Elders"] 
  [Text] Yesterday's Federation Council sitting can rightly 
be called a deciding one. The deputies were electing the 
chairman of the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly. 
  When discussion of the candidacies started it showed the 
deputies in the upper chamber so far unable to express their 
sympathy in favor of one particular contender in a clear-cut 
way. Their main task, however, was to elect a "silent speaker," 
that is, one who could take the interests of all the 
representatives of the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly 
into consideration to the utmost degree and would be able to 
lead it skillfully along the path of unity and constructive 
work. As Boris Nemtsov, head of the Nizhnyy Novgorod 
administration, emphasized in an exclusive interview with a 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent, it is not mandatory to elect a 
representative of the regions; the main task is to get work 
under way with maximum efficiency. Ramazan Abdulatipov also 
adheres to this opinion. He notably considers it most important 
to establish a link between the upper chamber of the parliament 
and the president. In his opinion, Vladimir Shumeyko possesses 
all the necessary qualities, and, most importantly, experience. 
  By 1400 the results of the secret ballot became known (it 
was 
conducted in booths). None of the contenders had gained the 
necessary number of votes. Vladimir Shumeyko with 85 votes and 
Petr Romanov with 56 went through to a second round. Shumeyko 
was left one vote short of victory. 
  The first day of the State Duma sitting was marked by two 
noteworthy episodes, which could be called a test of strength. 
  As evening was approaching Georgiy Lukava, who was chairing 
the sitting and who anyway has no experience as a speaker, 
clearly started to descend into improvisation and reacted to 
virtually every exclamation from the hall. The simplest 
questions took 20-30 minutes to discuss. Suffice it to say 
that, one hour after the beginning of the afternoon sitting, the 
registration had not yet been done. That is, it had not been 
established whether there was a quorum in the hall and whether 
the Duma had the power to adopt any decisions or not. 
  Then Vladimir Zhirinovskiy came to the microphone, and, in 
the "Sturm und Drang" style, instructed his party comrade to 
switch off the microphones, not allow anyone to speak, and 
remove anyone who disobeyed with the help of the militia. Then 
the first episode, which could be called a test of strength, 
occurred: Twice Georgiy Lukava announced the registration, and 
twice the board lit up the words: "No quorum." Later, Mikhail 
Poltoranin commented on this episode as follows: "We landed one 
on Zhirinovskiy." And Zhirinovskiy backed off. Lukava was 
replaced by his colleague from the Council of Elders. The work 
of the session continued. 
  But the second episode -- the vote on the question of the 
size of deputies' groups -- showed around 200 deputies 
gravitating toward the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] 
stance, while somewhere between 140 and 180 votes supported the 
Russia's Choice proposals. In the end, the figure named by 
Gennadiy Zyuganov -- 35 -- went through. That is how many 
deputies must be registered in a deputies' group for it to 
obtain the same rights as a faction. The votes came out 256 for 
and 146 against. And although Gennadiy Burbulis does not 
consider the outcome of the vote a defeat for the democrats (who 
sought a figure of 12-14), the disposition of votes clearly 
promises a hard life for them in the State Duma. As for the 
"nonregistration" ploy, it must be assumed that Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy will not always help his opponents to set all and 
sundry against him with unsubtle tricks. The democrats should 
not forget that this man knows not only how to "take a punch" 
but also how to learn lessons from doing so. 
  On Wednesday, following its turbulent start, the State Duma 
worked in factions. Deputies' groups were being formed. There 
will be a joint sitting on Thursday.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Talalayev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS -- The kind of relationship, 
which the Russian president will have with the newly elected 
parliament, has acquired a truly vital meaning for Russia today. 
Many people, including the president, if one can judge by his 
statements, will long remember the tragic end of the former 
Supreme Soviet, although there deservedly should be no pardon 
for its leaders, whose unlimited personal ambitions and 
insatiable hunger for power almost threw the country into civil 
war. 
  In this connection, it is no surprise that people awaited 
the 
president's first appearance in front of the new parliament with 
impatience. This interest was heightened by the president's 8 
January reversal of his original decision to hold a joint 
session of the Federal Assembly's two chambers and to speak only 
to the deputies of the upper chamber, the Federation Council. 
This decision was obviously based on the guidelines contained 
in the new constitution. 
  Yeltsin stated his position on the proper relationship 
between the two branches of power fairly clearly. After a 
reminder of the tremendous efforts required to maintain peace in 
the country last year, the president stressed that, "it is very 
important that the members of the Federation Council and the 
State Duma put the Russian parliament on a constructive path, so 
that cooperation becomes the most important aspect in relations 
between the executive and legislative branches." 
  Undoubtedly, the Federal Assembly is beginning its work in a 
very difficult period when the Russian state is really just 
being founded. However, the first popularly approved 
constitution in Russian history has given the country a 
realistic chance to form its ruling structures calmly and 
effectively. One could say that Russia has finally agreed on 
the rules of the game, which must be observed by all the 
political forces. 
  Now Russia needs more than anything else to preserve that 
spirit of agreement and calmness, which will prevent a 
dictatorship from ever returning. With this in mind, the 
president appealed to the deputies to "help the social and 
political forces agree on the most important thing, to fully and 
categorically exclude the use of force from the country's 
political arena." 
  Of course, the president and the parliamentarians can 
disagree with each other, argue, and insist on their own 
opinion, but all political problems can and must be solved in a 
legal way. "Despite the variety of parties in the parliament, 
there is a principled basis for their joint constructive work," 
Yeltsin declared. The same thought was voiced by Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who was simultaneously addressing 
the deputies of the State Duma. 
  However, the parliament's first day of work, especially in 
the lower chamber, did not radiate optimism. After spending a 
lot of time debating procedural questions, the Duma deputies 
never did get to any important matters. But the alarming thing 
is that the democratic forces have not yet managed to take 
control of the situation, while the part of the opposition 
represented by the Liberal Democratic Party and its ecstatic 
leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy behaved, to put it mildly, 
provocatively. It looks like the apprehensions voiced by 
Presidential Press spokesman Vladislav Kostikov on the eve of 
the parliament's debute may be true. He said that "a 
confrontational spirit might dominate" the Federal Assembly. 
  Of course, it is too early to draw conclusions. Moreover, 
the president has enough constitutional powers to prevent 
opposition forces from using their full strength. No matter how 
contradictory the 12 December elections were, Russia has to live 
with the new parliament for two years. The parliamentarians 
have been provided with all the necessary conditions to earn 
themselves a worthy place in the country's history. They have 
the sad experience of their predecessors, the executive branch's 
good will and readiness to cooperate, and the trust of their 
electors. Now the ball is in the parliament's court.

two 
vice premiers who are also State Duma deputies -- Sergey 
Shakhray, and Aleksandr Shokhin: Will they continue to work in 
the government, or will they concentrate fully on legislation? 
  Shakhray: I have not yet received an offer to join the new 
government. 
  Shokhin: I have not yet decided. I am prepared to move into 
a leading position in parliament. This parliament is terribly 
cumbersome and complex, and the more people with experience of 
government work in it, the better. Where can I work? Anywhere, 
from speaker to committee chairman. Provided it is an 
influential committee, of course -- for instance, the committee 
for the budget, or international affairs. The latter in 
particular, because it would be undesirable to see Zhirinovskiy 
move in there....

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Khrustov: "'White House' Prepares for </F>
New Occupants"] 
  [Text] Those who have moved houses even once will have 
been able to satisfy themselves from their own experience of the 
truth of the saying that one move is equal to two fires. And if 
you are about to move into a building where several stories are 
burnt out, almost all the windows are broken, ceilings and even 
supporting structures are damaged, and hardly any utilities are 
operational.... 
  This was precisely the state in which the fine, snow-white 
administrative complex on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment was 
found recently, when specialists arrived to carry out a detailed 
survey of the building and give an in-depth report on the nature 
and scale of the damage. 
  It is well-known that on 5 October the president signed an 
edict on handing over to the Russian Federation Government the 
administrative complex where parliament worked until recently. 
He thereby restored historical justice, if you like: The 
complex on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment, which came to be known 
as the "White House," was originally occupied by the Russian 
Federation Council of Ministers (indeed, the building was 
erected for that purpose). 
  Experts appeared at the site the following day. The 
impression of "devastation and desolation" -- as Petr Surov, 
head of the government apparatus construction department and 
first deputy chairman of the government commission, admitted to 
me at a recent meeting -- was depressing. Even with intensive 
work, restoring the 20-story building (or, to be more precise, 
the 24-story building, if you count the two basement floors and 
the clocktower) to its former working state before September 
next year seemed unrealistic. 
  But a tough schedule was set: The stylobate (six floors) to 
be completed in 1993, and the upper levels, comprising the 
seventh to 20th stories, to be completed by 15 February 1994. 
Moreover, the leaders of the government commission were given 
the necessary powers to engage any construction firms and other 
organizations in the work to restore the government building; 
and to conclude contracts with foreign firms. 
  "We immediately realized that we could not manage with 
Moscow 
builders alone (they have their own intensive program)," Petr 
Surov said. "So we engaged colleagues from a number of Russian 
cities, as well as foreign specialists. The extremely tight 
schedule made the supply of materials and equipment a crucial 
factor: We needed building and finishing materials (granite and 
marble), elevators, and fire prevention systems. Our foreign 
partners were able to deal with these matters promptly. In 
other words, we undertook to complete the work within the 
deadline by making sure we had all the necessary materials and 
equipment. 
  "We received offers from 27 foreign firms. Many of them were 
pursuing not so much commercial aims as political objectives: 
They wanted to help us restore the government residence, 
thereby expressing their solidarity with Viktor Chernomyrdin's 
cabinet and the current reforms. 
  "The Turkish firms Gama and Enka were chosen because they 
have made a good name for themselves in Russia. Enka already 
built a maternity home and a military hospital with 1,200 beds 
in Moscow and renovated the Petrovskiy Arcade. Gama agreed to 
work without any advance payment, using its own money to buy the 
necessary materials. 
  "Other firms were also engaged, mainly those that supplied 
equipment when the complex on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment was 
originally built. Take the elevators, for example. We had to 
replace 19 out of 49. This was done by Otis (a U.S. firm). The 
shuttle-mail system is being restored by Ascom, the Austrian 
company, which originally installed it. Hanwell (a U.S. firm) 
is renewing the fire-prevention systems. There was no hard 
currency available, but within 24 hours they had flown 
everything necessary to Moscow and started work. The commercial 
equipment for the dining room and snack bars (they are up and 
running, incidentally, and catering for the construction 
workers) was supplied by an Italian firm, which started work 
even before signing the contract and sent all the necessary 
equipment within one month. 
  "First of all, we had to bring the building `back to life,' 
make it `airtight' (virtually every window was broken), and get 
the utilities operational, that is, provide water, heating, and 
a working sewerage system. As many as 5,000 people were engaged 
in the restoration work virtually from day one. 
  "Then we had to eliminate the consequences of the fire and 
destruction. Many dividing walls had collapsed, some 
ferroconcrete floors were sagging, and some beams had to be 
reinforced. Obviously, all the debris and rubbish had to be 
quickly cleared from every story. 
  "This was not easy. The building is approximately 100 meters 
high and the freight and passenger elevators are the only form 
of transport, but they were not working (the electric wires were 
burnt through). However, together with their colleagues from 
Otis, Russian specialists had all the elevators working within 
four days. Using an efficient hourly system (each story in 
turn), the construction debris was removed and carefully packed 
into sacks. As many as 100 trucks of rubbish left the government 
building, covered in scaffolding, each day. 
  "People worked flat out, making the deadline -- which had 
recently seemed unattainable -- a real possibility. People from 
Yekaterinburg, Orenburg, Tolyatti, Omsk, Tomsk, Rostov, and 
other cities worked around the clock, showing that we can work. 
  "Of course, all the necessary conditions were created for 
the 
construction workers: Everyone was accommodated close by, at 
the Ukraina Hotel, free meals were organized, and their wages 
reflected the work done. 
  "The `treatment' of the facade has proved very difficult: It 
was quite literally decimated by the shelling. The process of 
polishing the lower six stories is now complete: Only the upper 
levels remain. But there the situation is worse: 1,200 square 
meters of marble slabs have to be replaced. This is being done 
by Gama (our specialists refused, suggesting that we wait for 
warmer weather). 
  "The tower clock has been repaired (the hands were riddled 
with bullets): It started working again on 30 December. One 
firm (Russian) asked for 600 million rubles to repair the clock. 
But local specialists did everything -- quickly and much more 
cheaply. 
  "A total of 10 stories are now complete. Furniture is being 
arranged, communications systems are being switched on, and the 
first `new arrivals' are expected. Our department is already 
here, incidentally," Petr Surov said. 
  "All the various chambers are ready: the awards chamber, the 
reception rooms, the Gold Chamber, the Blue Chamber, the 
government sessions hall, and the leaders' office suites. 
Construction workers are also ahead of schedule in the upper 
levels. The seventh story (including the reequipped dining 
room) and the eighth to 12th stories are complete. Plus the 
technical operations story (the 20th), which is responsible for 
the heat and water supply and all other utilities. 
  "All work will be finished by 15 February as planned. Not 
only restoration, but also modernization. It is intended to 
develop the communications systems in the future. The question 
of protecting the government building along the lines of the 
President Hotel, for example, is being discussed. It is planned 
to do this in the summer." 
  Petr Sergeyevich and I walked through the restored building. 
It is now white again. The tinted windows and reinforced 
window frames have somewhat changed its appearance and made the 
building more beautiful than before. The interior decoration is 
also of the highest quality. 
  All rooms in the stylobate (the first to sixth stories), and 
also the eighth to 12th stories of the central upper tower 
passed inspection by a working subcommission on New Year's Eve. 
(For your information: The state commission will sign a 
certificate of approval on completion of the complex). 
  Your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent has been informed that 
the Russian Federation Government headed by Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin will move to its new address in the near 
future. 
  Happy house warming!

"Bagrov Accused of Not Playing by the Rules"] 
  [Text] A group of candidates running for the republic's 
presidency has issued a statement in Crimea accusing Nikolay 
Bagrov of breaking the rules of the election campaign. 
  Among other things, Bagrov's rivals complain that Nikolay 
Vasilyevich's loyalists are constantly trying to discredit all 
other participants in the election campaign. They are also 
indignant at the fact that Ukrainian government newspapers, 
radio, and television have given their backing to Bagrov. This 
put the contenders at a disadvantage from the outset. 
  A MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI correspondent has learned that the 
Kiev 
authorities support Nikolay Bagrov, seeing him as an instrument 
of Ukraine's national policy. He announced his bid for the 
presidency only after chiefs of a pro-Kravchuk foundation called 
"The New Generation" -- Shmelev, who is also Kravchuk's adviser, 
and Buryak -- conducted active work with him from 27 October to 
1 November. It is noteworthy that Messrs. Shmelev and Buryak 
arrived in Crimea by car incognito. Mr. Shevyev, chairman of 
the Crimea's Economic Revival Party, who received the emissaries 
from Kiev, arranged confidential meetings for them with Bagrov 
in the "Yuzhnyy" sanatorium. After Shmelev and Buryak, who 
incidentally supervise the center for assistance to the 
presidential authority, spoke to Bagrov, the latter decided to 
try his luck in the presidential elections. 
  As soon as Kiev's envoys left Crimea, terror swept the 
region. On 6 November, Yuriy Asmanov, leader of the Crimean 
Tatars National Movement, was assassinated. Black Sea Fleet 
officers perish one after another. Tensions begin to rise in 
the region along with a campaign aimed at discrediting all 
candidates for the presidency except Nikolay Bagrov.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Merinchyk, chairman of the oblast </F>
organization of the Ukrainian Officers' Union (SOU); and Mykola 
Kadrashchuk, chairman of the SOU Committee for Military and 
Patriotic Indoctrination of Young People, by Bohdan Vivchar; 
place and date not given: "For the Defense of Ukraine"--answers 
to questions not attributed] 
  [Text]As has already been reported, the fifth 
congress of the Ukrainian Officers' Union was held in Kiev. It 
elected the new SOU [Ukrainian Officers Union] chairman -- Major 
General Roy, approved the composition of structural bodies, and 
introduced changes to the statutes. Our correspondent had a 
conversation with delegates of the congress -- Ivan Merinchyk, 
chairman of the oblast organization of the Ukrainian Officers' 
Union; and Mykola Kadrashchuk, chairman of the SOU Committee for 
the Military and Patriotic Indoctrination of Young People. 
  [Vivchar] Lately, much pressure has been exerted upon the 
Ukrainian Officers' Union and patriotically minded servicemen. 
This found its expression in the replacement of Defense 
Minister Kostyantyn Morozov, who supported the SOU, and in 
accusations that the Union was involved in political activity. 
  [Answer] National chauvinist forces in parliament, headed by 
such notorious figures as Marchenko, Moroz, Charodyeyev, 
Izmalkov, and others, are doing everything that they can to 
discredit the SOU and mainly to eliminate it or, at least, to 
isolate officers on active service from it. What is their goal? 
To prevent the establishment of an independent Ukrainian state 
through the building of strong armed forces. As long as 
intentions are announced and declarations are made, our 
opponents are still ready to listen to them. However, as soon 
as specific steps are made toward their implementation, the 
entire communist gang immediately goes into opposition. Over 
the time of its activity, the SOU has returned to Ukraine more 
than 10,000 Ukrainian officers and has prevented the removal of 
military property worth billions of U.S. dollars from the state. 
It conducts a relentless struggle against those who do not like 
the idea of building strong national armed forces. 
  [Vivchar] The SOU was also against the signing by President 
Kravchuk of the Massandra agreements with Russia.... 
  [Answer] Yes, we supported Defense Minister Morozov's 
position regarding those actions. Nobody has any doubt that 
this person is a patriot who did everything to enable our young 
state to have a strong army, based upon national principles and 
the interests of an independent Ukraine. Morozov opposed the 
creation of a military alliance, resembling the Warsaw Pact, 
among the CIS countries. At that time, the idea failed. By 
removing Morozov from his post as defense minister, these 
chauvinist forces are planning to draw Ukraine into a new 
military alliance. 
  [Vivchar] How did the congress proceed? 
  [Answer] Let us point out that the destructive forces did 
everything that they could to undermine its work. For example, 
it was only at the last moment that delegates representing the 
regular army were allowed to attend the congress. The 
atmosphere that prevailed at the congress was one of unity 
regarding ways of building up the Ukrainian Army and state and 
emerging from the economic crisis. The participation of the SOU 
in the Supreme Council elections was also discussed. It was 
proposed that the Officers' Union consolidate its ties with 
parties and movements of the democratic bloc, so that in the 
case of a threat to the independence of our state, a single 
front could be formed, not ruling out the revival of the UPA 
[the Ukrainian Insurrection Army]. These ideas were mainly 
expressed by delegates from eastern regions of our state and 
were approved by guests of the congress, including 
representatives of Russian Cossackdom and Cossacks from other 
CIS countries, who stated their support for the struggle of the 
Ukrainian people for Ukrainian independence. 
  [Vivchar] The congress expressed a readiness to participate 
in the forthcoming elections? 
  [Answer] Yes, the SOU will nominate its candidates in all 
the regions of Ukraine. It has called upon all citizens to take 
part in the elections and to elect to parliament people who will 
be able to extricate Ukraine from the crisis and to build up our 
state. Representatives from the army are needed there. For 
example, a tank that has no equal in the world was designed and 
tested in Ukraine. For a whole year, the Cabinet of Ministers 
did not find it possible to make a single step toward 
manufacturing this machine and equipping the army with it. 
Ukraine is destroying and scrapping tanks, and, at the same 
time, the government refuses to sell them to other countries. 
Instead, Russia is now selling them. This deal would have 
earned our state the hard currency that we need so badly: By 
selling 100 tanks, we would have obtained that same $175 million 
that we are now begging from the United States. 
  [Vivchar] Such a policy also prevails in aircraft building, 
space technology, and missile building. It is high time that 
order were established in the state and something were done in 
the interests of the people, instead of picturing us before the 
world as beggars and turning us into genuine paupers. It 
follows from everything that there exist influential forces that 
want, at any price, to bring Ukraine to its knees, so that we 
will again ask "Big Brother" to be our guardian. 
  [Answer] This is precisely what the Officers' Union is 
trying to prevent. Had the power structures, starting from the 
president and the government, fought for their own state and 
against anti-Ukrainian forces in the Crimea and in other regions 
with the same ardor as they struggle against the SOU, we would 
by now have definitely made serious steps toward our statehood 
and independence. However, despite everything, nobody will 
manage to eliminate the Officers' Union, split it up, or divert 
it from its goals. The decisions adopted by the recent congress 
confirm this. The SOU is again ready to defend Ukraine.

  [Text] Kiev -- As of 12 January each of the 23 parties 
registered with the Central Electoral Commission is being 
granted 10 minutes of airtime on weekdays. 
  It has been decided to refrain from casting lots: The order 
of the statements has been decided by the order of registration. 
The second stage of the campaign will begin 1 February -- 
hour-long discussions between blocs or parties. Only commercial 
television companies will be able to grant airtime to individual 
aspirants: according to a minimum tariff within the limits of 
the candidate's fund. This fund stands at 10 times the minimum 
wage or 6 million karbovanets, while one minute of airtime on a 
nonstate channel, according to the lowest estimates, will cost 
approximately 2.5 million.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yaroslav Mynko: "Who Will Unite With Whom?"] </F>
  [Text] Four political forces prevail in Ukraine's current 
social life. The most influential of them is the so-called 
'party of power,' represented by presidential structures and a 
majority of lawmakers. The possibility to influence the 
progress of electoral competition is their privilege. These 
people are interested in preserving the current state of things, 
which amounts to preserving their legislative seats. I think 
that the constituency has had a chance to access the activities 
of this group and to feel the effects of the latter over the 
last four years. I do not mean only negative phenomena 
surrounding us but also genuinely historic events -- the winning 
of independence and avoiding armed conflicts. Although, I must 
point out that this achievement should not be attributed to our 
mutated nomenklatura, because they are rather a result of our 
nation's wisdom, perseverance, and natural drive for democracy, 
telling to obey the most mediocre governments out of compassion 
for the weak and unwise. The current government made promises 
and humbly repented for not keeping them, but when it comes to 
losing power and dramatically changing their fate, they will 
wage an uncompromising war to keep their seats. The merging of 
powers has resulted in a situation when every oblast has its 
"presidents" and "fuehrers" ready to use their official status 
for victory in the elections. 
  The Socialist Party is another significant political force, 
represented by communists who want to separate themselves from 
the crimes of the Bolshevik regime and accept existing 
realities, including Ukraine's independence. However, this does 
not mean that these people have broken the ideals of "real 
socialism." Socialists oppose "antipopular reform" and 
"capitalist ideology." 
  Before the reconstitution of the Communist Party of Ukraine, 
its members worked within the Socialist Party structures. One 
could assume that the two parties would form an electoral bloc, 
but following the Communist Party's official registration, 
conflicts arose over distributing nominations for candidates. 
Then, Socialists made the final decision to refrain from 
forming coalitions and decided to participate independently in 
the elections. 
  Still, in the political aspect, the Communist Party remains 
a 
shadow of the Socialist Party; being not the smallest party in 
Ukraine, it does not have a lot of supporters. After some 
aggressive statements by its First Secretary Symonenko, the 
leadership of the party keeps mysteriously silent, perhaps 
having a surprise up their sleeve. One may anticipate that 
depending on the results of the elections, Communists will 
probably join Socialists or vice versa, disregarding the only 
basic discrepancy in their programs. Socialists champion 
Ukraine's independence, while Communists oppose it. However, 
judging from their fraternization, the similarity of political 
views, and traditional habit not to keep promises, new realities 
may bring the two parties together. 
  The electoral bloc of V. Hrynyov's New Ukraine and the Civic 
Union led by former Prime Minister Kuchma, also has numerous 
supporters. The two parties have absolute accord on the most 
crucial issue -- Ukraine can survive only with Russia's 
assistance and thus, will continue to be dependent on its 
neighbor. This standpoint puts an end to age-old hopes to join 
Europe, once voiced by the Ukrainian president. Leonid Kuchma 
continues to reiterate his hackneyed phrase that the West will 
not welcome us. However, he has never bothered to ask himself 
this question: "Why should they?" 
  Yet, a difference in views on Ukraine's economic development 
seems more surprising. Hrynyov advocates deep political and 
economic reform on the basis of market relations and private 
property, while Kuchma, being the prime minister supported the 
preservation of the state-run sector, representing 95 percent of 
the Ukrainian economy. 
  Both parties are primarily represented by hardheaded 
technocrats and big enterprise managers disregarding any 
psychological peculiarities of the nation. Many of them believe 
that patriotism is for fools. For example, Hrynyov treats the 
winning of independence as a given fact and not a progressive 
phenomenon. In his opinion, Ukraine should become a 
multinational state. The trick is that this otherwise perfect 
term in the current realities is devised for granting privileges 
to Russian culture and Russian mentality. Pragmatists do not 
care about Ukraine's rocky path to freedom. 
  Finally, the fourth force (due to its numeric strength 
rather 
than political significance) is the People's Rukh of Ukraine. 
Its program lists joining the EC, consolidating economic 
independence, and a renaissance of Ukrainian culture as the 
organization's primary goals. According to Rukh postulates, a 
society devoid of national features cannot integrate in world 
processes without risk of becoming someone else's appendage. A 
renaissance of national culture is a prerequisite, or rather the 
only way to join world culture. Without strengthening 
patriotism it is impossible to overcome the economic crisis 
racking the country. This is not romanticism; this is one of 
the most important factors of stability and democracy, which has 
been proven by the experience of those European and Asian 
countries that have become world leaders with regard to people's 
well-being. 
  The remaining principles promoted by the Rukh coincide with 
those of New Ukraine -- the building of a market economy and 
equal relations with all states, including Russia. 
  The chances of political parties and blocs in the upcoming 
elections depend not only on the number of their members, but 
also on the number of supporters and sympathizers. It is 
interesting that out of 450 electoral districts, 300 are urban 
districts. It is evident that the future fate of the state will 
be determined in those districts. 
  In Donbass, the south Cisdnieper areas, and a part of 
northeastern Ukraine, votes will be divided between the 
Hrynyov-Kuchma bloc and socialist-communist candidates. 
However, it would be naive to believe that this will grant 
anyone absolute domination in the legislature. 
National-democratic forces will probably receive support from 
central and western Ukrainian oblasts.

and Procedure for Utilizing Ukraine's Tectonically Produced 
Mineral Deposits" issued in Kiev on 30 December] 
  [Text] In order to ensure a comprehensive and more 
complete utilization of mineral raw-materials resources and 
improve the state of the environment, I resolve as follows: 
  1. To determine that all those remnants of raw materials 
resulting from extraction, enrichment, and processing of mineral 
raw materials that have been covered by geological studies in 
accordance with an established procedure and that have been 
valued and found to be of industrial significance are placed in 
the category of tectonically produced mineral deposits. 
  The tectonically produced mineral deposits are included into 
the State Fund for Ukraine's Mineral Deposits and are used in 
accordance with the procedure established by Ukraine's 
legislation on mineral resources. 
  2. To determine that the placement of remnants of raw 
materials resulting from extraction, enrichment, and processing 
of mineral raw materials in the category of tectonically 
produced mineral deposits does not entail any change in the 
existing legislation on the procedure for collecting payment for 
their presence in the environment. 
  3. Ukraine's State Committee for Geology and Utilization of 
Mineral Resources is in charge of organizing and 
methodologically ensuring geological exploration of tectonically 
produced mineral deposits. 
  4. In elaborating draft plans for socioeconomic development, 
Ukraine's Ministry of Economy, jointly with Ukraine's State 
Committee on Geology and Utilization of Mineral Deposits must 
provide, starting from 1994, for a separate item specifying 
capital on the geological exploration of tectonically produced 
mineral deposits within the limits of capital allocated for 
financing geological exploration.

<F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich during news </F>
conference with unidentified reporters from the Belarusian 
Television and Radio Company and BELINFORM on 12 January; place 
not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] It is clear that if Belarus 
were a nuclear state, if we had not refused to keep the nuclear 
weapons, we would not be participating in this meeting [with 
President Clinton]. I am speaking sincerely. However, we see 
that the Clinton administration is paying tribute to Belarus, 
and this is being done, first and foremost, by U. S. President 
Bill Clinton. This is brought about by the fact that we do not 
lay claims to nuclear weapons and we do not make nuclear weapons 
the subject of political bargaining. This is the most important 
thing. I hope that during our short meeting -- Clinton will 
stay with us no more than five hours -- we will discuss issues

<F P=106> [Interview with Zyanon Paznyak, leader of the Belarusian </F>
Popular Movement, by unidentified correspondent; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Clinton's visit to Belarus has some 
peculiarities, one of which is the controversial refusal of 
Zyanon Paznyak, leader of the Belarusian Popular Movement [BNF], 
to accept an invitation by the U.S. Ambassador in Belarus David 
Swartz, to meet with the American President at his residence. 
The BNF leader thinks that the U.S. Embassy invited to the 
meeting organizations that are against Belarusian independence 
and oppose the BNF rather than the Supreme Soviet or the Kebich 
government. We made a phone call to Mr. Paznyak and asked him 
to explain what actually happened at the Embassy and what would 
be the BNF's next moves. 
  [Paznyak] Well, I was presented to members of the National 
Accord Party and former party hacks who once opposed the 
referendum and the Popular Movement. A very strange lot of 
people. This is why I thought that I was put in an awkward 
position here. What kind of opposition would this be? So I 
expressed my doubts as to the relevance of my participation at 
that meeting, which, I heard, even spilled over to the press 
pages. However, Embassy officials have again brought me the 
invitation today. I think that the Embassy's mistake is one 
thing, but it is a completely different thing that I should 
attend that meeting out of respect for President Clinton and the 
United States. This is why I certainly will go there. And I 
would like to assure everyone that I am not going to make any 
controversial statements there. Since President Clinton offers 
such an opportunity, I will be glad to accept it. 
  [Correspondent] And there will be no face-to-face meeting of 
Paznyak and Clinton? 
  [Paznyak] No. After all, this may not be so important 
because the meeting will take place in Kuropaty [burial place of 
victims killed by the Soviet security police in the 1930's]. 
But in Kuropaty we will talk about Kuropaty, of course. 
  [Correspondent] What questions is the opposition going to 
bring up during this meeting? 
  [Paznyak] This will be a short, 15-minute meeting. So 
considering the presence of many political party activists, I 
don't think any serious questions will be raised. I think that 
the conversation will touch upon the delayed democratic 
processes in Belarus, and on assistance from a democratic state 
such as the United States for those processes. This is going to 
be the main issue. I consider it a crucial fact that President 
Clinton is going to visit Belarus, seeing it as an independent 
state. This proves that Belarus managed to attract the 
attention of the United States.

  [Text] Representatives of the BPF [Belarusian People's 
Front] parliamentary opposition have had a meeting with 
journalists at the Supreme Soviet. BPF leader, Z. Paznyak, 
stated that he has proposed a meeting with President B. Clinton 
on 15 January during his visit to Kuropaty. "The initiative for 
the meeting came from the U.S. side," Z. Paznyak made clear. 
  The leader of the parliamentary opposition sharply attacked 
the Supreme Soviet Speaker S. Shushkevich, for signing the 
agreement on collective security, accusing him of betraying the 
national interests of Belarus by this step. 
  He expressed a negative attitude to the agreement signed in 
Moscow on merging the money systems of the Russian Federation 
and the Republic of Belarus, and also the likelihood of the

  [Text] Minsk January 12 TASS -- Belarusian Prime Minister 
Vyacheslav Kebich met with Leonid Kuchma, president of the 
Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, in Minsk on 
Wednesday to discuss prospects for forging an economic union 
between the two republics. 
  Kuchma told journalists after the meeting that Kebich showed 
full understanding of the need to establish direct horizontal 
ties between Belarusian and Ukrainian manufacturers. 
  "We should think about tomorrow for ourselves, using our own 
experience," Kuchma said. He stressed the importance of 
Belarus' integrating role in the restoration of economic 
relations between former Soviet republics and supported Kebich's 
moves aimed at establishing an economic union with Russia. 
  During his meeting with Vyacheslav Kuznetsov, first deputy 
chairman of the Belarusian parliament, Kuchma said that the 
Belarusian model of integration of the monetary systems of 
Russia and Belarus is more preferable than others. He supported 
the Belarusian Government's position calling for a gradual, 
evolutionary development of the economy and rejecting shock 
therapy methods. 
  Kuznetsov and Kuchma called for strengthening both bilateral 
inter-state and direct ties between enterprises within the 
framework of the CIS economic union. 
  Kuznetsov noted that 1994 will be a year of big political 
activity for Belarus. The republic will have to determine the 
future state system, adopt a new constitution and a law on 
elections. However, no economic or political upheavals should 
be allowed to weaken friendship between the Slav nations and 
their good neighbourly and respective relations between each 
other.

rubric: "Slavs Against 'New World Order'"] 
  [Text] At a news conference held by leaders of the Slavic 
Union Belaya Rus, journalists have been informed of several 
resolutions adopted during the Union's recent congress, as well 
as of the participation of Union representatives in the meeting 
of Slavic patriotic organizations in Kiev. 
  Organizers of the news conference stressed that, with regard 
to the increased tendency to bring a categorical tone to 
international dialogue, participants in the Kiev meeting -- 
representatives of patriotic organizations from Ukraine, the 
Russian Federation, Belarus, and Poland -- protested against the 
withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine and Belarus. 
  To resist the establishment of a "new world order," the 
Slavic Union intends to convene the World Slavic Congress in 
summer 1994. For this purpose, the Union Belaya Rus has already 
established a Belarusian committee to make preparations for the 
Congress. 
  Union representatives also stated that the current Supreme 
Soviet is incapable of resolving any important issues, and 
therefore it should adopt a new electoral law and a resolution 
to hold early elections in the fall of 1994.

"Belarusian Military Budget Only Sufficient To Feed Army"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- The Belarusian Supreme Soviet has adopted 
a law on the state budget for 1994. The republic's difficult 
economic and financial position has forced parliamentarians to 
cut military expenditure to a minimum. 
  The Republic of Belarus Ministry of Defense has been 
allocated a little over 650 billion rubles [R] from the state 
"purse," which constitutes roughly 4 percent of the budget's 
expenditure section. The lion's share of these funds will go to 
pay monetary allowances to servicemen, to pay for communal 
services, and to provide the Army with food and clothing. A 
total of R18 billion -- around 3.5 [figure as published] percent 
of the military budget -- is earmarked for the purchase of 
hardware and arms, and the spare parts for them.

  [Text] According to a BELAPAN report, received at the 
National Bank of Belarus, there remain today two fundamental 
differences between the Republic of Belarus and the Russian 
Federation on the question of the merger of the monetary, 
credit, and financial systems of the two states. Belarus is 
insisting that the payment notes of the National Bank of the 
republic during the merger of the money systems should be 
exchanged for Russian rubles at a rate of one to one. Russia 
supports a rate of three Belarusian rubles to one Russian. 
  The second issue is that Belarus is making efforts to ensure 
that Russia's domestic prices for energy sources and raw 
materials after the merger of the money systems will also apply 
to the territory of Belarus, while representatives of the 
Russian Government do not agree with this. 
  It is thought that an attempt to overcome these differences 
will be made today at the working meeting in Moscow of S. 
Shushkevich, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of 
Belarus, with B. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation. 
Taking part in the talks on the Belarusian side are Vice 
Premier U. Zalamay and National Bank Board Chairman S. 
Bagdankevich.

  [Text] The U.S. government has promised to allocate $76 
million from the Nunn-Lugar Fund to give aid to Belarus in 
connection with disarmament and conversion. The republic has 
already received the first $20 million. 
  According to the agreement reached by the sides, 10.5 
million 
"greenbacks" from this sum will go into the conversion of three 
major Belarusian defense enterprises -- BelOMO, the "Integral" 
Plant, and the Minsk "Computer Technology" Production 
Association. The remaining funds will be used to build housing 
for servicemen and to equip the republic center for retraining 
servicemen transferred to the reserve and placing them in jobs. 
In the past few days, a consignment of equipment for computer 
classes worth $187,000 was supplied from the United States to 
the center's branch in Lida. Equipment for setting up a network 
of service stations will arrive there mid-January -- it is 
specifically for these stations that the Lida branch will be 
training specialists.

<F P=106> [Report by Uladzimir Hlod: "The End Crowns the Work..."] </F>
  [Text] It was almost 11 PM when a plane with the 
Belarusian delegation on board took off from Vnukovo airport to 
Minsk. Less than 10 minutes later, [Belarusian Prime Minister] 
Vyacheslav Kebich came out of the airplane's lounge to greet his 
aides and experts with the successful completion of negotiations 
in Moscow. 
  We, journalists, were told as follows: 
  "The government, headed by me, has always followed the 
course 
of establishing firm ties, as well as stable and mutually 
profitable relations with Russia. This day crowns the complex 
and exhaustive work. Therefore, I do not conceal my deepest 
satisfaction." 
  On 5 January at Moscow's White House, into which the Russian 
Government had moved just few days ago, three documents were 
signed. At the beginning, Vyacheslav Kebich and [Russian Prime 
Minister] Viktor Chernomyrdin signed a statement on the upcoming 
unification of both countries' monetary systems; afterward, 
Deputy Prime Ministers Stanislav Bryl [Belarus] and Aleksandr 
Shokin [Russia] placed their signatures under a document on 
deliveries of Russian gas to Belarus and the construction of a 
system of gas pipelines on Belarusian territory. 
  This way, the long-awaited unification of the monetary 
systems of Belarus and Russia came into effect. Asked whether 
any secret points had been included in the document, Vyacheslav 
Kebich stated the following: 
  "No, and I believe that the full text of the statement not 
only can but also should be published in the press. This should 
be done to prevent all possible misunderstandings and 
insinuations." 
  As a matter of fact, my task is much easier now -- any 
reader 
can carefully study the text of the statement. I would only 
like to point out that the statement is accompanied by a package 
containing 10 documents which outline the mechanism for 
implementing the unification. The documents are to be signed in 
Minsk in January, and, as the Belarusian prime minister pointed 
out, "due to the upcoming visit to Minsk by U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, the signing ceremony will be held in the second half of 
the month." 
  The documents signed in Moscow were agreed to not only by 
government heads. Also Russian President Boris Yeltsin has 
approved them. He, as the Belarusian Cabinet leader noted, 
expressed hope that the package on unification of the monetary 
systems will become effective as soon as possible. 
  As experts explained, following the signing of all the 
documents, the Russian ruble will be freely circulated on 
territories of both states, and for a certain period of time, we 
will return to the situation in which we have already been, 
meaning coexistent circulation of two currencies. Probably, the 
process of transition to the Russian ruble will be considerably 
protracted. Some experts believe that this will last three to 
six months, others do not exclude the possibility that the 
process will be protracted to the end of the year. This is 
connected with purely technical capabilities of providing 
Belarus with cash. 
  Journalists were interested as to why Russia assumed the 
responsibility for curbing inflation in Belarus. In response, 
Vyacheslav Kebich said: 
  "There is no inflation. If we enter the joint economic space 
and the ruble zone; if we unify prices for energy sources for 
Belarus and Russia, even given Belarus' financing exploration 
work and the drilling of new wells; and if we introduce the one 
to one currency exchange rate, we will not join the union as a 
yoke around Russia's neck, but as an equal state." 
  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin described the 
signing of the statement as "an important frontier, for which we 
have headed." According to his words, Russia and Belarus have 
closely approached not only the unification of their monetary 
systems, but also deepening of the economic integration in the 
framework of the CIS. Asked by a BELINFORM correspondent 
whether the Belarusian-Russian union would become a precedent 
for broadening cooperation among other countries of the former 
Soviet Union, the two prime ministers replied affirmatively. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin noted that the establishment of the 
ruble 
zone "is mutually beneficial -- neither one of us wants to 
exploit the other." The Russian prime minister stated that, by 
signing the statement, "Russia does not encroach on Belarus' 
sovereignty. The document is aimed at deepening coordination of 
our economic activities. All of Europe is developing in the 
same direction today." The Belarusian prime minister also 
voiced his viewpoint: "I have always said, and will continue to 
do so, that the signing of the documents we signed today means 
saving Belarus' sovereignty. Had we not done this, we would not 
have preserved our sovereignty."

<F P=106> [Report by Lilya Hrynyavetskaya: "BNF Sees Perspectives in </F>
Elections"] 
  [Text] Bill Clinton's visit to Minsk and the recent 
signing of the collective CIS security agreement were the 
reasons behind a press conference held by the Belarusian Popular 
Front [BNF]. 
  The two abovementioned events bear such great importance for 
Belarus (especially the latter one), so different political 
forces have begun to comment on them. Stanislav Shushkevich, 
who had long resisted the agreement on collective security and 
even spoke of holding a referendum on this issue, has suddenly 
changed his principles and signed the documents, which, 
according to his own words, may lead to a situation when our 
boys will be sent to Tajikistan. Zyanon Paznyak [BNF chairman] 
described the speaker's inconsistency as a desire to avoid his 
probable dismissal (we would like to recall that the legislative 
faction Belarus again plans to put the issue of Shushkevich's 
ouster on the agenda, immediately after the winter holiday). It 
is not sure whether the legislative majority will praise the 
speaker for this accomplishment and forgive him his previous 
inflexibility on this issue. Judging by all signs, BNF is not 
going to forgive its former supporter for his betrayal of 
Belarusian interests (as Paznyak described the signing of the 
treaty). 
  In the opinion of the opposition, the situation in Belarus 
has deteriorated considerably recently. This is connected not 
only with the deep economic crisis, which, according to BNF, was 
caused by the government's clumsy activities, but also with 
attempts against the political independence of Belarus. 
  With the signing of the agreement, the principles providing 
for Belarus' nonnuclear and neutral status included in our 
Constitution have been annulled, believes the opposition. 
Moreover, INTERFAX has disseminated Prime Minister Vyacheslav 
Kebich's statement, in which he admitted of possibility of 
Belarus joining NATO, should Russia do so first. "What is going 
on," complained Zyanon Paznyak, "first the agreement on 
collective security, now -- NATO?! What about our nonnuclear 
and neutral status?" (By the way, permanent NATO members do not 
rush to make room for new members from the former socialist 
camp. Instead of full NATO membership, they have come forward 
with the "Partnership for Peace" initiative -- a compromise that 
has been received by East European countries with skepticism). 
  Belarus should seek Europe's support, stated Paznyak. 
However, the opposition is to take advantage of the upcoming 
visit to Belarus by the U.S. President. Clinton will visit 
Kurapaty and meet with the opposition, possibly, its leader. 
Furthermore, the latter initiative, according to the 
opposition, has come from the American side. 
  In addition to the above-mentioned issues, the opposition 
touched upon the unification of the Russian and Belarusian 
monetary systems, which, in the opinion of BNF, has political 
overtones. They also described the government policy as 
treacherous, and compared the situation in Belarus to the 18th 
century partition of Poland. At the end of the conference, 
Zyanon Paznyak expressed hope that 1994 will be the last year of 
nomenklatura rule.

  [Text] This last time around, the annual conference of the 
Movement for Democratic Reforms -- Democratic Belarus [MDBDR] 
was held behind closed doors. While discussing program goals 
and tasks, the conference split in two. A group of participants 
and MDBDR Cochairman Leonid Zlotnikov found their further 
participation in the conference, as well as in the MDBDR, 
impossible. 
  The discord was provoked both by ideological concerns and, 
according to those who left the conference room, a breach of the 
agreed-upon time limit. One MDBDR leader, Olga Abramova, who 
shares the ideas and approaches of the Civic Union in Russia, 
thinks that the Movement should learn from Volski [leader of the 
Civic Union in Russia], while Leonid Zlotnikov and his adherents 
are more inclined to follow the Gaydar line. It is possible, 
according to a BELAPAN correspondent, that the former members of 
the MDBDR will join the United Democratic Party of Belarus.

Belarusian Supreme Soviet is currently discussing the draft of a 
new constitution without a preliminary resolution on the future 
social and economic system in our Republic. 
  The appeal, in particular, reads: 
  "There are only two possible choices: Exploitation of man by 
man is either allowed or prohibited... Since many people's 
deputies are thinking about the restoration of capitalism [as 
published] in Belarus, we want to draw their attention to the 
fact that the objective laws of natural and social development 
exclude the possibility of backward progress. Just as no one 
can change an old man back into a young one, neither can anyone 
turn history backward from socialism to capitalism. The 
inevitable difficulties at such a turn cannot be overcome. They 
can only bring civil war. To avoid that, we must adopt a course 
to preserve socialism and eliminate its deformities. 
  We are sure that the people of Belarus will support us in 
our 
effort to preserve and improve socialism, as well as develop 
people's democracy at all levels through the soviet system and 
revise the Belarusian Constitution in this direction." 
  Self-confidence is not a bad thing. However, with regard to 
"backward progress," MDSPJ adherents are not quite correct. It 
is according to Marxist doctrine that a society at certain 
stages of development can not only move forward but also roll 
backward. Such phenomena came to happen many, many times. For 
example, the Tartar- Mongol invasion, the Middle Ages...

<F P=106> [Interview with Stanislaw Bagdankevich, chairman of the </F>
Belarusian National Bank, by Valeriy Koribut; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] The upcoming unification of Russian and Belarusian 
monetary systems is by some regarded with hope, and by others 
with wariness. However, first hand information on the event is, 
so to say, in short supply. This is why our newspaper asked the 
Belarusian National Bank chairman, Stanislaw Bagdankevich, for 
an interview. 
  [Koribut] The declaration on the monetary unification signed 
by the Russian and Belarusian prime ministers last week produced 
somewhat mixed feelings. On the one hand, it has said that the 
sides are ready to implement the merger; and on the other hand, 
the whole range of issues seem quite ambiguous... 
  [Bahdankevich] This document reflects in the first place a 
general acceptance of the idea of common currency and the 
mechanism of the merger itself. At the same time, one should 
admit that we have failed to reach a consensus on several key 
issues. The most important of them is the setting of domestic 
prices for energy sources and basic raw materials on the 
territory of Russia and Belarus. The Russian side proposed a 
gradual merger, under which the prices for Belarusian 
enterprises would be lower than elsewhere in the world, and 
would be gradually increased for local consumers. The position 
of the National Bank on this is pretty clear -- immediately 
after the Republic's transition to the Russian ruble, a common 
mandatory price must be set for energy sources and basic raw 
materials within a common customs zone. Otherwise, the merger 
does not make sense since the Belarusian enterprises will prove 
uncompetitive on the Russian market. 
  There are disagreements concerning the rate of exchange of 
the Belarusian ruble to the Russian ruble. We examined several 
options: the one-to-one rate, a rate calculated on retail prices 
of the "consumer basket" and on the stock exchange data. The 
latter is advocated by the Russian Ministries of Economy and 
Finance. The Russian Central Bank is going to bring up this 
issue again at one of its board meetings. It should be stated 
that we only talked about non-cash money. As for the cash, this 
topic will be addressed later. I can only say that we were 
considering the possibility of freezing portions of deposits for 
different terms. For example, 25 percent of large deposits 
could be frozen for three, six, and 12 months. 
  Disputes were also triggered by the mechanisms of financing 
state budget deficits. It is proposed that Belarus coordinate 
them with Russia based on the GDP of each state, which is quite 
a normal procedure. However, the Russian Finance Ministry is 
inclined to perceive credits earmarked for this purpose as the 
Belarusian debt to the Russian Federation. We are absolutely 
against this, seeing them as the government's debt to its 
population repaid through the pricing system; in our situation 
-- through inflationary mark-ups [inflatsionnaya dobavka] added 
to retail prices for goods and services. 
  [Koribut] In our country, reforms in the credit and 
financial sphere are, as a rule, accompanied by unexpected 
losses for one and undeserved benefits for the others. Will the 
National Bank undertake any measures intended to reduce economic 
losses that might be caused by the upcoming merger? 
  [Bahdankevich] It is impossible to completely eliminate the 
possibility of economic problems for specific enterprises -- 
neither through economic nor administrative measures. 
  One should remember, however, that as a matter of fact, we 
are talking about revaluation -- increasing the value of a 
currency unit -- and, consequently, about advantages of those 
with cash on hand, and losses for those who took credits. As a 
result of revaluation, the former will increase their assets, 
while the latter will have more money to repay. This is why the 
National Bank demanded quick credit repayments, the sale of 
ready goods, and the reduction of raw material wastes, etc. Let 
me emphasize that substantial losses might be incurred by 
enterprises that converted their bank credits into hard currency 
in the hope that they would be repaid by the much devaluated 
Belarusian rubles. 
  [Koribut] Everyone knows that the National Bank has 
repeatedly alerted the Supreme Soviet to the need for a gradual 
and balanced approach to the monetary systems unification. Do 
you think that many of those fervently advocating the move now 
will later become its staunchest opponents? First of all, they 
might be managers who will discover that it is not enough to 
enter the zone of the ruble -- one must also earn it. 
  [Bahdankevich] At this point, unification displays its 
positive side. In addition to facilitated and simplified 
circulation of goods, payment settlements, and travel 
regulations, there are also macroeconomic advantages, such as 
the removal of customs duties and the adjustment of domestic 
prices for raw materials. After all, Russia will remain our 
prime market for a long time yet. 
  The negative effects include the Republic's slow pace of 
market- oriented changes, one-sided dependency on Russian raw 
materials, and low competitiveness of Belarusian products. 
Under certain circumstances, they could become dominant, with 
the present negative payment balance that we run with Russia 
threatening to crash our enterprises in massive numbers. This 
is why unification provides no grounds for excessive optimism. 
This is a chance, but will Belarus manage to grab it?

Moscow under the general heading "Americans Talking About 
Russia: U.S. President Bill Clinton's Four-Day State Visit to 
Moscow Begins Today. In Connection with This Event We Are 
Publishing Comments on Russia by Well-Known American Political 
and Public Figures"] 
  [Text] U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen: 
  Difficulties in the course of the reforms are no reason to 
slow them down. 
  The fact that the Russian population is encountering serious 
difficulties in the transition to the market economy is not 
unexpected. However, this is happening not because the reforms 
are moving too quickly but because they are developing too 
slowly. That opinion was expressed by U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen at a meeting with a group of journalists organized 
by USA TODAY. 
  The United States maintains relations with Russia at many 
levels, L. Bentsen said. We are discussing not only nuclear or 
military questions. We are also concerned about bilateral 
economic relations. And we are trying to help Russia make the 
transition to the market economy easier. One of the most 
difficult tasks during such a transformation is to reduce 
inflation, the high level of which in Russia is partly due to 
the continuation of subsidies to some state enterprises on which 
the whole social structure in some regions depends. They are 
continuing to produce goods which are not wanted and whose 
production is not in the interests of consumers. The progress 
in this sphere is quite slow. 
  Nevertheless, Russia has managed to reduce inflation 
somewhat. It has made "astonishing progress" in the 
privatization of small enterprises, too. "In this sphere the 
situation is heartening," L. Bentsen noted. The United States 
is interested in creating more favorable conditions for U.S. 
business investments in Russia. One such sphere is the oil 
industry. The participation of U.S. companies in its 
modernization could give Russia a speedy benefit in the form of 
hard currency. 
  The treasury secretary stressed that Russia should work more 
quickly to elaborate clear rules for the conclusion of contracts 
with foreign companies. Then American firms would have greater 
confidence in the legality of their investments and a clear idea 
what they can expect when contracts are being concluded. "Some 
progress has already been made in this regard. But even more 
remains to be made," L. Bentsen stressed. 
  Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent on what 
he expects from the discussion of economic problems during the 
U.S.-Russian summit meeting in Moscow, the treasury secretary 
said: "I believe that the U.S. Administration will insist on 
further progress in relations between international financial 
institutions and the Russian Government." Efforts must be made 
by both sides, L. Bentsen remarked. They must establish closer 
contact and discuss Russia's observance of the terms for 
granting loans. The United States is also urging the World Bank 
to take measures to help Russia to resolve its social problems 
connected with the dismissal of workers in major industrial 
sectors. 
  The World Bank can grant loans to help rectify the 
situation. 
I hope that the bank will study these opportunities together 
with the Russian Government, the U.S. treasury secretary said.

between the military departments of the Russian Federation and 
the Chechen Republic. 
  Journalists have been told by Colonel Musa Mirzhoyev, a 
spokesman for the president of Chechnya at the headquarters of 
the Chechnya armed forces, that the draft agreement envisages 
preserving the single defense space. According to this 
document, the Russian side has to provide Chechnya's troops with 
weapons, not to use its army against the Chechen Republic, train 
Chechen military experts and provide assistance in the 
maintenance of military equipment. If necessary, the Chechen 
side is obliged to give the Russian forces the use of their 
airfields, to take part in joint military manoeuvers and 
exercises and not to join any bloc opposing the Russian 
Federation.

sources, Aleksandr Zaveryukha would be among deputy prime 
ministers who are to stay in office. The movement warned the 
president that since the government was being cut primarily at 
the expense of the reform-minded wing, "a real threat looms over 
reform yet another time." "In the emerging situation we have to 
warn you that Democratic Russia, true to its principled views, 
will have to reconsider the question of its support for the

  [Text] Moscow, 12 Jan (ITAR-TASS) -- A whole range of 
forecasts about an allegedly inevitable reform in the Interior 
Ministry system have appeared in mass media in the last few 
days. Hypothetical assumptions are also being made about 
personnel changes, says a statement released today from 
Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian president's press secretary. 
  However, absolutely no such conclusions can drawn from the 
decree "On the structure of federal executive bodies" signed by 
the Russian president a few days ago. The government structure 
outlined in the decree retains the Interior Ministry, only 
specifying its constitutional accountability to the Russian 
president. 
  It is only natural that the logic of reforms leads to 
changes 
both in the government and in the operation of individual 
ministries. However, as far as the Interior Ministry system is 
concerned, I have been authorized to state that the president 
and the government have no short-term plans either to reform 
Interior Ministry bodies or to make any personnel decisions, 
says the statement from the Russian president's press secretary.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Bekker article under the "Power" rubric: </F>
"Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin Reform the Government. Fate of 
Council of Ministers' Bigwigs Will Be Decided Any Day Now"] 
  [Text] Having moved into a new building, the Russian 
Government also received a new inner structure on 10 January: 
Boris Yeltsin signed an edict "On the Structure of Federal 
Organs of Executive Power." Under it, the number of ministers 
has been cut to 23, and there will remain 44 state committees 
and committees that are now given an equal status. The 
reorganization boils down to scrapping a range of organs of 
federal power, transforming (complete with name change) 
individual ministries and agencies, and having the "outgoing" 
turn over their functions to those remaining. 
  One may note an enhanced status, to that of a ministry, of 
the State Committee on Economic Cooperation With Commonwealth 
Member States and of the State Committee on Civil Defense, 
Emergency Situations, and Recovery from Natural Disasters. 
Notably, the Agriculture Ministry now incorporates the 
Committee on the Food and Food Processing Industry, while the 
Committee on Price Policy run by Lilya Rozenova, which 
represented a "fifth column" inside the Economy Ministry, now 
becomes completely subsumed in the ministry. Federal organs will 
now delegate some functions to the provinces. An important 
development is that the president takes over the control of 
three ministries (Defense, Internal Affairs, and Foreign 
Affairs) and of seven federal services. 
  The edict directs Victor Chernomyrdin to propose within one 
week his candidates for two first and two "plain" deputies. 
Whereas there has been no doubt in the press as to the future 
status of Oleg Soskovets and Yegor Gaydar, there are varied 
guesses as to who will be vice premiers. Invariably present in 
all the combinations was Aleksandr Zaveryukha, who is personally 
close to the premier and hails from the same part of the country. 
  Who will be the second? Under the president's edict the 
functions of the agency for international cooperation and 
development created by Aleksandr Shokhin have been transferred 
to the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, and this seems to 
signal Shokhin's imminent discharge. Yuriy Yarov, who is 
supposedly leaving to take an elevated position in the State 
Duma, stands virtually no chance. Very significantly, the State 
Committee for the Management of State Property in the new 
structure does not amount to a ministry with Anatoliy Chubays 
still remaining a "vice," having not received even the 
consolation status of minister. As for Boris Fedorov, he is 
very unlikely to agree to become finance minister in a 
government whose vice premier will be Mr. Zaveryukha: too 
divergent views on the economic policy could not make their 
relations warm. But while Boris Fedorov is going to react 
adequately to the lowering of his status, Anatoliy Chubays will 
surely not slam the door. First, he has taken a strong liking 
to what he is doing (and there is plenty to do); second, while 
Gaydar remains in the government, Chubays will see possibilities 
for a gamble against his opponents. 
  Who will be vice premiers? This is of no idle interest in 
the present Russian situation. This is a fundamental question 
of the direction of reforms. If he errs, Viktor Chernomyrdin 
would not only emasculate the reforms, but would also weaken the 
government's intellectual potential in the face of the 
parliamentary opposition.

<F P=106> [Article by political scientist Andranik Migranyan in the </F>
"Opinion" column: "To Change the Team Means To Salvage the Ship"] 
  [Text] The constitution does not accord the State Duma the 
right to dictate the government composition to the president. 
But it enables it to raise the question of confidence in the 
government. It is fairly likely that the Duma in the very first 
weeks of its work will get bogged down in debates precisely on 
this issue. 
  The election results and the composition of the State Duma 
call for preemptive actions on the part of the president and the 
prime minister. They must not wait until the Duma raises the 
question point blank about changing the government composition. 
It is better to do this by themselves. In that event many 
upheavals would be avoided. 
  In my opinion, it would be most reasonable to renew the 
government completely, keeping Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin in 
his post. There are serious grounds for that. The most 
important among them is that over two years the first stage of 
reform has been passed and now adjustment of the course is 
required. 
  Whereas in internal politics adjustment should consist in 
working out a coherent industrial and social program, what is 
needed in foreign policy is a clear-cut definition of national 
and state interests and priorities. Up to now the possibilities 
of international support by Russian speakers in the neighboring 
countries have been left absolutely untapped. The United States 
and Western countries, about which Foreign Minister Kozyrev 
speaks as of Russia's allies, have not been in any way helping 
to address problems related to human rights in the former Union 
republics. Meanwhile these problems have substantially 
aggravated the internal political situation in Russia, which has 
been brilliantly used by Zhirinovskiy in his preelection 
campaign. 
  There is also a psychological dimension, which must not be 
ignored. The conduct of serious economic transformations always 
leads to a situation where their social side effects are 
associated with certain figures. Society has basically gotten 
tired of the same persons. Their replacement in itself will 
calm the people and prolong the "benefit of the doubt" even if 
the economic course remains unchanged. 
  To be sure, to pursue a consistent reformist line a team of 
like-minded people is needed. The current government is no 
longer a monolith: It has broken up into several blocs that 
have vied for seats in parliament. The latter circumstance is 
always seen in public consciousness as an irritating factor. 
Today the government especially needs professionals who would 
be ready to work on a nonpartisan basis. And there is no need 
for politicians who are thinking about their own political 
future in the post-Yeltsin Russia, concerned about creating a 
social and organizational basis for their own participation in 
the next presidential elections. 
  The need to revise substantially relations between the 
president and the government is also there. For the president 
to realize the powers granted him by the new constitution, a 
strategy of reforms must be formed in the presidential 
structures. And the government is called upon to implement this 
strategy. Otherwise Yeltsin will find himself in Gorbachev's 
situation in 1990-1991 when the USSR president was left with 
only one option -- to react to the sociopolitical process that 
had acquired its own logic of development. 
  What is in fact required from the government today? First, 
to prevent hyperinflation. Second, to conduct a more rational 
industrial policy. These tasks will confront any cabinet of 
ministers. But the authorities should be interested in seeing 
it formed from among the "second echelon" of reformer 
economists. Viktor Chernomyrdin is quite capable of becoming the 
conductor of such a course. While formally embodying the 
industrial lobby in the government, over the year of his 
premiership he has shown that he understands the laws of 
macroeconomic regulation and sees the possible negative 
implications of the "Ukrainization" of the economy. The 
presence of the constructive "reformist lobby" in the Duma from 
among the leaders of Russia's Choice, on the other hand, will 
restrain the new cabinet of ministers from an unduly 
inflation-oriented policy. But the main guarantor of the 
continuity of the reform course must be President Yeltsin, ready 
at any moment to intervene in the government's actions. 
  A renewed cabinet of ministers would undoubtedly receive 
support from the Federal Assembly for the next year or year and 
a half. It is not ruled out that a fairly broad left-of-center 
coalition could be formed in the Duma, oriented toward 
constructive cooperation with a government that has not tainted 
itself with "shock therapy." 
  Of course, the president has weighty reasons to doubt the 
expediency of a complete overhaul of the government. Such 
people as Gaydar, Fedorov, and Chubays epitomize the reforms. 
Their electorate is also the most active and consistent 
electorate of Yeltsin. But proceeding from Russia's long-term 
interests, the president should distance himself somewhat from 
the leaders of this orientation. In no case ignore them, but 
try to use these people in other power structures. Their 
deputyship gives them such an opportunity. Remaining rigidly 
linked to one of the groups in the current political spectrum, 
the president should be prepared to see that this will sharply 
narrow the social base of transformations, polarize society, and 
cause damage to the strategic aims of the reform. 
  Yeltsin may -- and not without reason -- fear that he will 
be 
charged with "treachery" for "changing the team." It is another 
matter if the initiative for the renewal of the government comes 
from Chernomyrdin; for this he will naturally have to present a 
program for the continuation of the reforms and a concept for a 
new government. But it would be best if the idea of creating a 
nonpartisan "cabinet of professionals" were initiated by leaders 
of Russia's Choice and other partisan factions in the 
government. This guarantees a conflict-free renewal of the 
cabinet of ministers and its calm work in the near future. 
  It appears, however, that there will no complete renewal of 
the government. What follows from this? Most likely the State 
Duma, where Russia's Choice has no majority, will raise the 
question of confidence in the government. This would mean a new 
spiral of confrontation between the representative and executive 
branches. Of course, the Duma has no serious possibilities of 
changing the government, and generally its powers are limited. 
But this conflict, not so important in itself, will have 
far-reaching implications. The entire responsibility for 
economic failures will be laid exclusively on the government and 
the president. In the context of the crisis and the quite 
probable "popular unrest," even a weak Duma, having embarked 
down the path of confrontation, is capable of extremely 
aggravating the political situation. 
  And amid social and political instability nobody has better 
chances for success than politicians like Zhirinovskiy.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 12, BNS -- Latvian Prime Minister Valdis 
Birkavs apologized to Russia for the Jan. 10 detention of two 
Russian generals, speaking Tuesday [11 January] in the presence 
of foreign diplomats and reporters in the Cabinet building. 
  Birkavs conceded that the incident harmed relations between 
Latvia and Russia. Its authors were thoughtful enough to choose 
the most advantageous moment for a provocation, taking into 
account the coincidence of the Latvian-Russian withdrawal talks, 
the NATO summit and President Bill Clinton's East European trip, 
said Birkavs. 
  Latvia will do all it can to remove the incident's 
consequences and avert similar misdeeds in the future, said the 
premier. 
  Birkavs also acquainted the meeting with resolutions 
approved 
in last night's emergency session of the Latvian Cabinet. 
  The prime minister said that it was possible to 
prognosticate 
the incident but it was impossible to prevent it because of the 
legislative drawbacks. Last night's resolutions at least allow 
for the prosecution of the responsible persons, Birkavs said. 
  Latvian Foreign Minister Goergs Andrejevs said he hoped that 
Russia would not draw a link between the incident and the 
Latvian official policies. 
  Interior Minister Girts Kristovskis noted that Latvia's 
military structures were "haphazardly arranged" because of 
various historical and political circumstances. The National 
Security Council finished to define rights and duties of armed 
formations Monday, Kristovskis added. 
  The Russian response was "adequate to the status quo of 
bilateral relations," said Birkavs. The Latvian Foreign Ministry 
prepared an answer to the Russian Government on the yesterday's 
conflict, Birkavs concluded.

  [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS - Ninety members of the 
Russian Federation Council Thursday nominated Vladimir Shumeyko 
for chairmanship of the new Russian legislature's upper chamber 
in a secret nomination procedure, thus giving him a better 
chance to be elected than in the first two rounds of voting 
Wednesday. 
  Shumeyko's name appeared on slips with nominations filed by 
every member of the chamber ahead of the actual voting, which is 
also to be by secret ballot. 
  If the same number of ballots are cast in his favour as 
there 
were nominations it will take Shumeyko over the 50-percent 
hurdle and land him safely in the chair. 
  On Wednesday, in the first round of voting this pro-Yeltsin 
candidate missed the election by a single vote by scoring 85 
votes, one short of the required 86 vote majority. But the 
second round confusingly brought his figure down to 81, just two 
votes ahead of his main rival, Siberian industrialist Petr 
Romanov. 
  The situation has changed in an unpredictable manner again. 
Today Romanov was renominated by a mere 37 people. The other 
challengers, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, president of an ethnic Kalmik 
Republic, and Eduard Rossel, the leader of the powerful 
association of several industrial regions in the Urals, got few 
votes each and have next to no chance to be elected.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in 
Ukrainian at 1710 GMT on 12 January carries a report on an 
expanded sitting of the Supreme Council commission in charge of 
drafting Ukraine's new constitution, held on 12 January under 
the chairmanship of President Leonid Kravchuk. The sitting was 
attended by chairmen of the oblast and city councils of people's 
deputies, president's representatives in the oblasts, and 
leaders of political parties. 
  Correspondent Anatoliy Komirenko says that the current 
constitution of Ukraine was adopted in Soviet times and, 
although updated, it did not create a legal basis for solving 
political and economic problems facing Ukraine, especially in 
conditions of a deep economic crisis. Which body is to adopt 
the new constitution: the Supreme Council, a constituent 
assembly, or an all-Ukrainian referendum to be held 
simultaneously with the election of people's deputies on 27 
March 1994? Such issues were discussed at the sitting of the 
commission. 
  Komirenko says that in his introductory speech Leonid 
Kravchuk indicated that for the sake of a reliable functioning 
of all the power structures it is necessary to lay down a 
reliable constitutional basis. In the opinion of the president, 
one of the ways to do this is to work up the draft constitution 
which has been elaborated for more than three years now. This 
can be done simultaneously with the elections to the Supreme 
Council. 
  The broadcast then carries a recorded extract from 
Kravchuk's 
speech, in which he says: "What would we like to discuss at 
this meeting of ours? First, if the draft constitution is 
submitted for an all-Ukrainian referendum, any aggravation of 
political struggle should be (?avoided). For this it is 
necessary to polish again and again separate provisions of the 
draft constitution. In particular, it is necessary to withdraw 
-- or formulate in a more clear-cut way -- those provisions 
which may cause aggravation and, by the way, those which can be 
solved by the Supreme Council of the next convocation, as is 
being done throughout the world. That is to say, not all issues 
should be submitted to the referendum in their full volume if we 
know that people' opinions on these issues will differ. 
  "Second, it would be worthwhile introducing relevant 
corrections to the provisions of the draft concerning the 
delimitation of state power and the structure of power in the 
regions, proceeding from the necessity to keep a maximum 
balance, precisely a balance, precisely more extensive rights to 
the regions, proceeding from the policy of decentralization. 
And what's more, all this should be done so as to preserve the 
state's integrity. 
  "Third, it would be expedient to forecast the passing of the 
prepared documents and the draft constitution, both our 
documents which have been handed to you, to the Supreme Council 
and also those to be submitted to the referendum. Nevertheless, 
it would be worthwhile having a forecast, to have a plan of 
action so as to ensure the adoption of the constitution by the 
people of Ukraine. The adoption of the new constitution by a 
nationwide vote would be the optimal, ideal way out of the 
constitutional crisis." 
  Korimenko goes on to say that the sitting participants also 
discussed the draft law on the structure of state power. In the 
opinion of certain speakers, it was elaborated even better than 
the draft fundamental law. In particular, Oleksandr Kotsynba, 
chairman of the standing commission for issues of legislation 
and legality, gave a positive assessment of the draft new 
constitution and a negative assessment of the draft law on the 
structure of state power. In particular, he said that this 
draft law has no mechanism for tackling and regulating a whole 
number of problems ranging from the structure to the plenary 
powers, to the functions of the state bodies, etc. 
  Korimenko adds that Vyacheslav Chornovil, chairman of the 
Ukrainian People's Movement for Perestroyka [Rukh], disagreed 
with Oleksandr Kotsyuba as far as the law on the structure of 
state power was concerned. In his opinion the adoption of such 
a document is imperative. 
  According to Korimenko, the speakers pointed out more than 
once that the draft constitution should be adopted by a certain 
body before it is submitted to a nationwide referendum. 
People's deputy Vitaliy Karpenko favored the idea of convening 
a constitutional assembly. Certain speakers were concerned 
about the fact that the election may fail to take place for one 
reason or another, which means that the referendum on the 
constitution would also be undermined. This is why it would be 
expedient to introduce amendments to the constitution currently 
in force so as to ensure the legitimacy of the new parliament's 
activity. 
  The sitting participants agreed that the future of the state 
depends on the solution of the issue of power. When it comes to 
the constitution, haste is unnecessary; however, further 
procrastination is also inadmissible, Korimenko concludes. 
  The program's announcer then says that, summing up the 
results of the sitting, Leonid Kravchuk emphasized the necessity 
of forming a working group of the members of the constitutional 
commission headed by Ivan Plyushch to summarize the expressed 
proposals and remarks. After this the draft constitution will be 
considered at the conference of the leaders of councils at all 
levels which will take place in Kiev on 18-19 January. With 
regard for the results of the discussion at this conference, the 
draft fundamental law will be submitted for the consideration of 
the ninth session of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. It will 
consider this document, and the most important provisions of the 
constitution, which will not be approved by the Supreme Council, 
will be submitted to the all-Ukrainian referendum on 27 March 
simultaneously with the election to the parliament. This 
proposal was approved by the majority of votes.

Lyushkevich for TASS] 
  [Text] Minsk January 12 TASS -- "The U.S. President's visit 
to the republic is not only of tremendous political and economic 
importance. It will also have great moral significance," 
Belarusian Foreign Minister Petr Kravchenko told a news 
conference in Minsk on Wednesday. 
  The visit will break through the information vacuum caused 
by 
the fact that Belarus was not a sovereign state and will help it 
acquire its political face in the international arena, 
Kravchenko said. 
  He added, however, that President Bill Clinton's visit to 
Belarus is not incidental. This is a recognition of its 
tactful, logical and well-balanced foreign policy, he said. 
  The minister noted that during the talks the sides will 
discuss compensation to Belarus for nuclear disarmament. The 
visit will also give a fresh impetus to the development of 
bilateral relations between the two states. He did not rule out 
the possibility that a set of agreements may be signed after the 
visit, including agreements on investment privileges and 
protection of investments, on scientific cooperation and banking. 
  As for the programme of Clinton's stay in Belarus, there 
will 
be a 30-minute welcoming ceremony at the airport. Then the U.S. 
delegation will proceed to Kuropaty, the burial place of the 
victims of Stalin repressions. In Kuropaty Clinton will also 
meet with Belarusian opposition leader Zenon Poznyak, 
confidential sources told the BELINFORM news agency. 
  Closer to noon, Clinton is expected to hold talks with 
Belarusian Parliament Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich and Prime 
Minister Vyacheslav Kebich. Clinton will also meet with 
Belarusian deputies. After the talks Clinton, Shushkevich and 
Kebich will attend a wreath-laying ceremony at the war memorial 
in the city centre. 
  The U.S. President will address young scientists with a 
15-minute speech at the republican Academy of Sciences. At 
Minsk airport Clinton will meet with U.S. diplomats working in 
Belarus and then leave for Geneva. 
  In the evening, Shushkevich will hold a news conference. 
Clinton will not be present. It has been known, however, that 
the American side plans to hold a news conference at the Hotel 
Planeta where foreign journalists will be staying.

  [Text] Geneva January 13 TASS -- The expectations that the 
second round of Georgian-Abkhazian talks in Geneva would be 
promptly completed have not been justified. The U.N. Secretary 
General's special envoy Eduard Brunner, who chairs over the 
meeting, had to cancel a news conference scheduled for Wednesday 
since the discussion dragged out. 
  The consultations arranged under the U.N. auspices are 
attended by a Russian delegation headed by Deputy Foreign 
Minister Boris Pastukhov. Both Brunner and Pastukhov, who are 
working in close cooperation, face considerable difficulties in 
mediating the talks. 
  TASS learnt from sources close to the participants in the 
meeting that the Georgian and Abkhazian negotiating teams had 
put forth a number of proposals and specifications concerning 
the final document, which is to reflect the key problems of the 
conflict settlement, specifically deployment of peace-keeping 
forces. The two sides also expect to draw up a special 
agreement on refugees. One of the options under consideration 
calls for creating conditions for their return originally to 
Abkhazia's one area only (most probably the Gali district). 
This issue is to be solved with the participation of experts 
from the U.N. High Commissionnair for Refugees' office. 
  Members of the negotiating teams told TASS that the 
discussion was of a constructive and businesslike character. 
However, it is not easy to surmount the differences in the two 
sides' positions, given that such critical problem as Abkhazia's 
future political status has not yet been solved. To all 
appearances, this issue is unlikely to be settled during the 
present round of talks. It is to be addressed by Georgian and 
Abkhazian experts who are expected to meet in Moscow on February 
8.

  [Text] Batoni [Georgian polite form of address] Aleksandr 
Kavsadze, a member of the Georgian delegation at the Geneva 
negotiations, said today in a conversation with a TV 
correspondent that the first day of the negotiations could be 
assessed as constructive and businesslike. 
  As during the first round of talks, our delegation was led 
by 
Batoni Jaba Ioseliani. He presented our proposals concerning 
what questions had to discussed and the views of the Georgian 
delegation as to how these questions should be resolved. On the 
instructions of the head of state, attention was focused on the 
principal question of the return of refugees to their places of 
residence. 
  One of the main questions (?discussed) during the 
negotiations yesterday was the (?return) of refugees. We 
listened to specific proposals presented by the UN High 
Commission, and the Russian side also had specific proposals. 
So, there were serious talks yesterday regarding this question. 
  We listened to information presented by a group of experts. 
They agreed that, today, fundamental documents regarding these 
questions would be prepared and there would also be talks 
regarding individual programs relating to these individual 
questions.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kamyshev report: "Black Sea Fleet Calls on </F>
Yeltsin. Sailors Remind Presidents of Their Problems"] 
  [Text] Disputes about nuclear arms on Ukrainian territory 
have relegated the Black Sea Fleet problem to the back burner. 
The situation there remains tense, however, which was confirmed 
by an appeal signed by officers of a Black Sea Fleet submarine 
formation to the chiefs of Russia, Ukraine, and Crimea, calling 
for the status of the fleet and Sevastopol as its main base to 
be determined as soon as possible. 
  The 1992 Russian-Ukrainian agreements called for a joint 
command of the Black Sea Fleet during the transitional period 
until 1995. In June 1993, the presidents of Russia and Ukraine 
decided to split the Black Sea Fleet equally, and at the 
September meeting in Crimea Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk 
agreed to hand the Ukrainian part of the fleet over to Russia 
toward repaying Ukraine's debts for energy deliveries. 
  The appeal points out that uncertainty over the Black Sea 
Fleet's political future may lead to a situation where Russia 
will simply be left without a fleet in the Black Sea. Given 
this, the authors of the appeal called on the leaders of Russia 
and Ukraine to determine as soon as possible the status of Black 
Sea Fleet servicemen and the city of Sevastopol as the fleet's 
main base, and also to speed up the solution of the question of 
dual citizenship for Black Sea Fleet sailors and their family 
members. The appeal also suggests that Black Sea Fleet sailors 
be allowed to receive pay on Russian territory if Ukraine is 
unable to provide Black Sea Fleet servicemen with money. 
  Meanwhile, a lack of a definitive solution to the problem of 
the Black Sea Fleet's status leads to a further heightening of 
tensions. On Tuesday, the Black Sea Fleet press service 
denounced attempts by the command of the Ukrainian Navy and the 
authorities of the city of Izmail to establish control of the 
Black Sea Fleet's naval engineering service units deployed in 
far-flung garrisons. The statement says that the blackmail and 
threats to which the Ukrainian authorities have subjected the 
sailors may lead to unpredictable consequences. Some crews are 
even ready to stop navigating the Danube as a protest.

  [Text] Moscow January 14 ITAR-TASS -- The official visit of 
U.S. President Bill Clinton to Moscow and meetings of both 
chambers of the new Russian parliament are in the focus of 
attention of Moscow newspapers today. 
  "The meeting of the Russian and American presidents began in 
an atmosphere of genuine partnership," TRUD writes, commenting 
on the Moscow talks. An atmosphere of confidence was 
established right from the beginning of the official visit, the 
newspaper points out further, quoting Bill Clinton as saying 
that it is necessary for the two countries to cooperate for the 
sake of Russia's future, the future of the whole world. The 
essence of the cooperation is in the creation of a new security 
structure in Europe, as well as the advance of democratic values 
and a free economic system, the U.S. President said. 
  Commenting on the results of Clinton's consultative meeting 
with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on intercontinental 
ballistic missiles, the newspaper writes that "the meeting set 
the beginning of a new stage in the Ukrainian-American relations 
and opened up the door to new forms of cooperation in the sphere 
of economy, politics and security. Ukraine's support for the 
`partnership for peace' initiative gives a chance to it to start 
more concrete cooperation with the NATO countries in the 
military sphere and integrate more deeply in the European 
structures." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes about various aspects of 
international security and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, 
that were discussed at the meeting. According to Vyachselav 
Kostiov, press secretary of the Russian president, the sides 
expressed the opinion that nothing is possible in the world 
without Russia and the United States. It follows from that 
statement that "Russia has retained the status of a great power, 
and not only a nuclear power, and the west, in the person of 
Clinton, recognised it without hesitation." 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA writes on the same subject that "the 
consolidation of Russia's greatness should be the main objective 
of the economic and socio-political reform, now under way in 
Russia". This objective is easier to attain by acting jointly 
with other countries, and close Russian-American cooperation, 
built on the principles of partnership, equality and mutual 
benefit, would play an important role in it. So far as European 
security is concerned, which was also discussed during the 
talks, previously the problem consisted in bringing down the 
level of military rivalry and preventing a nuclear catastrophe, 
while now the point at issue is joint, coordinated efforts, 
aimed at maintaining world stability, the newspaper writes. 
  Commenting on the meeting of the Russian and U.S. 
presidents, 
ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI quotes the words of Viktor Glukhikh, chairman 
of the State Committee for the Defence Industries of the Russian 
Federation, who said that "the trend of passing over from open 
technological rivalry to technological partnership has become 
clear." He said that 108 joint project on a wide range of 
scientific and technological problems are now being implemented. 
  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov described 
the 
results of the talks as the opening up of a new stage in 
Russian-American partnership, while "humanitarian assistance 
will be replaced by a package of measures, aimed at the revival 
of the Russian economy," IZVESTIYA writes. 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA and PRAVDA writes briefly about the most 
important moments of the first and second rounds of the 
Russian-American summit talks. 
  So far as the second important topic is concerned --meetings 
of the two chambers of the new Russian parliament -- the 
newspapers focus their attention on the election of Vladimir 
Shumeyko to the post of chairman of the Federation Council. 
According to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, the 98 votes that he got 
"reflect with mathematical accuracy the official position of the 
senators: 65 of them are heads of local administration of 
subjects of the Russian Federation, 11 are staff members of the 
president's administration, 15 are staff members of the 
administration of the government and another 15 are regional 
officials of a lower level." Only two people who voted for 
Shumeyko do not belong to this administrative team, the 
newspaper points out. According to the author of the article, 
if the new chairman really wants the Federation Council to be an 
efficient body, he should offer posts of deputy chairmen to 
representatives of the opposition. "Actually, he is facing the 
dilemma: either obedient deputy chairman along with the obedient 
Federation Council, or vice versa," the newspaper points out. 
  According to IZVESTIYA, the election of Shumeyko to the new 
post means that the president and the prime minister got whom 
they wanted on the post of chairman of the Federation Council, 
and the senators, who depend on the executie authorities, got 
the chairman whom the president and the prime minister wanted. 
Commenting on that fact, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI writes that members 
of the Federation Council can hardly be suspected of "too warm 
feelings for Shumeyko." They voted for him, because, 
irrespective of all his defects, he is "the president's man" and 
can help maintain cooperation with the Moscow power structures. 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA described the lower chamber of the new 
parliament, the State Duma, as a rather ornamental institution, 
deprived of any real power, while IZVESTIYA points to its 
"chaotic" character, judging by the first days of its work. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an article by Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev, which deals with Russia's military 
doctrine, its foreign and domestic policy. "The course of the 
country's foreign policy and security is set by the president of 
the Russian Federation. This fact, recorded in the new 
democratic constitution, reliably protects it from the influence 
of national-extremism. Basically, the course remained unchanged: 
it is aimed at the development of partner-like, good neighbourly 
relations with the rest of the world and continues to be open 
and predictable," Kozyrev wrote. "The military doctrine of the 
Russian Federation, approved by the Russian president early in 
November, is also a guarantee of stability and consistent 
character of the country's domestic and foreign policy. 
Together with the conceptual framework for foreign policy, it 
will be included in the conceptual framework for security, which 
is being drafted now," he pointed out.

  [Text] Kiev -- RUKH-PRESS reported on 13 January that 
People's Movement of Ukraine [Rukh] Chairman Vyacheslav 
Chornovil has described Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk's 
signing of the treaty on removing Ukraine's 176 nuclear missiles 
as a national betrayal. "This treaty will mean the full nuclear 
disarmament of Ukraine in as far as it embraces not only liquid 
fuel missiles, but also modern solid fuel missiles, which do not 
come under the START I Treaty," the Rukh chairman emphasized. 
  This is a shameful capitulation, for Ukraine will receive 
neither a single guarantee of its security, nor serious 
compensation. Two world superpowers -- the United States and 
Russia -- have combined their efforts in order to bring Ukraine 
to its knees. And this is easy for them to do because, having 
plundered the state, the rotten communist regime headed by 
Kravchuk is prepared for any kind of betrayal as long an 
economic catastrophe is averted and they hold on to power at the 
expense of American and Russian handouts. Evidently Kravchuk 
expects the nomenklatura to win in the March elections and the 
Supreme Council to ratify this shameful treaty. If we do not 
remove the traitors from power, Vyacheslav Chornovil warned, 
then that is the end of Ukraine. They will not stop for 
anything -- they will give up nuclear weapons, the Black Sea 
Fleet, the Crimea, and then even Ukraine itself. Then, I fear 
that Ukraine will for the second time this century lose a 
God-given chance to consolidate its statehood." [no opening

  [Text] Kiev -- In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent, 
evaluating the results of the meeting between the presidents of 
the United States and Ukraine on 12 January, Volodymyr Chernyak, 
a member of the central leadership of the People's Movement of 
Ukraine [Rukh] and a doctor of economic sciences, called it very 
ambiguous. He evaluated positively the fact that Ukraine is 
losing the artificially created image of a nuclear monster and 
its international isolation, which had begun to form. He 
expressed satisfaction that Ukraine will get the opportunity for 
wide economic cooperation and will get compensation for 
dismantling its nuclear weapons. 
  Volodymyr Chernyak stressed that the future agreement 
between 
Ukraine, Russia, and the United States is not an agreement on 
nuclear disarmament in general, but solely on the disarmament of 
Ukraine. In his opinion, there is not a single norm whereby 
Russia can have weapons but Ukraine cannot. This is not a 
normal situation, all the more so when such an odious figures as 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy can come to power in Russia. "The 
`partnership for peace' formula," said Volodymyar Chernyak, "was 
adopted by the United States under pressure from Russia so as 
not to accept countries of Central and Eastern Europe into NATO. 
There is nothing realistic in this formula. It does not 
guarantee security, not even for Ukraine."

  [Text] Kiev, 13 Jan -- In an interview with a UNIAR 
correspondent, Levko Lukyanenko, honorary chairman of the 
Ukrainian Republican Party and co-chairman of the Committee of 
National Democratic Forces [Narada Natsionalno-Demokratychnykh 
Syl], noted that the stance of the Ukrainian president at talks 
with Russia and the United States is causing him concern. "I 
fear... that the president wants to sign two agreements: first, 
on general principles of relations, which will evidently be a 
political document; second, on reducing atomic armaments. 
  "Because we do not have the document itself it is difficult 
to talk specifically about its content, but I would very much 
like the resolution, which the Supreme Council adopted on issues 
of Ukraine's nuclear armaments, to be adhered to. I think the 
resolution is a fair one and truly in the interests of the 
Ukrainian people. We are interested in Ukraine getting 
compensation for the nuclear materials of tactical atomic 
missiles, which Ukraine once moved to Russia, and the 
dismantlement itself should take place with the participation of 
foreign funds. We should get political guarantees of our 
independence from nuclear states and from the G-7." 
  The Committee of National Democratic Forces of Ukraine 
believes, Levko Lukyanenko stressed, that the 12 reservations 
expressed in the Supreme Council resolution are directed at 
protecting Ukraine, and any kind of retreat from them is 
inappropriate.

  [Text] The agreement that is to be signed in Moscow will 
definitely rescind Ukraine's nuclear status, stated Taras 
Stetskiv, one of the leaders of the New Wave union, in an 
interview with the Lvov Television Company Mist on 13 January. 
In exchange for ephemeral international aid, Ukraine will 
recklessly dispose of its nuclear weapons. Stetskiv spoke in 
favor of simultaneous disarmament of all nuclear states. The 
only promising news is that the agreement must be ratified by 
the Supreme Council, he added, and this is very unlikely to 
occur. 
  Stetskiv believes that the negative aspect of the 
Partnership 
for Peace initiative is that it contradicts the idea of the 
Baltic-Black Sea Commonwealth; one positive aspect is that it 
has been offered to Ukraine along with other Central Europe 
countries, but not Russia. This, in his opinion, gives a chance 
for Ukraine's integration with Europe without Russia. We should 
knock more decisively on Europe's door, concluded Stetskiv.

  [Text] Kiev -- On 12 January, Acting Ukrainian Prime 
Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy and Valeriy Remizov, first deputy 
chairman of the Russian joint stock company Gazprom, discussed 
the preparation of an intergovernmental agreement on Russian 
natural gas exports to Ukraine and its transit across Ukraine to 
European countries. It was announced by DerzhKomNaftoHaz 
[Ukraine State Oil and Gas Committee] that the duration of this 
agreement would be until 2005, providing for annual gas 
deliveries to the volume of 50-70 billion cubic meters. Ukraine 
will pay for some of the gas by constructing housing and by 
developing the social infrastructure in Russia, in particular in 
Stavropol Kray, as well as selling housing in Ukraine to 
Gazprom. 
  Plans have already been drawn up for 125,00 square meters of 
housing at a price of $500 per square meter. A document will be 
prepared on Russia's use of Ukrainian gas storage facilities 
with a volume of 30 billion cubic meters. The possibility was 
discussed of selling Ukrainian-made rail tankers, AN-74 
aircraft, and fishing vessels to Russia. However, the issue of 
their price was not settled. 
  In accordance with the intersectoral agreement, in 1994 
Gazprom is to supply approximately 60 billion cubic meters of 
gas at $50 per 1,000 cubic meters. The issue of a payments 
procedure in respect of the gas was discussed. In order to pay 
for the transit of gas across Ukraine, Gazprom accountants 
pointed out, Russia must be paid for the gas supplied, rather 
than paying irrespective of gas deliveries. Otherwise there 
will be taxation problems. It was decided that payment for 
transit would be offset by additional gas deliveries. 
  The date of signing the intergovernmental agreement is yet 
to 
be announced.

  [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev believes that 
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have great possibilities for joint 
economic development. He believes this could be achieved 
through mutually advantageous integration, which excludes the 
isolation of the two peoples who have common historical and 
cultural roots and a common future. 
  Nazarbayev made the statement finishing his stay in 
Uzbekistan. On Wednesday [12 January], the last day of his visit 
to the neighboring republic, the president saw ancient Central 
Asian towns of Khiva and Samarkand where he was accompanied by 
Uzbek President Islam Karimov. Nazarbayev saw the architectural 
sights, met representatives of regional authorities and ethnic 
Kazakhs. 
  The presidents of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan signed in 
Tashkent Monday night a treaty on creating a single economic 
space between the two republics. The document provides the 
removal of customs barriers on the border between the two 
countries, free migration of people and movement of goods and 
services and the creation of a legal basis for the joint 
development of communications and transportation. 
  Addressing the news conference, Nazarbayev spoke about the 
need to create a similar economic union. He said that 
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have always favored economic 
integration and denounced self-isolation. In conditions of 
circulation of equivalent national currencies, the idea should 
become a reality, he said, and added that talking in private the 
two presidents favored equal partnership excluding any forms of 
dictate and hegemony.

  [Text] Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev has 
completed his official visit to Uzbekistan. 
  [Ziyamukhamedov] Following the signing of bilateral 
interstate agreements between the Republic of Uzbekistan and 
Kazakhstan and the Mukus conference of the heads of Central 
Asian states on the problems of the area adjoining the Aral Sea, 
Presidents Nursultan Nazarbayev and Islam Karimov visited 
Urgench, the ancient towns of Khiva and Samarkand, where they 
visited world famous architectural monuments. This concluded 
president Nursultan Nazarbayev's official visit to Uzbekistan. 
  [Ganiyeva] What are the main political results? What new 
elements will the meeting contribute toward mutual relations 
between the two states? 
  [Nazarbayev] First, the meeting concluded six months of work 
to bring our economic integration closer. Our experts and 
governments intend the program to last until the year 2000. As 
a result of this work an agreement was signed on joint economic 
space. 
  [Karimov, in progress] ...which presupposes, above all, a 
free economy, a free movement of goods, capital, labor 
resources, manpower, services, and so forth. My view is that 
that we are now tackling problems, difficult economic problems, 
and we are thereby also settling political issues. Today we 
have made the first step toward integration. [Video shows

  [Text] On Thursday the local press published a new decree 
on elections to Uzbekistan's Oliy-Mazhlis (parliament), which 
consequently has been brought into force. The decree stipulates 
that the republic's new parliament will consist of 250 deputies 
elected in one-mandate districts on a multi-party basis for 5 
years. 
  Elections to the Oliy-Mazhlis are held on a nationwide 
basis. 
Citizens aged 18 have the right to vote and citizens not younger 
than 25 years old can be elected to the Uzbek parliament. 
  Political parties, Karakalpakia's parliament (an autonomous 
republic within Uzbekistan), regional and the Tashkent city 
councils of people's deputies can nominate candidates to the 
deputies of the new parliament. 
  Parties have the right to nominate their candidates under 
provision that they are registered by Uzbekistan's Justice 
Ministry not later than 6 months before the elections and have 
collected not less than 50,000 signatures of electors. 
  Citizens who have a previous conviction or have not lived in 
the republic before the elections, servicemen, employees of the 
national security service or Interior Ministry, and ministers of 
religion are not permitted to be registered. 
  The date of the elections to the new parliament has not been 
determined yet. Elections are likely to take place in summer 
1994, when the authorities of the deputies of the present 
Supreme Soviet expire. 
  Two parties officially registered in the republic can 
participate in the elections. These are the legal successor of 
the Communist Party, the Popular Democratic Party chaired by 
President Islam Karimov, and the Party Vatan Tarakkieti 
(Homeland's Progress) formed by the presidential state adviser 
Usman Azimov.

  [Text] Shells are no longer bursting on the worn-out land 
of Abkhazia today. But no one knows whether peace has set in 
for a long time, or whether the war is just taking a short 
breathing space. Fighters on both sides of the Ingur are 
looking into the future through the slits of gun-sights and may 
at any moment come together in a destructive tornado. Where has 
happened to compromise? And what is more important -- the right

self-determination, achieved through the blood of a battle of 
ethnic liberation? In a conversation with our correspondent, 
Professor Taras Shamba, doctor of juridical sciences and 
president of the World Congress of Abkhazian-Abazinian People, 
reflects on this. He reflects with partiality, sometimes with 
prejudice -- but is it easy to behave otherwise over the new 
graves of your fellow countrymen? 
  Of course, PRAVDA is prepared to give the floor to the other 
side too. 
  [Dementyeva] Taras Mironovich, do you think that the war in 
Abkhazia has finished? 
  [Shamba] For Abkhazia, only the first phase of war has 
ended; it has fully rid itself of Georgian military formations. 
Admittedly, groupings remain, hiding in the mountains, in 
individual population centers, but by and large the active 
hostilities have ended. Abkhazian armed formations have stopped 
at the Abkhazian-Georgian border along the River Ingur. The 
main thing for us today is to prevent a new war from being 
unleashed. The point is that the Georgian government troops 
which won a victory over ex-president Gamsakhurdia, have gained 
full control of Western Georgia and concentrated an enormous 
quantity of weapons and manpower on the border with Abkhazia. 
In this connection, it must be said that the Russian leadership 
and the Ministry of Defense have fully reequipped and re-armed 
the Georgian government forces -- they have been given tanks, 
armored personnel carriers, helicopters, airplanes, artillery, 
and ammunition. This started straight after the liberation of 
Sukhum [Abkhazian version opf Sukhumi], when the Abkhazian 
formations approached the border with Georgia. It was done with 
the aim of giving assistance to Shevardnadze in the fight 
against the ex-president, and as a result, a huge military 
potential has accumulated in Georgia. Once again people are 
starting to look for reasons to unleash aggression against 
Abkhazia. Voices can also be heard saying that the main 
railroad route must be protected again, and that the return of 
the refugees will be attended by the need for the presence of 
Georgian troops on the territory of Abkhazia. We do not want to 
be dragged into war again, we do not want the Georgian 
government forces to be given a pretext for returning. 
  [Dementyeva] What about the railroad? 
  [Shamba] In all, 10-12 percent of freight was passing 
through the territory of Abkhazia on its way to Georgia and 
Armenia. And in the area where the Georgian population is 
mainly concentrated -- in Gali, there were six instances of 
attacks on trains or blowing up of bridges. All the other cases 
(over 70) were on Georgian territory. The Abkhazian Government 
has guaranteed, then and now, that freight would travel 
unhindered through Abkhazian territory. That is, the problem 
does not exist here. The desire to place Georgian government 
troops along the entire mainline route, in every area, means 
another occupation of Abkhazia. Naturally, the Abkhaz side 
cannot agree to this at all. 
  [Dementyeva] Has any progress been made at the 
Georgian-Abkhazian talks? 
  [Shamba] Peace in the region depends on how the Georgian 
politicians behave. It would be wonderful if Shevardnadze and 
his entourage had sufficient common sense to sit down at the 
negotiating table 11 January 1994 under the aegis of Russia and 
the United Nations. These should be held in Moscow or Geneva. 
We need to agree on what mutual relations between Abkhazia and 
Georgia should be like. Then we could start to restore the 
economy, the social sphere, culture, we would be able to create 
opportunities for the gradual return of refugees. After all, 
Sukhum and Ochamchira have been practically destroyed, and many 
villages have been completely obliterated. And difficult 
experiences would await those who returned there now -- because 
of the blockade by Russia, there is no light, water, bread, or 
other foodstuffs. The humanitarian aid which is supposed to 
pass through Krasnodar Kray to Abkhazia is also being blocked. 
  [Dementyeva] So far no one has heard a lucid answer from the 
Abkhazian side as to why the Sochi agreement was disrupted? 
  [Shamba] The point is that the Georgian side used this truce 
in order to move up its forces and get new weapons. But, even 
though we knew this, we waited. And we trusted them. But the 
deadline for the withdrawal of the equipment and the departure 
of the troops was violated for the 11th time! 
  And when Shevardnadze claimed that by the time of the 
offensive by the Abkhazians, the Georgians in Sukhum were left 
empty handed, this did not correspond with reality, to put it 
mildly. Pehapse the only thing lacking there was nuclear 
missiles. Now that Sukhum has been liberated it is possible to 
familiarize oneself with the type of weapons that Georgia had at 
its disposal. They had an enormous quantity of tanks, armored 
personnel carriers, "Uragan" and "Grad" systems, howitzers, and 
state-of-the-art types of artillery -- 100mm and 120mm guns. 
Every cloud has a silver lining -- now the Abkhazian formations 
are equipped with state-of-the-art types of equipment which they 
managed to capture from the enemy. Plus the ones which the 
Georgians stored at dumps and bases in Sukhum and Ochamchira. 
  The mass media in Russia and abroad have created every 
possible condition for the Georgian side to present the facts in 
a light that is advantageous to it. For example, the story 
about the airplanes brought down in Sukhum. They claimed that 
women and children were traveling in them. But who is this 
meant to fool? These "women and children" flying into the combat 
operations area turned out to be a landing party hurrying to 
bring assistance. 
  [Dementyeva] How would you argue against the accusations of 
ethnic cleansing? 
  [Shamba] I would like to recall that the ethnic cleansing 
was started by the Georgians; Georgia for the Georgians was 
their idea. And these were official slogans. Karkarashvili, 
the commander of the Georgian government troops in Abkhazia, 
promised that he would destroy all 97,000 Abkhazians, and he 
would not begrudge assigning 100,000 Georgians for this purpose. 
And after all, no one has repudiated this policy. Furthermore, 
Shevardnadze then appoints Karkarashvili as defense minister and 
general. That means that the chauvinistic policy remains. 
Would it otherwise really have been possible to arrange mass 
annihilations of Armenians, Greeks, Russians, not to mention 
Abkhazians? And if it were not for the personal request of the 
Russian president, I think that Shevardnadze would already have 
been captured and would evidently stand trial. 
  [Dementyeva] Did the president turn to Ardzinba directly? 
  [Shamba] No, the deputy foreign minister spoke to the Abkhaz 
leadership on his behalf. He asked for the possibility to get 
Shevardnadze out of the territory of Abkhazia alive. I will not 
hide the fact that the main hopes are pinned on Russia's 
peacemaking role. Although it has maintained neutrality 
throughout the conflict, and although we have not received the 
assistance that Georgia has received, the services rendered by 
Russia in establishing peace on Abkhazian soil is enormous. 
Boris Nikolayevich Pastukhov really did sincerely try to help 
resolve the conflict by political means. 
  [Dementyeva] But nevertheless, how does Abkhazia plan to 
structure its relations with Georgia? 
  [Shamba] For its own part, Abkhazia has decided that it must 
be a sovereign, rule-of-law, democratic state. A subject of 
international law which can and should, I believe, establish 
relations with Georgia, with Armenia, with Russia, with Turkey, 
with Greece, and with other states. At the moment it is hard to 
say what the nature of these relations will be, because a great 
deal depends on Georgia. And on the leaders who head it today. 
Will they realize that Abkhazia is not an appendage, it is not a 
province of Georgia, but a sovereign democratic state with which 
relations must be constructed on the basis of equal rights? 
Then all questions can be resolved. And there are a great many 
common problems connected with transportation, the development 
of industry, communications, and finances. If Georgia displayed 
good will, we could reach agreement and have a good relationship. 
  [Dementyeva] But you do understand that Abkhazia is a 
remarkable land, and Georgia considers it to be its own 
territory. It will scarcely let it go... 
  [Shamba] It is not their problem whether to let it go or 
not, because Abkhazia itself, by its own will, has reached 
independence and sovereignty, and it now depends on the citizens 
of Abkhazia what the republic's status will be. When this 
status is determined, the citizens will evidently elect a new 
parliament. A draft of a new Abkhazian constitution has now 
been proposed. It will be discussed at the Supreme Soviet, and 
if it is adopted, then the future will also need to be 
determined according to this constitution. And I believe that 
when the legislative organs are created, it may prove necessary 
to hold a referendum. The people of the Republic of Abkhazia -- 
Abkhazians, Russians, Armenians, Greeks, Estonians, and 
representatives of other nationalities are included here -- will 
be able to determine their own fate. Abkhazia has now officially 
appealed to Greece, Israel, and Russia for assistance in 
returning the refugees who went to those countries during the 
war. Representatives of the Greek diaspora in Moscow are 
already discussing and counting up the cost of mechanisms for 
returning the Greeks home. 
  [Dementyeva] It has repeatedly been claimed, notably by the 
Georgian side, that the rights of representatives of 
non-Abkhazian nationality are being violated. I understand that 
the land is called Abkhazia, but a lot of different peoples live 
in it and they all have the right to resolve the future of this 
land together. What do you think about this? 
  [Shamba] The future of Abkhazia should be resolved by all of 
its population. Abkhazia has always been an multi-ethnic 
[internatsionalnaya] republic. Even travelers in ancient times 
noted that you had to be able to speak 130 languages in 
Dioscurias [ancient name of Sukhum]. Sukhum is an international 
city, and it should remain that way. Ordinary people are not to 
blame for the flaws of the previous policy. After all, we all 
remember perfectly well how the population of Abkhazia increased 
by 160,000 Georgians in the space of 10 years. Many Georgians, 
who were forcibly resettled in our country in accordance with 
the "Abkhazpereselenstroy" program, would return to their 
homeland, but they were nevertheless sent back to Abkhazia by 
force. That is how the forcible assimilation proceeded. Up to 
half of the names of population centers were renamed in 
Georgian, schools were closed, as was the radio, and everything 
that was connected with the Abkhazian language, culture, and 
literature was destroyed. But our people have a thousand-year 
history... 
  [Dementyeva] What will be the fate of the Georgian 
population? That is evidently the problem. Many Georgians who 
fled from Sukhum when Abkhazian troops entered the city, say 
that they have found out that their houses have now been 
occupied. What will be the mechanism for returning these 
Georgians home, and returning their property to them; will they 
be able to feel safe in Abkhazia? 
  [Shamba] Following the liberation of Sukhum, unfortunately 
it did not prove possible to take control of the city straight 
away and establish firm law and order. Marauders and plunderers 
committed outrages. War always means crimes and violence. But 
the situation is now changing. Several groups of marauders and 
bandits -- international ones, incidentally -- have now been 
neutralized. Life is gradually settling down, and it is possible 
to return refugees, including Georgians. But of course the 
approach to those who want to return will be differentiated. 
The horror which the Georgian formations left behind in 
Abkhazia will not be forgotten in a hurry. After all, entire 
villages were destroyed. But when people of various 
nationalities write what was done to them.... In brief, it will 
be necessary to establish, for every refugee who wants to 
return, what was his personal role in the military conflict. 
Whether he fought weapon in hand against the Abkhazian people 
and committed evil.... 
  As for the houses and apartments, yes, there really is a 
problem here. Many houses are standing empty, some people 
returning have found their houses burned down -- where are they 
to go? So they temporarily occupy the empty houses. This is 
not being done in an uncontrolled way, but with the permission 
of the administration, and strict registration is in effect. 
When the previous owners return they will definitely have to be 
given back their living space, but before then, we must try to 
restore the housing stock. Many of those who fought, for 
instance Cossacks and North Caucasus people, want to stay in 
Abkhazia. They are being authorized to temporarily live in the 
houses and apartments which are standing empty, so that later, 
when the situation has more or less stabilized, they can be 
allocated land and given assistance in housing construction. 
  [Dementyeva] How many people has Abkhazia lost in this war? 
  [Shamba] According to foreign information, the Abkhazian 
side has lost up to 5,000 people in this war, including around 
2,500-2,600 Abkhazians. 
  [Dementyeva] What will Abkhazia do if the Georgian 
Government troops nevertheless cross the Ingur? 
  [Shamba] I very much hope that there will be no war. But if 
it does break out, I believe that the new war will bring Georgia 
to a state of collapse. It will end its existence as a state. 
After all, the Abkhazian formations could go further than the 
Ingur... I think that the Georgian rulers should assess the 
situation rather more soberly. They are dealing with not just 
Abkhazian people, but the entire Caucasus region. And peace 
must finally come to this region.

  [Text] "Aware of my position and the moral state of the 
Georgian nation, I have decided to take my life in order to 
consolidate Georgians, Abkhazians, Ajarians and other peoples 
living in Georgia," reads Zviad Gamsakhurdia's last testament. 
This document was passed to Interfax by one of his nearest 
associates, who witnessed the suicide of Georgia's first 
president. 
  "I have used all legitimate and democratic ways of regaining 
power. My people, who love me, did not do everything they could 
to support me. I think my death will unite the people of 
Georgia. Let it be a symbol of protest for all peoples aspiring 
to freedom and independence," says Gamsakhurdia's testament. 
  "Russia, you, too, are to blame for my death. You will be 
repaid a hundredfold for your unworthy deeds. You are as much 
responsible for my death as my countrymen," says Gamsakhurdia's 
testament.

  [Text] Tbilisi January 13 TASS -- Tbilisi Military 
Commandant Zaza Chachua called for extending the state of 
emergency in the Georgian capital for several more months. 
  In an interview with journalists on Thursday, Chachua 
explained his call by the fact that the state of emergency 
imposed in the city on September 20, 1993 for two months and 
then prolonged for another two months has failed to restore law 
and order and combat crime in the capital. 
  Chachua stressed that at least 15,000 to 20,000 people are 
needed to keep up order in the city. At present the total 
number of Interior Ministry and regional police troops in the 
whole republic does not exceed 25,000 people. 
  Chachua said that during the state of emergency law 
enforcement bodies have confiscated 160 sub-machine guns, six 
machine guns, three grenade launchers, about 70 grenades, large 
amounts of ammunition and explosives and even one large-caliber 
gun from an armoured personnel carrier. 
  One to two out of 100 crimes reported in Tbilisi are 
committed at night when a curfew is in effect, the commandant 
said.

  [Excerpts] A significant number of the inhabitants of 
Kutaisi [Georgia's second city] have remained without electric 
power and water. Naturally, inhabitants of rayons in western 
Georgia are unable to watch television. However, the situation 
has become even more complex during the last four-five months. 
Last night, for almost six hours, Kutaisi and its environs were 
transformed, as they say, into a "dead" zone. Electricity was 
cut, all work came to a halt, and telephone communications were 
severed. In short, the city and its 300,000 inhabitants are 
experiencing the most difficult conditions. There is, in 
general, no natural gas; it is not possible to supply the 
minimum amount of electric power; water is being supplied barely 
once a week. [passage omitted] 
  In spite of the situation yesterday, all municipal police 
employees are honorably fulfilling their duties. They are 
displaying particular vigilance in such extreme conditions. 
  One can state that Kutaisi's No. 1 and No. 2 bakeries have 
diesel generators on permanent standby and, as a result, the 
city is being supplied with bread. Work has not stopped at the 
bread mill. 
  In short, Kutaisi is in an extremely difficult situation. 
[passage omitted] 
  Kutaisi has submitted a request to the Cabinet of Ministers 
that it nevertheless be supplied with electric power according 
to the schedule and that the city receive natural gas once a 
week. It is impossible for such a big city to remain paralyzed 
throughout the entire winter.

  [Text] A government commission has been set up and a 
program worked out for the gradual return of refugees, says 
video correspondent Ruslan Khashig. 
  Khashig says about 20,000 Russians, Armenians, and Jews have 
returned to Abkhazia from Russia over the three months since the 
end of the war. 
  The issue of the return to Abkhazia of Greeks sent to Greece 
during the war is almost settled, and special Athens-Sukhumi 
flights are soon to be organized by a Greek firm for this 
purpose. 
  The government commission for refugees has begun 
preparations 
to return Georgian refugees to Abkhazia's Galskiy Rayon. The 
commission held a random session yesterday in the town of Gali 
and met with the inhabitants of the rayon, he said. 
  The crime situation in the area is bad, which hinders the 
return of refugees, the commission pointed out. A decision was 
made to tighten the curfew, the video reporter said. 
  Refugees are returning without waiting for the issue to be 
finalized officially. Over 500 have already returned, not by 
the bridge over the Inguri River, but by the ford, which is 
dangerous. This means they avoid the checkpoint on the Georgian 
side that, strangely, is not letting them through. The refugees 
themselves told us that it is specifically the inhabitants of 
Gali Rayon who are being hindered from returning to their homes, 
the reporter said.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Reports by </F>
Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitry Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaly Trubetskoi and others] 
  [Text] The Wednesday [12 January] extraordinary session of 
the Armenian parliament has confirmed the privatization program 
and program of denationalization of state enterprises and 
uncompleted constructions sites. As many as 125 of 156 deputies 
have voted for this decision. 
  Addressing the session, President Levon Ter-Petrosian, who 
was the initiator of this extraordinary session, expressed 
dissatisfaction with the fact that Armenia is far behind in the 
privatization process. In his words, until now Armenia has made 
only two serious steps in this direction, namely privatization 
of land and housing. 
  "It's a shame to call privatization what we are discussing 
now because these are just those first elementary moves which 
had to be made much earlier. These moves don't even have any 
connection with the economic policy," underlined Ter-Petrosian. 
As he said, "the private sector always existed and played a 
certain role in the sphere of the economy in normal communist 
states, for example, in the previous German Democratic Republic, 
Hungary, or China." 
  The president believes that the third serious step to be 
made 
in the near term should provide for issuance of cash totalling 
20% of industrial enterprises'cost value to their workers. He 
also deems it necessary to expand lists of sites destined for 
privatization. 
  In his interview with Interfax Ter-Petrosian pointed out 
that 
Armenia plans to carry out "a widescale privatization of small 
sites" and this, to quote Ter-Petrosian, must "give a noticeable 
stimulus to the republic's economic life." 
  IF Note: According to the program confirmed by the 
parliament, 8,913 sites will be privatized in 1994, 61% of which 
are uncompleted construction sites, agricultural sites, state 
trade enterprises, and catering and servicing enterprises. In 
1995-1996, the percent of these sites is to grow to 74%. Small 
enterprises are the first to be privatized (there are 75% of 
them in the republic), with the number of workers at 80% of 
these enterprises not exceeding 5 people.

  [Text] Baku, January 13 (AZERTAC]--The Armenian armed 
forces suffering defeat caused by the Azeri national army, 
decided to revenge itself on civilian population of Azerbaijan. 
The districts of Kazakhskiy, Kedabekskiy and Tauzskiy, which 
border on Armenia in the south-west, were subject to heavy 
shelling of the Armenian artillery yesterday. There are victims 
and heavy destruction. 
  The Defence Ministry says yesterday's fight did not change 
the situation at the front. The Armenian armed forces attempts 
to attack the village of Hakop-Kamari from Terter, Agdam and 
Beylagan directions were stopped by the Azeri national army. 
The enemy suffered heavy casualties.

sustained major losses. 
  The Republican Defence Ministry said on Thursday that an 
Armenian tank and an armoured personnel carrier were destroyed 
in fighting in Fizuli region and another tank, a mortar and 
nearly one hundred mines were seized from retreating Armenians. 
  A major Armenian unit got onto a mine field while

strikes on Armenians who fled the battle scene leaving major 
losses behind them, according to the source. 
  The ministry also said that casualties and damage were 
reported in Azeri border settlements in the north-west of the 
country in two days of intensive Armenian shelling from

  [Text] Azerbaijan's Foreign Minister, Gasan Gasanov, 
declared in his interview with Interfax that assertions by 
Armenian sources about great losses by the Azerbaijani army 
during hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh are nothing more than 
lies. 
  He pointed out that "this is the product of work of the 
Armenian propaganda machine." The Armenian party, the minister 
said, strives to suppress the spirit of the Azerbaijani army 
while simultaneously trying to raise the spirit of its own army. 
  Gasanov again accused the Armenian party of attempts to 
solve 
the Karabakh conflict by coercive methods.

<F P=106> [Address by President Geydar Aliyev to army officers </F>
assigned to fronts on 13 January; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] On my instructions, the Azerbaijani Chief of 
General Staff organized a meeting with a group of officers 
serving in Baku, in military commissariats and other military 
units. 
  The purpose of our meeting was this: The process of forming 
the Azerbaijani Army has been going on in our republic for the 
last few months. And, you are witness to the fact that this 
process is going in the correct direction and positive results 
are being achieved. All these things contribute to the 
improvement of the Azerbaijani Republic's defenses and armed 
forces. [passage omitted] 
  I can now happily note that the work of forming an army is 
speedily progressing in Azerbaijan, our military units are 
taking shape, our armed forces are working to create a regular 
army, and the measures we have taken have started giving 
results. The existing army units that are in the battle zones 
are befittingly displaying their military potential and power 
[words indistinct]. 
  You are already aware of the changes taking place in recent 
months. You are all officers serving in the Azerbaijani army. 
The changes in recent months are obvious, these being: 
Disciplined military units are being created in our army, and 
many have already been created; and in those regions where they 
defend Azerbaijan on Azerbaijan's own territory, these units are 
giving a deserving reply to the Armenian armed forces, 
inflicting extremely heavy blows to them, and are reliably 
defending Azerbaijan's territory. 
  The fighting and warfare is continuing. The war is being 
waged by the Armenian Armed Forces against the Azerbaijani 
Republic. I already said that a portion of our land has been 
occupied, and the Armenian Armed Forces still believe that by 
occupying more territory they can impose their conditions on 
Azerbaijan. If they previously had some chance of achieving 
this objective, now they no longer have a chance to do so. The 
Azerbaijan Army units facing the Armenian Armed Forces are 
reliably defending our lands all along the front. In so doing, 
they are undoubtedly waging battles and, as I already said, they 
are striking hard at the Armenian Armed Forces. 
  You know that as a result of these battles some of the 
occupied Azerbaijani lands have returned to the control of the 
Azerbaijani Army -- that is, these lands have been recovered and 
the Azerbaijani Army units are now courageously trying to regain 
the rest of the occupied lands. 
  These are bloody battles. Our Azerbaijan Republic's brave, 
heroic sons, our soldiers and officers in the army, all our 
fighters -- and I note this with satisfaction -- are fighting 
heroically, and they are being killed and wounded. But I want 
to note that henceforth superiority rests with the Azerbaijani 
Army in these battles, and enormous losses have been inflicted 
on the Armenian Armed Forces as a result of these heavy blows. 
They are suffering heavy losses in men and material every day 
and are being defeated. 
  All these developments are exacerbating the situation on the 
borders. Again it is the Armenian side that is responsible for 
this exacerbation. You are aware that I have frequently stated 
that we want an end to the war, the fighting, and to hold peace 
talks. I have put forward proposals and made statements in this 
direction. However, the Armenian side is not in accord with 
this, and sometimes they put forward conditions that we 
undoubtedly cannot accept. 
  Therefore, the Armenian side and the Armenian Armed Forces 
are culpable and responsible for all the ongoing fighting and 
the war, whereas we are fighting to defend our own lands and 
homeland. 
  Inevitably, as the fighting intensified in this manner we 
felt a need for measures to further mobilize our forces. In 
this context, the Azerbaijani youth are now applying to serve in 
the army with high spirits. The situation is no longer the same 
as previously, when there were a considerable number of 
desertions from the army. Now, as you know, after my address to 
the nation on 2 November there was an upsurge in patriotism 
among all the citizens, especially the youth and those able to 
serve in the army. They are coming to the military 
commissariats and military units of their own volition to enter 
the fight and serve in the army. [passage omitted] 
  Our officer cadres at the fronts are fittingly fulfilling 
their duties, and displaying excellent heroism. However, our 
officers should be even closer to the war front and should be 
active there and serve there. 
  The Defense Ministry leadership informed me that the 
officers 
gathered here will be sent to the military units. Maybe most of 
the officers here are serving in the military commissariats and 
in army units deployed in Baku, but now you should continue your 
service in the military units at the battlefronts. [passage 
omitted] 
  You are officers in the military service, which has an 
unbreakable law that says that any serviceman serves where he is 
assigned by the homeland and army command. You all know this, 
so you should comply with the orders you will receive today, and 
I hope that you will go to the fronts, serve in the army units 
there and thus enhance Azerbaijan's defensive potential and 
contribute your share to the defense and recovery of our lands. 
[passage omitted] 
  I wish you success and hope that you will all go to the 
front 
and display heroism. That is all I have to say. God help you 
in your glorious work, and I hope that you will honorably 
discharge the orders given to you by the homeland. We are 
waging a war for the homeland, for the defense of our homeland, 
and you are active participants in this war for the homeland.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Arefyev, deputy head of the Russian </F>
Federation Government apparatus, by Ruslan Ignatyev; place and 
date not given: "Government: Restructuring on the March"] 
  [Text] A Russian Federation presidential edict has 
approved the new structure of federal organs of executive 
authority. A ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA special correspondent asked 
Yevgeniy Arefyev, deputy head of the Russian Federation 
government apparatus, to comment. 
  [Ignatyev] Yevgeniy Parfiryevich, on first acquaintance with 
the edict the impression is that minor changes have been made to 
the structure of government, the number of ministries is little 
reduced, and there has been practically no reduction in cabinet 
numbers. The question is: Was this restructuring necessary? 
  [Arefyev] Yes, the media are currently claiming that there 
have been no significant changes in the structure of the 
government. That is not so. First of all I want to say that 
the reorganization of federal organs of executive authority was 
necessary in view of the adoption of the Russian Federation 
Constitution, since there were many elements in the old 
structure that did not correspond to the country's main law. 
For instance, we have 22 ministries and 15 state committees. 
The latter's chairmen were members of the government, together 
with the ministers. Article 110 of the Constitution makes no 
provision for that. Point 2 says: "The Government of the 
Russian Federation comprises the chairman of the Russian 
Federation Government, the deputy chairmen of the Russian 
Federation Government, and federal ministers." That is why some 
state committees were turned into federal ministries. For 
instance, the Russian Federation State Committee for Economic 
Cooperation With Commonwealth States was turned into the Russian 
Federation Ministry for Cooperation With CIS States. The word 
"economic" was deliberately removed from the old name. So the 
functions of the new structure have been expanded. 
  [Ignatyev] So it was decided, as it were, to adapt the new 
government structure to the Constitution? 
  [Arefyev] No. The entire restructuring of the federal 
organs of executive authority was a response to the command of 
the times, to the new economic and social transformations that 
are currently taking place in our country. We are not just 
changing nameplates. Indeed, some ministries were created by 
combining state committees with other departments with related 
functions and activities. For example, the Russian Federation 
Ministry for Civil Defense, Emergencies, and for Eliminating the 
Aftermath of Natural Disasters was the successor to the state 
committee of the same name. But it incorporated the functions 
of the former Russian Federation State Committee for the Social 
Protection of Citizens and Rehabilitation of Territories 
Affected by the Chernobyl and Other Radiation Disasters, the 
Committee on Special Underwater Work, and the Russian Federation 
Air and Space Search and Rescue Service. 
  [Ignatyev] So there was practically no reduction and some 
departments acquired higher status by being revamped or 
combined, while others joined other government structures? 
  [Arefyev] All state committees left the government. Some of 
them did become ministries; others were absorbed into new 
structures, while nine of the 15 remained autonomous. They are 
performing the same functions as before, but they are operating 
within the framework of the law. I think this is the right 
decision. Irrespective of any change of government, the 
leadership of these committees will not now be replaced. As a 
rule, they are structures with very specific functions. Their 
work requires stability above all else. But some departments, 
such as the Russian Federation State Committee for the 
Management of State Property, could be turned into ministries, 
if necessary. It would require the Federal Assembly's adoption 
of a number of amendments to existing laws. Whereupon, the 
president would be able to issue an edict transforming the 
department. So of the 37 former members of the government who 
were heads of ministries or state committees, only 23 remain. 
Don't you call that a significant reduction?! We are nearly 
matching world standards now. 
  The world average for cabinet members is between 12 and 25. 
We now have a total of 29 instead of 45. 
  [Ignatyev] Is it possible to say at this point who will be 
the top people in the new cabinet? The press has already 
suggested the names of Gaydar, Soskovets... 
  [Arefyev] First of all I want to say that for the moment all 
the members of government are performing their duties as before. 
None has been dismissed. It is too early to talk about a new 
leadership. But if consultations have taken place in this 
matter, only two people -- Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin and Viktor 
Stepanovich Chernomyrdin -- can put specific names to the deputy 
prime ministers. And the press is misinforming you by 
publishing the names of candidates. We will get precise 
information in the very near future and we will certainly tell 
you.

<F P=106> [Report by Igor Karpenko of interview with Dmitriy Vasilyev, </F>
deputy chairman of the State Committee for the Administration of 
State Property; place and date not given: "New Privatization 
Program Adopted. But They Are Already Intending To Revise It"] 
  [Text] The president's edict "on the state program for the 
privatization of state and municipal enterprises in the Russian 
Federation" has been adopted. It would seem the end of the 
odyssey of a long-suffering document, which took 18 months to 
squeeze through the departmental turnpikes and parliamentary 
antagonism. Dmitriy Vasilyev, deputy chairman of the State 
Committee for the Administration of State Property 
[Goskomimushchestvo], told IZVESTIYA how it differs from the 
1992 program and what fundamental changes have been made to it 
by the government, time, and the economic situation in the 
country. 
  The present program, like the previous one, sets as its main 
aim the formation of a broad stratum of private owners as the 
economic basis of market relations. All the main means of 
privatization have been preserved as have the previous three 
types of benefit (incentives for the third type have been 
drastically enhanced), and the principles for voucher 
privatization that does not involve money [besplatnaya], the 
existing mechanism for voucher auctions, and so forth have been 
enshrined. 
  If you compare the "democratism" of the two programs then in 
D. Vasilyev's opinion one can sense in the new one a "certain 
deterioration -- there are more departmental bans and additional 
tough bureaucratic measures have been introduced." 
  At the same time all procedures of importance for voucher 
privatization have been successfully defended in the government 
and enshrined in documents and the list of property open to 
privatization has been expanded. D. Vasilyev believes that the 
sections on the privatization of nonresidential premises and the 
sale of land plots attached to enterprises are particularly 
important. Land and real estate are the foundation of small 
business, the basis of the next wave of market reforms. It is 
important that in the privatization process permission has been 
given to "divide up" and sell uncompleted construction projects. 
  A new section on foreign investments, in fact, lifts all 
restrictions for the participation of foreign businessmen in 
auctions and when buying shares for money and for vouchers. 
Actually one -- substantial -- restriction is envisaged for 
foreign businessmen: The federal counterintelligence service 
can submit to the government within a month a substantiated 
conclusion to the effect that shares should not be sold to a 
particular investor. Counterintelligence intends thus to prevent 
the "laundering" of money by the narco-mafia, the criminal 
world, and so forth. 
  The program substantially strengthens the role of investment 
funds. They have finally been allowed to increase the 
proportion of shares of a single enterprise in their portfolio 
to 25 percent instead of 10 percent, which will enable funds to 
take a real part in the management of joint-stock companies. 
Some funds have collected only 1,000 vouchers and, realizing 
that they simply cannot function, have been obliged to surrender 
their shares to larger and more powerful colleagues. This 
practice of some funds being "swallowed up" by others has now 
been legalized by the program. On the other hand, commercial 
banks' opportunities for purchasing the shares of privatized 
enterprises have been palpably limited. 
  The new program in general devotes substantial space to the 
defense of shareholders' rights. Henceforth all fundamental 
decisions -- on liquidating the company, on changing the 
incorporation capital, on joining a holding company or financial 
and industrial group, on selling a large proportion of its 
property -- will be made only at a meeting and with the 
agreement of three fourths of shareholders. The actual 
procedure for holding and preparing meetings has been 
"prescribed," ruling out the possibility of disregarding the 
opinion of ordinary shareholders, and so forth. 
  Dmitriy Vasilyevich believes that the biggest flaw in the 
new 
program is what he called "fantastically large section on the 
sectorial features of privatization, which includes goodness 
knows what -- from timber procurement establishments to medicine 
and cultural institutions." There were endless disputes in the 
government over the "specific features" of privatization in 
literally every sector, which in actual fact do not and should 
not exist. Vasilyev is convinced that this is only the first 
"pass" by the ministries and that this trend will strengthen and 
develop. And as proof he cited a striking fact: On 24 December 
the edict was signed, on 30 December it left the president's 
office, and today several ministries have already prepared the 
draft of one more edict...on repealing the privatization program 
in connection with the new political situation. The thrust of 
the changes is to approve departmental monopoly in a different 
incarnation -- through holding companies and giant financial and 
industrial groups. 
  To my question as to whether the new political situation is 
linked with the possible response of the State Duma Dmitriy 
Vasilyev replied that privatization will hardly be subjected to 
serious attacks from parliament in the near future -- it has 
enough concerns of its own. The "situation" in the government 
is more complex. 
  According to some reports the government intends to use 
Anatoliy Chubays' deputy's duties and status as faction deputy 
chairman as a pretext for removing him from the post of 
Goskomimushchestvo chairman. In that case even without 
"attacks" from the Duma, the implementation of the privatization 
program will simply be left hanging. 
  God grant, as they say, that it all turns out to be rumor. I 
am well acquainted with the situation and the relations that 
have taken shape in the Goskomimushchestvo and I am sure that 
following Chubays, his team -- the brain center of the committee 
with which all present privatization ideas are linked -- will 
unfailingly go too. Privatization is still a long way from 
completion and in contrast to Chubays I am, alas, far from 
convinced that "this process is irreversible." Although it is a 
case of the foundation of market relations and all reforms in 
the Russian economy.

  [Text] Aleksandr Shokhin told Interfax Thursday that Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin had asked him to stay in the 
government. 
  With reference to his recent meeting with the prime minister 
he said that they had talked about a specific post, but did not 
say which post had been offered to him. Earlier Shokhin had 
told journalists that if he did not retain the post of vice 
premier he would not consider his work in the government 
expedient. 
  He noted, however, that at first he would "fight" for a 
serious post in the State Duma, say the post of a committee 
chairman. "I would prefer to act in this capacity given the 
complicated situation in the State Duma," he said. 
  Shokhin refused to comment on the presidential decree on 
Cabinet reorganization, saying that he would not like to 
criticize the decree. He said, though, that if he had been 
given an opportunity to take part in drafting this document, 
"some of its provisions would have looked much better". 
  Next week, appointments to the post of vice premier and 
other 
posts are to be announced.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- Russian Vice-Prime 
Minister Aleksandr Shokhin said on Thursday he might remain in 
the government after an upcoming cabinet reshuffle. 
  The statement, which was made in the State Duma, the lower 
house of Russia's new parliament, on Thursday followed Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin's decision to cut the number of 
vice-prime ministers in the government from nine to four. There 
have also been numerous leaks that Shokhin and vice-premier 
Sergey Shakhray, both have been elected deputies of the State 
Duma, will not be offered posts in the new government. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Shokhin disagreed with 
statements that reductions will be made at the expense of 
reform-minded ministers. To exemplify his point, Shokhin cited 
Yeltsin's decision to appoint Anatoliy Chubays who is in charge 
of privatisation in Russia a fifth vice-prime minister. He 
added that none of the ministers of the old government has 
received such an offer yet. 
  Shokhin did not rule out the possibility that the number of 
vice-prime ministers may increase in the future. According to 
him, there are two optimum ways to form the government: first to 
determine the number of vice-prime ministers and then increase 
it or entrust federal ministers with management functions. In 
the latter case Shokhin would call for cutting the number of 
ministries by "establishing such a system under which ministers 
will have more powers in the government, while vice-prime 
ministers could substitute the premier in his absence."

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Shumeyko by </F>
Thomas Urban in Shumeyko's office in Moscow; date not given: 
"The Communists Are Much More Dangerous Than Zhirinovskiy"] 
  [Text] [Urban] You were one of the top candidates of 
Russia's Choice. Why did your bloc receive fewer votes than 
Zhirinovskiy's ultra-rightists? 
  [Shumeyko] We were only barely defeated. This was mainly 
attributable to preparation for the elections. Zhirinovskiy had 
set the goal for himself to win in any case. Russia's Choice 
failed to do so. Our election bloc did not make any promises, 
but instead continued to implement the government program. 
  [Urban] Most people apparently did not agree to such an 
approach. 
  [Shumeyko] It is a well-known fact that people currently 
have to put up with a decreasing living standard. This is an 
unavoidable part of this program. An estimated 30 to 40 million 
people are affected by it. Under socialism, most people got 
used to the fact that everything was settled for them for the 
future. It was simply enough to turn up at one's job to get 
paid. 
  [Urban] What, precisely, is different today? 
  [Shumeyko] The old ideology called Marxism-Leninism was 
defective. But it offered the people an orientation in life. 
Today we have an ideological pluralism that is also guaranteed 
by the Constitution. This means an ideological vacuum. 
However, the recent elections have shown that the notion of a 
powerful, strong state is alive. 
  [Urban] It was, above all, Zhirinovskiy who profited from 
this fact. 
  [Shumeyko] Whenever Zhirinovskiy appeared, he treated his 
audience like 12-year-old children, whereas others expounded 
their position at an academic level. Not everyone saw this. 
  [Urban] Is Zhirinovskiy dangerous? 
  [Shumeyko] His popularity is based solely on the way he 
talks with his voters. I have known him from two angles. As a 
member of the constitutional assembly called by the president he 
was silent, not talkative. When he did speak, it was mostly 
constructive. The communists are much more dangerous. 
  [Urban] Doesn't the failure of Russia's Choice mean a move 
away from the market economy? 
  [Shumeyko] According to Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the new 
Constitution, the government cannot stop the reform process. 
The government will not change its course, which is aimed at 
the market economy, but will continue it in accordance with the 
Constitution and the Federation Treaty. It agreed on a program 
for 1993 to 1995. 
  [Urban] What will the new government look like? 
  [Shumeyko] There will probably be structural changes. The 
apparatus will be streamlined, and the number of ministries 
reduced to 26 or 27; state committees that were independent in 
the past will be integrated into the ministries. 
  [Urban] Will the president continue to pursue his course, 
irrespective of the parliament and its majority of communists 
and nationalists? 
  [Shumeyko] The parliament consists of two chambers. The 
Federation Council consists of approximately 170 members. 
Two-thirds of them are regional administrative chiefs; they are 
the people who carry out the president's decrees and push 
reforms. However, the Duma with its different majorities can, 
under the Constitution, only make decisions in a very limited 
number of cases--as opposed to the former Supreme Soviet, which 
could deal with everything and decide on everything. This does 
not mean, however, that government work has become easier, since 
both chambers also have to get along with each other. 
  [Urban] You are one of the advocates of presidential 
democracy as defined by the new constitution. Boris Yeltsin 
will be head of state for another two years. What will come 
after him? 
  [Shumeyko] There is currently much talk about a presidential 
party. This is not Yeltsin's party, but an association of 
people advocating a strong state. This is the first time in 
Russia's 1,000-year history that there is a president, and 
Yeltsin is the first to hold this office. So the definition of 
the office depends on him. The fact that Zhirinovskiy is 
mentioned as a possible president shows that the office does not 
yet carry the weight and prestige due to it. Everyone must 
acknowledge that only someone who has a constructive attitude in 
every respect should be the head of state. Therefore, the 
development of this office must not be interrupted. Boris 
Yeltsin should be at the helm of the state for another term. 
  [Urban] But he has said that he does not want to and is not 
going to continue in office. 
  [Shumeyko] True. But he is strong enough and in good 
health. There is still a long time to go until 1996. 
  [Urban] How are you going to prevent a nationalist from 
becoming president in two years? 
  [Shumeyko] A president's party must emerge. I see the 
people advocating the notion of a strong and powerful state. 
The Russian nation, in a historic-philosophical sense, has 
always been expansive. Yet Russia has never conquered other 
states, only absorbed them. The Bolsheviks took over this 
empire. The people here and in the West always saw Russia in 
the Soviet Union. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia 
lost some of its territory for the first time in history. 
Russians became a minority in other states. This is a 
psychological shock for the whole nation. Zhirinovskiy's 
campaign was focused on this fact, and a presidential party must 
also focus on it. 
  [Urban] What would be the difference, then, to Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Shumeyko] The democratic grassroots. I hope there will be 
a president's party in two years. Then the person will win who 
has an idea -- the idea of a democratic Russia led by a 
president, but a state in which the people are proud of being 
its citizens. 
  [Urban] Who will be the first to succeed in conveying such 
an idea? 
  [Shumeyko] Perhaps the communists will be strong in this 
field, but the fascists will not. Everyone says that 
Zhirinovskiy's election success spells the rise of neofascism. 
But we must not ignore the fact that elderly people, above all, 
were the ones who voted. There is not a single family in our 
country that did not lose someone in the war. These people, of 
course, did not vote for fascism, but protested against their 
current living conditions. They voted for politicians who made 
promises. 
  [Urban] So will Russia in the future bank on its own way and 
put the West last? 
  [Shumeyko] We must differentiate between policy and the 
economy. Russia will also seek mutually beneficial economic 
cooperation, but it will never neglect its political interests. 
There is currently much talk about the Kaliningrad (Koenigsberg) 
area. The president has now created the option by decree that 
the area become a free economic zone. A small army contingent 
that will continue to be deployed there cannot interfere with 
this plan. But it means that Kaliningrad is Russian, and Russia 
will never leave the area. Russia is a sovereign state and can 
deploy its armed forces wherever it likes.

"Zemstvo Movement Looks for Its Niche and Wants To Replace Local 
Government Organs"] 
  [Text] A press conference was held in Moscow yesterday of 
the Russian Zemstvo [a system of local administrations] Movement 
(RZM) founded, or rather recreated, in November 1993. Having a 
hand in its creation were such organizations as the Russian 
Orthodox Church; the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Towns 
of Russia; the Russian Union of Self-Government; three cultural 
funds headed by Nikita Mikhalkov, Aleksandr Krutov, and 
Vyacheslav Klykov; and the Agrarian Union, provincial commercial 
structures, and so forth. Besides, the revived Zemstvo movement 
counts on assistance from the heads of administrations, 
noteworthy among whom is Nizhniy Novgorod Governor Boris 
Nemtsov, and help from experts such as Aleksandr Tsipko and 
Valeriy Zorkin. Although the movement was not active in the 
recent parliamentary elections, according to an RZM spokesman, 
some 50 percent of State Duma deputies, especially in the 
Democratic Party of Russia faction, share Zemstvo supporters' 
views. 
  The fundamental objectives of the movement are the "revival 
of moral and spiritual foundations of Russian society and 
restoration of this country's traditions of organization of 
power and the state." In the opinion of RZM Chairwoman Yelena 
Panina, the key areas of activity at this stage should be a 
quantitative and qualitative expansion of the movement, and the 
evolvement of a concept for reforming local administration. 
According to Mrs. Panina, the best model for a system of local 
administration that could not only fill the vacuum of power but 
that would also be organic for Russia, would be a combination of 
Zemstvo structures and the organs of government administration. 
The draft text of a law on so-called Zemstvo Reform prepared by 
experts of the movement should be submitted for scrutiny in the 
Duma. In addition, specific programs are being evolved aimed at 
solving ecological and educational problems, the development of 
small and medium-sized businesses. 
  Speaking before journalists, Yelena Panina outlined things 
that are supposed to form the "object of thoughts and work of 
not only Zemstvo supporters, but also of all the other 
nationally thinking people." In her opinion, this is a rallying 
of public forces on the basis of the revival of traditional 
Russian spirituality and healthy patriotic, rather than 
nationalist, ideas. 
  According to Mrs. Panina, RZM initiatives are meeting with 
understanding of Boris Yeltsin, with whom leaders of the 
movement had a two-hour discussion, and with understanding of 
members of the president's staff, with whom fruitful cooperation 
has been established. Zemstvo supporters are hoping to come to 
terms with the prime minister as well. 
  Although RZM proposals on a local government reform are not 
likely to be taken up adequately by the Federal Assembly, the 
movement, which has structures in 72 regions of Russia, would be 
able to influence in no small way the course of elections to 
local bodies of power.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Hold the Front Page!" </F>
rubric: "President Checks Up on `Ostankino'"] 
  [Text] On Wednesday [12 January], a presidential 
commission of 15 persons began a sweeping audit of the financial 
activities of the "Ostankino" television and radio company and 
of all subordinated enterprises. The commission comprises 
representatives of control and auditing administrations under 
the president, the tax police, and the Russian Federation 
Finance Ministry. In all probability, some of the facts that 
have been revealed and already reported by MOSKOVSKIY 
KOMSOMOLETS and that further investigation may prove to be gross 
financial violations, made Yakovlev ask the president to order a 
checkup at the state level. 
  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has learned from competent sources 
that the commission is supposed to pay special attention to 
Lazutkin, former first deputy general director of "Ostankino," 
who currently holds the position of first deputy head of the 
Russian Federation Federal Service for Television and Radio 
Broadcasting. By all appearances, the commission will show 
special interest in the agreement Lazutkin signed between 
"Ostankino," the State Television and Radio Fund headed at the 
time by Kornilov (currently under investigation on charges of 
taking a $5,000 bribe), and the "YuSSYu- Art-Group" entitling 
the Americans to rights to Russian music archives.

"Russia's Interests": "Country's Military Doctrine and 
International Security"] 
  [Text] The results of the December elections to the 
Federal Assembly have generated a debate abroad about possible 
changes to Russia's foreign and military policy. Citing the 
irresponsible, profascist statements made during the election 
campaign, certain observers have been predicting a strengthening 
of Moscow's "imperial aspirations." 
  I have already stated my attitude to such statements. I 
would like to reemphasize that Russia's line in the foreign 
policy and security sphere is determined by the Russian 
Federation president. This situation, which is enshrined in the 
new democratic Constitution, reliably protects that line from 
the influence of national extremism. The policy basically 
remains the same -- both in terms of being geared to the 
development of good-neighborly relations of partnership with the 
outside world and in terms of being open and predictable. 
  Another guarantee of the stability and consistency of the 
country's foreign and military policy is the Russian Federation 
military doctrine approved by the Russian president in early 
November. Together with the foreign policy concept ratified in 
April, it is an integral part of the emergent concept for the 
country's security. 
  The distinctive features of our military doctrine are its 
defensive thrust and the strict account it takes of the 
country's actual requirements as regards ensuring national 
security. In terms of its content it is entirely comparable 
with the doctrinal provisions of most democratic states. I am 
referring above all to the similarities in the assessment of the 
military-political situation and the prospects for its 
development both globally and regionally. A key factor is the 
absence of any potential military enemy for Russia. According 
to the doctrine, the main threat to the country's security is 
posed by local conflicts and the spread of nuclear and other 
weapons of mass destruction. 
  The Russian military doctrine is an obstacle in the way of 
any attempts to abuse military force. While using the full 
panoply of means available to it to safeguard its security, 
Russia will at the same time give priority to peaceful -- above 
all, political and diplomatic -- means. Military force can only 
be used for self-defense purposes, in order to rebuff aggression. 
  The Russian Armed Forces will be shaped to take account of 
the major changes in the world and the country's actual economic 
potential. By the end of this century, after the transition to 
the mixed principle of manpower acquisition, they will be 
substantially smaller, but more mobile and equipped with 
effective weapons systems and military hardware in sufficient 
quantities to ensure the defense of the country and its allies. 
  This provision of the doctrine can be illustrated by the 
Navy. It will fully retain its role as a factor determining 
Russia's might as a great power. Moreover, given the cuts 
envisaged by the Russian-U.S. START II Treaty, the naval 
component of our strategic "triad" will have increased. The 
decommissioning of obsolete ships will be combined with efforts 
to equip the Navy with modern hardware. The ships flying the 
St. Andrew's ensign should embody the most advanced achievements 
of Russian science and technology. 
  The fact that all this is not only necessary but possible 
was something I saw for myself at Severomorsk in Murmansk 
Oblast, where the electoral district, which I represent in the 
State Duma, is located. An immense potential is concentrated 
there -- the flower of Russia's Navy. This was also attested by 
my visit to Russia's naval outposts in the Far East and to the 
ships of the Black Sea Fleet. The Navy is traditionally one of 
the most flexible foreign policy tools at the disposal of the 
Russian state, whose interests naval seamen and diplomats have 
defended and will continue to defend together. I am therefore 
all the more aware of the social needs -- requiring state 
support -- of those who serve the motherland on its ocean and 
maritime borders. 
  Our view of nuclear weapons is becoming more realistic 
compared to that that prevailed in the Soviet period. The aim 
of the Russian Federation's policy is to remove the threat of 
nuclear war and the use of nuclear weapons by deterring a 
potential aggressor. In other words, Russia sees its nuclear 
forces first and foremost as a means of preventing war. This 
view is also conditioned by the fact that Russia does not intend 
to recreate massive Soviet-style general-purpose forces. 
  It would be a mistake to make out that our new approach to 
nuclear weapons increases the risk of nuclear war. The fact 
that we do not intend to be the first to use any weapons, and 
see nuclear weapons as a last resort, is of fundamental 
importance. 
  The military doctrine's provisions take full account of CIS 
collective security interests and are geared to strengthening 
defense cooperation among the CIS states on a multilateral and 
bilateral basis. The prerequisites for this are shared national 
security interests, a standard [odnotipnyy] armed forces 
structure and standardized weapons systems, and an interest in 
maintaining the former Union's defense infrastructure within 
your own territory. 
  The main provisions of Russian military doctrine have been 
brought to the attention of Russian and foreign public opinion. 
The international community has thereby been able to get a 
clearer idea of the aims and content of our policy in the 
security sphere. Our numerous contacts show that the world is 
satisfied with its defensive thrust and the way in which it 
corresponds to the norms of international law. This creates 
favorable prerequisites for strengthening Russia's cooperation 
with other countries in maintaining international peace and 
security. In particular, there is growing potential for 
cooperation among the nuclear powers. I am referring to the 
ending of nuclear weapons tests, given the ultimate goal of a 
comprehensive test ban, and to further reductions in nuclear 
forces to a minimum level and, in the distant historical future, 
the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. 
  Russia is ready to cooperate with all states in preventing 
the spread of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and 
the latest military production technologies. Safeguarding 
[obespecheniye] the unlimited-duration Nonproliferation Treaty 
is on the agenda. The clarification [konkretizatsiya] in the 
doctrine of the cases in which Russia will not use its nuclear 
weapons against parties to that treaty will serve as an added 
incentive for nonnuclear states, which have hitherto remained 
outside the treaty to sign it. 
  The new view on the nature of a possible war, which 
recognizes the minimal likelihood of the unleashing of world 
nuclear and conventional war along with the increased risk of 
local wars, including those on the territory of the former USSR, 
orients our diplomacy toward more active cooperation with other 
states with regard to peacemaking. The CSCE declaration 
condemning aggressive nationalism, which underlies many local 
conflicts -- a declaration adopted on Russia's initiative -- is 
of great significance. 
  In accordance with the doctrine the Russian Federation Armed 
Forces acquire a new function: participation in carrying out 
peacemaking operations. These are implemented by decision of 
the UN Security Council and other collective security organs or 
in accordance with international agreements, primarily within 
the CIS context. It is a matter of Russia's fulfilling not some 
sort of gendarme functions, but a mission fully consonant with 
its status and duties as a permanent member of the UN Security 
Council. The Russian troops taking part in such operations 
strictly respect the sovereignty of the sides involved in the 
conflict and act with their consent and in accordance with a 
clearly defined mandate. 
  In fulfilling peacemaking functions on the territory of the 
former USSR, the Russian Federation is prepared to cooperate 
closely with all interested countries and international 
organizations, primarily the United Nations and the CSCE. We 
are entitled to expect the world community to provide material 
support for this activity. We are raising the question of 
creating an international voluntary fund for these purposes. 
  The military doctrine envisages completing before 1996 the 
withdrawal to Russian territory of the Russian units stationed 
outside Russia. We will seek to ensure that the agreements 
being elaborated with a number of countries regarding this 
properly take into account Russia's security interests and also 
the interests of the Russian-speaking population in these 
countries. 
  At the same time the doctrine realistically proceeds from 
the 
premise that the interests of the security of the Russian 
Federation and other CIS members may necessitate the stationing 
of Russian Federation forces outside its territory. But, of 
course, this will be done only on the basis of appropriate 
international legal documents and with the consent of the states 
on whose territory our Armed Forces will be stationed. 
  In outlining the main directions for the development of 
Russia's cooperation with other countries in the 
military-technical sphere, the doctrine officially sets the 
relevant departments, the Foreign Ministry included, tasks which 
we effectively began to work on from the first months of 1992. 
On the one hand, there is a need to maintain the country's 
export potential in the sphere of conventional arms at the 
proper level, partly so the hard currency proceeds can be used 
for the needs of military production and for purposes of 
conversion. On the other hand, we cannot allow deliveries of 
arms and military equipment to lead to the spread of technology 
making it possible to create weapons of mass destruction and 
delivery systems for them, to the undermining of regional 
stability, or to the breaking of embargoes or other 
international accords to which Russia is a party. 
  The potential for strengthening mutual trust and developing 
cooperation with the NATO member countries, including within the 
framework of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, is 
expanding substantially with the adoption of the military 
doctrine. This is a weighty and, most important, practical 
alternative to the idea of the faster expansion of NATO to bring 
in new members. 
  The fundamental shifts toward greater transparency and trust 
are shown, in particular, by the joint naval exercises which 
Russia has held recently with Norway, Kuwait, and NATO countries 
in the Baltic Sea. Joint exercises by the Russian and NATO 
navies in the Barents Sea are planned. 
  The adoption of the basic principles of the foreign policy 
concept and military doctrine marks an important milestone in 
the development of democratic Russia's political and military 
thought. They graphically reflect the profound changes in the 
life of our state and society. Free from ideological rhetoric 
and claims to superpower status, these documents are called upon 
to help form in the world an image of democratic Russia as a 
peace-loving state with natural national interests. Not 
regarding any state as its enemies, Russia is prepared to see as 
partners all states whose policy is not detrimental to its 
interests and does not contravene the UN Charter. 
  Only thus will we be able to reliable ensure the security of 
the motherland.

  The spaceship safely landed (despite a collision with the 
Mir 
space station reported by the Ostankino radio station) 215 
kilometers west of the city of Karaganda, Kazakhstan. 
  The crew is planned to be brought to Moscow later in the 
day.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Ground Rent Instead of Profits Tax?"] </F>
  [Text] Petr Filippov, head of the presidential 
administration's analytical center for socioeconomic policy, 
supports the idea of fundamental reform of the tax system. 
  The idea was voiced by participants in an economic 
conference 
of scientific and business circles. 
  "I am in favor of switching to taxation of natural resources 
and using ground rent instead of stifling taxes on profits and 
wages," P. Filippov said. However, some other proposals made 
during the conference "create a complex impression," he said. 
In particular, in P. Filippov's opinion, the proposal from one 
of the conference organizers, the economist Sergey Glazyev, for 
a "compulsory freeze on amortization payments" would ruin 
enterprises. 
  The head of the presidential administration's analytical 
center is also worried by the "talk about enforced vertical 
integration of industry." "We had this with ministries and 
departments. If we want to create viable financial and 
industrial complexes, they must develop from the mutual 
interests of the participants and not according to the will of 
state officials," he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Irina Goryacheva of the Russian Federation </F>
Council of Ministers-Government Center for the Economic 
Situation: "Week's Inflation Highest Since Early September"] 
  [Text] According to the figures of the Russian Federation 
Council of Ministers-Governnent Center for the Economic 
Situation, over the past week the overall inflation index was 
106.3 percent, the increase in prices and rates for paid 
services to the population overtook the increase in the cost of 
food and nonfood commodities, and the average cost of a 
selection of the 19 most important types of food was 32,400 
rubles [R] calculated for a month, which is 5.4 percent higher 
than a week ago. 
  Over the period 27 December through 4 January inflation was 
6.3 percent. Such a high level for a week's inflation has not 
been noted since the start of September 1993. Over the past 
week the greatest increase was for tariffs for paid services to 
the population -- nearly 18 percent. Food increased 7.4 percent 
in cost while the smallest increase -- 2.4 percent -- was for 
nonfood goods. 
  Last week differences in inflation rates for individual 
economic regions of Russia was 5 percentage points. The biggest 
inflation index was noted in the Central Chernozem region -- 
108.7 percent. An equal level of inflation (6.8 percent) was 
recorded in the Central and West Siberian regions in which the 
biggest price increase was observed for paid services to the 
population -- 41 and 24 percent respectively. Inflation was 
lowest in the Far East region -- 3.7 percent. 
  Over the past week prices for basic foods increased 7.4 
percent. A higher weekly increase in food prices was last noted 
only in early 1993. Over the past week eggs continued to 
increase in cost more than other foods observed -- by 8.3 
percent. Prices increased 6-7 percent for bread articles and 
dairy products and vegetables and 5 percent for meat products 
and fruit. Vodka increased in price most markedly -- by nearly 
20 percent. At the same time prices for sugar did not change 
over the week while fish products, vegetable oil, groats, and 
pasta became 2 percent more expensive. 
  Over the past week there has been a considerable increase in 
prices for food in unorganized trade -- 10.3 percent (6.7 
percent in organized trade). Meat products increased most of 
all in price on the markets over the week -- by 14 percent -- 
after having increased in price more slowly over the past four 
months than prices for food as a whole. Over the week prices 
for dairy products and vegetables increased 11-12 percent and 
prices for fish products and flour increased 8 percent. In 
unorganized trade, prices for vegetable oil, sugar, groats, and 
pasta remained at virtually last week's level. 
  In the majority of economic regions prices for food goods at 
the markets increased more rapidly than in organized trade. The 
biggest differences were noted in the Central Chernozem and East 
Siberian regions. 
  The average cost of a selection of the 19 most important 
foods as of 4 January was R32,400 in monthly terms and increased 
5.4 percent over the week. The cost of this election at 
organized trade prices was R30,500 (an increase of 3.4 percent 
over the week, R44,200 at unorganized trade prices (11.1 
percent). The relationship between the prices in unorganized 
and organized trade was a factor of 1.4 times. 
  The gulf between the maximum and minimum cost of the 
selection in various cities of Russia increased to 3.9 times in 
early January. 
  The Far East region remains Russia's most expansive region 
(R57,700) and includes the most expensive cities -- Magadan 
(79.9 percent), Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (74.3 percent), and 
Vladivostok (73.1 percent) 
  Among the Russian cities the selection increased most in 
Saratov -- 25 percent. Over the past week wheat bread increased 
150 percent, beef increased 40 percent, milk 30 percent, and 
butter and cheese 20 percent. 
  The cost of the selection of 19 of the most important foods 
in Moscow rose 4.5 percent over the week and as of 4 January was 
R36,200. In St. Petersburg over the past week the selection 
increased 2.7 percent in cost and was equal to R30,500. Moscow 
is 24th on the list of cities observed (a week ago it was 35th) 
while St. Petersburg ranks 67th (58th).

<F P=106> [A. Yevgenyev report under the "Regions" rubric: </F>
"Impoverished Regions Will Not Add to the Country's Wealth"] 
  [Text] That Russia needs a well-thought-out regional 
policy more than ever today is the conclusion drawn by 
specialists of the Institute of Experts of the Russian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs in their report entitled "The 
Regions of Russia in the Transitional Period." 
  For some time now we have been unable to kick the bad habit 
of being wise after the event (remember the bitter sobering up 
that occurred after the recent elections). The analysis put 
forward by Yevgeniy Yasin, Andrey Neshchadin, Andrey Grigoryev, 
and Mikhail Malyutin is an attempt to "seize the moment," to get 
to grips with the key problem of Russian reforms. 
  In the experts' opinion, there are now two objectively 
inevitable processes under way in Russia -- decentralization and 
federalization. The crux of the former is the transfer of 
economic decisionmaking or, to be more precise, the sources of 
economic decisionmaking downward -- from the organs of 
centralized planning and management of the command economy to 
the marketplace. It is our common misfortune that this process, 
which began under the influence of the democratization of the 
USSR, got stuck at the level of the republics and led to its 
disintegration. The process was actually simply incapable of 
penetrating further -- to the lower, market level -- at the 
time. Compared with the USSR, Russia is a more uniform country 
in geopolitical and national terms (83 percent of the population 
are Russians), and its market groundwork has been better 
prepared. That should, as it were, reassure those who see in 
its fate direct analogies with the great Soviet empire. The crux 
of the matter, however, is that even here, in the process of 
decentralization, a hiatus has occurred at regional level in the 
devolution of power. Enterprises are not yet able to operate in 
a new way while the center is no longer in a position to manage 
in the old way. As a result the regional authorities get 
involved in everything under the sun from regulating prices to 
privatization, from subsidizing the disadvantaged to the 
purchase and sale of goods and the organization of inter-oblast 
bartering. This situation will not last forever. The 
development of private trade, commodity and money markets, and a 
labor market will set everything to rights. What we must not do 
is hurry events along or demand the impossible but must let the 
process come to fruition. 
  But the temptation to call to order, to regulate, and to 
take 
the center to task is greater than ever today. The report 
examines two diametrically opposed economic management models -- 
one in Nizhniy Novgorod, the other in Ulyanovsk. The first 
model is actively reformist, with the accent on privatization, 
the development of enterprise, deregulation of prices 
[svobodnoye tsenoobrazovaniye] prices, and a very open region. 
The second model largely sticks to the old-type structures and 
relationships. There they do not much welcome the private 
sector, they regulate prices, set quotas for the allocation of 
prime necessities, and ban the export of subsidized goods from 
the oblast. The upshot is that inhabitants of Ulyanovsk Oblast 
can acquire for their income twice the quantity of staple 
foodstuffs that the average inhabitant of Nizhniy Novgorod can, 
although, from the standpoint of the future, it is the Nizhniy 
Novgorod strategy, which promises to yield the greatest return. 
But it would be a very great mistake to order everyone to march 
in step! The Ulyanovsk authorities' tactics are dictated by the 
totality of the specific conditions that obtain there, 
conditions that are not reproduced countrywide, such as the 
oblast's self-sufficiency in food and the balance between the 
industrial and agrarian sectors. Moreover, in Ulyanovsk, as in 
other regions where they regulate prices, inflation is no lower 
than where prices are free. No one, anyway, will be able to 
keep prices fixed. Of course, there is some injustice in all 
this: The inhabitants of Nizhniy Novgorod are working not just 
for their own future but the future of the whole country; in 
Ulyanovsk they are seeking to squeeze the maximum out of what 
the Lord God has sent them and have created a command system. 
But this is the will of the regions, and it must not not be 
ignored. 
  The other process, which we are experiencing, is 
federalization. That is to say, the formation of a system of 
institutions of power bound up with the transition from a 
unitary union state to a truly federal one. And that is 
impossible without a budgetary system. So long as Moscow 
determines how much tax someone must pay to the center, there 
will always be aggrieved people who think that their neighbors 
are eating them out of house and home. And there will 
consequently be grounds for separatism. A single-channel 
taxation system does not suit us, experts believe, and it leads 
toward confederation. The German option is the most acceptable: 
The center sets a single value-added tax and a single moderate 
rate of tax on profits payable to the federal exchequer while 
the local authorities have the opportunity to increase it to the 
benefit of the regional budget and also to set and collect any 
other taxes for their own exchequer. 
  That is what the theoreticians think, but the 
administrators? 
The Finance Ministry would seem not to be against. But another 
year has now elapsed and there is still nno clarity. Until we 
sort out taxes, there will be no peace in our common home. 
  And yet structural reorganization is the most difficult task 
from the standpoint of the future. The authors of the report 
make an interesting observation. They started by trying to 
define what concepts of reform in general are feasible in Russia 
today. In the experts' opinion, there are three such options. 
The raw-materials option, placing reliance on the extractive 
sectors, whose output we could sell abroad. The conversion 
option, entailing the development of high-tech production and 
the restructuring of the military-industrial complex. And 
finally the third and, unlike the previous ones, self-contained 
option, geared toward the domestic market. Each of them has its 
own advantages and disadvantages. Something else is important: 
Depending on the structure of their economy, all the regions 
gravitate toward a particular concept of reforms. The authors 
of the report have done a simple thing: They have taken the 
results of the April referendum and examined to what extent the 
results depend on the coincidence of the center's reform line 
and the structure of the region. There turns out to be a very 
direct link. Politics is one thing, but it is the economy that 
feeds us. It is the economy that determines our political 
sympathies. 
  The resume will be brief: Russia is too big a country to 
adopt and maintain a single pure strategy of reforms. The 
strategy must be a mixed one, which takes account of the 
interests of Nadym and Kaliningrad. To press down obstinately 
upon a single lever while moving along such a difficult, 
treacherous, and unpredictable path as the one we are trying to 
traverse is an ineffectual activity. And a dangerous one.

"Government Forecasts Growth in Wages, Prices, and Unemployment 
in 1994"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation Economy Ministry has 
prepared a report together with the State Statistics Committee 
"On the State of the Russian Economy in 1993 and the Prospects 
of its Development for 1994." The economic slump continued in 
1993, the report says: GDP [gross domestic product] shrunk 12 
percent compared with 1992, and the budget deficit was 7 percent. 
  Despite the slump in production, the report continues, the 
situation on the consumer market has improved. The supply of 
commodities has increased, and aggregate trade volume was up 
against 1992. Money incomes of the population grew 10 percent, 
while the share of food in household expenditures began to 
decline. 
  The nonstate sector of the economy is beginning to play a 
significant role in the market transformations, the ministry 
says. It employs over 40 percent of the country's working 
population. Municipal property privatization entered its final 
stage. By the end of 1993, the program of "small privatization" 
covered around 70 percent of trade, public catering, and 
consumer service enterprises. The process of switching to a 
single agricultural market has been under way. The formation of 
a two-tier banking system continued. Aside from the Central 
Bank, around 2,000 commercial banks operated in the sector. 
They accounted for 80 percent of the total volume of credits. 
  An important characteristic of the current economic 
situation 
in Russia, the report says, is the growth of the service sector 
as a share of GDP, a trend attributable to a stepped-up activity 
in the service and finance industries. In 1993, they accounted 
for around 42 percent in actual prices, whereas in 1992 their 
share was 33 percent. 
  The report says that the government's main objective in 1994 
will be to continue moderately tight financial and monetary 
policies aimed at reducing the inflation rate and cutting the 
budget deficit. According to the authors of the report, the 
anti-inflation measures will make it possible to reduce the 
inflation index to 5-7 percent per month by year's end, or three 
times lower compared to the fourth quarter of 1993. 
  In 1994 nominal monthly wages will continue to rise and, 
according to the authors' forecasts, may reach 240,000 rubles 
[R], which amounts to a 4.1- to 4.2-fold increase against 1992. 
The ratio of nominal money incomes and consumer prices will be 
85-90 percent. The minimum pay, taking into account the 
subsistence minimum, will reach R50,000 plus by year's end. 
  It is expected, the report notes, that the volume of retail 
sales will stabilize in 1994 and the share of light industry 
production will increase. So will the share of paid services in 
the structure of consumer expenditures: up to 14-15 percent 
against 7.5 percent in 1993. 
  The authors see growing unemployment as a characteristic 
feature of 1994 caused by the slump in production and the 
restructuring of enterprises: the number of unemployed will 
rise to 7 million against 4 million in 1993, but only around 3 
million people will be officially registered as such. By the 
end of 1994 unemployment is expected to rise to 5-6 percent. 
  The report predicts that the growth in retail and wholesale 
prices will slow steadily in 1994. Wholesale prices are 
expected to rise 3.6-fold by December 1994 compared with 
December 1992. The ruble's slide is also expected to slow down 
between twofold and threefold.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" from Economics Ministry forecast: "Industry-94. </F>
Possible Development Scenario" -- from PROMYSHLENNAYA GAZETA 
section] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation Economics Ministry has 
prepared a forecast of socioeconomic development in the Russian 
Federation in 1994. We offer readers excerpts from the section 
on the main industrial sectors. 
  The crucial factor in industrial development in 1994 will be 
not so much the significant (60 percent) slowdown in the decline 
as the character of the specific tasks and problems occurring in 
the sectors in whose solution the state must be actively 
involved. 
  The main problems material production will encounter in 1994 
can be split into three groups. The first is the group of 
general economic and financial problems that objectively exist 
and adversely affect practically all aspects of the economy. 
The second group of problems is associated with sector and 
product supply and demand discrepancies. The third group of 
problems is the problems of specific enterprises, coupled with 
regional peculiarities. 
  The first group certainly includes problems of nonpayments 
and lack of funds for development. In the Economics Ministry's 
opinion, the main ways of solving these problems might include 
paying off the state's debt and helping to pay off the CIS's 
debt. As of October 1993 this sum was of the order of 25 percent 
of the economy's debts. In view of the fact that it is 
estimated that the paying off of this part of the debt could 
have a threefold multiplication effect given the particular 
mechanism currently being prepared at the Economics Ministry, 
the problem of nonpayments could be resolved in principle. 
  The only way to solve the problems in the second and third 
groups is on the basis and within the framework of the 
implementation of a selective structural policy by finally 
putting into operation a mechanism for selecting enterprises 
either for support or for reorganization on the basis of the 
bankruptcy procedure. 
  Hitherto limited support funds have been allocated, often 
without any assessment of production efficiency, without their 
being combined with a financial clean-up and organizational and 
technological renewal of the production potential. Selective 
support for individual production facilities and projects must 
be implemented on the basis of a thorough analysis of the 
support recipients and in accordance with adopted federal 
programs. 
  In view of the limited financial resources, it is necessary 
to establish the principle of killing several birds with one 
stone. In other words, the task is to ensure that the selective 
identification of support recipients makes it possible to tackle 
problems that lie within the sphere of interests of several 
sectors or regions. 
  In 1994 there must be an active policy of reorganizing 
nonviable enterprises and inefficient production facilities, 
which are a major drain on the budget and are holding up 
structural transformations in the economy. A tougher credit and 
finance policy without appropriate changes in the institutional 
sphere, above all the absence of the practice of bankruptcies, 
will constantly exacerbate the problem of nonpayments, which 
will ultimately affect the level of industrial production. 
  More and more enterprises can be expected to adapt to the 
prevailing conditions in 1994, with the majority of enterprises 
being able to ensure the volume of sales that is required for 
their normal operation. But if uncompetitive enterprises do not 
cease operations, they will have to be maintained by the budget 
at the cost of an increased tax burden. Should this happen, 
there will be no movement of capital from inefficient to 
efficient producers, whose development will be held up. 
<H5>  The Fuel and Energy Complex </H5>
  Production and extraction of fuel resources in 1994 is 
forecast to be 6 percent below the 1993 level. 
  Oil and gas condensate extraction in 1994 is estimated at 
327 
million tonnes, as opposed to 357 million tonnes in 1993 (taking 
extraction by joint ventures into account). But the rate of 
decline in oil extraction will total 8 percent in 1994, as 
opposed to 10.5 percent in 1993 and 14 percent in 1992. 
  It is only possible to prevent a decline in oil extraction 
and then stabilize it if development of new fields with total 
reserves of 6-8 billion tonnes is expedited. 
  In 1993 the Russian Federation Government exempted oil 
industry enterprises from paying import and export duties, and 
also granted concessions in the shape of an exemption from the 
mandatory sale of their foreign exchange earnings from oil 
exports so as to provide an incentive for work to develop new 
fields and bring dormant wells on stream. Foreign firms have 
been involved in repairing wells. The concessions have been 
worth around R1.8 trillion to oil drilling enterprises. The 
rate of decline in oil extraction has slowed as a result. 
  It will be necessary to preserve existing measures of state 
support in 1994 in order to develop this trend in the oil 
extracting industry. It is also planned to leave up to 60 
percent of the oil lifted from new wells in the hands of the 
sector so as to ensure that the funds raised from its sale are 
channeled into modernization, new construction work, and the 
development of new fields. 
  Supplies of crude oil to refineries in 1994 are forecast at 
225-226 million tonnes (taking joint-venture and 
customer-supplied crude into account) -- in other words, at 
close to the 1993 level. Production of light oil products will 
increase somewhat on last year's level, reaching 32.2 million 
tonnes for gasoline, 58.1 million tonnes for diesel, and 12.5 
million tonnes for jet engine fuel. 
  The problem in developing the sector is the low utilization 
of Russia's refinery capacity for the primary processing of oil 
-- refineries (not counting enterprises in Groznyy) were 
operating at 72 percent of capacity in 1993. Yet certain 
enterprises are operating at a critical level of utilization. 
  With a view to enhancing efficiency in the refining of crude 
oil, a program has been drawn up to fundamentally modernize and 
upgrade Russia's oil refineries. During phase one of this 
program it is planned to increase the level of refining [glubina 
pererabotki] from 62 to 75 percent and to considerably improve 
the quality of petroleum products. 
  The gas industry, which has a reliable raw-material base for 
further development, will in the very near future be the only 
sector in the Russian Federation with the real potential to 
increase production of fuel and energy resources. Gas 
extraction in 1994 is expected to be 620 billion cubic meters. 
  But in recent years nonpayment by customers for gas used has 
resulted in a virtual halt in the construction and commissioning 
of new capacity in the sector owing to a lack of funds. 
  As of 1 October 1993 nonpayments for gas were running at 
R1,345 billion. Provided that the debts owed by the state and 
the CIS countries are cleared and that subsequent transactions 
with most customers are effected on this basis, the gas industry 
is capable of resolving the main issues of its development. 
  The government has made a decision to build a system of main 
gas pipelines from the gas fields of the Yamal Peninsula across 
Belarus and Poland to Europe. The commissioning of this sytem of 
gas pipelines will make it possible to sell Europe additional 
amounts of Russian gas (up to 65 billion cubic meters by the 
year 2010), to provide an alternative to the current monopoly 
corridor through Ukraine, and to guarantee that Russia's 
obligations to supply gas for export are complied with. 
  Coal extraction in 1994 is forecast at approximately 250 
million tonnes, as against 300 million tonnes in 1993. 
  It is also expected that consumer demand will fall owing to 
the increased cost of the coal itself and higher transportation 
costs. Any further increase in prices could substantially 
reduce effective demand. Consequently, a considerable 
proportion of the actual requirement for coal -- as a result of 
the severe climatic conditions over most Russian territory -- 
might not be covered by effective demand. 
  The state of our coal mines is constantly deteriorating, and 
labor-intensive and dangerous mining is steadily on the 
increase. Our of 270 pits 60 percent have been mined for more 
than 20 years and have not been modernized during that period. 
  In order to solve the main problems facing the coal industry 
in 1994 it will be necessary to change the procedure for 
allocating subsidies, with a view to steering the bulk of the 
subsidies toward coal consumers -- above all, rail transport. 
  In 1994 it will also be necessary to start solving the very 
complex problem of closing down pits and open cuts, which have 
no future. A list of 42 no longer viable pits and open cuts 
with a total capacity of 11.2 million tonnes of coal a year and 
a workforce of more than 48,000 industrial production personnel 
has now been drawn up. 
  Pit closures will require considerable expenditure on 
social, 
technical, and technological measures. 
  Electricity generation in 1994 is forecast at 910 billion 
kilowatt-hours, as against 945 billion kilowatt-hours in 1993. 
The power supply situation will remain difficult in a number of 
parts of Russia. 
  As in all fuel and energy complex sectors, the main problem 
in power generation is the inability of consumers to pay their 
debts. 
  Since 1992 there has been state regulation in the sector of 
electricity and thermal energy, which has made it possible in 
the context of the gradual deregulation of prices for fuel 
resources and free prices for other raw materials to set rates 
for electric and thermal energy through regional power 
commissions, taking account of the self-financing of power 
generating enterprises and not allowing unjustifiable costs to 
be included in the prime cost. 
  It is planned in 1994 to maintain state regulation of prices 
for electricity and thermal energy at two levels -- the federal 
and regional levels -- through the relevant power commissions. 
  Despite the shortage of investment funds, it is planned to 
commission around 700,000 kilowatts of new power generating 
capacity in 1994 at the Gusinoozersk and Kharanorskaya State 
Regional Electric Power Stations [GRES] and at other 
installations in the Far East and Siberia. 
  R83.5 billion will be allocated from the federal budget as a 
priority in order to improve the safety of existing nuclear 
electric power stations [AES]. And construction of a number of 
research testbeds and installations will have to be postponed 
owing to a shortage of funds. The commissioning of Power Unit 
No. 3 at the Kalinin AES and Power Unit No. 5 at the Kursk AES 
-- each with a 1-megawatt capacity -- will also have to be 
postponed to future years, as will commissioning of the first 
units at the Bureya, Boguchanskaya, and Irganayskaya 
Hydroelectric Power Stations. 
  Thus, a problem common to all fuel and energy complex 
sectors 
is nonpayment, and its solution will determine the prospects for 
the development and self-financing of the complex in 1994. The 
budget has suffered a shortfall of around R0.6 trillion due to 
nonpayments alone. And more than 90 percent of the consumers of 
fuel and energy resources are now in debt. Given the specifics 
of the functioning of the fuel and energy complex -- the 
continuous nature of the production and consumption of fuel and 
energy resoures, and the onset of the winter heating period, 
during which the possibility of enforcing restrictions on 
customers' access to energy resources declines substantially -- 
the problem of the failure to pay fuel and energy complex 
enterprises for the energy resources they supply cannot be fully 
resolved. 
  At a time of limited budget appropriations the main sources 
for investment in 1994 will be enterprises' own funds and funds 
specifically geared to financial support for fuel and energy 
complex sectors. Appropriations from the federal budget in the 
coming year will be able to provide only 3-5 percent of the 
total volume of investments compared with 14 percent in 1993. 
<H5>  Metallurgy </H5>
  In 1994, production of finished ferrous rolled metal will 
decrease by 1 million tonnes compared with 1993 and will total 
42 million tonnes; the figures for the production of steel pipes 
will be 0.2 million tonnes and 5.8 million tonnes, respectively. 
Production will be 63 and 48 percent of total capacity, 
respectively. As the economy stabilizes, the demand for metal 
products will increase, which will require a larger volume of 
production. 
  For a long time the fixed capital replacement rate in 
metallurgy has been 0.9-1.2 percent, which is three to four 
times less than the proper technical and economic level. What 
this means is that more than 60 percent of steel and 50 percent 
of rolled metal is now being produced on obsolete equipment. 
The national economy loses $3.5-4 billion annually as a result 
of the technical backwardness of Russian ferrous metallurgy and 
the consequent increased production costs. 
  As well as demand constraints on ferrous metallurgy 
products, 
there is the inhibiting factor of problems when it comes to 
supplying enterprises with refractories, which are the main 
construction materials for lining heating units, not only in 
metallurgy, but also in machine building, the construction 
materials and chemical industries, and defense and other sectors 
of industry. The production of refractories is being cut by 7 
percent annually due to the depletion of existing deposits of 
magnesite and the delays in the commissioning of new mines. As 
a result the national economy's magnesite needs will be catered 
for in 1994 by import purchases. Supplies of imported powder 
will diminish as the production capacities at the Savinskoye 
deposit come on stream (beginning in 1995). 
  The production of the basic types of nonferrous metallurgy 
products is significantly affected by the foreign economic 
situation and also by the provision of raw materials, which is 
governed by the very slow development of the Russian mining 
base. Smelting of alumina is expected to remain steady, as in 
1992 and 1993. 
  High production costs have meant that wholesale prices of 
such highly important types of nonferrous metals as lead, tin, 
aluminum, and nickel have already reached or exceeded world 
levels. If this trend continues and the ruble is stable against 
the U.S. dollar it could result in a loss of competitiveness and 
a reduction in exports and effective demand for these metals 
inside the country. 
  Given the demand constraints on certain types of nonferrous 
metals (titanium, magnesium, refined copper, zinc, and so on), a 
number of enterprises producing them are using free capacities 
and manpower to process customer-supplied raw materials from 
countries in nearby and faraway foreign parts. 
  Measures are envisaged for 1994 to give state support to a 
number of enterprises in the form of the allocation of quotas 
for the supply of nonferrous metals for export and concessionary 
export and import duties, which will make it possible to import 
the requisite raw materials and supplies for industrial 
engineering needs, as well as equipment to continue the 
reconstruction and retooling of the production potential. 
  In order to maker fuller use of the metallurgical complex 
production facilities established on the territory of the former 
Union it is advisable to remove export duties from supplies to 
CIS countries of products produced under intrasector 
production-sharing arrangements, which will ensure the 
production of finished products on a mutually advantageous basis. 
  Since the critical state of raw material provision for the 
sector's enterprises due to the severe underdevelopment of the 
Russian mining base because of underinvestment remains the main 
problem facing the development of nonferrous metallurgy, it is 
necessary to approve the "Nonferrous Metallurgy Raw Material 
Base Development" program. The main sources of finance for the 
national program to retool and reconstruct the enterprises and 
also to develop the raw material base are enterprises' own funds 
(depreciation, profits), as well as the nonbudget-financed 
investment fund, which constitute 80.5 percent of the total 
value of essential investment resources. Around 11.5 percent of 
the money will come from export and import business concessions 
and foreign investments and only 8 percent is scheduled to come 
from centralized credits. 
<H5>  The Chemical, Petrochemical, and Microbiological Industry </H5>
  In 1994, according to the projected estimate, output of 
chemical, petrochemical, and microbiological output will fall by 
11 percent against the 1993 level. 
  The production of artificial fertilizers is by far the most 
responsive to demand constraints. The country has the capacity 
to produce roughly 20 million tonnes of artificial fertilizer. 
This is roughly the amount required according to biological 
norms for applying fertilizer to the soil. However, given the 
imbalances in the correlation between prices for agricultural 
produce and industrial items for the agricultural sector, even 
with state financial support for the agricultural sector the 
demand for artificial fertilizers, which developed in 1993 meant 
that between 8.3 and 8.5 million tonnes was produced. 
  Demand constraints for 1994 could intensify, and production 
of artificial fertilizers could drop to 6.3 million tonnes. At 
the same time, opportunities for exporting artificial 
fertilizers will be greatly restricted as their price is already 
creeping ahead of world prices. 
  The main reason for the high price of artificial fertilizers 
is the extremely low level at which production capacities are 
utilized (37 percent). 
  The way out of the existing situation must lie in the 
planned 
withdrawal of worn-out equipment and obsolete technology, a cut 
in the production of outdated products, and an increase in the 
output of more progressive types of fertilizers. 
  Previously highly specialized enterprises producing 
artificial fertilizers have started up production of products in 
constant demand on the market alongside the basic production 
commodity: polymer plumbing equipment, construction materials 
made from scrap, bricks, tiles, sports clothes, polymer items. 
In this way, the financial stability of enterprises is 
attained, new jobs are created, and problems in the social 
sector are resolved. 
  In the synthetic resins and plastics industry, proceeding 
from the projected demand, production of polystyrene, PVC, and 
chemical fibers and filaments will drop between 5 and 7 percent, 
and output of polyethylene and polypropylene, taking due account 
of the assimilation of new capacities, is set to stabilize at 
the 1993 level. 
  It should be noted that with the attainment of stability in 
the Russian economy the domestic market's capacity for chemical 
products will rise once again. Therefore, considering the huge 
inertia of fundamental major projects, it is essential, despite 
extremely limited finances, to implement measures for the 
selective state support of certain of the most important 
enterprises in the mining and chemical industry. 
  In 1994 the total output of medical supplies is forecast to 
be at the estimated 1993 level. This presupposes state 
financial support for producer-enterprises and consumers of 
medicines. This could be implemented by means of stopping 
subsidizing imports of medical supplies and channeling the 
released funds, worth R70 billion in 1994, into maintaining 
health services and granting preferential medical help to the 
population (accounting for up to 90 percent of the funds), and 
into developing the national pharmaceutical industry (around 10 
percent). 
  Moreover, it would be expedient to halve export and import 
duties incurred by enterprises in the medical supplies industry 
on exported products and purchased raw materials, 
semimanufactured goods, substances, materials, and equipment. 
  This would make it possible to stabilize the financial 
situation of enterprises in the sector and improve their 
provision with the material resources essential for the 
manufacture of drugs and items for medical purposes. 
<H5>  Machine Building </H5>
  The situation in machine building in 1994 will substantially 
depend on investment activity and the possible reduction 
(elimination) of demand constraints on certain types of machines 
and equipment -- primarily output for consumers such as 
agriculture, construction, freight and passenger transport, and 
the population (passenger cars). On the whole, the decline in 
output volumes at machine building complex enterprises is 
expected to be of the order of 5-7 percent as opposed to 11-12 
percent in 1993. 
  Given the forecast demand, production of the most important 
types of machines and equipment supplied to vitally important 
sectors of industry and the national economy -- equipment for 
the fuel and energy complex, diesel engines and diesel 
generators, AC electric motors, basic types of rolling stock for 
rail transport, and other types of equipment -- is planned to be 
at or slightly below the 1993 level. 
  In the machine tool and tool making industry the strained 
situation with the sale of metalworking equipment and tools -- 
primarily of the high-tech variety -- will persist, as it did in 
1993. 
  With a view to adapting machine tool making enterprises to 
market conditions, retaining their collectives, and making best 
use of their production potential, work is actively under way to 
convert them to the production of multipurpose equipment with 
manual control, as well as bench metal-cutting and wood 
processing machine tools that are in demand from small and 
commercial enterprises and from the population. Moreover, 
enterprises in this sector are assimilating production of 
products that are new to the machine tool and tool making 
industry. This is allowing them to retain their collectives and 
survive in market economy conditions. But the sector of the 
machine-tool and tool-making industry producing high-tech 
machinery and equipment may lose its scientific, production, and 
personnel potential without state investment support. 
  Demand constraints are having a particularly negative impact 
on the performance of enterprises in the subsector of tractor 
and agricultural machine building. As a result, production of 
marketable output in 1994 will fall 12 percent in comparison 
with 1993. Yet rural commodity producers are not refusing to 
take this equipment because they do not need it but because they 
lack the funds to pay for it, in part because of their 
nonreceipt of funds for agricultural output consigned to the 
state. 
  In the automotive industry a complex situation is developing 
in terms of passenger car sales. The rise in prices and 
corresponding shrinkage of demand is not only the result of cost 
inflation in the industrial sectors that supply their products 
to car plants. In the automotive industry costs for which the 
vehicle builders themselves are responsible are extremely high. 
  But, taking account of the acuteness of the situation and 
the 
need to retain an automotive industry, which determines the 
development of many related sectors, and considering that excise 
duties are intended to apply mainly to high-profit output, 
levying this duty on enterprises that produce passenger cars 
should be abandoned from 1994. 
<H5>  The Defense Complex </H5>
  A characteristic feature of the upcoming period of 
development is the implementation of targeted substantial 
structural transformations in sectors of the defense industry. 
  It is envisioned that by the beginning of 1995 the formation 
of a nucleus of specialized state enterprises to meet state 
needs in the defense and security field will be complete and a 
considerable proportion, primarily of enterprises undergoing 
conversion, will have made the transition to the conditions of a 
self-regulating open economy. It is estimated that by the end 
of 1994 state enterprises could account for a total of around 20 
percent of the enterprises in defense sectors of industry. 
  In terms of the complex as a whole, the volume of marketable 
output in 1994 is predicted to be between 94 and 95 percent of 
the 1993 level, and civilian output's share of total defense 
complex output will increase by 3 percentage points. 
  The competitive mechanisms for state support for priority 
areas of conversion, which have been elaborated and are being 
implemented, are aimed at getting enterprises to choose for 
themselves the most effective ways to respecialize their 
production, to study demand, and to build economic links, 
including foreign economic links. 
<H5>  The Consumer Sector </H5>
  The development trends, which have currently developed in 
the 
national economy and the measures being taken by the Russian 
Federation Government to stabilize it, ensure the further 
consolidation in 1994 of the structural shifts toward the 
preferential development of the consumer sector. Consumer goods 
production's share of total industrial output will rise to 23.8 
percent in 1994 as against 23 percent in 1993. 
  In the manufacture of nonfood consumer goods there will be 
increasing signs in 1994 of the satisfaction of effective 
consumer demand for a number of the most important types of 
durables. 
  At the same time, given the growth of effective consumer 
demand and as a result of the stabilization of the population's 
real incomes combined with a decline in inflation rates, 
production of some cultural, everyday, and economic goods 
(particularly socially significant goods) can be expected to 
stay at the current year's level in 1994. 
  An increase in output for products produced in insufficient 
quantities is expected. These include food processors, 
microwave ovens, electric mincers, electric juicers of various 
capacities, food mixers, and others. An increase in production 
of compact monochrome television sets (there is a demand for 
affordable ones) is expected to result in a 4-percent increase 
in television output. 
  It is predicted that there will be an expansion of the range 
of commodities produced for farms, yards, and market gardens, 
including the production of a wide list of manual and power 
tools offering increased efficiency and intensified work. 
  Should it not prove possible to maintain effective consumer 
demand in 1994, only refrigerators and freezers can be expected 
to increase against the expected 1993 level. At the same time 
there could be a decline in production of washing machines and 
television sets. Strong competition from higher quality imports 
will most likely lead to a decline of around 20 percent in tape 
player and radio equipment production in comparison with 1993. 
  The prediction sees a 7-percent decline in light industry 
output in 1994 as against 21 percent in 1993. The decline in 
cotton, woolen, and linen fabric and footwear production will 
continue. Only silk fabrics, knitwear, and hosiery can expect to 
match the 1993 production level in 1994. 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  The problem for 1994 is to convert the general decline in 
production into a structural process initiating progressive 
structural changes. In 1994 Russian industry will face 
increasing competition from foreign products on both the 
domestic and the foreign market. By switching to prices at 
world levels while labor productivity is lower, the products of 
a considerable number of enterprises could prove uncompetitive 
on the domestic market, which would require the adoption of a 
number of protectionist measures with respect to the output of 
individual raw material sectors (ferrous metallurgy, the 
chemical and petrochemical industry, light industry) and the 
global task of raising output quality -- particularly in 
processing sectors. 
  A preliminary analysis of the problems and the cited 
calculations for performance parameters in physical production 
give grounds for considering that the increasing trend among 
producers to aim to meet effective demand will make it possible 
in 1994: 

  -  to ensure that most enterprises, on the basis of increased 
accuracy in identifying the scale of production, have the 
minimum output sales level necessary to function viably; 
  -  to stop a whole number of enterprises operating on their 
previous institutional and technological basis and to start 
redirecting capital from inefficient to efficient production 
processes; 
  -  to ensure the development of new economic links -- internal 
and 
external alike. 
  The pursuit of a consistent structural policy will require 
selective support for individual production facilities and 
projects and can be implemented only on the basis of in-depth 
analysis of recipients of the support in accordance with federal 
programs which are adopted (after prior expert examination). 
  The main "players" in structural restructuring in 1994 will 
be enterprises themselves. In the process many enterprises' 
structural policy could change and become more active with a 
view to securing the conditions for their own development, 
increasing competitiveness, and achieving economic growth. 
  At the same time the calculations show that in the sphere of 
physical production the skewed nature of the structure of 
production in our country, the temporary structural imbalances 
between supply and demand for a number of commodities, and the 
ensuing social problems necessitate the adoption of state 
decisions on: 

  -  settling payment arrangements with CIS countries, 
particularly for energy resources; 
  -  renewing the mineral and raw material base; 
  -  overcoming the negative impact of transportation costs on the 
supply and demand equation; 
  -  supporting industrial exports and protecting producers in our 
country in the context of an "open" economy and rising domestic 
prices (this applies particularly to light industry); 
  -  supporting effective demand in the transportation and 
construction sectors and among the population.

who will this summer become the country's ambassador to the 
United Nations said NATO programme "Partnership for Peace" was 
very favourable to Estonia as there were no alternatives. 
  "If the programme will be developed in a way that Estonia 
has 
enough time to join in and this way develop its own political 
and national defence structures, practical cooperation with NATO 
and bringing Estonia's national defence in line with NATO 
standards will become possible in near future," Velliste said.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 13, BNS -- A governmental working 
group set up to prepare blueprints for Estonia's joining the 
European Union presented at today's Cabinet meeting a four-page 
program of action, Ivar Raig, the chairman of the group, told 
BNS. 
  The first part of the two-part program includes security, 
socioeconomic and legal issues that need to be coordinated; the 
second part deals with the methods and the mechanism of 
unification, Raig said. 
  "Estonia can realistically expect to join the European Union 
before the other former socialist countries," Raig claimed. The 
country's main goal is not to lag behind Ukraine, Slovenia and 
the Czech Republic that already have asked to be admitted to the 
union, he added. 
  The working group consists of a score of politicians and 
economics experts. Last week it appointed Priit Kolbre, the head 
of the Foreign Ministry's foreign economic policy department, as 
its secretary, Raig told BNS.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 12, BNS -- U.S. President Bill Clinton 
and Russian President Boris Yeltsin at their summit meeting in 
Moscow are going to discuss two issues that are of particular 
interest to Estonia, said Raul Malk, aide to the Estonian 
foreign minister. 
  Estonia, in particular, is interested what conclusion 
Yeltsin 
and Clinton will reach on the issue of the withdrawal of Russian 
troops from Estonia. 
  As a more general issue, it is important for Estonia what 
position the United States takes with respect to Russia's 
foreign policy. 
  Malk reminded how several countries neighboring Russia had 
painfully reacted when Russia announced the concept of so-called 
near abroad in its foreign policy. He said it was now extremely 
important whether or not the U.S. president was going to raise 
the issue at all and if the president was also to voice his 
position on the issue. 
  If Russia's foreign political course is aimed toward taking 
part in strengthening the European security and communicating 
with its neighbors according to democratic principles, the 
Moscow summit may give a new impact to the implementation of 
NATO's "Partnership for Peace" plan, Malk said. 
  "But if Russia takes the attitude that she has quite 
different rights and that she has the right to prescribe certain 
actions to others -- in their relations with NATO, for instance 
-- then things are naturally quite different," Malk said.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 13, BNS -- After the Estonian 
legislators ruled Wednesday [12 January] that phone-tapping and 
letter checks are unconstitutional, all concrete cases when 
these measures were taken must be brought to light, Deputy 
Speaker of the parliament Edgar Savisaar told BNS at a press 
conference today. 
  Savisaar said that Asso Kommer, the former chief of the 
Laanemaa Voluntary Infantry Company who is kept in detention, 
also has the right to turn to the court, since the State Court 
authorized the Defense Police to tap his phone during the 
so-called Pullapaa crisis last summer. 
  The State Court's Constitutionality Board ruled Wednesday to 
declare null and void the government decrees and the articles of 
the law on amending the police law, which regulated the 
procedure of applying special surveillance methods including 
phone tapping and letter checks. 
  Centrist MP Andra Veidemann, a member of a commission 
looking 
into the activity of the Defense Police, told BNS at the press 
conference that "the commission was familiarized with the 
mechanism of phone-tapping and given information on the number 
of times special surveillance methods were applied over the last 
six months." 
  Veidemann stated that the commission was not given the 
concrete materials on which the Defense Police based its 
applications to the State Court. 
  She also said that the parliamentary Legality Commission is 
drafting a surveillance law under which all Estonian citizens 
have the right to inquire once a year of the Defense Police and 
the Criminal Police whether their phones have been tapped and 
why. The draft law gives the police the right not to reply to 
such inquiries, she said.

  [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- Vladimir Shumeyko who was 
elected the speaker of the Federation Council, the upper chamber 
of the Russian parliament, denied the possibility that he may 
with time become an arch rival of President Boris Yeltsin like 
it happened with former Parliament Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov. 
  "It is hardly possible that our relations will be difficult. 
Boris Yeltsin and I share the same point of view", he said 
adding that they both stand for the strengthening of the 
presidency in Russia. 
  Khasbulatov was a staunch supporter of Yeltsin before 1991 
Soviet coup, but turned rival when Yeltsin began his market 
reforms in the country. 
  Shumeyko said his main task in the Federation Council will 
be 
to rule out "hidden intrigues, shady deals and agreements 
between factions" of the upper chamber. 
  He added that the Council of the Federation may bypass the 
State Duma, which is the main legislative chamber, in case the 
latter works "unconstructively". 
  "It is possible, in cooperation with those deputies of the 
State Duma who really want to do something, to draft lawbills in 
joint commissions and committees and adopt them right here (in 
the federation council)", Shumeyko explained, but added that 
this may be done only in "extreme situations" and in case of a 
"tough necessity". 
  Shumeyko said his election to the post of the speaker was 
the 
"triumph of commonsense". He succeeded to win the post only in 
three attempts and encountered a tough competition from his 
conservative rival Petr Romanov. 
  Shumeyko will most evidently lose his job of the first 
deputy 
prime minister and, according to a draft resolution of the 
chamber, will only be paid the same salary by the government for 
two years.

<F P=106> [Valeriy Vyzhutovich report: "Vladimir Shumeyko Elected </F>
Chairman of the Federation Council. His Victory Was Finally 
Ensured by Two Votes, But What Votes They Were!"] 
  [Text] In the latest round of voting held 13 January 
Vladimir Shumeyko polled 98 votes and was thus finally elected 
chairman of the Federation Council. Petr Romanov got 52 votes, 
Kirsan Ilyumzhinov seven, and Eduard Rossel six. 
  Federation Council deputies were candid and forthright about 
the reasons for Vladimir Shumeyko's surprise failure to win in 
the second round of voting, in which he dropped four votes, when 
they spoke about it the next day, 13 January. They recalled the 
wire that North Ossetia leader Akhsarbek Galazov, absent from 
the session, had sent in Shumeyko's support but which he 
addressed not to the Federation Council but to President Yeltsin 
and to the actual contender for this prestigious post. In the 
opinion of Viktor Stepanov, chairman of the Karelia Supreme 
Soviet, Shumeyko made a tactical mistake: "He should have 
refused that vote, but he said nothing." Aman Tuleyev, former 
chairman of the Kemerovo Oblast Soviet, was even more 
forthright: "It was a shoddy affair. People in the president's 
team do not balk at pressuring deputies whenever they get the 
opportunity." 
  Meanwhile, the attempts to tilt the balance of voting in 
favor of the president's protege continued on the morning of 13 
January. According to confidential information, Eduard Rossel 
received an offer from the prime minister's messengers of the 
post of first deputy speaker if he persuaded his supporters to 
vote for Vladimir Shumeyko. The offer was rejected. A little 
earlier, at 0830, Viktor Chernomyrdin called the heads of 
administration to see him and, probably in exchange for a pledge 
of additional credits, investments, tax concessions, and so 
forth, obtained their "understanding" and "surety" by clearly 
indicating which of the candidates they should vote for. 
Finally that morning, before the latest nominations began, 
First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets went to the building on 
Bolshaya Dmitrovskaya Ulitsa where he "consulted" with powerful 
representatives of the industrial directors' lobby. 
  Such very close attention paid by the top men in the 
government to the course of the campaign for the speakership of 
the upper chamber was due not only to a desire to ensure that 
their man got the job (although that was the prime reason) but 
also to the sudden appearance on the political horizon of the 
figure of Petr Romanov, general director of the "Yenisey" 
Petrochemical Combine, who publicly confirmed his adherence to 
Sterligov's Russian National Assembly. 
  Be that as it may, the president and head of the government 
now have the man they wanted as chairman of the Federation 
Council. And the senators dependent on the executive have gotten 
the man that the president and the prime minister wanted.

"Shumeyko Comes to the Surface in Federation Council Under

  [Text] The 98 votes garnered by Shumeyko reflect with 
mathematical precision nothing else but the official status of 
the senators: 65 heads of administrations of Federation 
components, 11 members of the president's staff, and 15 members 
of the government staff, as well as 15 lower-level regional 
leaders. Only two persons who voted for Shumeyko do not belong 
in this apparat-administrative team. 
  In the meantime, commenting on the results of voting in a 
conversation with your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, Yegor 
Stroyev, head of the Orel Oblast administration and member of 
the Federation Council, remarked that "the senators have made a 
"Solomonic decision." They offered no cause for a standoff 
between the Federation Council and the president. But today, to 
make the Federation Council efficient, Shumeyko should propose 
members of the opposition as his deputies. He, in fact, will 
have to solve the dilemma: disobedient deputies versus an 
obedient house or vice versa."

  [Text] Moscow, 14 January -- Two deputy chairmen of the 
upper chamber of parliament were elected today at a session of 
the Federation Council of the Russian Federal Assembly. They 
were Ramazan Abdulatipov, first deputy minister for 
nationalities affairs and regional policy, and Valeryan 
Viktorov, chairman of the Chuvash republic Council of Ministers. 
  A third deputy speaker was not elected because neither of 
the 
two nominees for this post -- Petr Romanov, general director of 
the "Yenisey" association, and Aleksandr Kovalev, head of the 
administration of Voronezh Oblast -- succeeded in acquiring the 
required majority of votes. As proposed by Federation Council 
Chairman Viktor Shumeyko, the elections for the third deputy 
were held over until the next meeting of the chamber. 
  The Federation Council is now debating the question of 
forming parliamentary committees. Work is proceeding in a calm 
and businesslike manner.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Orlov report: "Who Is the Russian Senator? The </F>
Federation Council in Figures"] 
  [Text] Like the upper chamber in the parliament of the 
Russian Empire (the State Council), the Federation Council is 
characterized by greater conservatism than the State Duma -- 
naturally so, of course. The typical Russian senator is a man 
(95.3 percent) and a nonparty person (84.8 percent), aged 
between 40 and 50. Akhsarbek Galazov, chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet of the Republic of North Ossetia, and Yuriy Chernichenko, 
writer and leader of the Peasant Party, which is part of the 
Russia's Choice bloc, (both born in 1929) can lay claim to the 
title of the oldest members of the Federation Council, while the 
youngest is Sergey Levitan, president of the "Nostromo" concern 
(born in 1963). 
  Representation of the electoral associations and other 
political organizations in the Federation Council is very 
limited: Just 26 Council members (15.2 percent) indicated 
membership of them. The undoubted leaders in this respect are 
the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (10 seats) and the 
Russia's Choice bloc (eight Federation Council members). The 
Agrarian Party of Russia, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, 
the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms, the Labor Party, 
the All-Russia "Renewal" Union, and the 
Constitutional-Democratic Party (Party of People's Freedom), the 
Union of Communists of Karelia, and the "Peoples' Cocreativity 
in the Name of Life" association, which are little known to the 
voter, each got one deputy into the upper chamber of parliament. 
It seems that for the majority of "party" senators, as distinct 
from State Duma members, membership of a particular pressure 
group is secondary and unimportant. 
  The largest group of members of the Federal Assembly's 
Federation Council is made up of heads of executive and 
representative power in the components of the Federation. 
Presidents, council of ministers chairmen, administration heads, 
and governors make up 34.5 percent of the Federation Council (59 
people). It is noteworthy that in a number of components of the 
Federation two representatives of the top executive power were 
elected simultaneously to the Federation Council -- such as, for 
example, Kabardino-Balkaria, where both the president and the 
prime minister became members of the upper chamber of parliament 
(in this case we have placed the prime minister in another 
category -- that of representatives of the local executive and 
legislative power). Heads of soviets are represented 
considerably more modestly -- 19 people, or 11.1 percent. 
Members of the Russian Government, employees of the federal 
executive, representatives of the president, and representatives 
of components of the Federation under the president make up just 
5.8 percent of the Federation Council (10 people). This enables 
us to speak of the Federation Council as an organ representing 
the executive and local elites. The total number of "senators" 
in the categories we have enumerated is close to a qualified 
majority (64.3 percent). The main thing in doubt is the 
capacity for work of this section of the Federation Council and 
the possibility, if only purely technical, of blocking State 
Duma decisions with which a majority of Federation Council 
members disagree. 
  Precisely 23 entrepreneurs were elected to the Federation 
Council (13.5 percent). Their composition is substantially 
different from those elected to the State Duma -- they are, as a 
rule, leaders of major joint-stock companies and top managers of 
giant state enterprises like Sergey Korepanov, director of an 
office of the "Gazprom" Russian Joint-Stock Company. The 
Federation Council does not have many jurists who were 
professionally engaged in jurisprudence at the time they were 
elected; in fact there are five (2.9 percent). There is the 
same number of higher educational institution principals and 
lecturers. There are three journalists in the upper chamber of 
parliament (1.8 percent) -- as distinct from the State Duma, 
they are not mainly party publicists but editors and creative 
employees of popular local newspapers. 
  To judge from the initial characteristics of the membership, 
one of the main tasks of the Russian Federation Federal 
Assembly's Federation Council will be to coordinate widely 
understood local interests. I would like to hope that the 
Federation Council members, Russia's senators, will proceed from 
Russia's national interests in their approach to assessing the 
State Duma's draft laws.

  [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- A hard-line lawmaker from 
the Agrarian Party, who was a leader of the Communist faction of 
the disbanded Russian Supreme Soviet, is most likely to become 
the speaker of the state Duma, the lower house of the Russian 
parliament. 
  Ivan Rybkin got 233 votes during a so-called "rating vote" 
on 
Thursday which is far above the majority of the Duma. Yuriy 
Vlasov, another conservative lawmaker, was second with 200 votes. 
  Rybkin's success should be attributed also to a 
representative of the communist party, Valentin Kovalev, who 
withdrew his candidacy in favour of Rybkin just before the vote. 
  The winner will be determined on Friday morning when the 
deputies would elect one of the two lawmakers.

  [Text] The Tellers Commission has just taken the rostrum 
and announced the respective votes. There were two candidates, 
I'd like to remind you -- Yuriy Petrovich Vlasov and Ivan 
Petrovich Rybkin -- and the vote went the following way: for 
Vlasov -- 23 deputies for and 311 against; for Rybkin -- 223 for 
and 101 against. So Ivan Petrovich Rybkin, representing the 
Agrarian Party, is elected chairman of the State Duma with one 
vote over the minimum. He needed 222 votes and got 223, so he 
has been elected. 
  But there is some discussion at the moment about one ballot 
being disputed, but it's difficult to say while this discussion 
is going on. So far, however, the news is that Rybkin, Ivan 
Petrovich, representative of the Agrarian Party, has been 
elected chairman of the State Duma. Thank you.

  [Text] Moscow, 14 Jan -- The State Duma, the Federal 
Assembly's lower chamber, has elected engineer Ivan Rybkin, 47, 
to the post of its speaker. He was put forward by the Russian 
Agrarian Party. He was the leader of the Communist faction in 
the former Russian Parliament, the Supreme Soviet. 
  In an exclusive interview for an ITAR-TASS correspondent, 
Ivan Rybkin said that his position is to work in the lower 
chamber of Parliament "for consensus, cooperation, and for the 
interests of all groups and factions of deputies to be taken 
into account as much as possible." The State Duma speaker 
intends to focus particularly on defending minority rights. 
"Not infrequently in our bitter Russian history has it been the 
case that it is precisely the minority that turns out to be 
right," stressed Ivan Rybkin. 
  He said he will strive to cooperate with the president and 
the Government "within the constitutional framework," as he put 
it, and naturally maintain firm ties to the upper chamber of the 
parliament -- the Federation Council -- "on a principled and 
partner-like basis." 
  Asked whether his political sympathies would affect his 
conduct in the Duma, Ivan Rybkin said: "I think not."

  [Text] The State Duma, the lower house of Russia's new 
parliament, has approved interim house rules on the powers of 
its Speaker. 
  The Speaker is responsible for house proceedings and routine 
preparation of questions for debate and for representing the 
Duma in relations with the President, federal and regional 
bodies, as well as with parliaments of other countries and 
inter-parliamentary groups. 
  He also represents the House in any conciliatory procedure 
envisaged by the country's constitution. 
  The House rejected a proposal from Kiril Ignatyev of the 
Russia's Choice faction calling to delete a clause on the 
Speaker's function of preparing questions for debate. 
  The Duma has also reached agreement on how to elect Speaker 
of the House. The deputies rejected the option of a secret 
ballot, settling for the Council of Factions' proposal for two 
rounds of voting to be held instead. 
  The names of two candidates who enlist more support than 
others in a straw vote will next be put forward for a secret 
ballot. 
  The Duma has now begun nominating candidates for the post.

  [Text] Leader of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, in a speech to the State Duma during the 
presentation of candidates for the post of House Speaker, said 
that in all countries, the party winning a majority vote was 
automatically entitled to form a new government or to the post 
of parliamentary leader. 
  Zhirinovskiy said his recent tour of Europe "gave the 
jitters 
to the whole of the continent, diplomats and politicians alike" 
who were ready to part with billions of dollars to fulfill all 
conditions so that Russia could follow the path it opted for on 
December 12. 
  In reply to an earlier proposal from deputy Viktor Mironov 
that all candidates for the post of Speaker undergo a 
psychiatric test, Zhirinovskiy promised that all of the deputies 
would undergo one with the help of his security services. He 
said he would obtain all evidence of "who is suffering from what 
and for how long." The LDP leader said he did not think himself 
fit for a dispatcher's role and would await a new election 
instead. 
  In reply to an uproar in the house, Zhirinovskiy shouted 
"Shut up." 
  Addressing members of the Russia's Choice [RC] faction, the 
LDP leader said their time was up and now was the time for his 
party. "You are 30 percent behind us now, the gap will increase 
to 60 percent in spring and 90 percent in autumn," he told RC 
members. Zhirinovskiy said the presence of Gaydar, Kozyrev, 
Chubays and Fedorov in the government was having an adverse 
effect on his health and that he would temporarily opt out of 
the bout for the post of Speaker, biding his time until 
presidential elections in 1996. 
  In reply to Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays' gesture to the 
chairman indicating that Zhirinovskiy's time was up, the LDP 
leader shouted from the rostrum: "You will be pointing to your 
watch at Lefortovo prison!"

  [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- Russian Nationalist Leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy quarelled with lawmaker Mark Goryachev in 
the dining room during the lunch break in the Duma session on 
Friday and received a blow in the face, eye witnesses told TASS. 
  They said the quarrel emerged when one of the two Duma 
members wanted to jump the line for food, but could not say 
exactly whether it was Zhirinovskiy or Goryachev. 
  Anyway Goryachev, a prominent businessmen from St. 
Petersurg, 
hit Zhirinovskiy in the face leaving a bleeding scratch on it. 
  Police were called in and doctors rendered first aid to 
Zhirinovskiy. 
  The Russian Nationalist leader promised that Goryachev will 
be the first to get jailed in the notorious Lefortovo Prison, 
which used to belong to the KGB. Zhirinovskiy, evidently meant 
this would happen when he becomes the Russian president of which 
he is dreaming. 
  However, Goryachev is not the first man to receive such a 
threat from Zhirinovskiy. Right after the Decemeber 12 
elections Zhirinovskiy promised the same fate to Gennadiy 
khazanov, a famous comic who often mocks him. Khazanov 
responded by appearing in a show dressed as a convict with the 
number "001" sign on his shirt. 
  This is not the first case that Zhirinovskiy got beaten up. 
Before December elections bodyguards of popular singer Sofi 
Rotaru beat him up at a concert.

<F P=106> [Interview with Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the </F>
Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc, by Nadezhda Garifullina in 
Moscow; date not given; carried under the general heading "`We 
Have a Chance. Let's Fight!'"] 
  [Text] "In someone's pocket," "unfit for work" -- all 
kinds of descriptions, mainly unflattering, were being applied, 
long before the session, to the lower chamber of the new 
parliament, for which politicians and political scientists are 
not predicting a long life. What do the deputies themselves 
think? In the break I approached Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of 
the "Yabloko" [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin] bloc. It was a 
mystery to me why Grigoriy Alekseyevich had decided to run for 
the Duma at all, and so I asked him: 
  Do you believe that parliamentarianism is possible in 
Russia, 
after the shootout at the Supreme Soviet? 
  [Yavlinskiy] First, I think it is necessary, and as for 
whether it is possible or not, let us try once again to find out 
in practice. Second, after the situation we found ourselves in 
after 3-4 October, there was simply no alternative to holding 
elections -- in any form, even with all the shortcomings, which, 
of course, we knew about. Third, the Duma will have done its 
job if it acts as a Constituent Assembly, and that is its main 
mission. It must approve two things that are fundamental for 
Russia: electoral laws and an electoral code, and it simply 
must prepare Russia for elections of a real parliament and a 
president, and for elections of local organs of power. This is 
essential. 
  [Garifullina] And how long will the Duma be able to exist? 
Is it possible that a conflict could break out between the new 
paerliament and the president? 
  [Yavlinskiy] One would wish to avoid that. But the fact is 
that the Constitution today is structured in such a way that the 
president possesses full power. Therefore the Duma apparently 
has virtually no areas where it overlaps with the president. 
But at the same time the president bears full responsibility 
for what happens in the country. The Duma was elected for a 
short term -- only two years. Well, I don't know.... I would 
not wish to make pessimistic predictions. But if you think that 
after it is dissolved the next Duma will be better, I have grave 
doubts of that. 
  The majority of my voters did not participate in the vote, 
because the attitude to the elections themselves was negative, 
people did not have confidence in how they were organized, how 
they were called, how they were conducted, who supervised them. 
That was inevitable: When an authoritarian regime holds 
elections, it holds them in order to strengthen itself. But 
this is our road and we must follow it. We have a chance. 
Let's fight!

  [Text] By 13:00 on January 13, seven factions had been 
registered in the State Duma. One more faction - the Communist 
Party of the Russian Federation - appealed for registration, 
head of the State Duma's temporary secretariat Sergey Stankevich 
told the State Duma. 
  He also announced that one group of deputies - the New 
Regional Policy - had been registered (see the 12:30 news 
bulletin for details). 
  Stankevich presented information about the number of 
deputies 
in the registered associations (as of 13:00). 
  Russia's Choice, led by Vice Premier Yegor Gaydar - 75 
members; 
  The New Regional Policy, led by Vladimir Medvedyev - 65 
members; 
  The faction of the Liberal-Democratic Party, led by Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy - 63 members; 
  The Agrarian Party faction (Mikhail Lapshin) - 55 members; 
  The Communist Party faction (Gennadiy Zyuganov) - 45 
members; 
  The Party of Russian Unity and Concord (Sergey Shakhray) - 
30 
members; 
  The faction of the Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc (Grigoriy 
Yavlinskiy) - 25 members; 
  Women of Russia (Yekaterina Lakhova) - 23 members; 
  The faction of the Democratic Party of Russia (Nikolay 
Travkin) - 15 members. 
  Stankevich noted, however, that those figures were not final 
because deputies continued to apply for membership in the State 
Duma factions.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- The first deputies' group 
has been registered in the State Duma along with the nine party 
factions, under the name, "New Regional Politics". Chairman of 
the Oil-Workers Union Vladimir Medvedev is the leader of this 
group in the lower chamber of the newly elected Russian 
parliament. 
  Yuriy Voevoda told ITAR-TASS that the group has 65 members. 
It consists mainly of representatives of industrial circles 
with Medvedev at their head. Former Secretary of the Central 
Committee of the Soviet Communist Party Aleksandr Dzasokhov, who 
gathered around himself regional representatives, including 
those from the North Caucasus, added another twenty or so 
members to the group. 
  So far the group's members are united by the slogan, "Strong 
regions - a strong federation". But many of the deputies 
interpret this phrase, first voiced by Boris Yeltsin, in 
different ways. Some of the deputies think it is their duty to 
force the reduction of the percentage of overall income 
transferred by local governments to the center down to thirty 
per cent. 
  Voevoda and his allies think that the regions should use 
their own resources to solve their internal problems, perhaps by 
attracting funds from the international community. The 
districts who have free economic zones on their territory, like 
the Kaliningrad region and in the Far East, see this option as 
being a possibility for their own areas. 
  It is obvious that State Duma deputies are going to lobby 
the 
parliament for the interests of their home districts. Voevoda, 
for example, intends to use the support of his deputies' group 
to enact a law declaring a special status for the Kaliningrad 
region, so that the region can become "an object of 
international law for the resolution of all its problems without 
asking the centre for permission". The Kaliningrad region's 
difficult location, which is territorially cut off from Russia 
proper, makes it necessary for it to develop its own independent 
policies concerning the surrounding states in order to establish 
optimal border, transport, and energy systems, Voevoda asserted. 
  He said that part of the deputies' group intend to have 
another look at specific articles of the federal treaty and will 
push to make that document an integral part of the Russian 
Constitution. 
  The "New Regional Politics" group can be classified as 
centrist. Therefore, the "regionalists'" position will have the 
power to seriously influence the adoption of decisions in the 
parliament, depending on whether the group aligns itself with 
the "left" or the "right" blocs on any given question.

  The other co-chairpersons are member of the Moscow

Aleksandr Braginskiy and an entrepreneur from Nizhniy Novgorod 
Yevgeniy Bushmin. 
  To quote Khakamada, the Union of December 12 consists of 
lawyers, entrepreneurs and economists. It will not join any of 
the political factions. 
  She expressed hope that during the next three weeks the 
group 
will have 35 members which is sufficient for being registered.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 13 Jan (TASS) -- Russia's Choice is the 
largest faction in the State Duma. It has 76 deputies. The new 
regional policy group that was the first to be registered has 65 
deputies. The Liberal Democratic Party earned 63 seats in 
parliament, the Agrarian Party 55, the Communist Party 45. 
  There are four smaller parliamentary factions: The groups of 
the Party of Russian Unity and Accord with 30 seats; the Yabloko 
Party with 25 seats; the Women of Russia with 23 seats; and the 
Democratic Party of Russia with 15 seats. 
  The preliminary alignment of political forces in the State 
Duma indicates that communists, agrarians, and members of 
Zhirinovskiy's party have a total of 163 seats and are short of 
a parliamentary majority. The new regional policy group is 
likely to become influential in the lower chamber of parliament. 
Its composition, mostly centrists, are likely to consolidate 
the positions now of the right wing, now of the left. Many 
factions are likely to compete for friendship with this powerful 
group, which includes major industrialists and regional leaders 
elected in one-seat constituencies.

<F P=106> [Anastasiya Kasyanikova report: "Where Will the Duma -- </F>
Thought, in Russian -- Think Its Thought? Cherry Orchard-94"] 
  [Text] In 18 months or so Kutuzovskiy Prospekt will be 
transformed from a government highway into a sort of Capitol 
Hill. Yesterday, a government commission decided at its meeting 
on where to build a new State Duma building. 
  Apparently, this is the final decision. It turned out that 
the question has been under discussion, without too much 
publicity, for as long as two months. From the outset there 
have been two proposals. The first option was to split the 
government complex into two parts. The residential part was to 
be built on the outskirts of the White House, and the office 
building at the "Krasnaya Presnya" stadium. Apart from the fact 
that the area is cramped for space, which embarrasses both the 
customers and the builders, the Duma's proximity to the U.S. 
Embassy does not suit the special services. They were not 
embarrassed, though, when the White House was built, nor did 
they have any doubts about moving the government there. 
  The second option, however, suited everyone -- it gives room 
for frolicking. Over 20 hectares between Kutuzovskiy Prospekt 
and the Belarusian railway line will turn into a construction 
site for the future parliamentary center. The complex of 
buildings itself will be erected right in front of the Arch of 
Triumph. Deputies will also be able to run to the Borodino 
Panorama [exhibition of war against Napoleon] during breaks 
between meetings. 
  Four years ago, a Foreign Ministry complex, nicknamed 
Shevardnadze's congress center, was nearly built on that same 
spot. A competition of blueprints was even conducted. But it 
fell through.... This time, the commission will be very 
meticulous in studying new blueprints. The thirst for 
civilization is so great that there are already plans to send 
messengers to Brussels, Strasbourg, and Bonn soon to study 
Europe's best parliamentary architecture.

documents were found not to be ready. 
  Nevertheless, two sensational developments occurred in those 
30 minutes: The "New Regional Policy" deputies' group, set up 
12 January, has overtaken the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia] in terms of numbers, becoming the largest deputies' 
association in the Duma after "Russia's Choice." 
  On the whole then, the deputies divided up as follows: 

  -  The "Democratic Party of Russia" faction -- 15 members; 
  -  the "Women of Russia" faction -- 23 members; 
  -  the LDPR faction -- 63 members; 
  -  Yavlinskiy's faction -- 25 members; 
  -  "Russia's Choice" -- 76 members; 
  -  the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] -- 30 members; 
  -  the Agrarian Party of Russia -- 55 members; 
  -  the Communist faction -- 45 members; and 
  -  the "New Regional Policy" deputies' group -- 65 members. 
  An ITAR-TASS correspondent learned the names of the leaders 
of the State Duma factions from deputies in the lower chamber. 
  Vladimir Lukin has been put forward for the post of chairman 
of the "Yabloko" faction; Ivan Rybkin for that of the Agrarian 
Party; Sergey Glazyev for the Democratic Party of Russia; 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy for the LDPR; Sergey Shakhray for the 
PRES; Mikhail Lapshin for the Communist Party of the Russian 
Federation; Oil Workers' Union President Vladimir Medvedev for 
the "New Regional Policy" faction; Alevtina Fedulova for "Women 
of Russia." "Russia's Choice" has so far refrained from 
publicizing the name of its faction chairman. 
  The organizational formalization of factions is not over 
yet. 
But it can already be noted that the Communists have teamed up 
with the Agrarians. 
  The main result of the consultations by independent deputies 
on the subject of forming deputies' groups in the Duma, for 
which purpose a day and a half's recess was proposed, was the 
appearance of the "New Regional Policy" deputies' group. There 
are 62 people on its lists [figure as published]. So in terms 
of strength, the new deputies' group has overtaken the 
Communists and the Agrarians, and gotten very close to 
Zhirinovskiy's faction, which yet again casts doubt over the 
LDPR head's claims to undisputed leadership in the parliament. 
  Judging from the group's declarations, the Duma's political 
center has not stayed vacant for long, and it is precisely "New 
Regional Policy," which has taken the place of the former "Civic 
Union" in the old Russian parliament. The composition of the 
new deputies' association is interesting and diverse. On the 
one hand, a group of representatives of Russian republics and 
autonomies led by former CPSU Central Committee Secretary A. 
Dzasokhov has joined it, and, on the other, famous Russian 
businessman A. Tarasov is among its ranks. Almost all the Army 
generals who were elected deputies have ended up in the group's 
line-up. But the association's fundamental support consists of 
the managers of major enterprises, including from the fuel and 
energy complex. Along with the PRES, "Russia's Choice," and 
Agrarian factions, "New Regional Policy" also has a minister in 
its midst -- Government apparatus leader V. Kvasov, who obtained 
ministerial rank a few days ago. It is said in the Duma 
corridors that the new association has the prime minister's 
sympathies. 
  On the subject of the political nature of "New Regional 
Policy" and opportunities for it to form alliances and blocs, 
there will be a more detailed discussion of this in an interview 
with the group's chairman, Oil Workers' Union President V. 
Medvedev, to be published in a forthcoming edition. However, 
judgment can be made about its claim to the role of a serious 
force in the Duma by the fact that V. Medvedev has already been 
put forward as a candidate for the post of speaker of the lower 
chamber. At the same time, it is not ruled out that his 
candidacy will receive the support of the "Russia's Choice" 
bloc, which has as yet failed to put its own candidate forward. 
  In point of fact, the creation of the "New Regional Policy" 
group was the only successfully completed attempt at forming new 
deputies' associations. The so-called industrial-financial 
group failed to gather the requisite 35 people under its banner. 
The groups of deputies led by I. Khakamada, after much 
deliberation, decided to join "Russia's Choice." Likewise, the 
patriotically minded deputies led by A. Lukyanov did not succeed 
in registering, although observers are of the opinion that they 
still have a chance of setting up a deputies' group. 
  At the same time, despite the recent spread of rumors, the 
"Russia's Choice" faction remained united. As G. Burbulis 
declared in a conversation with IZVESTIYA's correspondent, he 
does not entertain the possibility of a split in the faction, 
although it is not impossible that some of its members will not 
match up to demands placed on them for a high level of 
professionalism. As for the faction's possible stance in 
connection with the expected government reshuffle, G. Burbulis 
declared that "Russia's Choice" will not play the role of 
passive observer of government actions. Along with this he 
stressed that the faction does not intend to switch to opposing 
the president, and it will try to help B. Yeltsin to maintain 
his stance as a president of reform.

<F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich with </F>
unidentified reporters from the Belarusian Television and Radio 
Company and Belinform on 12 January; place not given -- live or 
recorded; in Russian unless otherwise specified] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Certain events that occurred in 1993 are 
now being widely discussed. I am referring to the unification 
of the Belarusian and Russian monetary systems. People are 
calling us and asking about the motives behind this step, how 
and when this will happen. The main question is: In what way 
will the Belarusian economy and the man in the street gain from 
this? Please, comment on these government actions. 
  [Kebich] I want to go back in history. As you know, I have 
always been an advocate of a close economic union with all CIS 
states. However, some politicians have failed to understand the 
advantages of such a union. The conference of Belarusian and 
Ukrainian entrepreneurs in which I participated today, 
demonstrated that nostalgia for the economic union, and not just 
nostalgia, but also new circumstances force entrepreneurs to 
unite. Speaking of Russia and the Republic of Belarus, you know 
that the two states are so closely integrated that in fact, we 
cannot exist without one another. With regard to Belarusian 
power resources, we totally depend on Russian supplies. Russia 
supplies us with 50 to 60 percent of metals and other raw 
materials. Russia in fact, remains the only market for our 
products. We have reached some very negative phenomena and this 
forced people who are not selfish...perhaps neither Kebich nor 
Ivanov nor Petrov need that; our people need a close economic 
union. Such a union means equal prices for power resources for 
Russian and Belarusian consumers, eliminating all quotas, 
duties, and tariffs.... In fact, this will lead to a reduction 
of prices. Wholesale prices will decrease following a decrease 
in production costs and then, retail prices will go down as well. 
  Is it not a sad experience seeing people who went on 
Christmas vacation, forgive me the word, still not working. 
Healthy people who should operate machines and make products 
are spending time on the lakes fishing. The people do not 
understand what happened. They ask: Where are you, politicians? 
What are you preoccupied with? What are you doing? I am 
currently doing the will of my legislature that decreed the 
unification of monetary systems and the formation of an economic 
union with Russia. 
  My recent meeting with Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin 
that lasted some three and a half hours led us to the conclusion 
that we are culturally, spiritually, and morally affiliated. We 
realized that the two states' economic systems are similar and 
that we need each other. Why should Russia build a plant like 
our BelAZ when we have difficulties selling our trucks? Huge 
prices for power resources make our products uncompetitive not 
only in the West, but also on CIS markets. All these factors 
brought about the signing of the agreement between the two 
states. We decided to sign it in Minsk which is the CIS capital 
to demonstrate that we made first steps toward [reforming] our 
economies. We are moving on from multilateral to bilateral 
relations. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Kebich] As far as I know, I have been told by our 
ambassador, that as a result of today's negotiations [between 
Shushkevich and Yeltsin], orders were given to prepare for the 
signing of the agreements as soon as possible. During my 
meetings with the Russian leadership it was precisely envisioned 
that this should be done in January. 
  [Reporter] Could you say what issues have been left 
unresolved? 
  [Kebich] There will be no more declarations. Bilateral 
relations between Chernomyrdin and Kebich, the two prime 
ministers, will be signed [as heard]. All the agreements but 
one have been already ratified by ministers or their deputies. 
Thus, the signing of these 12 agreements will denote that our 
monetary systems have been unified. 
  [Reporter] Considering that these agreements are so 
advantageous for Belarus, what caused opposition against their 
signing? 
  [Kebich] I liked the interview given by Viktor Chernomyrdin 
after signing the agreement in which he said: We have no claims 
on anybody's sovereignty. I have always said, and I want to 
underline over again that by joining the single ruble zone, by 
signing economic agreements, by lifting all barriers that hamper 
the free flow of products, people may give us a chance to 
survive and save our sovereignty. I think that those 
politicians who oppose the economic union care only about 
themselves. They do not care about either Belarusian 
sovereignty or peoples' lives. They want to make a show. Every 
sound politician, even having a negative attitude toward the 
union must understand that the latter provides undisputable 
advantages. 
  [Reporter, in Belarusian] Did Russia put forward any 
preconditions for [signing the agreement with] Belarus? 
  [Kebich, in Belarusian] There were no preconditions. In 
general, I must say that we agreed that prices for power 
resources will be equal and even the Russian side maintained 
that the unification of monetary systems should be done on a 
parity basis. To avoid misinterpretations I want to point out 
that parity does not mean that our hare will equal one ruble. 
It means that one hare will equal (?30) rubles. 
  [Reporter, in Belarusian] Is there a chance that following 
the unification of monetary systems Russian enterprises will 
repay their debts to Belarusian partners? 
  [Kebich, in Belarusian] Our enterprises kept their assets in 
Russia. Now, they will be returned to Belarus and start working 
for the economy of Belarus and not Russia. 
  [Reporter] Does this mean that the union with Russia is a 
real necessity? 
  [Kebich] I do not see any other way to save the Belarusian 
economy. I may be mistaken; I may be condemned, but this is my 
way, my policy, and the rest of my life. By saying this, I do 
not rule out that we should not form economic unions with any 
other state. The agreement does not prohibit bilateral relations 
with other states. We should seek contacts with East Europe; we 
should have equally good relations with Western states. This 
does not contradict our union with Russia. I think that perhaps 
this move will push other CIS states to signing bilateral 
agreements with us. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] 
  [Kebich] I would like to say that I am not as adamant on 
this 
issue. I can take a step to the left or the right to profit 
from this union. And now about my personal appraisal: You 
know, I would like to say that, from this perspective, I am very 
satisfied. However, from another perspective, I am somewhat 
dissatisfied, because the good work that we are currently 
conducting is being criticized by other people. You claim that 
the industrial complex is against this union, but this is not 
true. You know, one should not trust all reports and 
statements. I have recently met with Belarusian and Ukrainian 
industrialists, and they all, arm in arm, approve this very 
union. They are very thankful for what the prime minister has 
done for them. I have recently read a newspaper published by 
Belarusian Communists, and they also assault the government. 
You are probably in the center of this criticism. In all 
countries all over the world, people who are not in power always 
criticize authorities. However, they criticize the people who 
are responsible for concrete matters. 
  Regarding the current issue, I would like to say that, when 
the time for the electoral race comes, all opposition forces 
wake up. In this case, I can see rapprochement of extreme 
radicalism from the left and right sides. As the saying goes, 
one goes left but comes from the right. Due to that, I must 
proceed on the path between these lines. I can step neither on 
the left path nor on the right one, and therefore I will proceed 
on the current path. 
  [Correspondent] Returning to the issue of our economic union 
with Russia, we praise it [words indistinct]. 
  [Kebich] The point is that if prices for energy sources 
become equal in Russia and Belarus, our relations will instantly 
become based on equal rights. Currently, the price for gas in 
Russia amounts to 26,000 rubles [R], in Belarus it reaches 
R80,000. The price for oil is also two and a half times higher 
in Belarus than in Russia. The unification of monetary systems 
cannot be accomplished, if prices for all goods in Russia and 
Belarus are not equal. Due to that, we have not even allowed 
the possibility that prices would be different. It is possible 
that we will finance the expenditures for oil exploration and 
drilling works, however, this will be an insignificant cost. 
Exploration work has already been conducted for a long time. 
This has cost them, too. Therefore, we put it this way: This 
does not mean that we should currently pay the same amount for 
gas as Russia does. The situation could be different: Our 
prices will be decreasing, while Russia's will be increasing 
until we reach one level. Moreover, I would like to emphasize 
that although the unification of our monetary systems has not 
yet been completed, we have already agreed that we will pay $55 
instead of $80 for gas. So, can you tell me, isn't this alone a 
great achievement? Russia has met us halfway. Not $80 but $55. 
This is $25 or almost R30,000. This is the initial result. 
  [Correspondent] Your meeting with Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin lasted almost 
three hours. What issues were discussed during this time? 
  [Kebich] There have been no such lengthy negotiations over 
my 
entire political life. Due to that, a great number of issues 
was discussed, including the circumstances connected with 
certain East European countries' willingness to join NATO. We 
discussed the attitude toward these countries and the issue of 
participation of our countries in the IMF. The scope of the 
discussed issues went far beyond relations between Russia and 
the Republic of Belarus. 
  [Correspondent] Suppose the monetary unification is not 
accomplished. What does it mean for Belarus and what is your 
prognosis? 
  [Kebich] The most unpleasant prognosis is that our 
enterprises will simply collapse. I am not speaking about 
agriculture. The agricultural sector is in much better shape 
than industry. Due to that, a new government, and I do not know 
who it will be, will have a very complex situation. All I can 
say is that, over two years in Ukraine, three governments have 
been changed. What has rally changed there? There have been 
pragmatics, theorists, and professionals, and nothing has 
changed. Recently, the president has assumed all powers, and 
the situation there is even worse than ours. Thus, I believe 
that we have no other way. I always ask politicians: What do 
you propose? Yesterday, a NEW YORK TIMES correspondent told me: 
You always speak of help for Russia. Do you think that helping 
Russia you also help other CIS countries. However, this is not 
true. If you analyzed the help granted to Russia by IMF and the 
one granted to us, it would become obvious that we have received 
more. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] 
  [Kebich] It is clear that if Belarus were a nuclear state, 
if 
we had not refused to keep the nuclear weapons, we would not be 
participating in this meeting [with President Clinton]. I am 
speaking sincerely. However, we see that the Clinton 
administration is paying tribute to Belarus, and this is being 
done, first and foremost, by U.S. President Bill Clinton. This 
is brought about by the fact that we do not lay claims to 
nuclear weapons and we do not make nuclear weapons the subject 
of political bargaining. This is the most important thing. I 
hope that during our short meeting -- Clinton will stay with us 
no more than five hours -- we will discuss issues related solely 
to economic relations between Belarusian and U.S. business 
circles.

  [Text] Minsk, 13 Jan (TASS-BELINFORM)--Belarus intends to 
build economic relations with the United States primarily 
through the implementation of specific programs promoting trade 
and investments, Stanislav Shushkevich, chairman of the Republic 
of Belarus' Supreme Soviet, said today on the eve of U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's visit to Minsk. 
  According to the Belorusian leader, although affected by the 
Chernobyl catastrophe and floods more than others through no 
fault of its own, the republic did not attach prime importance 
to humanitarian aid in the past, either. In the opinion of the 
head of Belorusian parliament, the state's foreign economic 
policy should aim not at "patching up holes but at a search for 
ways of proper economic cooperation with foreign partners and, 
first of all, with the United States", something to be discussed 
during Bill Clinton's visit. 
  Shushkevich noted that the Belorusian side had drawn up 
concrete proposals to be discussed with the American side. It 
is not ruled out that conversation will touch upon the United 
States' assistance in implementing measures linked to the 
withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Belarus. 
  As regards the Belorusian side's other proposals, he 
believed 
that it was too early to announce them prior to the meeting with 
Bill Clinton. 
  Answering a question about why the program for the U.S. 
delegation's stay in the Republic of Belarus included separate 
meetings with the head of parliament and the head of executive 
authority, Shushkevich noted that this was in no way connected 
with different positions upheld by legislative and executive 
authorities. "Since the U.S. President is the head of supreme 
executive authority and has great powers in legislative 
activity, both sides have agreed to hold two separate meetings, 
with the chairman of the Supreme Soviet and the chairman of the 
Council of Ministers," Shushkevich said.

  [Text] Minsk, 13 Jan -- At a working meeting between 
Colonel General Pavel Kozlovskiy, Belarus defense minister, and 
U.S. Ambassador in Belarus David Swartz, possible ways of 
extending application of the Nunn-Lugar Bill were discussed. 
Under this bill, the United States can provide additional 
finance to Belarus -- which rigorously follows the course toward 
nonnuclear status, in keeping with international treaties on 
confidence-building measures and disarmament in Europe -- to 
compensate for its expenses connected with the reduction of its 
army to the necessary sufficiency level. 
  The cost of destroying excess military equipment is a burden 
currently being borne by the Belarus taxpayers. Any help in 
this area would be more than welcome. Discussion of this 
important issue is expected at the summit meeting when U.S. 
President Bill Clinton visits Minsk.

  [Text] Provided no changes are made in the schedule of 
U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Belarus, the President 
will fly to Minsk on 15 January along with his wife Hillary and 
daughter Chelsea. Guests are always shown what is best, 
although this will not be an easy task given the fact that the 
Clintons' visit will last only a couple of hours. As is known, 
Hillary and Chelsea Clinton have plans of their own during the 
visit. The President's daughter will attend a demonstration at 
the State Choreography College, while his wife will visit the 
Opera and Ballet Theater. She will be accompanied by our 
Republic's first ladies -- Irina Shushkevich and Alena Kebich. 
They will exchange souvenirs at the opera, after which Hillary 
Clinton will meet with artists.

  [Text] Corr.: Before your meeting with Boris Yeltsin took 
place, observers thought it would center on prospects for a more 
extensive mutual integration of Belarus and Russia, including 
the unification of their monetary systems. Is that what your 
talks were about? 
  Stanislav Shushkevich: To start with, I'm very pleased that 
that meeting has taken place. It seems to me we were talking in 
an atmosphere of mutual trust. I was very pleased with the 
attention the Russian president gave to the problems of Belarus 
and with his understanding of them. 
  As for the concrete results of the meeting, we paid 
practically no attention to minor tactical problems. We talked 
about comprehensive long-term cooperation. 
  There are urgent matters, of course, and we did give 
consideration to them. But there are also matters that need 
serious preparation. We paid attention to those too. 
  What I consider to be the main result is that we agreed that 
there is a need for a new treaty between Belarus and Russia. I 
think it's obvious to everyone that some points of the treaty of 
December 18, 1990, which is still in effect and which was signed 
when the Soviet Union was still in existence, don't seem too 
serious nowadays. What we need is a document that would provide 
a clear and accurate legal basis for comprehensive interaction 
between our two countries, help them achieve stabilization and 
make their development more dynamic. 
  Corr.: Do you have in mind military and political 
cooperation? 
  S.S.: Certainly. We discussed the current withdrawal of 
strategic nuclear forces from Belarus to Russia and the 
possibility of speeding up that process. We also gave detailed 
consideration to the latest initiative of the United States and 
European nations, known as "partnership for the sake of peace." 
And we talked about the participation of Belarus in the 
collective security system [of the CIS] as well. 
  I will first of all say a few words about the latter 
problem. 
President Yeltsin understands our position, namely that we 
cannot fully participate in that system, because the syndrome of 
the Great Patriotic War (of 1941-45) and the Afghan syndrome are 
particularly painful for us. May I remind you that in both wars 
Belarus suffered greater per capita losses than any other 
republic of the former Soviet Union. 
  Boris Yeltsin and I agreed that Belarus mustn't ensure its 
own security at the expense of any other state and therefore 
decided that Belarus would be gradually incorporated into the 
collective security system. By such gradual incorporation, 
which would make it possible to solve the problem painlessly, 
without giving rise to a confrontation within Belarus, I mean 
that we have not yet ratified the Treaty on Collective Security. 
We plan to ratify it with some reservations. Our diplomats 
should try to make it clear to our partners in the CIS that 
those reservations are not a whim on our part but reflect the 
actual state of affairs. When Russia realizes that, it will be 
easier to bring it home to other signatories to the treaty. 
  Now, as regards rumors that we have plans to join NATO, we 
have never, under no circumstances, expressed any desire to join 
NATO, and have never even hinted at that. 
  As for the withdrawal of strategic nuclear forces to Russia, 
we stated once again that everything is going on in conformity 
to the former agreements. We are working on a detailed schedule 
for it and a detailed treaty on it between our defense 
ministries. Belarus is making no direct or indirect conditions 
for it. We are deeply satisfied that our position has been 
given a good reception in the world. It is not ourselves but 
Russia and the United States that have proposed that, when 
fissile materials are assigned for civilian use, the part of 
their cost which is proportional to the amount of those 
materials remaining on Belarusian territory be paid to Belarus 
in hard currency. 
  The only reservation we'd like to make is that, although all 
of us would like the nuclear weapons to be taken away as soon as 
possible, we may get into trouble if we are in too much of a 
hurry to get it done. So we'll make sure that all necessary 
safety measures are taken. 
  Corr.: The peace policy of Belarus is likely to affect the 
nature of its armed forces too. However, today Belarus has more 
military officers "per capita" than any other former Soviet 
republic. How is that problem being solved? 
  S.S.: That's a very painful and complicated process. We'd 
like to have what is, to all intents, a national army. We are 
patiently dealing with that task, taking into consideration the 
needs and sentiments of both the officers serving in Belarus and 
ethnic Belarusians doing military service outside the country 
and wishing to return home. 
  I don't think cutting down the number of officers by decree 
is an acceptable way to speed up the creation of a national 
army. It's much more in our interest to get something done 
without throwing them out and leaving them totally neglected and 
embittered. 
  Yes, it is a complicated process, I must repeat, but it's 
under control. We have a special parliamentary commission (the 
Commission on Defense and National Security headed by parliament 
presidium member Mechislav Grib) that is in charge of it and 
pays extremely close attention to it. 
  Corr.: Did you discuss with the Russian president the 
possibility of assistance to Belarus in the protection of its 
borders? 
  S.S.: I did. The point is that, if we wish to have a single 
customs area, -which is our aim under our earlier agreements, - 
Russia must have guarantees that Belarus doesn't provide a 
loophole for bending Russian laws and customs regulations. 
First of all, we must take care of our borders with Lithuania 
and Latvia (the Polish border is well under control). By the 
way, that would be much easier for Russia to do than look after 
the Russian-Belarusian border, which is much longer. 
  Corr.: What are the other priorities that you think Belarus 
should have in its cooperation with Russia? 
  S.S.: Belarus and Russia must have uniform price policies. 
Agreement on many points can be reached at the level of 
enterprises, without any government intervention. I think final 
documents will be basically ready by the end of this month, when 
(Russian Prime Minister) Viktor Chernomyrdin comes to Belarus to 
sign them. 
  Corr.: Is Chernomyrdin mainly coming to make a joint 
statement with the Belarusian leadership on the unification of 
the monetary systems of the two countries, as has been reported? 
  S.S.: What needs to be done is not to make statements but to 
sign a package of documents. If such documents are signed - 
there should be six or seven of them - the unification you have 
mentioned will materialize. It would be fairly naive to expect 
the two monetary systems to be unified instantly. 
  See the next issue of Presidential Bulletin for the end of 
the interview, where Shushkevich speaks about the forthcoming 
visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to Minsk and the CIS's 
development prospects.

<F P=106> [Ivan Hladkiy report on news conference by Supreme Soviet </F>
Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich, National Bank Chairman Stanislav 
Bogdankevich, and CIS Affairs Secretary Uladzimir Zalomay at the 
Supreme Soviet press center in Minsk on 13 January; from the 
"Postfactum Radio" feature--passages with quotation marks are 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] You know that Belarusian Supreme Soviet 
Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich has just concluded a visit to 
Moscow where he met and spoke with Boris Yeltsin. This meeting 
will likely be recorded as a turning point in history and its 
results are interesting to everybody. We are subconsciously 
waiting for a miracle to happen; we are expecting our lives to 
get better. Therefore, a great many journalists gathered at a 
news conference held at the Supreme Soviet press center. My 
colleague Ivan Hladkiy was also invited. So, I am turning the 
microphone over to him. 
  [Hladkiy] Interest in this news conference was enormous. It 
was manifested in the great number of journalists who took part 
in it. Their interest is quite understandable. Currently, 
everyone is speaking about the unification of two monetary 
systems -- Russian and Belarusian; about the upcoming visit of 
U.S. President Bill Clinton to Minsk, and about other urgent 
issues. The entire audience was eager to know what issues our 
Belarusian delegation settled in Moscow. This is how Belarusian 
Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich characterized the 
results of the Moscow talks. 
  [Shushkevich] "I am going to read the joint communique. It 
includes the following ideas: First of all, we have discussed 
the issues of the economic situation and other issues of 
bilateral relations. The most important thing is that we have 
arrived at a unanimous decision and I am pleased to mark that 
the treaty on cooperation, signed in December 1990, when the two 
states were parts of the former USSR, does not suit new 
realities. It is high time to immediately draft a new 
full-fledged treaty on friendship and cooperation. We have also 
discussed the visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to Moscow and 
Minsk and reached an understanding on this issue, as well as on 
the issue of the unification of the Belarusian and Russian 
monetary systems; the merging of our monetary systems. It is 
very difficult to declare and then unite our monetary systems. 
Therefore, work on the adjustment of the positions of the two 
countries is being continued. In my mind, this work will be 
done in January, that is, [words indistinct]. Boris Yeltsin has 
authorized Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin to visit Minsk in 
January, where he will hold additional talks with the Belarusian 
Government. If by that time work on the rapprochement of mutual 
positions is concluded [words indistinct] and a legal footing 
for this unification [word indistinct]. I personally consider 
the issue of equal prices to be the key issue. I am satisfied 
with the fact that we could explain to the Russian leadership 
[words indistinct] about Chernobyl. [Words indistinct] some 15 
percent of our state expenditures are represented by Chernobyl 
costs. Therefore, it is very difficult for us to stand on our 
own feet when Russia is pursuing its own pricing policy. I hope 
that we will [words indistinct] with Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin resolve this issue this month." 
  [Hladkiy] The CIS Executive Secretary Vladimir Zalomay, 
Belarusian vice prime minister, said: 
  [Zalomay] "Actually, the key issue on the agenda is the 
unification of the two monetary systems. Currently, the mass 
media are carrying various reports as to which stage this 
process has reached. I would like to note that this process is 
in the penultimate stage of being concluded. However, the work 
has not yet reached its final stage. The final step will be 
made in January in Minsk. We have completed all the preparatory 
work, which puts the unification of the monetary systems on a 
legal footing." 
  [Hladkiy] There were many questions and they were very 
different. However, the prevailing majority of questions 
concerned the monetary union: What will be the exchange rate of 
Belarusian hares [nickname for Belarusian currency]? Will 
Belarus lose its state independence? What advantages will this 
monetary union provide Belarus? Belarusian National Bank 
Chairman Stanislav Bogdankevich addressed all of these questions. 
  [Bogdankevich] "Answering the question on the exchange rate 
of Belarusian rubles, I can say the following: At the moment, 
we have no written agreement on the exchange rate. We 
understand that we can begin using an exchange rate of 10:1, in 
favor of the Russian ruble." 
  [Hladkiy] "So, what was the reaction of international 
financial organizations to the possible unification of the 
Belarusian and Russian monetary systems?" 
  [Bogdankevich] "The IMF has somehow expressed its concern 
with the fact that we do not properly inform it on the course of 
negotiations on the issue. I met with an IMF representative and 
explained to him the current state of affairs. Later, we 
received another IMF statement recommending that we think hard 
and adopt decisions carefully." 
  [Hladkiy] "What can you say about the circulation of Russian 
rubles and Belarusian hares when our states unite their monetary 
systems?" 
  [Bogdankevich] "The concern is that if the decision on the 
establishment of a 1:1 exchange rate of Belarusian hares and 
Russian rubles is adopted, then it will not be necessary to 
immediately withdraw our Belarusian payment notes from 
circulation. We should put into circulation that amount of 
Russian money that our population requires for [words 
indistinct]. I am emphasizing that we are approaching the 
signing of an agreement on this exchange rate, but it has not 
yet been signed. As for the unification itself, I think that if 
we unite our financial systems on a sound basis, on the basis of 
using and distributing Russian primary raw materials, primarily 
energy resources, on Belarusian territory, it will be easier to 
stabilize the Belarusian economy and to preserve markets in 
Russia and Belarus. In this aspect, the key issue is to agree 
and unite on the basis of using domestic Russian prices at the 
moment we begin using the Russian currency. Not later, but 
instantly." 
  [Hladkiy] These are their opinions and prospects. However, 
my dear listeners, we can do nothing but wait. Let us hope for 
the best.

<F P=106> [Sergey Prokopenko and Valeriy Kovalev article: "Belarus </F>
Economy in a Coma. Will the Politicians Revive It at the 
Russian-Belarusian Talks?"] 
  [Text] Undoubtedly Stanislav Shushkevich, the head of the 
Belarusian parliament, who visited Moscow 12 January at the head 
of a Republic of Belarus Supreme Soviet delegation left Minsk in 
a mood that was far from jovial. A most grave economic 
situation has developed in the republic. Since New Year more 
than 20 of Belarus' largest enterprises have stopped work. In 
addition, the vehicle and agricultural machine building 
enterprises have not begun work. The BelAZ Belarusian Truck 
Plant, MAZ Minsk Truck Plant, and "Gomselmash" plants are 
standing idle. The situation is no better at enterprises in the 
radioelectronics sector, which together with machine building 
constitute over 80 percent of the republic's industrial 
potential. The "vacation" at the "Vychislitelnaya tekhnika 
[computer equipment]" republic industrial association will last 
until 1 February and the "Integral" Science-and-Production 
Association, BelOMO [Optical and Mechanical Association], and 
other enterprises are standing idle. 
  One of the main causes of the economic crisis in Belarus is 
the sharp rise in prices for energy resources and the lack of 
cash in Russian rubles. According to certain statistics payment 
for energy sources already accounts for 60 percent of production 
costs in the republic. 
  In this situation, however, the Belarus leadership is 
pinning 
great hopes on the unification of the monetary systems of 
Belarus and Russia: A decision on that was adopted last week. 
However, even here it is not all plain sailing. For example, 
in the opinion of Stanislav Bogdankevich, chairman of the board 
of the National Bank of Belarus, the statement on the 
forthcoming unification of the monetary systems leaves an 
ambiguous impression. On the one hand it is stated that the 
sides are ready to carry out this unification but on the other 
there is a marked lack of agreement on a whole series of 
questions. In particular, Bogdankevich stressed that from the 
date of the republic's switch to the Russian ruble it is 
stipulated that standard prices must be set for energy sources 
and basic raw materials within the confines of the common 
customs territory. Otherwise any unification becomes pointless 
because Belarusian enterprises will obviously be uncompetitive 
in the Russian market. 
  In short, the statement on the unification of the two 
countries' monetary systems has produced conflicting 
interpretations both in Russia and in Belarus. The opponents and 
supporters of this move have considerable justification for 
their view. Skeptics, for example, consider that the 
unification of the monetary systems could lead to an 
infringement of Belarusian sovereignty whereas the realists are 
ready to forego a proportion of that sovereignty for the sake of 
saving the economy.

  [Text] Chisinau January 13 TASS -- General Aleksandr Lebed, 
commander of the 14th Russian Army in the self-proclaimed 
Dniester Republic of Moldova, denied allegations that the 
presence of the Army worsens the economic situation in the 
region. 
  In an interview with Asket [name as received] cable 
television on Thursday, Lebed brushed off accusations that his 
"troops are worsening the economic crisis in the Dniester 
Republic" as groundless. Many blame the soldiers who are paid 
in new Russian roubles for the low buying power of the local 
population. The soldiers exchange their money for old Soviet 
banknotes which are the only legal tender in the republic on the 
black market at a very high exchange rate. 
  Lebed also accused the authorities of the Dniester Republic 
of misappropriations. He stressed that over 11 billion roubles 
are used annually to keep the bureaucratic apparatuses and 
servicing personnel of Dniester leaders, as well as finance the 
studying of their children and relatives abroad. 
  He blasted Dniester officials for abusing their powers and 
offices and neglecting the needs of the people.

  The final resolution rests with the Cabinet after it has

  The Baltic presidents in their Jan. 11 statement already 
voiced their wish to participate in the cooperation plan, which 
NATO offers to the East European countries and the Baltic states 
as an avenue to eventual NATO membership. 
  Latvia has not decided yet how it will participate in the 
program. The establishment of the Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion 
is the first task now, said Pavlovskis.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 12, BNS -- The Jan. 10 incident was a 
Russian-organized, deliberate political provocation, MP Odisejs 
Kostanda, of the Latvian National Independence Movement, told 
reporters Wednesday [12 January]. 
  Andrejs Rucs, the former head of the Riga Vidzeme district 
municipality, was prompted by his "impulsive disposition to join 
in the incident but he was unconscious of the actual goals of 
its organizers," said Kostanda. 
  The Homeland and Freedom faction does not support methods 
used by Rucs during the incident because, currently, Latvia is 
unable to turn out the occupation army by force, said faction 
head Maris Grinblats. 
  The faction calls for more composure in similar situations, 
said Grinblats. Simultaneously, Grinblats criticized the 
government for "overdramatizing" the occurrence and being too 
submissive to Russia's interests. 
  "Russian militarists quite often take the liberty to treat 
Latvia's citizens in a criminal way," noted Kostanda. 
  Russia's military planes cross the Latvian airspace without 
any permission almost daily but the Latvian Government has 
notified Russia on none of these occassions, Kostanda said. 
  Kostanda reminded the participants of the press conference 
that one of the detainees, Maj. Gen. Anatoly Vodopyanov, 
conducted actions against the Latvian state in January and 
August, 1991. 
  The other officer, Maj. Gen. Nikolay Tailokov, has 
unlawfully 
settled in a summer house of a Latvian citizen and refuses to 
move out, said Kostanda. 
  Kostanda characterized the government's apology to Russia as 
"irresponsible and corresponding to its disloyal policies." 
  The Cabinet used the incident to extend its authority by 
unlawful means, said Grinblats, pointing at the amendments to 
the law on municipalities. The amended law allowed for the 
immediate dismissal of Rucs. 
  The amendments are inconsistent with the 81st paragraph of 
the Latvian Constitution, said Grinblats. The new rules also 
increased the dependence of municipal officials from the 
government, he added. 
  At the same time, speakers of the Homeland and Freedom 
faction pledged to pay more attention to issues related to the 
procedure of Russian troops' withdrawal and the takeover of the 
military property.

  [Text] Riga January 13 TASS -- "The whole package of 
agreements dealing with the troop withdrawal from Latvia may be 
signed as early as in February," ambassador at large Sergey 
Zotov, head of the Russian delegation, told ITAR-TASS. 
  After the end of the talks that lasted two days, Zotov had a 
meeting with Latvian Prime minister Valdis Birkavas. Both sides 
pointed to perceptible progress, achieved on the key issues. A 
complex agreement on the legal status of a Russian anti-missile 
radar station in Skrunde has almost been completed. An 
agreement may be reached even on the most controversial issue -- 
the time- limit of the functioning of the radar station. 
  The Latvian prime minister again offered apologies to the 
Russian side about the incident [as received], that took place 
in Latvia, and said the government was taking measures for 
preventing in the future the actions that could have a negative 
impact on bilateral relations.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 13, BNS -- The leaders of Latvian and 
Russian negotiation teams wrapped up their latest meeting 
Wednesday [12 January] in Riga without setting terms for 
functioning and dismantling of the Russian radar in Skrunda, 
Latvia. 
  The officials, however, agreed on a series of technical 
aspects of the radar's operation, the Latvian Foreign Ministry 
reports. 
  The social protection of Russian military persons in Latvia 
was another topic on the talks' agenda. 
  As reported, Russia proposed to surrender the radar station 
in five years. Latvia has not produced an official answer yet, 
said Russian delegation head Sergey Zotov.

  [Text] Sergey Zotov, the Russian chief negotiator at talks 
with Latvia, thinks that the package of agreements on withdrawal 
of Russian troops from that country may be drafted in February. 
  He told Interfax that the meeting of chief negotiators that 
ended in Riga Wednesday was "productive." 
  That meeting was delayed until Latvia apologized for the 
incident of January 10 when Latvian territorial troops blocked 
numerous buildings belonging to the Russian Army in the Latvian 
capital and held two Russian generals handcuffed for hours 
before releasing them by order of Latvian President Guntis 
Ulmanis. 
  In the words of Zotov, the provocation against the Russian 
troops on the day when the Russian delegation stayed in Riga 
unexpectedly facilitated the Russo-Latvian talks. 
  He said that a broad understanding was reached on the legal 
status of the Russian radar station in the village of Skrunda 
and an agreement on the deadline for its closure seems possible. 
  The Russian delegation which had insisted on keeping the 
station under Russian control for six years agreed to reduce 
that time to five years. The Latvian authorities had wanted the 
station dismantled in three years. 
  Zotov added that Latvian Prime Minister Birkavs had also 
noted the success of the talks when the two men met on January 
12. Birkavs said then that the Latvian government would do its 
best to prevent activities that could have a negative impact on 
the bilateral relations and obstruct the talks between Russia 
and Latvia. 
  The two men agreed that efforts must be redoubled to draft 
the agreements and create a legal basis for normal development 
of the Russo-Latvian relations.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 13, BNS -- Latvian local governments will 
be elected in a direct and proportional ballot for an office of 
three years, under the law on local elections, passed Thursday 
by the Latvian Saeima (parliament). 
  Lawmakers fixed May 22 the date for the elections. Electors 
are all Latvian citizens, which have full 18 years of age on the 
election day. 
  Persons serving their term or waiting for a sentence in 
places of detention are barred from the elections, under the 
law. Persons recognized as irresponsible also should not 
participate in the local elections. 
  A deputy candidate is a Latvian citizen, over 21 year of 
age, 
a permanent resident of the electoral district for at least 
twelve months. Knowledge of the Latvian language is another 
prerequisite for being elected a local deputy. 
  Persons serving their term or waiting for a sentence in 
places of imprisonment, as well as irresponsible persons, are 
barred from being elected to local governments. The ban also 
refers to persons convicted for grave crimes and persons having 
collaborated with foreign reconnaissance services. 
  The Saeima voted down a proposal by the Democratic Party and 
the National Independence Movement to bar double citizens from 
running for the local governments. 
  Lawmakers also rejected a proposal by Homeland and Freedom's 
Janis Straume to bar former functionaries of the Communist Party 
and Komsomol from the elections. 
  There was no separate vote on the participation of 
non-citizens in the elections. This issue may be approached only 
after the adoption of the law on citizenship, the deputies said.

  [Text] The Constitutional Commission ended its session in 
Kiev late on Wednesday [12 January] by rejecting President 
Kravchuk's proposal for a new constitution and a law on power 
sharing to be put for a nationwide referendum. 
  The session involved regional legislators and administrators 
and leaders of political parties and movements. 
  Instead, the Commission approved a proposal by Parliamentary 
Chairman Ivan Plyushch saying that only constitutional clauses 
on power sharing in the center and regions must be brought for 
discussion by parliament due to open on January 20 before these 
are approved in a referendum. 
  Plyushch will lead a working group to draft main 
constitutional provisions to be adopted by a new parliament. 
  The Supreme Soviet did not authorize the Commission to bring 
a new constitution under a referendum, head of the law 
commission Alexander Kotsyuba said. He said the paper must be 
adopted by the next session of parliament, but any controversial 
points be put for a referendum.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Skachko report: "New Constitution Can Be Passed </F>
in Referendum, After Which Local Authorities Will Be 
Transformed"] 
  [Text] A full-scale session of the Constitutional 
Commission attended by the chairmen of oblast soviets, 
representatives of Ukraine's president in oblasts, and leaders 
of political parties, trade unions, and other public 
associations was held yesterday on the premises of the Supreme 
Soviet of Ukraine and chaired by Ukraine President Leonid 
Kravchuk and Parliament Speaker Ivan Plyushch. President Leonid 
Kravchuk, a cochairman of the Constitutional Commission, said in 
his introductory remarks that the conference is supposed to 
explore avenues for a constitutional process in Ukraine because 
it "is a state recognized by the world community, hence it 
should not stand aloof from civilized constitutional norms." 
According to Leonid Kravchuk, the objective of passing a new 
constitution should be such a separation of the functions of 
powers where "each power branch should be authoritative, not 
authoritarian." Leonid Kravchuk outlined his own pattern of 
such a separation of the functions of powers: The president is 
taken out of the system of executive branch to become head of 
state; the parliament remains the sole legislative organ 
carrying out the legislative, founding, and control functions; 
whereas the prime minister, who becomes head of the executive 
branch and forms the government, shall be accountable to 
parliament in all respects. 
  In Leonid Kravchuk's opinion, one of the acceptable ways to 
pass a new constitution is a nationwide referendum which can be 
held simultaneously with the parliamentary elections on 27 March 
-- but to enable this, the mechanics for the final discussion 
and approval of the constitution's text and its passage via 
parliament should be determined. Leonid Kravchuk named as 
another condition for putting the constitution to a referendum 
the elimination of all political inconsistencies in the text of 
the fundamental law that could aggravate the standoff in society. 
  Leonid Kravchuk specified as other options for setting in 
motion a constitutional process in Ukraine the passing of a law 
on power if it proves impossible to put the constitution to a 
referendum. A draft of such a law elaborated by the president's 
team was handed out to those present. 
  Much as had been expected, those who spoke after him 
differed 
in their opinions. Some deputies spoke for passing the 
constitution, some spoke for passing the law on power. 
Gradually one more proposal jelled -- to approve the text of a 
new constitution by a constitutional assembly, an ad hoc body. 
But the final decision on this matter would most probably be 
made by Ukraine's Supreme Soviet, whose ninth session will open 
on 20 January. Advocates of soviet power, who press for a 
purely parliamentary republic, will say what they think about 
the constitution at a conference of the chairmen of oblast 
Soviets of People's Deputies in Kiev on 18 and 19 January. It is 
this conference that its organizers think should come to replace 
the All-Ukraine Congress of Soviets. Parliament Chairman Ivan 
Plyushch, another cochairman of the Constitutional Commission, 
will deliver a report at this conference. 
  According to Leonid Kravchuk, the adoption of a constitution 
in Ukraine should be followed by deciding on a system of local 
power, and a balance should be struck between the powers of the 
center and those of the regions that could please everyone. 
Many speakers warned Leonid Kravchuk and Ivan Plyushch against 
dividing powers between Kiev and oblast centers in such a way 
that would split Ukraine into 25 autonomous republics.

  [Text] Kiev, 12 Jan -- A regular meeting of the Central 
Electoral Commission, which discussed in particular the election 
of Ukraine's people's deputies, approved a formal letter from 
the Central Electoral Commission to district electoral 
commissions. It contained recommendations on preparing and 
holding the elections. 
  Viktor Pohorilo, deputy chief of the Central Electoral 
Commission, noted that all appropriate documents to be prepared 
by district electoral commissions should already be at electoral 
districts by 12 March. The tasks of the district electoral 
commissions include: compiling a list of voters, planning work 
during the preparatory period, holding and summing up the 
results of the elections, and ensuring that legality is 
maintained during the mentioned period. 
  The meeting's participants approved a resolution on how 
Ukrainian citizens who work in Ukraine's diplomatic 
representations and permanent representations attached to 
international organizations or who are abroad on training can 
participate in the elections of Ukrainian people's deputies on 
27 March 1994. In particular, a resolution calls for electoral 
districts abroad to be registered with Artemovskiy electoral 
district No. 1 of Kiev. Deputy Foreign Minister Yuriy Vilych 
said there are about 75,500 voters abroad. He proposed that the 
right to form such electoral commissions remain with the 
leadership of foreign institutions. The Foreign Ministry will 
be given the right to send copies of electoral documents by fax 
or diplomatic post. 
  The meeting examined the state of party registration and of 
electoral blocs which have expressed an intention to nominate 
candidates for participation in the parliamentary elections. 
Speaker Ivan Yemets noted that as of today 23 parties have 
received certificates of registration, the first ones being the 
Ukrainian Republican Party, the Communist Party, the Congress of 
Ukrainian Nationalists in Ukraine, the Liberal and the Christian 
Democratic Party of Ukraine, and the Labor Congress of Ukraine. 
There have been no applications from party blocs to the Central 
Electoral Commission. 
  The meeting heard a speech by Dmytro Tabachnyk, deputy head 
of the State Committee for Publications, on measures to ensure 
the timely preparation of electoral documents (ballot papers, 
posters containing pre-electoral programs, and biographical 
information on parliamentary candidates) for district electoral 
districts using the printing base of Ukraine's State Committee 
for Publications. They discussed the nomination of contenders 
for parliamentary posts and their registration and the question 
of implementing measures concerning the financing and material 
provision of the electoral campaign. It was stated in 
particular that the total estimate for the electoral campaign is 
more than 1 trillion karbovantsi; however, funds are being given 
both according to real need and in accordance with the 
possibilities that at present are not big. The meeting 
discussed the central electoral commission's plan of work for 
1994. [passage indistinct]

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Yermakov, Crimean Supreme Soviet deputy </F>
chairman and candidate for president, by T. Ryabchikova; place 
and date not given: "New People Should Come to Leadership"] 
  [Excerpts] [Ryabchikova] Why did you decide to run for 
president as an independent candidate? 
  [Yermakov] Because I am convinced that only an independent 
candidate stands a good chance of becoming a popular president. 
This would also expand the basis for a prospective program and 
its adjustments, making it genuinely centrist -- I have centrist 
convictions -- and extracting whatever is good from the programs 
of different parties. 
  Besides, if we talk about the need to form a coalition 
government, a president coming from a party will find that to be 
a much more difficult task. Instead of common sense or 
compromise, this president would be steered by the party as to 
what decision to make or who to nominate to this or that post. 
I have long realized the correctness of Stalin's slogan: 
Personnel are fundamental. 
  Finally, it is my deep conviction that a reform-minded 
president must feel the support of all people, and of one party 
only. 
  [Ryabchikova] But the people now seem to be concerned only 
with their dropping standard of living. Could we live at least 
a little bit better? 
  [Yermakov] In my opinion, we have approached a line which is 
very dangerous to cross. People cannot even feed themselves 
properly. Yes, we could live better, but our perestroyka 
transformed everything into some kind of agony. We set out to 
mess up everything in sight without thinking about where we are 
headed. Everyone is to blame for this, especially communists. 
As a rank-and-file Communist Party member, I too am guilty. 
However, I am not ashamed of belonging to the Communist Party, 
which, by the way, I have not abandoned to this very day. 
[passage omitted] 
  One should not again lie to people -- there is no turning 
back. But we all must admit that the process of economic 
stabilization and trying to get out of the crisis by ourselves 
is very much delayed in the Crimea. The peninsula has followed 
the lead of Ukraine's unpredictable policies lacking any sense 
of direction. This has led to extremely bad consequences. 
  [Ryabchikova] What do you think about the idea of a Crimean 
state? 
  [Yermakov] We have declared that the Crimea is a state and 
have written this into the Crimean Constitution. Our statehood, 
however, has to be defended and consolidated. Whether or not 
Kiev wants it, the Crimea has proclaimed itself an independent 
state. Without leaving Ukraine. One should reckon with this 
fact. Or else... everything has its limits, you know. 
  [Ryabchikova] What do you think about the Sevastopol issue? 
  [Yermakov] At present, the city of Sevastopol has the rights 
and responsibilities of an oblast. In fact, it is a little 
oblast. A strange situation has taken shape -- as it is directly 
subordinated to Kiev, the city is and at the same time is not in 
the Crimea. I believe that it should not be separated from the 
Crimea. We should eventually form a common entity. The time has 
come to unite. First of all, this would strengthen the Crimean 
state -- one out of every five Crimean residents lives in that 
city. It also has vast intellectual potential -- its five 
research institutes used to work for the entire Soviet Union -- 
as well as economic potential. Finally, it is the chief Black 
Sea Fleet base. 
  [Ryabchikova] Will this task require calling a referendum, 
do 
you think? 
  [Yermakov] I believe we can do without a referendum. It 
would be enough to conduct a public opinion poll, and based on 
its results, have the Sevastopol City Council adopt a 
resolution. After that, the council along with the Crimean 
Supreme Soviet would request that the Ukrainian Supreme Council 
recognize our unification. This is our inalienable right. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Ryabchikova] How would you assess the activities of the 
Crimean Supreme Soviet? 
  [Yermakov] Unfortunately, our sessions have looked more like 
political rallies, focusing on trifle matters and neglecting 
serious economic problems. No offense meant, but the present 
deputies are not capable of delivering any changes at all. New 
people should come to the Crimean leadership -- those who know 
their way through the dangerous thicket of the market jungle and 
can survive under new conditions. [passage omitted] 
  [Ryabchikova] How should we begin our reforms? 
  [Yermakov] Without a stable monetary system, it is 
impossible 
to boost the economy and introduce the market pricing system. 
To mend the financial system, we should devise a program 
intended to encourage production and stabilize the credit and 
financial system. We must determine the status of the Crimean 
National Bank with the possible transition to payment 
settlements conducted in Russian hard-currency rubles. This 
would immediately balance the supply and demand relations in the 
market and ease strains on society. 
  [Ryabchikova] How is your program different from the 
programs 
of other candidates for Crimean president? 
  [Yermakov] Let me present three main points, the 
implementation of which is completely different. First, we 
stand for a confederation of all former Soviet republics in one 
economic commonwealth based on a common military and political 
doctrine and the Commonwealth Armed Forces, which would consist 
of small national armies. This commonwealth would be free from 
internal borders and customs houses with the common ruble zone 
and energy sources. This would solve the issue of the Black Sea 
Fleet, dual citizenship, raw material supplies, components for 
Crimean enterprises, etc. [passage omitted] 
  [Ryabchikova] How do you think the Black Sea Fleet issue 
could be resolved? 
  [Yermakov] No one doubts that the fleet should not be 
divided. This, however, is a kind of triple problem consisting 
of three elements -- Sevastopol, the Crimea, and the fleet. If 
you settle only one of these elements, leaving the other two 
unaddressed, the problem as a whole will remain unresolved. 
  All those commissions are only games conducted by 
politicians. I have more than enough of participating in them, 
and am convinced that no commission will ever resolve anything. 
It will take a forcible decision on the part of both states: 
"It is going to be this way, and that's that." We should not 
be afraid of this.

  [Text] Kiev -- On 13 January, the Cabinet of Ministers held 
a meeting chaired by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, which 
examined drafts of Ukraine's economic and social development 
plan and state budget for 1994. Reports were delivered by 
Finance Minister Hryhoriy Pyatachenko and First Deputy Economy 
Minister Valentyn Popov. 
  The Economy Ministry worked out two versions of the main 
indices of the plan for 1994 on the basis of different price 
rise indices against 1993, one estimating that prices will rise 
7.4 times and the other 4.45 times. The intention of the 
government and the Ukrainian National Bank to operate a tough 
monetary policy in 1994 was taken into consideration, and the 
indices under the second version were submitted for the Cabinet 
of Ministers' consideration. 
  During the discussion of the plan It was stated that the 
gross domestic produce last year exceeded 100 trillion [as 
received] karbovantsi at current prices. The national income 
generated fell 13 percent against the 1992 level and labor 
productivity 10 percent. The catastrophic decrease in investment 
activity continued. Due to growing inflation, last year's 
volume of investments from the state budget turned out to be 
exhausted almost entirely as early as in the first six months of 
1993. Agricultural producers completed last year in difficult 
conditions, and none of the beet growing regions, in particular, 
fulfilled the state order. 
  The overall progress of denationalization, privatization, 
and 
corporatization of enterprises was held up by the imperfect 
legislation and partial blocking of small-scale privatization by 
local councils, state administrations, and ministries. 
  The meeting determined seven state priorities in the economy 
for 1994, ranging from speeding up the development of 
agro-industrial sectors, to designing and manufacturing weapons 
and military hardware. Bilateral and multilateral trade and 
economic relations between Ukraine and the CIS and Baltic states 
are expected to improve in 1994. It is forecast that the volume 
of foreign credit that will be attracted this year will be $697 
million. In 1994 the policy of further delimiting state and 
enterprise finances will continue. 
  It is planned to hold a news conference when the Cabinet of 
Ministers' meeting ends. UNIAN will have the details in the 
evening bulletin.

  [Text] Kiev -- On 12 January, a conference was held by 
Acting Ukrainian Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, the 
Ukrainian president's regional representatives, heads of the 
relevant ministries and departments, and regional state and 
communal property funds. "In the three months that have passed 
since the Ukrainian president issued the directive on the 
privatization of unfinished construction facilities and their 
land, virtually nothing has been done," stated Yukhym 
Zvyahilskyy. Of the 9,200 unfinished construction facilities 
earmarked for privatization, in the words of State Property Fund 
Chairman Volodymyr Pryadko, only 3 have been sold after three 
months. 
  The following were named by the participants as being among 
the causes suppressing progress on this matter: The 
privatization scheme is bulky; there are no potential buyers or 
investors due to the financial and payment crisis; privatization 
is being carried out in tough conditions and there is nothing to 
gain financially. 
  The opinion of Ukrainian Construction and Architecture 
Minister Yuriy Serbin's is that, in holding up the privatization 
of unfinished construction facilities, "it has turned out that 
the culprits are state administrations that are unwilling to 
give up the facilities they think they need, though lacking 
funds to complete their construction." 
  One of the ways to speed up privatization, Yukhym 
Zvyahilskyy 
believes, is through "personal responsibility of local leaders 
regarding the implementation of presidential directives." He 
added: "Our president is very liberal. One should punish 
administratively rather than trying to talk them round."

<F P=106> [INTERFAX report: "Ukrainian National Bank Issues Credit </F>
Totaling in Excess of One-Half of GDP"] 
  [Text] In 1993, the Ukrainian National Bank issued credits 
worth a total of 57 trillion karbovantsi in accordance with 
decisions by the Supreme Council and cabinet of ministers. 
  This was announced by Viktor Yushchenko, chairman of the 
republic National Bank board, in an interview. According to 
preliminary data the Ukrainian GNP in 1993 is expected to stand 
at 100 trillion karbovantsi. According to V. Yushchenko, 80 
percent of the credits went to the state sector of the economy. 
The government's constant practice last year of printing money 
for credits "made prices soar and brought the state to the brink 
of bankruptcy," the bank board chairman said.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 12, BNS -- 72 members of the Polish 
Sejm have sent a letter to the Polish president, the prime 
minister, the foreign minister and the speaker of the 
parliament, demanding to observe several principles when signing 
an agreement on friendship and cooperation with Lithuania, 
according to press reports Wednesday. 
  The Polish lawmakers said the accord can be signed on 
condition that the predominantly Polish populated Vilnius and 
Salcininkai regions are given autonomy in culture and education; 
land is returned to Polish farmers who live on Lithuanian 
territory; Polish social organizations get back their property 
that was nationalized in 1939-1940; a Polish university is given 
the right to function in Vilnius. 
  The 72 also demand to exclude the historic interpretation of 
the 1920 occupation of Vilnius and its region by Poland from the 
agreement "because it is contradictory" and can result in new 
arguments and may affect the status of Poles in Lithuania. 
  The Polish lawmakers urge their country's leadership not to 
sign any additional declarations "which would create 
possibilities for various interpretations of the agreement and 
may be later directed against the interests of Lithuania's 
Poles." 
  As previously reported, Lithuania agreed not to mention the 
1920 invasion in the main agreement but demands to 
simultaneously sign a separate declaration on the matter. The 
Polish side said it sees no need to sign both document together. 
  The 72 lawmakers also said the previous Polish government 
ignored their recommendations and urge the new administration 
"not to repeat the mistakes that may worsen the situation for 
fellow-countrymen in Lithuania."

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 13, BNS -- The representative of the 
International Monetary Fund in Lithuania, Peter Cornelius, said 
the fund is seriously concerned about the present rate of 
inflation in Lithuania. 
  The problem will reportedly be the central issue at talks 
between the Lithuanian Government, the central bank and an IMF 
mission that is scheduled to come to Vilnius next week. 
  "The fund is quite concerned about inflation. It has gone up 
from less than 1 percent in August to 7.3 percent in October and 
then fell to 6.8 and 6.2 percent in November and December 
respectively. These are inflation figures that we regard as too 
high," Cornelius said. 
  The IMF official admitted, however, that there are some 
extraordinary factors behind these figures, such as the 
reduction of subsidies to energy and the increased import 
tariffs for certain agricultural products. 
  Cornelius said "these factors had an impact on inflation, 
however to a large extent, it has been caused by the monetary 
policy" of the Lithuanian central bank. He said this is 
indicated by the amount of money in circulation. 1 billion lits 
were supposed to be in circulation by the end of 1993, but 1.1 
billion were released. Another 0.1 billion later added to that 
amount in two weeks. 
  "Next week, the IMF mission will thoroughly discuss 
inflation 
and how to get the monetary policy back on track." 
  Cornelius said the central bank's interference with the 
foreign currency market is too strong. On the average, the bank 
buys around 5 million U.S. dollars per week, or around 20-15 
million per month, which is around 80-100 million lits. 
  The IMF representative said the bank's hard currency 
reserves 
totalled 227 million U.S. dollars in late December, but, 
according to the Lithuanian economic policy memorandum, the 
reserve was supposed to be only 110 million. 
  Cornelius denied press reports that the IMF pressingly 
recommends to create a currency board, but added that the system 
has some advantages. "No space is left for politics to interfere 
with the monetary policy." In his opinion, a currency board also 
means "very tight arrangements which do not allow credits to the 
government, enterprises and commercial banks." 
  Currency boards function in Estonia, Hong Kong and 
Argentina. 
Their activities are very successful in all of these countries, 
Cornelius said. 
  "We do not push the idea of a currency board but we are 
ready 
to help in implementing it if the government makes a decision 
and if there is strong support in the parliament.''

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 12, BNS - Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas pursued only one aim by asking for NATO 
membership -- he wanted to take away a trump card from the 
rightist opposition, which sharply criticized the administration 
for delaying an official request, the LIETUVOS RYTAS newspaper 
said in its editorial Wednesday [12 January]. 
  The newspaper said key issues in foreign policy are used 
only 
as a "tool for internal struggle" and a lacks a clear attitude 
toward this or that problem. 
  LIETUVOS RYTAS noted, however, that the international 
community heard Lithuania's name once again after a considerable 
break. "A majority of politicians consider the step premature, 
but they realized that Lithuania's aspiration is sincere -- to 
be safe on a dangerous crossing in Eastern Europe."

<F P=106> [Report by Gennadiy Charodeyev: "Lithuanian Seimas </F>
Chairman: Kaliningrad Does Not Belong to Russia"] 
  [Text] There are growing calls in the Lithuanian 
parliament for the separation of Kaliningrad Oblast from the 
Russian Federation and the formation of a new Baltic republic on 
its territory. 
  In a joint statement, Seimas Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas and 
Deputy Romualdas Ozolas demand the oblast's "demilitarization" 
and "deoccupation," a review of its international status, and 
the creation of a new state, integrated into the structure of 
North Europe. Ozolas stated: "At the Potsdam Conference in 
1945, the victorious countries entrusted the oblast's 
administration to the USSR for a period of only 50 years." 
  The Potsdam Conference decision to transfer what is now 
Kaliningrad Oblast to the Soviet Union was final, irrevocable, 
and indefinite, which unequivocally follows from the text of the 
relevant accord. The fact that territorially the oblast belongs 
to the USSR, and correspondingly to Russia, was subsequently 
enshrined in the Treaty on the Final Settlement Against Germany 
of 12 September 1990 and the Treaty on Good-Neighborliness, 
Partnership, and Cooperation Between the USSR and the FRG of 9 
November 1990. 
  As regards the Russian military presence in the oblast, it 
is 
and will be determined exclusively by Russia's defense needs. 
  Do the Lithuanian deputies realize that their irresponsible 
comments could complicate Lithuanian-Russian relations and that 
they can only play into the hands of the notorious extremist 
forces in Russia?

  [Excerpt] Vilnius, Jan 14, BNS -- Mykolas Burokevicius, 
former leader of the pro-Moscow Lithuanian Communist Party, has 
addressed the Lithuanian government with suggestions "on ways of 
getting the Republic out of a crisis." 
  The communist party has been outlawed in Lithuania and its 
former leader is listed among the 30 believed organizers and 
executors of the failed Soviet coup attempt in 1991. Some of 
them currently hide in Russia, and, according to some sources, 
in the neighboring Belarus. Lithuania has demanded several times 
to extradite the alleged state criminals, but without any 
success so far. 
  In a letter addressed to Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius 
and received on the eve of the third anniversary of the Jan. 13, 
1991 bloodshed, the central committee of the so called 
Lithuanian Communist Party points out "the need to restore the 
political power of the working people." Burokevicius also 
demands to legalize the communist party in Lithuania and to stop 
its legal persecution, the LIETUVOS RYTAS newspaper said.

<F P=106> [Fifth article in a series by Virginijus Gaivenis: "Who </F>
Armed National Defense? (5)"] 
  [Excerpts] Last spring, National Defense Ministry [KAM] 
leaders were preoccupied with the purchase of helicopters. The 
occasion was very convenient -- Lithuania was preparing for the 
visit of Pope John Paul II. To this end, the commanders of the 
Lithuanian Air Force applied to the leaders of the Ministry of 
Transportation with the request of assessing whether a 
helicopter from Palukne airport was suitable for this purpose. 
On 28 April, the helicopter MI-8 MTV offered by the private 
firm "Akvel" was inspected. However, the conclusion about the 
helicopter's suitability for the pope's mission, submitted by A. 
Raklevicius, chief of the Civilian Aviation Department Aircraft 
Section, did not seem to cheer up KAM Air Force Commander Z. 
Vegelevicius. The decision was categorical: "The helicopter 
cannot be used during the pope's visit in Lithuania." As 
representatives of the Transportation Ministry noted, the 
"Akvel" commodity was not new. [passage omitted] This closed 
stock company expected to earn more than $1 million on its 
helicopter. Sensing that such a price was unrealistic, the 
"Akvel" manager blurted out in a private conversation that he 
would sell it to the National Defense Ministry for $700,000 or 
$800,000. The problem was that there was no place to store this 
helicopter in Lithuania, and some of its necessary documentation 
was missing. 
  It seemed that this deal would be buried, because the KAM 
leaders did not apply to experts for help any more. They kept 
silent on any helicopter purchases, intentions to buy them, and 
partners. The fact that the same helicopter offered by "Akvel" 
had already been bought for $1,100,000 was discovered after the 
deal. The price paid for another two helicopters sold by the 
closed stock company "Mingrin" was also revealed then. 
Lithuania had paid from its pocket even $2.4 million for two 
MI-8T helicopters. The latter, which Z. Vegelevicius hopes to 
use for rescue operations, in motorized landing subunits, 
consignment, and reconnaissance, seem to be totally unsuitable 
for such purposes. The two MI-8T are designed to fly KAM 
commanders or some other high-ranking officials rather than for 
combat purposes. [passage omitted] 
  New helicopters MI-8T and MI-8MTV, bought directly from the 
Russian association "Aviaeksport," cost $1.2 and $1.7 million, 
respectively. This Russian enterprise itself delivers aircraft 
to customers, issues the necessary technical documentation, 
provides a full set of spare parts, gives a guarantee for three 
and a half or four years, and assumes the commitment of 
repairing all failures over this period. The aforementioned 
prices apply to all CIS states and the so-called "near abroad" 
countries. Certainly, similar Western helicopters are more 
expensive, however, their quality seems to be ten-times higher. 
The Transportation Ministry experts' commission, which had the 
instruction to inspect and assess the aircraft acquired by the 
KAM, noted that one could buy cheaper and brand-new MI-8T or 
MI-8MTV from Russia. For example, the aircraft plant in Kazan 
can sell helicopters of these types at contract prices ranging 
from $900,000 to $1 million. Prices at other Russian 
enterprises dealing in helicopters are similar. And one more 
thing. The air company "Cheremshanka" from Krasnoyarsk offered 
the same type of helicopter for sale to Lithuania as the one 
bought for $750,000-800,000 as far back as March of 1993. 
However, the KAM leaders were not interested in any other 
partners or offers of cheaper and newer aircraft for some reason. 
  On 10 June 1993, [former] Defense Minister A. Butkevicius 
informed Prime Minister A. Slezevicius that the "KAM had 
received a number of commercial bids to acquire MI-8MTV 
helicopters of different models" for prices ranging from 
$900,000 to $1.6 million. According to A. Butkevicius, one of 
the most acceptable offers had come from the closed stock 
company "Akvel." The helicopter proposed by this company was in 
Lithuania. Moreover, the KAM Air Force had received all 
documentation, the helicopter had undergone technical 
inspection, and there had been several test flights. A. 
Butkevicius reported to the prime minister that the helicopter 
was suitable for operation, and that the Air Force was ready to 
take it. A. Butkevicius requested the additional millions of 
dollars from the prime minister. 
  Did the government show any interest in what helicopter 
offers the KAM had received? Was it really positive before 
assigning millions of dollars that these helicopters would be 
new and with all the necessary parts and documentation? Was it 
not possible to acquire newer aircraft for the same amount of 
money abroad?... The government did nothing of the kind. It 
seems that its leaders trusted Minister A. Butkevicius and his 
relations with people of dubious reputation. 
  The certificate signed by Air Force Commander Z. 
Vegelevicius, which RESPUBLIKA has today, reads that the 
helicopters offered for sale by both "Akvel" and "Mingrin" are 
new. However, it was noticed on 17 September 1993, while 
receiving the first helicopter from the company "Akvel" in the 
Siauliai region, that it lacked dozens or even hundreds of spare 
parts and some equipment. The same applied to the helicopters 
acquired from the "Mingrin" company in November. These aircraft 
were received by ordinary local air base employees -- a 
commission headed by Captain A. Baskevicius. The statements of 
transfer did not indicate the suppliers' names. The fact that 
the helicopters worth millions of dollars were accepted by local 
air base employees is surprising. The entire leadership of the 
Air Force and the Defense Ministry itself avoided the signing of 
any documents at that time. It was such a responsibility and a 
risk! One could understand that the leaders would have to 
account for this deal sooner or later. Law enforcement 
officials, to whom I have talked recently, doubt whether the 
companies "Akvel" and "Mingrin" had acquired those helicopters 
legally. They might have been stolen! No provisional 
certificates of their suitability for use or a document that 
they had been erased from Russia's state air register were 
provided during the transaction. Nor is there any such 
documentation as of today. In addition, the Transportation 
Ministry experts' commission, which was authorized to assess the 
state of the helicopters, the legal basis and the expediency of 
the deal, believes that the KAM price commission behaved 
frivolously by approving the decision of the ministry's 
leadership to waste millions of dollars from the state's 
pocketbook.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 12, BNS -- The Lithuanian president, 
the parliament and the government should "resolutely condemn any 
display of anti-Semitism" in Lithuania, the Jewish community of 
Lithuania said in a written statement that was published by the 
rightist LIETUVOS AIDAS newspaper Wednesday [12 January]. 
  The Jewish community said the Vilnius-based RESPUBLIKA 
newspaper uses every opportunity to slander Jews. The 
statement's authors said the way RESPUBLIKA treats the Jewish 
nation often resembles statements by the leader of the Russian 
liberal democrats, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. 
  No specific examples are indicated in the letter, but the 
community said it is not the first time that shades of 
anti-Semitism appear in the Lithuanian press. 
  RESPUBLIKA is the second biggest newspaper in Lithuania with 
a daily circulation of around 80,000.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Glazovskaya] </F>
  [Text] Ashgabat January 13 TASS -- The last week in 
Turkmenistan marked the beginning of a transition period from 
the past to a future. A national referendum will be held in the 
republic on Saturday, January 15, to decide on the extension of 
President Saparmurad Niyazov's rule by another term in office. 
  This is "the will of the Turkmens", based on the 
incontrovertible logic dictating that the reforms now underway 
and the whole programme "10 years of prosperity" should be 
completed by the president whom the people call "Turvenbashi", 
father of all Turekmens. Time has shown that Turkmenbashi "is a 
capable helmsman" who can steer the state free of shallows and 
reefs, according to the unanimous opinion of all local 
newspapers promoting the idea of prolonging Niyazov's term of 
presidency. 
  It would not be an exaggeration to say that the president 
himself has uttered enough pronouncements about the results of 
his activity which can be used to effectively sell the idea. 
  Speaking at the first meeting of the cabinet of ministers 
this year about the results of his official visit to Teheran, 
the Turkmen leader made clear that he was quite close to 
translating into life his cherished dream -- to lift the veil 
of isolation which is shrouding Iran, a great neighbour country 
with a multi-million population which, according to Niyazov, is 
making a rapid economic headway and is willing to engage in 
international cooperation. 
  The Turkmen leader said that having elevated special 
relationship with "two great neighbours", Iran and Russia, above 
the common, he now has "new guarantees of peaceful and 
progressive development", which most countries of Europe and 
Asia need above all. 
  Niyazov said the same to the commanders of the CIS border 
troops at their meeting in Ashgabat. Thanks to mutual 
benevolence and trust linking Turkmenistan with Russia and Iran 
it becomes possible to solve all problems, including those on 
the borders, he said. According to him, the existing borders 
must be inviolable thus strengthening peace and quiet. 
  Talks between Niyazov and President Hashemi-Rafsanjani of 
Iran showed that the presidents see eye to eye on these and 
other aspects of cooperation. 
  Niyazov's "own political style" was manifested again in his 
telephone conversation with Boris Yeltsin during which both 
presidents confirmed the importance of the latest agreements 
between Russia and Turkmenistan and agreed on the need to hold a 
conference of Caspian states. 
  Yet another argument in favour of Niyazov was remembrance 
day 
held in Turkmenistan on January 12 to commemorate all victims of 
violence in the country's history. By decreeing that this day 
be marked annually, Niyazov added another chip to his extensive 
popularity in the republic.

reaffirmed Pakistan's principled stand that the Kashmir issue 
should be resolved on the basis of the UN resolutions, and India 
should end its brutalities in occupied Kashmir. Addressing a 
joint news conference with his Kazakh counterpart in Almaty, he 
said both India and Pakistan are committed within the framework 
of the UN resolutions and the Simla Agreement to settle the 
Kashmir issue peacefully. He said Kashmiris have been subjected 
to the worst kind of genocide in the occupied territory by 
Indian forces, and India has also blocked all access to the

  [Text] Kyrgyz agriculture is in need of urgent assistance, 
Kyrgyz Prime Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov told parliament on 
Thursday [13 January]. 
  To quote Dzhumagulov, the government has drafted proposals 
for reducing agricultural enterprises' profit tax from 35% to 
15%. It is also planning to purchase agricultural produce at 
market prices. 
  It will also establish a monopoly on the production and sale 
of alcoholic beverages, cigarettes and bread, all of which will 
require changes in the current legislation. 
  Dzhumagulov also noted that in order to increase the budget, 
the ministries and departments' personnel would be reduced by 
20%. This will save the state 190 Mn soms (1 som equals 160 
rubles).

  [Text] Dear compatriots: Our dear motherland, the Republic 
of Tajikistan is on the eve of great political changes. History 
will provide once again an opportunity for the Tajiks, together, 
to contribute to the fate of this ancient nation. It is 
necessary for us to discuss comprehensively the new 
constitution, the main law of Tajikistan, and to put it to a 
nationwide referendum, and on its basis to hold elections for 
the highest bodies of power in the republic. 
  These fateful political activities on which the sovereignty, 
the future of the state, and the present and future life of the 
people depend, have to be carried out until the end of the 
current year. 
  Dear compatriots, our Tajikistan can not only overcome all 
the difficulties posed by the fratricidal war, as a result of 
which it has lost much, but it can preserve political unity, 
territorial integrity and its sovereignty. Today, our dear 
Tajikistan is flourishing, and the republic looks with hope to 
every one of its worthy sons who can contribute to this in this 
ancient land. 
  The process of reconciliation and forgiveness continues in 
long- suffering Tajikistan. Fruitful negotiations with the 
different political forces of the republic have been under way 
for several months. Brother can not have offended brother. We 
all remember you, and we hope that you will return soon and will 
shake hands with your brothers. We hope that you will settle in 
the motherland of your ancestors and at the same time will 
contribute in helping our country flourish. We hope that you, 
our dear compatriots abroad, will take an active part in the 
future political and economic life of Tajikistan. 
  The leadership of Tajikistan is ready to create all the 
conditions required for your return. We are ready to solve your 
economic, social and political problems fraternally, and to find 
decisions which satisfy everyone. We are ready to say welcome 
to all who want to return home and to create favorable 
conditions for them. 
  We are confident that the sense of patriotism will envelop 
you and that you will overcome all obstacles to your return 
home. The Tajiks have one motherland and our task is to 
preserve and to love it. Each home, each family and each town 
are waiting for you. 
  [Signed] Imamali Rakhmanov, head of state of the Republic of 
Tajikistan

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Kuzar and Mikhail Pogorelyy: </F>
"Russian-American Dialogue in the Kremlin"] 
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived in the Russian 
capital for an official state visit on 13 January. After a 
short rest he met with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The 
official ceremony was held in St. Georges' Hall, in the Great 
Kremlin Palace. The heads of the world's two leading states 
exchanged short speeches of welcome and then got down to work 
almost immediately. The basic content of the work was the 
development of ways of bilateral cooperation, those very ways 
thanks to which, Bill Clinton stated in his welcoming remarks, 
"Russia's greatness will be consolidated." 
  For Russians now embroiled in a long, drawn-out, and 
seemingly almost futile fight against poverty, inflation, 
falling output, and never-ending price rises the American 
president's words may sound like a standard polite form of 
words, a sign of respect for the hosts. But when you come down 
to it, the crux of the economic and sociopolitical reforms being 
pursued in the country is precisely to consolidate Russia's 
greatness and restore to it the great power status which 
legitimately belongs to it. After all, the might and power of a 
state rests on the prosperity and confidence in the present and 
future of its citizens and on the stability of its economy and 
the solidity of its international position. 
  Our people have to scale these heights themselves, through 
their own efforts, but they do not have to do it solo! It is 
easier and more reliable to do it with others, and here no small 
role could be played by the close Russian-American cooperation 
which is being built on the principles of partnership, equality, 
and mutual benefit. 
  After the first round of talks, held within a narrow circle, 
Boris Yeltsin expressed satisfaction at the work being 
conducted. Bill Clinton also went for a short walk around the 
Kremlin during the break, wearing a contented expression. Talks 
then resumed, now with expanded delegations including 
representatives of the national security structures and the 
foreign and finance ministries. The composition of the 
negotiating teams suggests the basic topics discussed at the 
presidents' meeting: That is to say, a range of questions 
concerning Russian-American cooperation in the economic sphere 
and in the sphere of international and European security. 
  Despite the fact that at this stage these topics are no 
longer, as it were, at the forefront of Russian-American 
dialogue, they remain important. Moreover they have been given 
a new dimension: Previously discussion was about reducing the 
danger posed to one another, lowering the level of military 
confrontation, and preventing nuclear catastrophe; it is now 
about joint, coordinated efforts to maintain world stability. 
The presidents discussed the problem of ensuring the 
nonproliferation of mass destruction weapons, including nuclear 
weapons. As was remarked in the corridors of the meeting, the 
prospects of securing an optimum resolution to the question of 
nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula were touched on. The 
Yugoslav crisis and the continuation of coordinated, 
multilateral ways of resolving it is another topic to which the 
leaders of the world's two major military powers will doubtless 
have to return more than once. 
  Another major set of questions is connected with the 
Partnership for Peace concept, just adopted by the NATO Council. 
As the Russian Foreign Ministry has announced, Russia is still 
carefully studying the specific provisions of the NATO program, 
but Presiident Yeltsin's fundamental approach was described by 
his press secretary in these terms: We have no reason whatever 
to spurn the initiative; we just need to see to what extent its 
implementation accords with Russia's national interests. 
  President Clinton arrived in Moscow two hours behind his 
original schedule, but this caused no irritation in Moscow. On 
the contrary, the persistence and consistency shown by the 
American leader in his approach to the nuclear disarmament of 
Ukraine is welcomed here. En route to Moscow Bill Clinton had 
held a brief meeting with Leonid Kravchuk at which the terms of 
the agreement on eliminating the 176 strategic missiles and the 
1,500 warheads belonging to them which are now on Ukrainian 
territory were preliminarily agreed. The agreement itself will 
have been signed by the time you read this newspaper, so we will 
not try to guess its provisions. We will only query the 
justification of the request said to have been made by President 
Kravchuk that Russia write off Ukraine's multibillion debt for 
energy sources. Weapons should not be a bargaining counter; 
they are too dangerous, Russian Defense Minister Army General 
Pavel Grachev remarked on the eve of the Moscow summit, 
particularly as the United States is allocating considerable 
respources to Ukraine to carry out the dismantling of nuclear 
armaments and remove them to Russian territory. 
  Apart from the Russian-American-Ukrainian agreement on the 
results of the talks, it is also planned to sign the Moscow 
Declaration and agreements on air traffic, on cooperation in the 
sphere of studying the effect of radiation on people's health 
and the environment... But that takes place on Friday. 
  As far as the second half of Bill Clinton's first day in 
Moscow was concerned, a visit to the Danilov Monastery, where 
the U.S. President was to have held a meeting with Aleksiy II, 
patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, was dropped from the 
itinerary, although it cannot be ruled out that the meeting will 
take place, albeit not at his residence, but in the Moscow 
hospital where the head of the Russian Orthodox Church is 
undergoing treatment.

<F P=106> [Vasiliy Kononenko report: "Russian and U.S. Presidents' </F>
One-on-One Meeting Lasts Longer Than Planned"] 
  [Text] Following the ceremonial meeting between Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton in the 
St. George's Hall of the Great Kremlin Palace in the Kremlin, 
both men moved to the Green Hall to talk one-on-one, but there 
was then an unforeseen deviation from protocol -- U.S. 
journalists first disregarded the "no questions" ban and started 
asking questions. 
  The U.S. President expressed his intention to discuss the 
progress of economic reform in Russia, noting the exceptional 
importance of building a "free economic system" in the country 
which would help Russia to join the world market. 
  A separate item on the agenda for the presidents' meeting is 
the adoption at this week's NATO summit of the "Partnership for 
Peace" program proposed by the Clinton administration. 
  In this context the tripartite agreement on the withdrawal 
of 
nuclear weapons from Ukrainian territory to Russia -- to be 
signed by the three heads of state in Moscow Friday -- is of 
particular importance. 
  President Yeltsin briefly answered the journalists' 
questions 
-- the main aim of the Moscow summit is to ensure tranquillity 
and peace both in Russia and the United States, and to safeguard 
global stability. 
  Immediately after the small-scale talks had ended, Boris 
Yeltsin stated in reply to an INTERFAX correspondent's question 
that he was satisfied with the start of the talks with Bill 
Clinton. Their first conversation had lasted around an hour -- 
20 minutes longer than scheduled in the program. 
  Both presidents then took the traditional walk around the 
Kremlin, viewing the Czar Pushka and the Czar Kolokol and 
visiting the Cathedral of the Assumption. In the biting wind 
and a temperature of minus 10 degrees, the presidents spent no 
more than 10 minutes outside and went for lunch to warm up. 
  After this the talks continued on an enlarged scale. 
  According to V. Kostikov, the Russian president's press 
secretary, the first round of Russian-U.S. talks at the summit 
took place in a relatively calm atmosphere -- neither side tried 
to impose its line on the other. Naturally, at the very 
beginning of the conversation the two presidents touched on the 
subject of cooperation with parliaments. It is not hard to 
imagine that, during this conversation, the U.S. President would 
have been interested in one aspect -- will the Russians finally 
be able to divide up power in a civilized manner. 
  In the afternoon the presidents were joined in the Kremlin 
by 
delegation members, and the discussion turned to very specific 
problems -- humanitarian aid should be replaced by U.S. 
assistance in restructuring the Russian economy.

  [Text] Mikhail Poltoranin, a Duma member from the 
"Russia's Choice" bloc, believes that U.S. President Bill 
Clinton should not meet with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the leader 
of the Liberal Democratic Party. He told journalists on 
Thursday that instead of distinguishing between the notion of 
"Zhirinovskiy himself" and the "phenomenon of Zhirinovskiy," 
they had been giving too much publicity to him. 
  The phenomenon of Zhirinovskiy means discontent with 
official 
policy in Russia today. Zhirinovskiy is disgusting to many 
people, Poltoranin said, but they seem to have chosen the lesser 
of the two evils. And Clinton has been right to say that by 
voting for Zhirinovskiy citizens protested against the policy of 
the authorities. "The balloting showed that people had gotten 
tired of the helpless government, rampant bureaucracy, crime, 
etc. Official policy must be more effective," Poltoranin said.

  [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- Bill Clinton's visit to 
Moscow is "evidence of respect of the United States for our 
great country," Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, deputy to the State Duma, 
told ITAR-TASS. He was for a long time head of the Committee 
for International Affairs at the previous Russian Parliament. 
  "I hope the U.S. President will take advantage of the visit 
to familiarise himself even more deeply with Russian problems. 
I think the U.S. should proceed from the assumption that it is 
necessary to promote the development of Russian democracy, from 
the understanding that any sort of encirclement is not for 
Russia." In the opinion of Ambartsumov, the creation of another 
sanitary cordon around Russia should be out of the question. 
  "We are now living through a difficult period of our 
history. 
However, Russia has seen even worse times, but inevitably was 
brought back to life, like Phoenix from ashes. I hope the U.S. 
Administration thinks the same way," he said.

  [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- Gennadiy Zyuganov, the 
leader of the Russian Communist Party, said the visit of the 
U.S. President "is exclusively important and timely as our 
political situation has changed and it is necessary (for Bill 
Clinton) to get acquainted with it". 
  Zyuganov told a press conference on Thursday that security 
issues should be in the focus of Russian-U.S. talks. 
  "The system of security in Russia is completely disorganised 
and the issue should be discussed in detail during the visit 
before the situation goes out of control completely", he said. 
  Speaking on Duma affairs, Zyuganov said that his party had 
already blocked with the Agrarian party and the Democratic 
Russia. 
  "Doors for others remain open", he stressed and added that 
communists are ready to unite with those factions which share 
three of their basic principles: peace in the country, 
well-being in every family and not only in elite families, the 
understanding that the current situation leads to chaos and 
upheavals. 
  Communists will focus on three tasks in the Duma and the 
major one is to change the course of reforms. The other two 
include the restoration of the state management in the country 
and moral improvement in society.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Ivan Ivanov and Gennadiy </F>
Talalayev] 
  Moscow January 13 TASS -- Russian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Georgiy Mamedov said the current U.S.-Russian summit is the most 
"intense, businesslike and concrete" of all summit meetings he 
had attended. 
  The main leitmotif of the extended talks between the Russian 
and American delegations that took place in the Kremlin on 
Thursday can be phrased like this, Mamedov said -- 
"Russian-American relations have passed the period when 
bilateral relations focused on humanitarian and other assistance 
to Russia at the initial stage of reform." 
  "Now they have moved on to macroeconomic partnership, 
support 
for structural reform in Russia, transformation of relations 
between Russia, its neighbours and large countries of the world, 
and changes in the attitude of international economic agencies 
towards reform in Russia with special attention to be paid to 
its social aspects,+ Mamedov said. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday, Mamedov stressed 
that U.S. President Bill Clinton has proposed a whole package of 
concrete measures to facilitate, in cooperation with other 
countries and international economic organisations, radical 
changes in approaches towards Russia to let it into the world 
markets and promote relations between Russia and former Soviet 
republics. 
  To exemplify his point, Mamedov said that the U.S. has 
persuaded international economic organisations to provide 
financial assistance to the CIS states to buy fuel and energy in 
Russia at higher prices. 
  "There is also a program of support for conversion of the 
defence industry aimed at preventing further increase of 
unemployment. The means released will be used to finance social 
programs, including job placement," he said. 
  During the discussion of the economic situation in Russia 
Clinton said that in his opinion based on analyses provided by 
American institutions Russia will be able to make a breakthrough 
in two years. This may enable it to qualify as the eighth member 
of the G-7 group. "But this is a very complicated problem. The 
American side said it would welcome such changes from the 
political point of view, adding that structural reform in Russia 
should lead to the reorganisation of the G-7 group into a G-8 
one from the economic perspective as well," Mamedov said. 
  During the talks earlier today, Clinton voiced support for 
the idea of Russia's joining the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade. He also said the U.S. would abolish customs duties 
for almost 4,400 types of Russian goods, deputy minister said.

Talalayev] 
  [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- Russian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Georgiy Mamedov regards the present Russian-American 
talks "the most substantive, businesslike and concrete" out of 
all summits in which he participated. 
  Mamedov said in an interview with ITAR-TASS on Friday [14 
January] that the characteristic feature of the present talks 
was that "Russian-American relations came to the end of a period 
when bilateral ties focused, due to circumstances connected with 
the initial stage of Russian reforms, on rendering aid to Russia 
in the humanitarian and other spheres". 
  "We witness now a switch to macroeconomic partnership, 
assistance in structural changes of the Russian economy, in 
restructuring of Russia's relations with close neighbours and 
major countries in the world as well as in a change of the 
attitude of international economic organisations to reforms in 
our country with a greater edge on social programmes," the 
deputy minister noted. 
  According to Mamedov, Clinton "put forth a package of 
specific measures, to be taken by the United States together 
with other countries and international economic organisations, 
to help change radically attitudes to Russia in order to ensure 
a greater foothold for it on world markets and to ease Russia's 
economic relations with former Soviet republics. 
  Mamedov noted that, thanks to U.S. assistance, international 
economic organisations will appropriate funds to countries of 
the Commonwealth of Independent States to purchase energy 
carriers from Russia at higher prices. 
  "There is also a programme for converting the munitions 
industry to prevent greater unemployment. Funds released as a 
result of conversion will be channeled for social programmes, 
including creation of jobs," he continued. 
  "You see, the package provides not for canned meat 
deliveries 
but serious measures which will help restructure the Russian 
economy and simultaneously create 'a social insurance system'." 
  Incidentally, Mamedov added, Clinton, guided by an analysis 
of the situation made by American agencies, said during a 
discussion of the economic situation in Russia that Russia would 
make a powerful breakthrough in two years' time. 
  In this connection, the sides discussed changing the seven 
most industrialised countries into a G-8. "This issue is 
difficult enough," Mamedov admitted. "The American side 
expressed support for such a change in the political resepect. 
It also noted that structural changes in the economy should 
lead to turning the G-7 into a G-8 also economically." 
  ITAR-TASS learnt from a member of the Russian delegation at 
the talks, who refused to be identified, that the U.S. expressed 
support for Russia's admission to GATT during the second round 
of the summit. 
  It was also made known that customs restrictions on nearly 
4,400 types of Russian goods will be lifted on the American 
market. 
  Mamedov noted that the Russian president supported the 
"Partnership for Peace" initiative put forth by Clinton.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature, by Diplomatic </F>
Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy 
Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Excerpts] President Boris Yeltsin has expressed 
satisfaction with the start of a Russian-American summit in 
Moscow. "All is going well," he told an Interfax correspondent 
after the first round of talks on Thursday morning, lasting 20 
minutes longer than scheduled. The delegations met in a narrow 
circle. [passage omitted] 
  The meeting was held in an atmosphere of sincere partnership 
with neither side trying even to imply its specific role, 
Presidential Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov said, commenting on 
the first round of talks as the two sides met in a narrow 
composition this morning. In his words, both sides proceed from 
a premise that peace and stability in Europe and worldwide is 
impossible without Russia and the United States. 
  Elaborating the point, Kostikov said the world was in need 
of 
"a solid new order and great powers." As shown by various 
conflicts including military, there can be no stable peace 
without great powers, he went on to say. Kostikov spoke of a 
widespread beliefs in Russia that it remained a great power 
politically, militarily and culturally. 
  Russia's elections and new constitution, the NATO summit in 
Brussels and the implementation of the Tokyo accords by G-7 
states dominated the agenda of the morning session, he said. 
  President Yeltsin spoke of Russia's turbulent though chaotic 
process of parliamentarism and democracy, but he stressed that 
his country had already joined the club of constitutional 
democracies. Kostikov said the two leaders had exchanged views 
on relations between the legislature and executive in a modern 
democratic society. 
  Clinton briefed the Russian leader on the resolutions 
adopted 
by the NATO summit in Brussels including the U.S. partnership 
for Peace proposal. Kostikov said that since little was known 
of the U.S. proposal in Russia, such information was useful. As 
he described the U.S. initiative as a politically attractive 
declaration rather than a real program, Kostikov said it needed 
more substance. 
  There were no differences on the impossibility of drawing 
new 
demarcation lines in Europe, the spokesman said. 
  For his part, member of the Presidential Council Andrannik 
Migranian said the obscurely-worded concept of the Partnership 
for Peace proposal would for a long time leave Eastern Europe 
and Russia outside the framework of mechanisms for decision 
making on European security. 
  He is opposed to attempts to try to make NATO universal and 
create a European security structure in its place. Instead, 
Migranian calls for a security structure allowing all countries 
to take an equal part in any decision making on European 
security. 
  He also said the question of understanding and recognition 
of 
Russia's special role throughout the former Soviet Union would 
come on the summit agenda. Migranian says that Russia is the 
only factor capable of safeguarding regional peace and security. 
He denied that Russia was out to establish a neo- imperial or 
hegemonistic order in the region, adding that the reason was 
that no single international agency or regional force was able 
to act as guarantor of peace and stability in that area. "I 
think the sooner the western countries agree to provide 
appropriate financial and diplomatic support to Russia, the 
quicker peace and security will come to reign in what used to be 
the Soviet Union," Migranian said. 
  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Grigory Karasin described the 
U.S.- proposed Partnership for Peace initiative as an 
alternative to the mechanical expansion of NATO and a rapid 
acceptance of new members. In his words, Russia will hold a 
comprehensive exchange of views on the Nato's Brussels summit 
with as many countries of Eastern and Western Europe as possible 
to determine optimal ways of promoting cooperation in 
maintaining stability and security in Europe. 
  Karasin said the Russian-American dialogue must not be taken 
as an attempt by the two great powers to strike separate 
accords. The question is one of joint searches for such means 
of European stability that will provide security guarantees to 
all European states regardless of size, geography, economic or 
military potential, he said.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>
  [Text] The dramatic events in Russia in 1993 have 
confirmed that the Clinton-Yeltsin axis can withstand overloads, 
Interfax was told by the former Soviet Foreign Minister, now 
head of the Foreign Policy Association, Aleksandr Bessmertnykh. 
  He believes that the Russian-U.S. summit is of vital 
importance for the future world situation and character of 
Russian-U.S. relations. 
  Bessmertnykh believes that the Moscow dialogue should pass 
on 
equal terms. Bill Clinton will have to give up the temptation 
to act not only as the leader of the United States, but as one 
of the only superpowers whose mission is to rule the world. 
This approach will not work in Russia because in this country 
American aspirations for world leadership are not recognized as 
natural, he said. 
  Bessmertnykh is sure that it is beneficial strategically for 
the United States to look at Russia as a strong and prosperous 
state. Clinton is a leader of the new generation, he said. He 
is able to see the great advantage in U.S. friendship with a 
strong Russia rather than with a weakened giant spreading 
disintegration and instability throughout the world. 
  Bessmertnykh believes that Russia should be satisfied in its 
relations with the United States with the level of partnership. 
The desire to reach the rank of a U.S. ally is inexplicable, he 
said. "Why hurry if the willingness is not shared by the other 
side?" said Bessmertnykh. 
  He emphasized that Russia, as the successor of the former 
Soviet Union, remains a world power with a broad range of 
interests which should be respected by the rest of the world. 
Without the understanding of this on the part of the United 
States, it would be hard to lay a firm foundation under the 
Russian-U.S. relations, which in this case will be destined to 
fluctuate, he said. 
  Unless the two sides reach understanding in this respect, 
any 
efforts by Russia within the Commonwealth of Independent States 
and outside will continue to be interpreted as the manifestation 
of Russian "imperialism." The most delicate solutions - for 
example, NATO-extended membership to include the countries of 
Eastern and Central Europe - will depend on the result of the 
talks on this subject, said Bessmertnykh.

  [Text] President Boris Yeltsin has expressed satisfaction 
with the start of a Russian-American summit in Moscow. "All 
goes well," he told an Interfax correspondent after the first 
round of talks on Thursday morning [13 January], lasting 20 
minutes longer than scheduled. 
  President Bill Clinton arrived in Moscow at about 01:00 on 
Thursday en route from Kiev, where he held two hours of talks 
with Ukrainian leader Leonid Kravchuk during a brief stopover at 
the local airport. 
  In a welcoming speech at the formal ceremony at the Kremlin, 
to which Clinton was ten minutes late, Yeltsin stressed that 
their previous summit in Vancouver laid down the groundwork of 
U.S.- Russian partnership and marked the start of their personal 
friendship. 
  The Russian leader expressed the hope that current summit 
talks would be far-reaching, practical and comprehensive. 
  In a reply speech, Clinton said this summit was taking place 
at an historic moment marking the start of bilateral cooperation 
for the sake of the future of Europe and the world at large. He 
pledged cooperation in creating a new security structure in 
Europe, advocating democratic values and a free economic system 
to help towards the advancement of all countries. 
  Clinton said the two sides, meeting in full strength, would 
discuss concrete economic reforms that would help the Russian 
people reap real benefits from the ongoing transformations. 
  "Russia will continue reforms and there is no question of 
their slow down." This remark, made by Yeltsin when he met with 
Clinton at the head of a larger delegation, became the theme of 
the second hour-long meeting of the two presidents in the 
Kremlin Thursday. 
  Following the end of this round of talks Oleg Lobov, 
secretary of the National Security Council, told Interfax that 
the meeting had demonstrated "America's willingness to provide 
effective support for Russian reform by paying some of its 
social costs." 
  In particular, Clinton assured the Russian president that he 
had succeeded in having Congress appropriate $900 Mn [million] 
for aid to Russia in 1995. 
  Furthermore, numerous funds, especially one supporting small 
business, would be launched. The U.S. is prepared to allocate 
$300 Mn for that purpose. The Clinton Administration is making 
$100 Mn available for a recently established American-Russian 
reconstruction of large factories fund. 
  "Solid support" has also been pledged for Russia's joining 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Duties will be 
lifted from 4,400 Russian products in the U.S. market. The U.S. 
secretary of Commerce will arrive in Russia in March with a team 
of experts to study the possibility of closer contacts between 
U.S. businessmen and Russian state- and privately owned 
businesses, Lobov said. In his words, Clinton asked Yeltsin to 
help in finding partners for U.S. businesses. 
  Russia sees the NATO-approved Partnership for Peace program 
as an important step forward and a serious test of the existing 
partnership between Russia, the U.S. and other NATO states, 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told Interfax. 
  Speaking after a meeting with Acting Foreign Minister of 
Moldova Ion Botnaru, he said the expansion of NATO to include 
new members would be a simplistic solution. Kozyrev did not 
contest the right of other countries to join the alliance but 
"this could lead to the creation of new barriers in Europe if 
implemented." 
  In his words, Russia's voice was heeded by NATO, Eastern and 
Central Europe. This is a case illustrating that a short cut is 
not always optimal, leading nowhere and to wrong decisions, 
Kozyrev said. By contrast, he added, a longer road can lead to 
the right destination. 
  The minister said the Partnership for Peace proposal had 
been 
discussed by Yeltsin and Clinton on Thursday and that both of 
them were satisfied it implied partnership rather than 
membership. 
  Kozyrev spoke of having discussed the problem with U.S. 
secretary of State Warren Christopher earlier in the day. "It is 
too early yet to say how the period of partnership will end," 
the minister said. "One option is to expand NATO by accepting 
new members, including Russia, something we do not rule out," he 
said. Other options are also possible, he said, including the 
creation of broader security systems and the consolidation of 
the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. The minister called for 
efforts to be taken in parallel in all those directions but all 
of these must end up in greater stability and cooperation in 
Europe. 
  For his part, Botnaru spoke of seeing his talks with the 
Russian foreign minister as a step on the road to implementing 
the Partnership for Peace plan. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher, who held discussions while Yeltsin and 
Clinton conferred elsewhere in the Kremlin, finalized four 
documents that have to be signed "at the ministerial level," in 
particular agreements on air traffic, on cooperation in health 
care and biomedical research, on cooperation in research in 
radiation impact on human health and the environment, and a 
memorandum of intent on cooperation in expert control, Galina 
Sidorova, the political adviser of the Russian foreign minister, 
told Interfax. 
  She noted that Kozyrev and Christopher will also make a 
joint 
statement on the Middle East. "The presidents will issue a joint 
Moscow Declaration and make two statements, on human rights and 
on nuclear nonproliferation," she said. 
  According to Sidorova, Kozyrev and Christopher also 
discussed 
the January 14 meeting of the Russian, U.S. and Ukrainian 
presidents. "We are confident that this meeting will culminate 
in signing documents on the nuclear weapons stationed in 
Ukraine. Kozyrev observed, however, that making sure that the 
documents are implemented was even more important," Sidorova 
said. 
  She also told Interfax that Kozyrev and Christopher had a 
thorough talk on the results of the Brussels NATO summit. "The 
Russian foreign minister emphasized that Moscow regarded the 
Partnership for Peace program as an invitation for partnership 
and tangible cooperation with that organization rather than 
staying in its ante-room," Sidorova said. 
  In her words, the most important item in that program for 
Russia was actual cooperation in military exercises and 
adjustment of military doctrines. "It would be premature to say 
now where this will lead to, whether Russia and other East 
European countries will join NATO or NATO and all of us will 
become a broader European security organization," the foreign 
minister's adviser said.

<F P=106> [Pavel Shinkarenko report: "Russia and United States -- </F>
Guarantors of Peace. Russian-U.S. Summit Talks Begin in 
Kremlin"] 
  [Text] The official meeting ceremony between the Russian 
and U.S. presidents was held in the Kremlin's St. George's Hall 
yesterday morning. Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton then moved to 
the Green Hall of the Great Kremlin Palace for their first talks 
with few officials present [v uzkom sostave]. Apart from the 
heads of state, those taking part in the talks were Dmitriy 
Ryurikov, aide to the Russian Federation president, and Strobe 
Talbott, special adviser to the U.S. secretary of state. But 
before this the two presidents nonetheless stated their attitude 
to the coming talks. In the opinion of both of them, the 
dialogue between Russia and the United States will help to 
strengthen peace and tranquillity worldwide and to deepen 
cooperation between our countries. 
  The first round of talks lasted 90 minutes -- 20 minutes 
longer than scheduled. The second round started after a brief 
recess, which Boris Yeltsin used to show the guest the sights of 
the Kremlin. This time the talks were held on an enlarged scale. 
  According to information obtained by ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI from 
both delegations' entourages, the presidents discussed a wide 
range of issues. In particular, they discussed the results of 
the 12 December parliamentary elections in Russia, the progress 
of Russian reform, and problems relating to international 
security and nuclear nonproliferation. In this regard the sides 
stressed the importance of Ukraine's readiness to sign a 
document with Russia and the United States in Moscow 14 January 
on the withdrawal of nuclear warheads from its territory. The 
situation relating to the Russian radar station in Latvia was 
also examined. 
  As Viktor Glukhikh, chairman of the Russian Federation State 
Committee for the Defense Sectors of Industry, put it, there is 
quite a clear trend in relations between our countries away from 
pronounced technological confrontation toward technological 
partnership. There are 108 joint projects covering the widest 
range of basic and applied research, development, production, 
and marketing that are now at various stages of implementation. 
For instance, a memorandum of understanding was recently signed 
with the National Aeronautical and Space Administration, and 
this has the potential to become one of the most promising 
projects. 
  In the afternoon Bill Clinton held a cocktail party for 
representatives of Russian political and business circles. The 
day ended with a select dinner hosted by the Russian Federation 
president.

  [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton outlined three major Russian tasks in a live TV address 
at the major Ostankino TV and Radio Company here today. 
  He said Russian future will much depend on whether the 
country will continue to create a genuine market economy, 
whether Russian citizens will remain adherent to democracy and 
prevent any limits on it and whether Russia will keep to its 
previous role on the international scene or change it. 
  The President expressed his admiration with Russian 
achievements in literature, art, on the battle field and in 
space. He said the Communist system suppressed people and led 
to the cold war. Nevertheless, greatness of the Russian people 
has been always evident and it has a prospect to become powerful 
and prospering on the eve of the 21st century. 
  Despite the fact old human vices -- hatred and racial 
intolerance -- remain, the greatness of peoples in the 21st 
century will be determined not by their ability to impose their 
will on others but by the ability to enable everyone to use all 
possibilities of modern and future world regardless one's race 
and sex, said Clinton. 
  As for Russia and the United States they are bound to make 
their contribution to the consolidation of the spirit of 
cooperation and partnership throughout the world and improvement 
of everyday life of each person, including Russian citizens. 
Clinton stressed Russians themselves are to make their own 
future. 
  In their turn, the U.S. people and President want to be 
partners and sincere friends of Russia, he added. Clinton said 
he ran for U.S. President to make sure changes for the better 
come true. 
  Dwelling on the development of Russian economy, the U.S. 
President agreed transition to market economy was painful and 
difficult, it even disoriented Russian citizens. However, in 
his opinion, Russia would have to pay more for being idle or 
trying to turn back. State-controlled economy does not work in 
the modern world, said Clinton. The old system was doomed to 
failure, and if Russians try to re-introduce it it will fail 
again, assured the President. 
  Speaking of Russian economic problems, Clinton noted high 
inflation rates. In his words, the inflation must be curbed 
down, but it will also claim some price. Another problem is the 
need to create a system of social guarantees for people affected 
by swift economic development. Clinton said the Americans will 
do their best to make the difficulties easier as Russians 
progress on their path. 
  Clinton said a major task of the Russian people is 
consolidation of democracy, since it gives the most reliable 
guarantees of observation and protection of ethnic minorities' 
rights. In order to ensure democracy, everyone should denounce 
intolerance, hatred and antisemitism, said Clinton. 
  The U.S. President focused on human rights and said America 
warns other states against disrespect for rights of ethnic 
Russians. 
  Clinton said he is concerned with some irresponsible 
statements recently made on the Russian political scene and, 
without mentioning Zhirinovskiy's name, added with a smile he is 
not going to return Alaska to Russia. 
  The President expressed the assurance the future measurement 
of Russian greatness will be its ability to be a peace-loving 
neighbour. 
  Speaking of common European problems, Clinton noted this is 
the first time ever Europe is not divided, it is united with 
adherence to democracy, free market economy and the availability 
of common borders. 
  The U.S. state head said he is satisfied with the Russian 
president's decision to participate in the Partnership for Peace 
initiative and work for integration of Europe. He especially 
praised the historic Russian-U.S.-Ukrainian agreement on 
elimination of nuclear arms signed in Moscow. 
  In his opinion, it is sign the future will be considerably 
different from the past. The Russian fate may also influence 
that of America and the United States wants Russia to make 
decisions that will be good for itself. 
  Many people gathered in the Ostankino studio to meet the 
U.S. 
President. The studio was also connected with some Russian 
cities whose residents were welcome to ask questions. 
  Part of the audience, mainly philology students, asked 
questions in good English, which made Clinton wonder whether 
everyone in the studio is from Moscow State University and 
speaks without an accent. 
  Asked what is the difference between the United States and 
Russia, the President said Americans have created their 
democracy for 200 years, and Russia has the world's youngest 
democracy. Still, he said there is plenty of similarities in 
characters of the two peoples. 
  A representative of Stavropol Cossacks asked Clinton in what 
form the United States may participate in settlement of 
conflicts in Russia. The President gave an evasive answer and 
spoke of Yugoslavia where the U.N. peace-makers are trying to 
help avoid victims. 
  The President was asked two questions about the Baltic 
Republics. The first question wondered why America does not want 
to render assistance to states striving for democracy, including 
the Baltic Republics. The other wondered why America helps the 
Baltic states despite their infringement on rights of the 
Russian-speaking minority. 
  Clinton said he wants to render assistance to the Baltic 
states and invite them to the Partnership for Peace together 
with Russia. They will participate in outlining joint military 
plans, military operations and so on. If they decide to join 
NATO, they will have to take certain obligations, safety 
guarantees, said the President. 
  In the opinion of the U.S. President, the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Lithuania testifies to the Russian 
Government's satisfaction with the state of bilateral relations. 
  Problems with Estonia and Latvia remain unsettled, added the 
President and said an international group representing CSCE is 
studying the human rights situation in these states. In the 
words of Clinton, he has warned heads of the Baltic states that 
if violations of rights of the Russian-speaking population are 
revealed, this will tell on the U.S. policy towards those states. 
  Asked about prospects for U.S. economic assistance to 
Russian 
businessmen, the President said he thinks there should be much 
more U.S. investments in Russia. In his words, the U.S. 
secretary of commerce will come to Russia in March with a large 
group of U.S. businessmen to persuade them to invest in Russia. 
  The question of a 13-year-old boy "When did you decide to 
become U.S. President?" came somewhat unexpectedly. Clinton 
said he was sixteen years old when he shook Kennedy's hand and 
approximately at the same time he understood he wants to serve 
for the state. 
  He shook the boy's hand and said maybe one day he will 
become 
Russian president. 
  Speaking to the audience in Nizhnyy Novgorod, the President 
said it would be good for U.S. college and school students to 
come to Russia for studies. If Boris Yeltsin addresses a U.S. 
audience, few U.S. students would be able to talk to him in 
Russian, admitted the U.S. President and again praised language 
abilities of his young Russian interlocutors. 
  A youngster asked the President whether he would play 
saxophone for them, but Clinton answered he had played saxophone 
at Thursday's dinner for President Yeltsin and added he has a 
one-time saxophone play quota for each country.

<F P=106> [Vitaliy Tretyakov article: "Watch the Lineup of Figures. </F>
Bill Clinton Will Review Russian Political Forces -- for the 
Most Part Pro-Presidential"] 
  [Text] U.S. President Clinton has arrived in Moscow. No 
matter how the current state of Russian-U.S. relations and 
especially the role of today's Russia in the world might be 
assessed, this is still a visit by the head of one superpower to 
the capital of another superpower (and not only in the nuclear 
sense): a demonstration, as it were, of mutual respect, 
recognition, and mutual acceptance of the sides' parity. 
  If the Russian president arrives in Washington, then, under 
diplomatic protocol, the heads of all the power branches in the 
United States would be introduced to him. Unfortunately, there 
is a very long way to reciprocity here. 
  President Clinton can hold equal-to-equal talks with 
President Yeltsin. But farther down the line, Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin can do little more than demonstrate to the U.S. 
guest the proposed variants for the composition of his cabinet. 
Things are even worse with the parliament: Both chambers have 
no chairmen, but perhaps the occupant of the White House would 
be pleased to take a look at the symbolic pair of elders: Mr. 
Lukava (Liberal Democratic Party of Russia) and Mr. Chernichenko 
(Russia's Choice) -- a model of Russian political diversity, as 
it were. 
  From the Constitutional Court (the third branch of power) it 
would be possible to present either acting chairman Vitruk, if 
he is still alive, or Luchin, who has called a hunger strike. 
Oh, these Russian bears! Oh, this mysterious Russian soul! 
  It would also be good to show the leaders of the party that 
won the elections. But who would this be? Apparently Mr. 
Gaydar (but for some reason the winners are almost in the 
minority in the State Duma in relation to the losers). Or Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy? Or Mr. Zyuganov (after Boris Yeltsin announced 
the final abolition of communism in Russia this would be 
especially rich). 
  Of course, Yegor Gaydar in not uninteresting to the U.S. 
President in his present (not his Duma) capacity, but how long 
will he continue there? What matters here is not only the will 
of the president but also the will of Gaydar himself. The 
latter does not like to stay too long in a dubious situation. 
Especially since he (unlike Yeltsin) has nowhere to hurry. 
  No doubt, not everything is so sad in the ranks of the 
Moscow 
political nomenklatura. Yuriy Baturin's latest appointment as 
national security adviser -- if this is not a purely 
bureaucratic intrigue (on the part of the president) -- is a 
brilliant move which, I for one, did not expect from Yeltsin. 
In its long-term implications this is the sole accurate act in 
the last several months (since 20 September). 
  The overall picture however is tragicomic (an optimist would 
say "transitional"). There are no other guards while the 
presidential guard is strongly divided: Some are knee-high to a 
grasshopper and some are taller than the David himself who broke 
the neck of the Goliath of communism. 
  Let us be like the Chinese: Carefully look into the 
background of all major events in the course of the visit. How 
the master of ceremonies positions the figures there, so the 
latest (for the next few months) face of the Russian power 
establishment will be. A strong presidential flux is 
unmistakable but what interests us are the other features of the 
face drawn with its hands. [Silnyy prezidentskiy flyus 
ocheviden, no nas interesuyut drugiye cherty litsa, risuyemyye 
rukami etogo flyusa.]

  [Text] Joint Statement by the President of the 
Russian Federation and the President of the United States on 
Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and the Means 
of Their Delivery 
  President Yeltsin and President Clinton, during their 
meeting 
in Moscow on January 14, 1994, agreed that the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction and their missile delivery systems 
represents an acute threat to international security in the 
period following the end of the Cold War. They declared the 
resolve of their countries to cooperate actively and closely 
with each other, and also with other interested states, for the 
purpose of preventing and reducing this threat. 
  The presidents noted that the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons created a serious threat to the security of all states, 
and expressed their intention to take energetic measures aimed 
at prevention of such proliferation. 
  -- Considering the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear 
Weapons as the basis for efforts to ensure the non-proliferation 
of nuclear weapons, they called for its indefinite and 
unconditional extension at conference of its participants in 
1995, and they urged that all states that have not yet done so 
accede to this treaty. 
  -- They expressed their resolve to implement effective 
measures to limit and reduce nuclear weapons. In this 
connection, they advocated the most rapid possible entry into 
force of the START I and START II Treaties. 
  -- They agreed to review jointly appropriate ways to 
strengthen security assurances for the states which have 
renounced the possession of nuclear weapons and comply strictly 
with their non- proliferation obligations. 
  -- They expressed their support for the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] in its efforts to carry out its safeguards 
responsibilities. They also expressed their intention to 
provide assistance to the agency in the safeguards field, 
including through joint efforts of their relevant laboratories 
to improve safeguards. 
  -- They supported the nuclear suppliers group, and agreed 
with the need for effective implementation of the principle of 
full-scope IAEA safeguards as a condition for nuclear exports 
with the need for export controls on dual-use materials and 
technology in the nuclear field. 
  -- They reaffirmed their countries' commitment to the 
conclusion as soon as possible of an international treaty to 
achieve a comprehensive ban on nuclear test explosions and 
welcomed the decision to begin negotiations at the conference on 
disarmament. They declared their firm intention to provide 
political support for the negotiating process, and appealed to 
other states to refrain from carrying out nuclear explosions 
while these talks are being held. 
  -- They noted that an important contribution to the goal of 
non- proliferation of nuclear weapons would be made by a 
verifiable ban on the production of fissile materials for 
nuclear weapons and by the most rapid conclusion of an 
international convention to this effect with the widest possible 
participation of states and on a non-discriminatory basis. 
  -- They agreed to cooperate with each other and also with 
other states to elaborate measures designed to prevent the 
accumulation of excessive stocks of fissile materials and over 
time to reduce such stocks. 
  -- They agreed to establish a joint working group to 
consider: 
  -- including in their voluntary IAEA safeguards offers all 
source and special fissionable materials, excluding only those 
facilities associated with activities having direct national 
security significance; 
  -- steps to ensure the transparency and irreversibility of 
the progress of reduction of nuclear weapons, including the 
possibility of putting a portion of fissionable material under 
IAEA safeguards. Particular attention would be given to 
materials released in the process of nuclear disarmament and 
steps to ensure that these materials would not be used again for 
nuclear weapons. 
  -- The presidents also tasked their experts to study options 
for the long-term disposition of fissile materials, particularly 
of plutonium, taking into account the issues of 
non-proliferation, environmental protection, safety, and 
technical and economic factors. 
  -- They reaffirmed the intention of interested organizations 
of the two countries to complete within a short time a joint 
study of the possibilities of terminating the production of 
weapon-grade plutonium. 
  -- The presidents agreed that reduction of the risk of 
theft or diversion of nuclear materials is a high priority, and 
in this context they noted the usefulness of the September 1993 
agreement to cooperate in improving the system of controls, 
accounting, and physical protection for nuclear materials. They 
attached great significance to further joint work on the 
separate but mutually connected problems of accounting for 
nuclear materials used in the civilian an military fields. 
  Both presidents favored a further increase in the efforts to 
prevent the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons. 
  -- As the heads of the countries that have the world's 
largest stockpiles of chemical weapons, they acknowledged 
particular responsibility for eliminating the threat posed by 
these weapons. In this context, they declare their resolute 
support for the convention on the prohibition of chemical 
weapons, and their intention to promote ratification as rapidly 
as possible and entry into force of the convention not later 
than 1995. 
  -- To promote implementation of a comprehensive ban on 
chemical weapons, they welcomed the conclusion of the 
implementing documents for the Wyoming memorandum of 
understanding and agreed to conclude work in as short a time as 
possible on the implementing documents for the bilateral 
agreement on the destruction of chemical weapons. 
  -- The presidents reaffirmed their desire to facilitate the 
safe, secure, timely, and ecologically sound destruction of 
chemical weapons in the Russian federation and the United 
States. The applauded the joint chemical weapons destruction 
work plan recently concluded between the two countries which 
leads the way for the united states to provide additional 30 
million dollars in assistance to support an analytical chemical 
laboratory in Russia to facilitate chemical weapons destruction. 
The United States also agreed to consider appropriate 
additional measures to support Russia's chemical weapons 
destruction programme. 
  -- They reiterated the importance of strict compliance with 
the convention on the prohibition of biological and toxin 
weapons and of continued implementation of measures in 
accordance with the Russian-American-British statement of 
September 1992, which provides inter alia for the visits of 
facilities and meetings between experts in order to ensure 
confidence in the compliance with the convention. 
  -- They supported convening a special conference of the 
states' parties to the convention on the prohibition of 
biological and toxin weapons in order to consider measures that 
would contribute to transparency and thereby confidence in 
compliance with the convention and its effectiveness. 
  The presidents expressed the determination of their 
countries 
to cooperate with each other in preventing the proliferation of 
missiles capable of carrying weapons of mass destruction. 
  -- They welcomed the conclusion of the bilateral memorandum 
of understanding between the Government of the Russian 
Federation an the Government of the United States of America 
signed in September 1993, noted the importance of this agreement 
for ensuring mutually beneficial cooperation between Russia and 
the U.S. in the field of space exploration, and agreed to 
collaborate closely in order to ensure its full and timely 
implementation. 
  -- The U.S. welcomed Russia's intention to join the Missile 
Technology Control Regime [MTCR] and undertook to cooperate with 
Russia in facilitation of its membership at an early date. The 
Russian Federation and the United States of America are certain 
that further improving the MTCR, including the prudent expansion 
of membership, will help reduce the threat of proliferation of 
missiles and missile techologies in the regional context as well. 
  The presidents of the two countries agreed that, in addition 
to strengthening global norms of non-proliferation and working 
out agreements to this effect, close cooperation is essential in 
order to develop policies on non-proliferation applicable to 
specific regions posing the greatest risk of proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. 
  -- They agreed that nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula 
would represent a grave threat to regional and international 
security, and decided that their countries would consult with 
each other on ways to eliminate this danger. They called upon 
the DPRK to honour fully its obligation under the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its safeguards 
agreement with the IAEA in connection with the treaty, and to 
resolve the problems of safeguards implementation, inter alia, 
through dialogue between IAEA and DPRK. They also urged full and 
speedy implementation of the joint declaration of the ROK and 
the DPRK on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 
  -- They support efforts to reach agreement on the 
establishment of a multi-lateral forum to consider measures in 
the field of arms control in non-proliferation that could 
strengthen security in South Asia. They call on India and 
Pakistan to join in the negotiation of and become original 
signatories to the treaty banning nuclear weapons test 
explosions and the proposed convention to ban production of 
fissile materials for nuclear explosives and to refrain from 
deploying ballistic missiles capable of delivering weapons of 
mass destruction to each other's territories. 
  -- They agreed that Russia and the U.s., as co-chairs in the 
Middle East peace process, would actively promote progress in 
the activity of the working group for arms control and regional 
security in the Middle East, striving for speedy implementation 
of confidence-building measures and working toward turning the 
Middle East into a region free of weapons of mass destruction, 
where conventional forces would not exceed reasonable defense 
needs. 
  -- They firmly supported the efforts of the UN special 
commission and the IAEA to put into operation a long-term 
monitoring system of the military potential of Iraq, and called 
upon Iraq to comply with all UN Security Council resolutions.

  [Text] [no datelined as received] -- The president of the 
Russian Federation and the President of the United States of 
America share the view that full guarantees of respect for basic 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of all persons are 
indispensable for the maintenance of good relations between 
countries and the strengthening of stability and security in the 
world. They also share the view that the development of a state 
founded on the rule of law with an independent, impartial and 
effective legal system is essential for the respect of human 
rights. 
  They agree that aggressive nationalism and political 
extremism are the main threat to peace and democracy today. 
They therefore reaffirm their resolve to focus attention, 
through joint efforts where possible, on violations of human 
rights wherever they may occur and to continue to work for the 
elimination of discrimination, intolerance, racial and national 
prejudices, xenophobia and anti- semitism. Adhering to the 
principle of intolerance of any nationalistic or religious 
extremism, they reiterate their commitment to take all necessary 
measures for the effective guarantee of the rights of all 
citizens, regardless of their nationality or religion. 
  They will take coordinated steps to increase the 
effectiveness of the activities of international organizations 
and mechanisms in order to improve human rights practices 
everywhere and to guarantee their full respect. They reaffirm 
the determination of CSCE foreign ministers in Rome that better 
use of CSCE human dimension instruments, including CSCE 
missions, should be made to promote open and diverse media. 
They reiterate their commitment to safeguard freedom of 
expression as a basic human right and underscore its importance 
for a free and open society. 
  The United States reaffirms its support for democratic 
reforms in Russia. Among these reforms are the establishment of 
an independent judiciary as a fundamental part of a state based 
on the rule of law, the strengthening of other foundations of a 
civil society, and full realization of personal rights and 
liberties. The presidents agree that the continued success of 
the democratic transformations in Russia is of great importance 
for the promotion of the principles of democracy and human 
rights all over the world and for the maintenance of 
international stability and security.

<F P=106> ["Text of the Russian-U.S. Moscow Declaration"] </F>
  [Text] [no dateline as received] The President of the 
Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin and the President of the United 
States, William J. Clinton, having met together in Moscow from 
January 12- 15, 1994, reaffirmed the fundamental importance of 
Russian-U.S. cooperation based upon the Charter of 
Russian-American Partnership and Friendship, the Vancouver 
Declaration, and existing treaties and agreements. They noted 
with satisfaction that the relationship between Russia and the 
United States has entered a new stage of mature strategic 
partnership based on equality, mutual advantage, and recognition 
of each other's national interests. From this perspective, they 
reviewed the full range of bilateral and international issues. 
  The two presidents had an extensive discussion of security 
issues, including arms reduction and non-proliferation regimes. 
They agreed upon the need to strengthen those regimes and to 
create, together with other interested states, a new mechanism 
to enhance transparency and responsibility in the transfer of 
conventional arms and sensitive dual use technologies. They 
also strongly supported completion of negotiations on a 
comprehensive test ban at the earliest possible time. The two 
presidents reiterated their support for a cutoff of production 
of fissile materials for weapons and considered new measures to 
strengthen strategic stability. 
  Based on ongoing discussions of strategic disengagement 
measures between the Ministries of Defense of the two countries, 
the presidents announced that they would direct the detargeting 
of strategic nuclear missiles under their respective commands so 
that by not later than May 30, 1994 those missiles will not be 
targeted. Thus, for the first time in nearly half a century -- 
virtually since the dawn of the nuclear age -- Russia and United 
States will not operate nuclear forces, day-to-day, in a manner 
that presumes they are adversaries. 
  Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton expressed 
satisfaction with the accelerating development of a wide range 
of economic, scientific and technological relationships between 
Russia and the United States. They also reaffirmed their strong 
support for the rapid growth of bilateral trade and investment 
as a special priority. In their view, the Gore-Chernomyrdin 
Commission has become a dynamic and effective mechanism for 
coordination and expansion of Russian-U.S. cooperation. A key 
expression of this relationship is the Russian-U.S. joint 
cooperation in space, especially their partnership, with other 
interested parties, in the construction of a space station. 
  The two presidents reaffirmed their readiness to move 
forward 
on the path of openness and mutual trust in Russian-U.S. 
relations and to create favorable conditions for the 
comprehensive development of political, commercial, humanitarian 
and people-to-people contacts between the two countries. In 
this connection, a mutual interest in enlarging consular 
presence on each other's territory was expressed. In particular, 
the American side intends to open a consulate general in 
Yekaterinburg in February 1994. 
  With the approval by the U.S. Congress of NAFTA [North 
American Free Trade Agreement] and the successful completion of 
the Uruguay round of global trade negotiations, President 
Yeltsin and President Clinton welcomed the accelerating progress 
toward creation of an open and prosperous world economy and 
trading system. President Yeltsin informed President Clinton of 
recent steps among the member-states of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States towards increased economic coordination and 
cooperation. The two presidents agreed that such initiatives, 
pursued in an open and voluntary manner consistent with GATT 
rules and procedures, should be conducive to the rapid inclusion 
of all the participating states into the global economy. 
  In this context, President Yeltsin and President Clinton 
exchanged views on the economic strategies of their respective 
governments. President Yeltsin described the economic situation 
in Russia. He affirmed the irreversibility of Russia's 
transition to a market economy and his intention to further 
promote reforms and to address social needs associated with this 
transition. President Clinton stressed his strong support for 
Russian reform and suggested that social issues could be a new 
and promising area for cooperation. 
  President Yeltsin and President Clinton noted with 
satisfaction that the end of the Cold War has brought continuous 
progress toward overcoming the division of the European 
continent and opened the way for broad cooperation among 
European states on a new agenda of urgent tasks, with priority 
being given to preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and protection 
of human rights and the rights of national and other minorities. 
In this connection, the two presidents welcomed the decisions 
of the CSCE foreign ministers' meeting in Rome, which they 
consider to be an important step in making the CSCE a key 
mechanism of international cooperation in Europe. 
  Proceeding from the conviction that new divisions of Europe 
must be avoided, President Yeltsin and President Clinton agreed 
upon the need to create a new European security order that is 
inclusive, non-discriminatory and focused on practical political 
and security cooperation. The two presidents agreed that the 
concept of the Partnership for Peace adopted at the Brussels 
meeting of the NATO member states is an important element of an 
emerging new European security architecture. President Yeltsin 
informed President Clinton of Russia's intention to participate 
actively in the partnership for peace and to conclude 
substantive agreements opening the way for broad and intensive 
cooperation between Russia and NATO as a partner. Taking into 
account Russia's international role, President Clinton welcomed 
the prospect of Russia's active participation in the Partnership 
for Peace. 
  The two presidents condemned aggressive nationalism, 
violations of human rights, and religious intolerance of any 
kind, including anti-Semitism. They expressed serious concern 
about the existence and potential for intensification of 
conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and in a number of the new 
independent states of the former Soviet Union. President 
Yeltsin apprised President Clinton of the peacekeeping efforts 
undertaken by Russia on the territory of the former USSR. The 
two presidents are determined to intensify the coordination of 
their efforts, within the framework of the United Nations and 
the CSCE, to promote rapid and peaceful resolution of conflicts 
on conditions that correspond to generally accepted standards of 
international law, including respect for the independence, 
sovereignty, and existing borders of the new independent states 
of the former Soviet Union. 
  The two presidents reaffirmed the support of Russia and the 
United States for the United Nations. They will act with other 
countries to strengthen the potential of the UN to support and 
establish peace and to prevent conflicts. The two sides will 
work out practical activities among themselves and other 
countries to improve preparation for participation in UN 
peacekeeping operations. In connection with the upcoming 50th 
anniversary of the UN, Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin 
consider it important to convene at the appropriate time a 
meeting of the heads of state and government of the members of 
the UN Security Council for a review of the work established for 
the UN at the January 1992 Security Council summit and an 
examination of tasks for the future. 
  President Yeltsin and President Clinton are convinced that 
the United States and Russia will continue to consolidate their 
partnership and together promote global stability, peace, and 
prosperity.

  [Text] Joint Statement on Issues of Export Controls 
and Policy in the Area of Transfers of Conventional Weapons and 
Dual-Use Technologies 
  The secretary of state of the United States of America and 
the minister of foreign affairs of the Russian Federation 
underscored the staunch commitment of their countries to efforts 
to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to 
enhance global and regional stability. In keeping with the 
spirit of the new strategic partnership between the United 
States and Russia the ministers have agreed on development of 
wide-ranging cooperation in the field of export control. 
Moreover, they have agreed that all necessary steps in this 
field be taken expeditiously, and have established a 
senior-level working group for this purpose, as well as to 
initiate bilateral cooperation in the areas specified in a 
memorandum of intent signed this day in Moscow. 
  The ministers expressed satisfaction with steps taken since 
the last meeting of the President of the United States and the 
president of the Russian Federation to eliminate the vestiges of 
the Cold War, such as the Coordinating Committee for 
Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), which according to the 
understanding reached by COCOM members will be terminated not 
later than March 31, 1994. They also welcomed the decision to 
establish a new multilateral regime for enhancing responsibility 
and transparency in the transfers of armaments and sensitive 
dual-use technologies. This new arrangement would not be 
directed against any state or group of states, and would prevent 
the acquisition of such items for military end uses if the 
behavior of a state is or becomes a cause for serious concern as 
determined by the participants of the new multilateral regime. 
  The United States and Russia, as leading exporters of 
conventional weapons, military equipment and dual-use 
technologies, are convinced that additional measures are needed 
on an international basis to increase responsibility, 
transparency and, were appropriate, restraint in this area. 
They expressed their willingness to work with other countries 
in bringing about the early establishment of a new multilateral 
regime in order to achieve these objectives, which would 
supplement existing non-proliferation regimes, in particular 
through arrangements to exchange information for the purpose of 
meaningful consultations.

<F P=106> [Article by Yelena Ovcharenko and Leonid Timofeyev under the </F>
general heading "U.S. President Has Entered Our House With His 
Own Personal Dream": "Moscow: Around the Samovar at 
`Spaso-House'"] 
  [Text] For us simple mortals it is a cinch to invite 
around some guests, but take the example of the meeting with 
prominent Russians invited to the [ambassadorial] residence 
"Spaso-House" on the occasion of the U.S. President's visit, 
which is already the subject of criticism and remarks. The 
American side acted in the following manner: Of the 170 guests, 
100 are well-known for their progovernment views and 70 are 
reformers of a whole range of persuasions. The press was also 
invited. They decided not to invite Zhirinovskiy. But such an 
authority as former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, when 
questioned by American television about this, gave a reply to 
the effect that the organization of this event already seems to 
him to have failed. Instead of this pompous political display, 
30-40 genuine Russian political leaders should have been 
invited, and should have had a concrete, serious, informal 
discussion with him, meeting behind closed doors away from the 
press. Incidentally, Zhirinovskiy should have been invited. So 
that he would be one among many. And deprived of the political 
exclusivity which was created for him after the elections. But 
as we learned from American sources, the advisers who prepared 
the guest list became fearful lest Vladimir Volfovich might put 
the President in an embarrassing position at this informal 
shindig with his latest utterance. 
  In general protocol is a delicate matter. It looks as if we 
have the makings of a major incident. The President's 
spur-of-the-moment stop-off at Borospil airport [Kiev] has in 
the space of one and a half days become an event of state 
significance, in the wake of which an agreement between Russia 
and Ukraine will be signed. Its aim is to eliminate Ukraine's 
nuclear weapons in exchange for a whole series of political and 
economic gains. For example, according to THE WASHINGTON POST, 
Russia will decline payment from this republic for its enormous 
debt for energy resources. Ukraine will also receive nuclear 
fuel and economic and technical assistance. We should remind 
the reader that Kiev is receiving $5 billion from across the 
ocean for the nuclear payload of each missile warhead which has 
already been shipped to Russia. 
  So, what lies in store for Ukraine? What concessions are we 
talking about? The Treaty On the Principles for Eliminating 
Nuclear Weapons Situated on Ukrainian Territory will be the 
title of the document which, it is expected, Presidents Yeltsin, 
Clinton, and Kravchuk will sign in Moscow 14 January. What is 
more Ukraine will sign it as an interested party which earlier 
announced its voluntary renunciation of the possession of this 
type of weaponry. Russia and the United States will in this 
instance appear as nuclear powers and guarantors of Ukraine's 
security. 
  The document concerns a very sensitive area. However, in 
spite of reports in the U.S. press, Ukrainian diplomats working 
in Moscow expressed their doubts to us that the treaty will 
contain any secret articles. It is not the president's business 
to keep secret that in which everybody has an interest and which 
one would hardly succeed in suppressing. 
  They also categorically rejected the above news that Ukraine 
had "exchanged" the agreement to eliminate nuclear weapons for a 
cancellation of their debts to Russia for energy sources 
supplied by it. That is, the draft treaty is about nuclear 
weapons, conditions for their elimination, and guarantees of 
security, and is not about debts for oil or gas. 
  True, one ticklish factor does remain in connection with 
the Ukrainian opposition's demand to subject the tripartite 
document to a process of ratification. The Law on the President 
grants Leonid Kravchuk powers to put his signature to such a 
treaty. According to representatives of the Ukrainian Embassy 
in Moscow, it will become apparent what legal mechanisms to put 
into effect in the future. 
  ...One week before Clinton's departure for Europe, the 
journal NEWSWEEK writes, passersby in the vicinity of the White 
House ran the risk of being picked up and taken to the President 
in person so that they could give him their opinion of U.S. 
foreign policy. It was through this quip that our colleagues 
conveyed a picture of the frantic consultations which were order 
of the day on the eve of his trip. As well as the President's 
notorious habit of canvassing dozens of people's opinions -- 
from cleaners to experts -- before making decisions. 
  Congress and the American public opinion had been in a stew 
for a long time over Kiev's intractability concerning nuclear 
weapons. Even if Clinton's visit to Moscow is not crowned with 
outstanding success, the signing of the tripartite agreement may 
be credited not just to the U.S. President, but also to his 
colleagues from Moscow and Kiev.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- Documents on problems on 
nuclear arms in Ukraine are expected to be signed at a 
tripartite summit of Russia, the United States and Ukraine on 
Friday. A mechanism of the implementation of Ukraine's decision 
on the withdrawal of nuclear warheads from its territory will 
also be worked out, ITAR-TASS learned from informed sources on 
Thursday. 
  This applies to 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles and 
some 1,500 warheads. Weapons that, in opinion of the U.S. side, 
are the most dangerous ones, SS-24 and SS-19 missiles, are to be 
dismantled within three years under an agreement that is to be 
signed. 
  The signing of the documents on dismantling the entire 
Ukrainian nuclear potential is to end a prolonged debate on the 
destiny of the Soviet nuclear arsenal that remained in the 
Ukrainian territory after the Soviet Union's dissolution in 
1991. This will mean keeping to the schedule outlined in the 
1992 Lisbon protocols. Under the protocols two other former 
Union republics with nuclear arms -- Kazakhstan and Belarus -- 
supported the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and agreed to 
destroy nuclear arms, turning them over to Russia for the 
purpose. 
  But the Ukrainian parliament, ratifying the Strategic Arms 
Limitation Treaty on November 18, 1993, made a number of 
reservations: on the control of strategic nuclear forces in the 
Ukrainian territory, on the elimination of extra carriers and 
charges, on control over disassembly and destruction of nuclear 
charges. Ukraine made its non-nuclear status and stage-by-stage 
elimination of nuclear weapons conditional upon guarantees of 
its national security by nuclear states. 
  Several rounds of tripartite talks of Russia, Ukraine and 
the 
United States were held last month. The foreign press notes 
they were held until President Clinton said in Brussels on 
Monday that an agreement on problems of nuclear arms in Ukraine 
became a reality. 
  The compensation and splitting between Ukraine and Russia of 
proceeds from the sale of enriched uranium was among central 
problems at the talks. The United States pledged itself to form 
a semi-state corporation which will buy uranium contained in 
warheads for nuclear power plants to make up for the 
expenditures for nuclear arms destruction. In the runup to the 
President's visit to Moscow, the U.S. Congress earmarked a sum 
of 175 million dollars as a step to promote the destruction of 
nuclear warheads in Ukraine, to compensate for the dismantling 
of nuclear arms. The U.S. Congress also endorses economic aid 
to Ukraine amounting to 155 million dollars. 
  Participants in the tripartite negotiations believe the 
signing of documents on problems of nuclear arms in Ukraine must 
ease tensions that have complicated relations between the United 
States, Russia and Ukraine of late. New agreements in Moscow 
will promote the establishment of peace and tranquility in the 
world and a greater cooperation of the three countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk by </F>
correspondent Natalya Chernyshova at the Moscow airport on 13 
January; from the "Novosti" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Chernyshova] Leonid Makarovich, would you say a 
few words about your talks with Clinton? 
  [Kravchuk] They were good, normal talks. We discussed 
several problems. The first one, naturally, was the nuclear 
problem; the second, the economic problem, our relations with 
the United States. We discussed questions connected with 
tomorrow's signing of documents by the presidents of Russia, the 
United States, and Ukraine. I think this is a great 
breakthrough, a political and economic breakthrough. The main 
thing is that we have succeeded in resolving a very complicated 
global problem -- the nuclear one -- in a civilized way, in the 
interests of our states, Russia, Ukraine, and the United States, 
and, of course, of the entire world. 
  [Chernyshova] What compromises have been made by Ukraine and 
by Russia? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, we made compromises, naturally. We have 
reached an agreement that is no longer a secret: compensation 
for Ukraine's tactical nuclear weapons, and, of course, the 
agreements that have already been signed on strategic nuclear 
weapons, normal economic relations, normal economic ties, the 
exclusion of any pressure, territorial integrity of states, 
mutual respect, relations of partnership. Frankly, this is 
nothing new. It is all generally accepted in the world. Our 
only problem is that so far we have find it very difficult to 
get accustomed to this. 
  [Chernyshova] Will the Ukrainian parliament ratify this 
agreement? 
  [Kravchuk] I think it will ratify the agreement because it 
is a good solution for everyone, including us, because it 
increases our people's awareness that we are being treated with 
respect as a country, as a state, and not as some, well, 
secondary appendage. That is the first point. Second, 
everything is being resolved fairly, therefore the parliament 
must ratify the agreement. I am convinced of this. 
  [Chernyshova] And tomorrow you will sign the agreement? 
  [Kravchuk] Absolutely.

  [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine declared upon 
his arrival in Moscow that the documents on nuclear disarmament 
to be signed by the leaders of the U.S., Russia, and Ukraine on 
Friday were the fruit of natural compromises. 
  Ukraine gets compensation for battlefield nuclear weapons. 
"We have also secured smooth economic relations, confirmed 
territorial integrity, respect for each other, and partnership," 
Kravchuk said. "That, he added, can hardly be called a 
compromise because such relations are taken for granted as 
absolutely normal ties, only we have been getting used to them 
with difficulty so far." 
  Talking to an Interfax correspondent, Kravchuk voiced 
confidence that parliament would ratify the accords as they 
offer a good solution to this very complex world problem. 
  "The people and parliament of Ukraine will see that their 
republic is treated with respect as a country rather than a 
second rate nation and that all issues are being settled fairly." 
  The president voiced readiness to risk his political career. 
"The career of a politician cannot compare with the global 
problem we are solving. I do not put my career above this 
global issue. I will do all I can so that Ukraine does not 
stand in the way of nuclear disarmament," Kravchuk stressed. 
  He reported that Russia and Ukraine were working out a 
friendship treaty that would rest on a new basis and awareness 
of responsibility to people and history. "We will remove the 
acute issues dividing us. We will resolve the nuclear problem 
tomorrow. And then we will settle the problem of the Black Sea 
Fleet," the Ukrainian president said.

  [Text] Documents with regard to the Russian-U.S. talks are 
to be signed in the Kremlin today. Our observer Yuliy Semenov 
has the details and is on the phone: 
  [Semenov] Hello again from the Kremlin. The Kremlin is 
magnificent, as ever, but both presidents and their assistants 
have other things on their minds, working hard since early 
morning. 
  Several minutes ago the trilateral meeting smoothly turned 
into a bilateral one. Documents on the results of the meeting 
between the three presidents connected with the problem of 
Ukraine's nuclear disarmament have been signed: a joint 
statement, which has the status of a treaty, an appendix to it, 
and letters that the delegations exchanged, setting out their 
specific views. 
  The essence of what has taken place is that the agreement 
that has been reached reflects a balance of interests. Each 
side had to make some concessions, but the final result is a 
victory for all--a victory for the principle of the 
non-proliferation of nuclear arms. 
  Two hundred nuclear warheads will be transported from 
Ukraine 
into Russia over the next 10 months, and the withdrawal 
timetable will be agreed on. It is not being made public 
because it is a working schedule. 
  The United States and Russia extend security guarantees to 
Ukraine. Great Britain, as is known, has already joined in 
this. Russia will compensate Ukraine in an equitable and honest 
way--as Boris Yeltsin put it--for its nuclear fuel, and a 
proportion of Ukraine's financial debt to Russia is wiped off as 
part of this compensation. 
  For its part, the United States will substantially assist 
Russia and Ukraine in the implementation of the accords, and 
this naturally includes material assistance. All the 
participants in the meeting have appraised these results as a 
breakthrough. 
  Replying to journalists' questions following the signing of 
the documents--a brief meeting took place--Yeltsin said that 
this was a historic day for the nuclear security of the whole 
world and for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and was 
an important step in world disarmament. 
  Bill Clinton's view is that by agreeing to sign these 
documents and to resolve problems, Ukraine has made its position 
in the world weightier, having strengthened the security of the 
United States, Russia, Ukraine, and world security as a whole. 
Clinton said that the potential for nuclear espionage, 
terrorism, and blackmail has been diminished. 
  This will make it possible both for Russia and Ukraine to 
raise their living standards for their citizens. His view is 
that Ukrainian prestige will grow in the world; more people and 
states will wish to cooperate with Ukraine, and Ukraine will be 
altogether better off as a result. 
  Finally, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said that his 
view was that this step would help strengthen everyone's 
security and the security of Ukraine in particular, because it 
was precisely in the U.S. and Russian guarantees--their nuclear 
umbrella--that Ukraine saw its security. If we are friends with 
Ukraine [as heard] and Russia, nothing will threaten us. 
  Currently, as I am speaking, the Russian-American dialogue 
has been resumed--a plenary session of both delegations with all 
officials present is taking place in the Yekaterinskiy Hall in 
the Kremlin. 
  A whole package of U.S.-Russian documents will subsequently 
be signed, to be followed by a news conference, during which we 
will be given complete information.

  [Excerpts] Moscow, 14 Jan -- After the signing of the 
trilateral documents on the elimination of nuclear weapons on 
the territory of Ukraine, Boris Yeltsin, Bill Clinton, and 
Leonid Kravchuk replied to journalists' questions. 
  "We have not thought nor do we think that Ukraine ever posed 
any danger to Russia, but this is a historic day for the 
international community. The documents on Ukraine's elimination 
of nuclear weapons and adherence to the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the three Presidents signed, are 
another step in the nuclear disarmament of the world," Boris 
Yeltsin said, replying to a question by an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent. [passage omitted] 
  Leonid Kravchuk told journalists that starting today, 
"Ukraine's security has been substantially enhanced, because by 
signing these documents along with the Presidents of Russia and 
the United States it has obtained from each confirmation of its 
security."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Ivan Ivanov and Gennadiy </F>
Talalayev] 
  [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- The agreements concluded 
between Presidents Boris Yeltsin, Bill Clinton and Leonid 
Kravchuk on the withdrawal of nuclear warheads from Ukrainian 
territory "will tell most positively on the Russian national 
security", because Russia thereby gets a nuclear-free neighbour 
state, ITAR-TASS was told today at the Kremlin by Secretary of 
the Russian Security Council Oleg Lobov. 
  He confirmed that Russia and the United States "will give 
Ukraine the broadest possible guarantees of security as a 
nuclear-free power". 
  "The main thing is that Ukraine has confirmed its 
nuclear-free power status and has agreed to hand over its 
nuclear warheads to the Russian side," Lobov stressed, noting, 
that "Russia will have to pay compensation, of course, by 
delivering nuclear fuel to Ukrainian atomic power plants". 
  The secretary of the Russian Security Council described 
Ukraine's decision concerning nuclear weapons as "a very good 
step towards normalising relations with Russia", which must be 
developed on the basis of "partnership, trust, joint 
participation in the organisation of a European security system". 
  Asked whether Ukraine could again sharply raise the question 
of the Black Sea Navy after having relinquished its nuclear 
weapons to Russia, Lobov said: "I think the two problems should 
not be linked. The existing Black Sea Navy problem must be 
examined separately. I think that there should be no 
'bargaining' over it". 
  Lobov admitted that Russia would have to make some financial 
spendings linked with the transfer of Ukrainian warheads to its 
territory and with deliveries of low-enriched uranium to 
Ukraine. Nevertheless, he noted that "Russia is getting in 
return highly enriched weapon Uranium and, in addition, it will 
no longer have to spend money on the servicing of warhead 
storages".

<F P=106> [Konstantin Eggert report: "Name of New Russian Ambassador </F>
to United States Already Known"] 
  [Text] We have learned from informed diplomatic sources 
that the appointment of the new Russian ambassador in Washington 
has been virtually decided. The new ambassador will be 
65-year-old Yuliy Vorontsov, currently Russia's permanent 
representative at the United Nations. 
  It is expected that the presidential edict confirming him in 
the position will be signed soon after Bill Clinton's Moscow 
visit ends. The candidate for the new head of mission at the 
United Nations has not yet been decided, but people on Smolensk 
Square are convinced that it will be a career diplomat. Andrey 
Kolosovskiy, who has been mentioned as the possible number two 
contender for the embassy, will not be going to New York, since 
he will soon be getting another assignment. The 
minister-counsellor position will be taken by Vladimir 
Chkhikvishvili, deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's North 
America Department. 
  As is well known, another ambassadorial post -- London -- is 
also vacant. The conviction is being expressed in diplomatic 
circles that Britain should no longer be seen as a posting for 
honorable exile (L. Zamyatin, B. Pankin). "The posting to the 
British capital should go to a professional diplomat who is 
dynamic and self-confident," a well-informed Foreign Ministry 
source noted in this connection. "Candidates are being selected 
at the ministry." 
  But, as our contact put it, it is still very likely that 
London will go to a political appointee -- perhaps somebody 
losing a ministerial portfolio.

  [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- The Russo-American 
contract on the sale of enriched uranium was signed at the 
Russian Ministry of Atomic Power on Friday [14 January]. 
Russian President Yeltsin welcomed the agreement at a news 
conference in Moscow on the same day. "I am very satisfied that 
an agreement on uranium was signed", he said. 
  Under the contract to operate for 20 years, Russia plans to 
turn over to the United States 500 metric tonnes of weapon-grade 
uranium worth around 12 billion dollars. It will be extracted 
from 20 thousand units of nuclear ammunition during its 
elimination. 
  The uranium will be reprocessed to serve as fuel for nuclear 
power plants. 
  Russian Minister of Atomic Power Viktor Mikhaylov said on 
Friday that this agreement means a step to real nuclear 
disarmament. He said the contract was concluded under an 
intergovernmental agreement between Russia and the United States 
signed in February last. 
  The need for joint work with the United States in this area 
stems from the fact that the United States controls 50 per cent 
of the world market of uranium, while Russia's share in this 
market is only five to six per cent. "The contract will bring to 
Russia a source of foreign cerrency, while the industry of the 
U.S. can draw on Russian technologies", the minister believes. 
  There was a separate discussion during the preparation for 
the signing of the contract on the sharing of profits from the 
contract between Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. The 
minister said it is for experts to establish if there is profit 
from the elimination of tactical nuclear weapons. Vast funds 
are so far spent on the dismantling of nuclear weapons and 
utilisation of nuclear charges. 
  Experts believe the document signed on Friday has a 
commercial chararter in addition to political. William Timbers, 
the head of the U.S. side at the signing, acting manager of the 
U.S. enrichment corporation, said it is the first time in 
history that disarmament can bring profit to states.

<F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS correspondent Irina Bolshakova: </F>
"U.S.-Russian Trade Relations Have Much Room for Improvement" 
-- ITAR-TASS headline] 
  [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- The U.S.-Russian trade 
turnover is not very substantial so far, according to Russian 
Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov. The 
United States accounts for only about two per cent in Russia's 
foreign trade. Thus, the trade turnover with the U.S. totalled 
2,426 mln dollars in the period from January-November 1993, 
including 1,007,200 thousand dollars in export and 1.418,800 
thousand in import. 
  The structure of the bilateral trade turnover inherited by 
Russia from the former Soviet Union is based on raw materials, 
Davydov noted. The bulk of Russia's export to the United States 
is made up by precious metals and articles made of them, rare 
earth and non-ferrous metals, oil products, chemicals and 
agricultural produce. The U.S. import to Russia is largely 
represented by foodstuffs and agricultural produce (wheat, 
maize, oats, butter, soy-beans), machinery, equipment and 
transport vehicles. 
  The Russian minister believes the legal and agreement 
framework for U.S.-Russian trade and economic relations set up 
in 1992-1993, the most-favoured-nation trade regime, the 
extension to Russia of the U.S. general system of preferences, 
as well as the new programmes for economic assistance to Russia 
create real preconditions for a greater volume and a broader 
range of U.S.- Russian trade. 
  However, despite of the recent progress in trade and 
economic 
relations between the two countries, they still bear the stamp 
of the Cold War, Davydov stressed. Thus, the development of 
U.S.-Russian trade is hampered by the Jackson-Vanick Amendment 
and Cocom lists, barriers on U.S. export of hi-tech products, 
tough quantitative restrictions on imports. Furthermore, the 
solution of some commercial and financial problems is linked 
with various political conditions and the progress of market 
reforms. Recently, the United States has considerably limited 
the possibilities of Russian uranium products and imposed an 
anti-dumping duty on ferrosilicium. According to the minister, 
anti-dumping investigation is likely to be launched with respect 
to Russian supplies of potassium chloride, aluminium and steel, 
which may undermine the positions of Russian exporters on the 
American market. 
  With all this in view, Davydov thinks it necessary to work 
out a mechanism of bilateral consultations to prevent possible 
conflicts over the trade regime. According to the minister, 
Russia should also press for lifting the existing non-tariff 
restrictions on Russian exports to the United States and for 
using partnership relations with the U.S. to ensure Russia's 
full-fledged participation in GATT and the international export 
control system. Large-scale cooperation in the investment sphere 
is to promote U.S.- Russian trade and economic relations as 
well, the Russian minister pointed out.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. of Economic Sciences Anatoliy Aleksandrovich </F>
Porokhovskiy, deputy director of Russian Academy of Sciences 
United States and Canada Institute, under "Russia-United States: 
Dialogue About Partnership" rubric: "In Conditions of Sharp 
Competition"] 
  [Text] Two laws have been adopted while Bill Clinton has 
been in power -- the so-called freedom support bill and the 
friendship with Russia bill. The first removed a number of 
problems and granted Russia most-favored-nation status in trade 
with the United States. The second virtually entirely removed 
all tariffs and duties on trade with Russia -- which is 
considerably more than most favored nation terms. 
  It has to be admitted that the United States is doing 
everything to promote rapprochement with Russia. The Clinton 
administration has taken particularly significant steps in the 
sphere of attracting private U.S. business to Russia. The U.S. 
Department of Commerce has allocated special funds to open 17 
U.S. business trade centers in Russia. The largest of these are 
already functioning in Moscow. The rest will be scattered 
throughout the territory. 
  It should be pointed out that, as one more step, the state 
has allocated more than $2 billion to guarantee credits and 
investments by U.S. companies in the Russian economy. Along 
with the 17 important agreements signed earlier between the 
United States and Russia, which make it possible to avoid double 
taxation and create guarantees for state credits, all this 
ensures a favorable atmosphere for U.S. private business, which 
has virtually gotten a surety from its government. 
  America is motivated by not just political but also economic 
interests. In recent years the entire Western world has been 
experiencing a grave economic slump, and the United States 
itself has a big deficit in trade with certain countries, 
including Japan and China. This greatly affects the 
competitiveness of U.S. companies, which are feverishly seeking 
additional markets. The huge Russian market is of extraordinary 
interest to them. It is also a known fact that each additional 
$1 billion in U.S. exports creates 20,000 new jobs. When 
approximately 7 percent of Americans are unemployed, this factor 
is also of by no means minor significance. 
  I would also point out another fact: In endeavoring to push 
forward onto the Russian market, America takes into account the 
fact of increased competition in the world economy. Under 
conditions of the growing influence of the European Union and 
other international economic organizations in which the United 
States retains a significant role, Russia, which is on the 
Eurasian continent, is a very convenient base for strengthening 
the positions of U.S. private business in this region. 
Therefore it turns out that from an economic viewpoint America 
has an interest in ensuring that Russia is a reliable economic 
partner -- only not a weak one but a reliable and strong one. 
This is pure economic reality. 
  At the same time America is concerned, above all, for its 
own 
economic security. It understands that the solution to internal 
U.S. problems lies outside its borders -- in the world economy, 
where such an important partner as Russia has now emerged. At 
the same time most of the U.S. Administration's efforts are 
aimed at present at creating the infrastructure to strengthen 
business ties between the two countries. Private U.S. business 
is still somewhat cautious about developing them. Even so, U.S. 
companies are in first place in terms of the number of joint 
ventures in Russia. U.S. firms are also ahead of their 
competitors in terms of the number of offices in Russia. 
  These are the "pioneers" of U.S. business, who might 
develop business at any moment but are refraining at present, 
waiting to see how events develop in Russia in the future. 
  If we look at Russian reality from this viewpoint, we should 
acknowledge that things here are far from favorable at present. 
This is, of course, connected with the fact that the elimination 
of the foreign trade monopoly has brought out onto the world 
market a large number of new agents who do not coordinate their 
actions and who have their own quotas for sales of a particular 
product. Competition has arisen among Russian contracting 
parties proper in such important export sectors as oil, gas, 
mineral fertilizers, and a number of others where Russia could 
earn currency. 
  On the one hand, the elimination of the foreign trade 
monopoly is a positive phenomenon, but because of organizational 
mistakes, we have to a considerable extent obtained a negative 
result instead of a positive effect. On the whole, the 
country's currency revenues have proved not as substantial as 
was intended. A considerable part of the proceeds from trade 
ended up abroad, and our exporters were not interested in 
transferring money to the Russian economy. Only now, since the 
president signed the edict on currency-export controls, has the 
situation begun to change for the better. 
  I would particularly like to emphasize that we should not 
have any illusions about trade and economic ties between Russia 
and the United States. If U.S. companies do not gain at least 
some advantage, they will not come here. If the U.S. state does 
not gain at least some economic advantage, it will not invest in 
the Russian economy. It is pointless to hope that money will be 
spent just because Russia needs help. The market system can 
work on the basis of political priorities only thanks to budget 
funds, which in the United States are under the rigid control of 
Congress. 
  Account must also be taken of the fact that, whenever the 
United States allocates funds to support a particular country, 
it supports, above all, its own companies which will help this 
country. That is, up to 80 percent of the total sum will be 
realized through U.S. private business, and just 20 percent of 
the aid will directly reach projects on our country's territory.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "What the Future Has in Store for </F>
Us.... U.S. Analysts on Russia's Future"] 
  [Text] A book entitled Russia in the Year 2010 and 
What It Means for the World has been published in the 
United States. THE NEW YORK TIMES reviewed the book and 
described it as the "methodology of informed forecasting," in 
which "the social, political, and economic forces operating in 
Russia are separated from the myths, then these forces are 
formed into various structures and unexpected changes made in 
them." 
  The book, which, according to THE NEW YORK TIMES, provides 
an 
"invaluable service" for anyone "trying to predict where Russia 
is going," was the by-product of research by its authors, Daniel 
Joergen and Professor Thane Gustafson of Georgetown University. 
  The book will disappoint people looking for an unequivocal 
answer to the question posed in the title, namely what Russia 
will be like in the year 2010. Instead the reader is offered 
four scenarios for the possible development of events. The 
so-called "miracle" scenario takes him to 17 May 2010 when, in 
the trade center built for the Moscow stock exchange, the head 
of a major Russian bank announces the purchase of the seventh 
largest U.S. bank. Thus symbolically summing up the successful 
implementation of market reforms. 
  The "Russian bear" scenario makes a diametrically opposite 
forecast: A military parade is under way in Moscow's Red Square 
to mark the eighth anniversary of a successful military coup. 
The Kremlin towers are adorned with two-headed eagles, slogans 
proclaim the glory of the supreme commander in chief and the 
valiant Russian Army. 
  According to the other two scenarios, Russia either 
gradually 
breaks up in the grip of political and economic paralysis or 
continues to vegetate under the leadership of an authoritarian 
group of officials, representatives of the military-industrial 
complex, state enterprise directors, and the Army command. 
  Strictly speaking, all these scenarios only summarize the 
very extensive range of predictions and hypotheses current in 
the United States. 
  The book's authors draw several conclusions which, in their 
opinion, will remain true however events develop. Thus they 
believe that, whatever happens, Russia will inevitably have 
increasingly close ties with the world economy. They also 
predict that toward the year 2010 Russian agriculture will not 
under any circumstances be able to find its feet even if it 
passes entirely into private hands, since the countryside is too 
ravaged and lacking in manpower. The authors' main conclusion 
throws down a challenge to those who are banking on the West in 
the formation of the new Russia. They write confidently: 
"Ultimately Russia will of course write its own history by 
itself...."

  [Text] Powerful superheavy trucks, with which Russians are 
more familiar from foreign movies, will shortly appear on our 
national highways. There are plans to produce them at a joint 
enteprise in Moscow set up by ZiL and the U.S. firm Packard. 
  The agreements on starting this production are largely 
ready, 
your ITAR-TASS correspondent was told by ZiL First Deputy 
General Director Valeriy Saykin. "ZiL-Packard" is the proposed 
name of the powerful truck capable of carrying over 20 tonnes of 
freight. The vehicle plus the freight and trailer weighs over 
40 tonnes altogether. 
  The first step toward this cooperation was the creation of 
the "Novotrak" joint enterprise, which sells diesel-engined ZiL 
trucks and ships some types of heavy truck from the United 
States; the second was the signing of the documents of 
association creating the "Novodizel" Joint Enterprise, which 
will manufacture more sophisticated fuel equipment for ZiL 
trucks. In the opinion of U.S. specialists, using this 
equipment will help make annual fuel savings of around $200 
million. 
  "In addition to joint production of heavy trucks," Valeriy 
Saykin concluded, "we intend to organize production of diesel 
engines in conjunction with the Caterpillar firm, first using 
foreign spare parts and subsequently switching to producing all 
the necessary components in Russia."

<F P=106> [Vladimir Rogachev article under "Russia-United States: </F>
Dialogue About Partnership" rubric: "Common Home in Space"] 
  [Text] The question of Russian-U.S. cooperation in 
creating a joint space station is the focus of attention for 
specialists and experts in both countries. At the same time the 
attitude of various representatives of the U.S. side to Russia's 
participation in this project can hardly be called unequivocal. 
Viewpoints differ very greatly and cover virtually the entire 
range of opinions. Whereas NASA Director Daniel Goldin 
maintains that neither the United States nor Russia can create 
such a station independently and that Russia's involvement 
enables the United States to save $2 billion and to speed up the 
station's commissioning by two years, in the opinion of James 
Oberg, an expert on Soviet and Russian space programs, the 
United States' "ingenuous and too-rapid advance toward this 
starry union could sow seeds which will lead ultimately to 
disappointment and failure." 
  It must undoubtedly be admitted that the dominant viewpoint 
supports the development of Russian-U.S. cooperation in space 
orbits. As Senator Barbara Mikulski (Democrat from Maryland) 
declared, in particular, when appearing on a CBS-TV program, 
"without the support of the Russians and without a saving in 
money and time, efforts to create a space station will prove 
risky." "The Russians," she pointed out, "are valuable because 
they will share their tremendous experience in launching and 
docking -- spheres in which they are superior." But at the same 
time she voiced the fear that "a Russian-U.S. joint space 
venture will result in some U.S. jobs being exported to Russia." 
  At the same time there is a view according to which the 
agreement on an orbital station has to a very significant degree 
resulted from political and certainly not scientific motives. 
Thus the WALL STREET JOURNAL maintained that "Washington's 
decision to conclude an agreement with the Russians to implement 
a project to create an orbital station is the basis of an 
ambitious and risky strategy aimed at consolidating Russia's 
orientation toward reforms after the U.S. and Western pattern by 
establishing ties with its military, scientific, and industrial 
elite." In the newspaper's opinion, the agreement represented 
"at the same time both a reward for Russia's aerospace industry 
for its agreement not to sell secret rocket technology to India 
and an opportunity for the United States to involve Russian 
scientists in efforts to further limit the spread of dangerous 
weapons." 
  Mindful of the December election results in Russia, the 
article's authors warn that "for President Clinton...the new 
strategy raises the stakes" and, given a certain combination of 
circumstances, "the United States could lose the orbital 
station, which has already cost the U.S. taxpayers $10 billion." 
In the opinion of Nicholas Johnson, a specialist on the Russian 
space industry and a high-ranking staffer of the scientific 
department of the Keymen [name as transliterated] Sciences 
Corporation, which is involved in research and development at 
Colorado Springs (Colorado), "if we think about the worst option 
for the development of events and assume that in two or three 
years' time Russia will completely stop abiding by common sense, 
we will have to start all over again." 
  At the same time some members of the U.S. Congress are 
concerned about "the possibility of hidden expenditure, which 
will build up as the project is carried out -- expenditure 
connected, for example, with the need to repair the Baykonur 
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, which is increasingly going to ruin." 
  In summing up this brief review of the U.S. side's views it 
may be worth dwelling on statements by James Oberg cited in THE 
WASHINGTON TIMES: "Benjamin Franklin once gave an excellent 
prescription for a successful marriage: `Before the betrothal 
keep your eyes wide open, but afterward keep them half-closed.'"

Launch Program Going Till the Year 2000"] 
  [Text] Anatoliy Kiselev, general director of the 
Khrunichev State Space Scientific-Production Center and member 
of the board of directors of the Russian-U.S. 
"Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energiya" joint venture, said that thanks 
to their cooperation "in the past 12 months we managed to sign 
nine commercial contracts for launching Western companies' 
satellites with the Russian "Proton" system. The total amount 
of the contracts exceeds $600 million." According to the 
general director, the cooperation with the partners, who have 
taken over the marketing of Russia's most powerful rocket in 
service and also the licensing of Western firms' space vehicles, 
enabled the center "fully to book the program of space launches 
till the year 2000 and to look to the future with optimism."

  [Text] Russia sees the NATO-approved Partnership for Peace 
program as an important step forward and a serious test of the 
existing partnership between Russia, the U.S. and other NATO 
states, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told Interfax. 
  Speaking after a meeting with Acting Foreign Minister of 
Moldova Ion Botnaru, he said the expansion of NATO to include 
new members would be a simplistic solution. Kozyrev did not 
contest the right of other countries to join the alliance but 
"this could lead to the creation of new barriers in Europe if 
implemented." 
  In his words, Russia's voice was heeded by NATO, Eastern and 
Central Europe. This is a case illustrating that a short cut is 
not always optimal, leading nowhere and to wrong decisions, 
Kozyrev said. By contrast, he added, a longer road can lead to 
the right destination. 
  The minister said the Partnership for Peace proposal had 
been 
discussed by Yeltsin and Clinton on Thursday and that both of 
them were satisfied it implied partnership rather than 
membership. 
  Kozyrev spoke of having discussed the problem with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher earlier in the day. "It 
is too early yet to say how the period of partnership will end," 
the minister said. "One option is to expand NATO by accepting 
new members, including Russia, something we do not rule out," he 
said. Other options are also possible, he said, including the 
creation of broader security systems and the consolidation of 
the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. The minister called for 
efforts to be taken in parallel in all those directions but all 
of these must end up in greater stability and cooperation in 
Europe. 
  For his part, Botnaru spoke of seeing his talks with the 
Russian foreign minister as a step on the road to implementing 
the Partnership for Peace plan.

<F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev: "Partnership </F>
for a United Democratic Europe"] 
  [Text] There is no shortage of -- on the surface -- 
effective "unidirectional" solutions to the problems of Europe's 
security. Two myths, which their supporters consider to be 
axioms of current European policy, lie at the heart of these 
recommendations. First, there is the theory that there is a 
"security vacuum" or "gray zone" in Central Europe, which will 
almost inevitably become the sphere of Russian expansion. 
Second, there is the theory that refers to "Russia's return to 
a nationalist, imperialist policy" as a result of the recent 
parliamentary elections. 
  Combining the two hypotheses leads to this conclusion: NATO 
must protect the countries of Central Europe from the inexorable 
pressure from the East. 
  Accepting the theory of a "security vacuum" means rejecting 
the very essence of the pan-European process expressed in the 
Paris Charter and the unity of the democratic nations of Europe. 
This would be the most major crack in the supporting pillars of 
European policy, which, despite apparently insurmountable 
difficulties, has brought about the reunification of Germany and 
led to the collapse of the 20th century's totalitarian monsters. 
  If I were to make a prediction about the worst case scenario 
-- the restoration of Russian imperialism -- it would not come 
from the invasion of the West by "Russian tanks," but from a 
repetition of the Yugoslav drama in the former USSR. The 
repercussions of this would be tens of millions of refugees and 
upheaval in the large industrial complexes, and the threat of 
tactical nuclear weapons deployment. What could NATO do in this 
situation to protect its eastern members? Several Chernobyls 
would be enough to finish off the whole of Europe -- with 
interest. The "guard on the Bug" would be incapable of 
protecting anyone. 
  However, this worst case scenario could be provoked by the 
hasty expansion of NATO. This presents the extremists in Russia 
with a most convincing argument in favor of restoring the 
Russian empire, because "it is necessary to defend ourselves" 
against "pressure from the West." The strategy of the "worst 
case scenario" is dangerous, therefore, because it contains the 
detonator of a prophecy that may then fulfill itself. 
<H5>  The Russian Factor in European Security </H5>
  Anxiety about a new "threat from the East" can be dispelled 
-- first and foremost -- by a partnership strategy with 
democratic Russia, which has embarked upon the policy of 
establishing a law- governed state and a market economy. 
  Russia's presidential foreign policy has already made 
evident 
its orientation toward implementing the country's nation-state 
interests by means of partnership and not by confrontation with 
the surrounding world. This orientation is enshrined in the 
democratic constitution. Russia does not have territorial 
claims against any state, including the countries of Central and 
Eastern Europe. Russia's new military doctrine orients its armed 
forces exclusively toward defending the country and its allies 
and toward peacekeeping operations in harmony with Russia's 
international commitments. 
  As far as the results of the parliamentary elections are 
concerned, I am convinced that there is no fertile ground for 
pro- fascist tendencies in Russia, because Russia placed more 
sacrifices than any other country on the altar of victory over 
fascism. The voters cast their ballots not in favor of a "march 
toward the West," but in favor of a "leap into warmer waters," 
that is, not for the violent restoration of the Soviet Union and 
the socialist camp. They voted against the ambitions and 
arrogance of some reformers, against their inability to explain 
the aims of reform to the people in simple, ordinary language, 
and against the shortcomings in social security for the 
population and in the struggle with crime. Russian democrats 
have already begun to draw unavoidable conclusions from the 
sobering lesson of the parliamentary elections. However, this 
will definitely not take the form of toying with right-wing 
extremism. We condemn any overt or covert form of extremism, 
aggressive nationalism, and fascism. 
  The West should now draw some conclusions from this and 
modify the tone and accent of its dialogue with Russia. The 
pedantic language in it is inappropriate. It is hard to 
associate partnership with the submission of proposals that we 
have to either adopt in full or reject completely, without the 
right to amend them to suit our interests. 
  Right now Russia needs to feel greater support from outside 
for the reform line. A precise and detailed strategy for 
cooperation between Russia and its democratic allies in the West 
has to be drawn up. We need new strategic concepts and the 
mechanisms to implement them, mechanisms that would emphatically 
express the current level of progress in our relations. And 
most important of all -- it is essential to move forward on the 
promises Russia received in Tokyo at the meeting with the 
leading representatives of the seven most industrially advanced 
nations (G-7) toward multilateral cooperation, that is, to the 
fulfillment of these promises. 
<H5>  Partnership on Behalf of a United Europe </H5>
  In designing the new European architecture, it is important 
to take into consideration the following criteria: 
  A balanced step-by-step approach toward transforming 
Europe's 
security. It is essential to eliminate "shock diplomacy" 
methods and the policy of faits accomplis. The Russian side 
favors broad consultations with all the countries involved. 
  The openness of regional organizations and institutions as a 
guarantee for their successful adaptation to the current 
European situation. Russia has no right to dictate who can and 
cannot join NATO. We have the right, however, to assume that 
the North Atlantic Alliance will take into consideration the 
specific features of the inevitable long-term transition period 
and -- since we are talking about the longer-term perspective -- 
that it will confirm the position contained in its documents 
declaring NATO to be an organization open to the entry of all 
democratic states in the Euro- Atlantic region. It is 
impossible to discount the possibility a priori that Russia will 
also apply for entry into NATO in the future. The primary task 
is to guarantee an effective and equal partnership during the 
period of mutual transformation and adaptation. 
  Providing guarantees for an equal standard of security for 
each European state. The creation of "first and second class 
security," "gray zones," "special spheres of influence," 
"isolated regions," and "cordons sanitaire" in Europe is 
unacceptable. 
  The preservation of the current principles for European 
security, which are based on treaties. 
  The removal of territorial claims within the framework of 
interstate relations in Europe. 
  The main aims of the strategy that we propose, for 
partnership in the political sphere in the area of security, are 
as follows: 
  First: Forging North Atlantic cooperation. Transforming the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) into a 
general regional political organization and the North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council (NACC) into an independent organization for 
military-political cooperation, but closely associated with the 
CSCE. It is necessary to orient them toward coordinating the 
efforts of NATO, the Western European Union, and the 
Commonwealth of Independent States in the spheres of improving 
international security and the peace-forming and sincere 
protection of ethnic rights and of linguistic and other 
minorities in Europe. I consider the acceptance of the 
declaration on resistance to aggressive nationalism during the 
CSCE conference in Rome to be a major step in this direction. 
  It is essential to understand NACC not an "anteroom" to NATO 
in accordance with the formula "NATO plus," but -- as was 
intended at the time of its establishment -- as an independent 
instrument for equal partnership among former adversaries in the 
interest of building a new Europe. The proposals to expand the 
NACC by including the European neutral states and to create a 
compact NACC secretariat are arousing great interest. It is 
necessary to orient the Council toward developing cooperation in 
the spheres of security, military planning, conversion, and 
peace missions. 
  Second: Creating a system of mutually interlinked security 
guarantees for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The 
more these states are interlinked, the stronger their relations 
will be. Perhaps it would be worthwhile to consider -- for 
example -- creating a kind of "safety net" on the basis of 
mutually supplementary agreements on security between Germany 
and Poland and Poland and Russia. Analogous agreements could 
also be proposed to the other states in the region. 
  Three: I welcome the proposals put forward by my German 
colleague, K. Kinkel, concerning the signing of an agreement on 
cooperation and consultations between NATO on the one hand and 
the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, and Ukraine 
on the other hand. The establishment of a communications 
channel between NATO and the CIS would also be a positive 
element. 
  Four: An improvement in the ability of the European states 
to actively participate in the peace process. At the moment, to 
be frank, the East and West have not found a solid response to 
the local conflicts in Yugoslavia and the former USSR. These 
problems are turning into major problems within the framework of 
European security. Our partners should give genuine support to 
the efforts of Russia, which is bearing the main burden of the 
peace process in the former USSR. The time has come to create a 
voluntary support fund for the peace process in the CIS. NACC 
could offer practical assistance (whether by providing finance 
or preparing staff). 
  Fifth: The non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in Europe. 
It is wrong to regard the Russian-Ukrainian dispute over 
strategic missiles as a matter or element of Soviet heritage. 
It involves preserving the regime of nuclear non-proliferation. 
The strategy for European partnership must contain strong 
incentives for adhering to the current nuclear non-proliferation 
treaty. 
  The economic aspect of partnership forms a special chapter. 
The gist of it is: During the transition from individual, 
chronically overdue programs to help incorporate Russia into the 
international division of labor on an equal and 
non-discriminatory basis, it is necessary to guarantee Russia 
access to European markets. 
  The dialogue on the strategy for partnership in Europe is 
progressing actively. I believe that the NATO summit, by means 
of its well considered and far-reaching decisions, will make a 
positive contribution to its development. Russia remains for 
the members of the North Atlantic Alliance a responsible partner 
interested in drawing up such a strategy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Churkin, deputy minister of foreign </F>
affairs, by Blazej Panik in the High Tatra; date not given: "On 
Zhirinovskiy, Minorities, and NATO"] 
  [Text] Bratislava -- Vitaliy Ivanovich Churkin is Russian 
deputy minister of foreign affairs (in charge of European 
affairs) and President Yeltsin's special envoy for former 
Yugoslavia. He is a graduate of the State Institute of 
International Relations in Moscow. He spent five years in 
Switzerland within the framework of the Soviet-U.S. talks on 
limiting strategic offensive weapons (START II) and another five 
years at the embassy in Washington. This "flying Russian 
emissary" (he spent over 300 hours flying last year) was 
vacationing in the High Tatra these days together with his 
family. On this occasion, he granted an exclusive interview to 
our daily. 
  [Panik] A certain reorganization is currently taking place 
in your ministry and cadre changes are also being prepared. 
What are the causes? 
  [Churkin] Minister Andrey Kozyrev has been saying for some 
time -- and quite justifiably, in my opinion -- that it is 
necessary to devote more attention to the CIS, to our closest 
and immediate neighbors. The aim of the current structural 
reorganization of our office is, therefore, to orient our 
activity to the greatest possible degree toward these states. 
Whereas, until now, the Baltic states were the only former 
Soviet republics under the jurisdiction of the European Affairs 
Department, following the reorganization, this department will 
also be in charge of relations with Ukraine, Belarus, and 
Moldova. The CIS department will then only deal with 
multilateral relations within the framework of this 
Commonwealth. Four regional sections will be established within 
the European Affairs Department. 
  [Panik] According to the new Constitution, foreign policy is 
the president's prerogative. Nonetheless, the question comes to 
mind what influence the new parliament will exert on it? 
  [Churkin] We would like to hope that our relations will be 
distinguished by a spirit of cooperation. Even regarding the 
old parliament, our ministry devoted considerable efforts to the 
search for constructive interaction with deputies. We were not 
too successful, however. 
  [Panik] Mr. Zhirinovskiy has been active on the official 
Russian political scene for only a few weeks, yet his statements 
have already alarmed many states, particularly Russia's 
neighbors. On the other hand, they also cause unnecessary 
problems to your office, which will repeatedly be forced to 
react to his words. How do you intend to approach this problem? 
  [Churkin] It seems that, after the elections of 12 December, 
foreign countries, in particular, have been struck by some kind 
of a shock, which finds its expression in the attribution of 
great significance to Zhirinovskiy's statements. One 
circumstance tends to be forgotten in all this -- that 
Zhirinovskiy is far from being the president. Even if we take a 
realistic look at the composition of the new parliament, we see 
that his party does not even have a majority there. Russia's 
Choice will, after all, be the strongest parliamentary group. 
  [Panik] Yet Zhirinovskiy's electoral success is impossible 
to ignore. 
  [Churkin] Certainly not. It is a fairly serious signal, one 
that should be taken into consideration by both Russian 
democrats and by foreign countries, that highly complex 
processes are taking place in Russia, that the continuing 
struggle for democracy is taking place under extremely 
complicated conditions. At the same time, however, I do not 
think that it is necessary to react from all sides and with an 
outcry to every statement Zhirinovskiy makes. For example, he 
spoke about some weapons. So what? What can he actually do? He 
is a man with a very peculiar and well-known manner of conduct. 
He is not averse to sensationalist statements; his main concern 
is to build up his popularity. If each of his statements 
triggers a minor storm the world over, it will only play into 
his cards, in my opinion. Therefore, I would suggest that the 
reactions be calm and prudent because, as I have already said, 
Zhirinovskiy is far from being the president and is not even a 
Russian politician who could influence certain decisions. Of 
course, should he raise some questions in parliament within the 
framework of constitutional procedures, we will respond to them. 
But we definitely do not intend to build our policy on some of 
his exotic statements. 
  [Panik] But try to imagine yourself in the position of other 
states. In Bulgaria, for example, he called for the removal of 
President Zhelev.... 
  [Churkin] This is exactly one of those cases where any 
commentary is unnecessary. This man simply does not hesitate to 
resort to such scandalous statements for the sake of popularity. 
How can you elbow your way to the front pages of newspapers in 
the East European countries, for example? In his opinion, it is 
simple: You just have to go there and call for the removal of 
the president. I repeat, if we were to oversensitively react to 
each of his statements and call a meeting of the General 
Assembly or the UN Security Council every time, we would look 
absurd -- if we get trapped by this quite simple political trick. 
  [Panik] Sometimes it seems as if Zhirinovskiy were 
specially "made to order" of certain, possibly quite specific, 
aims of Russian foreign policy, so that these can be covered by 
his strong, and in [the Russian] society rather popular, ideas. 
This is particularly alarming when we consider a phenomenon 
such as the growth of Russian nationalism. Is Moscow, planning 
to change in any way its policy regarding the protection of the 
rights of Russians in the so-called adjacent foreign countries 
[reference to former Soviet republics]? 
  [Churkin] No. 
  [Panik] Not even modify? 
  [Churkin] No. Another matter is that the December elections 
-- and also the way in which Zhirinovskiy exploited the thesis 
about the position of Russians abroad -- demonstrated that this 
problem really exists. Therefore, when we raised this issue on 
the premises of the CSCE, the Council of Europe, or the United 
Nations, it was no propaganda on our part, as some of our 
partners in the Baltic countries have been trying to interpret 
this, but the pinpointing of actually existing sore spots that 
must be dealt with. The elections clearly showed this. This is 
one of those issues, from which, as I hope, correct conclusions 
will be drawn. 
  [Panik] This entire complex of questions is associated with 
the highly topical all-European subject of ethnic minority 
rights. Which view does Moscow endorse: Should uniform and 
universal standards of these rights be drafted within the 
framework of the entire European continent or should the 
so-called regional principle be applied? 
  [Churkin] This is a very delicate issue. Our main 
principle, which we are trying to observe, is not to cause any 
damage. When ethnic minorities are concerned, a small problem 
can easily grow into a big one. As a matter of principle, we 
are of the opinion that the idea of drafting a charter of ethnic 
minority rights is not bad and must be assessed. However, we 
are opposed to proceeding in these matters on the basis of the 
bulldozer principle, as it were. 
  [Panik] What does that mean? 
  [Churkin] I am thinking of the formulation of some rigid 
principles and the effort to force them upon everyone. It is 
generally true, and the example of Yugoslavia showed this quite 
drastically, that any coercion is a very dangerous thing with 
regarding the issue of ethnic minority rights. Apart from the 
aforementioned principle, we are guided by yet another one: In 
every specific instance, Russia's demands concerning the rights 
of Russian minorities in the countries in question must not 
exceed their demands -- that is, the demands of these countries. 
  [Panik] What did you have in mind when you said that it is 
necessary to assess the idea of drafting a charter of minority 
rights? 
  [Churkin] Apparently, it will be necessary to formulate a 
set of certain universal rights. The question is how 
far-reaching and all-encompassing these universal rights should 
be. Would it be appropriate, for example, to treat as absolute 
the principle of federalization? I do not think so. In some 
instances, the creation of a federation can be the only way out 
of the situation, but in other instances this requirement can 
complicate the problem where it may not even exist, and where it 
could be resolved, for example, by the installation of road 
signs or street names in the language of the minority, as a 
supplement to signs in the state language. Hence, minority 
rights cannot be made fully universal. And there is yet another 
thing. I have the feeling that far from everything is stable in 
Europe in this regard and that not everyone understands that 
some demands that are being raised could be applied also against 
those who raise them, if one were to be consistent. Regarding 
Yugoslavia, for example, some countries are putting forward 
demands, which I am not at all sure they would be able to apply 
at home, once the Yugoslav conflict is settled. Therein lies a 
danger. Because when we resolve some problem at one place and 
lay down some criteria, an explosive mixture will come about 
when we try to apply the same criteria to other states. I 
assume that Europe is not interested in this. I repeat, certain 
general, universal principles of minority rights are necessary 
but, at the same time, exceptional sensitivity is needed when 
tackling problems with regard to each specific situation. 
  [Panik] How would Moscow react if the real threat emerged in 
the south of Slovakia of the creation of territorial autonomy 
based on the ethnic principle? 
  [Churkin] I would not like to comment on such specific 
issues. As a matter of principle, however, I am of the opinion 
that the fewer surgical incisions every specific decision will 
entail, the better. In other words, the smaller the number of 
changes and adaptations that are necessary for people to feel as 
citizens with full rights, the better. It is necessary to 
proceed according to the principle of minimization [princip 
minimalnosti]. For example, it is superb when it is enough to 
install [bilingual] signs and inscriptions and people will say 
that precisely that is what they found lacking. If more needs 
to be done to satisfy people -- for example, open more schools 
-- even that is fine. Overall, however, many things need to be 
taken into consideration. There are politicians, for example, 
who deliberately stir up people's emotions to be able to score 
additional points with the help of these emotions in order to 
obtain some political post. A Georgian politician once spoke 
with one of our diplomats about the position of the Russian 
minority in Georgia. He said that Russians have no problems 
there, live the same lives as Georgians, and have absolutely 
equal rights. He also said, however, that if all of a sudden 
some extremist politician from among Russians in Georgia started 
asking for autonomy, a problem would immediately emerge, as well 
as another conflict. We must beware of this everywhere. 
  [Panik] Under what circumstances would Moscow not have any 
objections to the Visegrad Four countries joining NATO? 
  [Churkin] We all will enter together.... 
  [Panik] Who "all"? The entire Europe? 
  [Churkin] No, why? The Visegrad group along with Russia. 
All together. Why not, as a matter of fact? Why? 
  [Panik] Is that your answer? 
  [Churkin] No, it is my spontaneous reaction, so to say. 
  [Panik] And your answer? 
  [Churkin] The problem is not in whether Moscow has or does 
not have objections. We have not objected to anything. But 
when this issue arose, we only came up with what I would rather 
call a plea: not to deal with this issue rashly, on a wave of 
emotions. This is because a whole number of issues is at stake 
that, in our firm conviction, have not been thought through yet 
-- by anyone. Not by you, not by the North Atlantic Alliance, 
and not by us. Incidentally, I am absolutely sure that, even if 
he had not said a single world and had sat silently like a fish, 
neither the Visegrad Four nor anyone else would have been 
admitted into NATO now. Simply because the North Atlantic 
Alliance itself is not ready for that. It is not ready because 
of what I have mentioned: that not all the consequences of such 
a step have been calculated. 
  [Panik] What, in particular, do you have in mind? 
  [Churkin] In my opinion, it is necessary to keep several 
factors in mind. In present-day Europe it is impossible to gain 
additional security while at the same time harming the security 
of other states. So there has to be equal security. Second, 
how would the admission of, let us say, only some East European 
countries into NATO be accepted by the other states of the 
region (and I am not thinking of Russia right now)? For 
example, in the past few months, when this dispute was going on, 
I quite clearly felt a certain tension arising among the East 
European countries themselves. Because some of them were 
interested not so much in their own NATO membership but, rather, 
they feared that someone might be admitted without them being 
admitted. This is a negative factor, and then will the East 
European countries' entry into NATO at this time resolve the 
actually existing problems in this region? Or is it something 
that is rather more symbolic and that does not resolve these 
real problems and may even create additional ones? How will 
this be reflected in the very foundations of European security? 
One of its pillars and, in my opinion one of the most important 
ones is the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe. If four 
former Warsaw Pact member countries were now admitted into NATO, 
how would that be reflected in the treaty? I do not know.... 
  [Panik] What do your experts say about that? 
  [Churkin] They also raise this question and draw attention 
to the fact that the treaty had been worked out in blocks, that 
is, it was based on the number of weapons of 16 NATO states and 
seven Warsaw Pact states deployed on the European continent. 
Certain ceilings were set. Then the Warsaw Pact broke up. 
Still, we are observing the treaty. Even the Soviet Union has 
broken up but, still, we are observing the treaty. But what if 
there will not be 16 states on one side, but 20 states? What 
are we going to do with that treaty then? This is an unclear 
and unanswered question. Or take another matter: I have had a 
number of conversations with representatives of East European 
states and, to be candid, I do not have the feeling that from 
the purely financial viewpoint they have a clear idea of what 
NATO membership would cost them. After all, this is not such a 
simple matter. NATO is, of course, a solid organization; the 
people there are solid. I do not see in them any evil spirits 
who are conspiring against someone. That is not the point. We 
ourselves are prepared and want to cooperate with them. But they 
are no philanthropists either; they are not going to engage in 
any charitable activities. Entry into NATO is, therefore, a 
serious matter, which would surely require considerable material 
contributions and expenditures. Therefore, having pondered the 
issue and racked our brains, and, understandably, keeping in 
mind the interests of Russia and our already complicated 
internal political situation, we said: It will be better to 
ponder the problems of European security for another while. In 
this context, it seems to us that the idea of "Partnership for 
Peace" is a good one. 
  [Panik] Evil tongues claim that it is more your idea than 
Washington's idea.... 
  [Churkin] No. I think that it is the product of a dialogue, 
including our dialogue with the Americans. But in this case it 
would be immodest and incorrect if we tried to arrogate the 
authorship of this idea.

<F P=106> [Video report from Moscow by correspondent Natalya </F>
Chernyshova, including recording of interview remarks by Belarus 
leader Stanislav Shushkevich; from the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] On the eve of the Russian-U.S. summit, Belarus 
leader Shushkevich arrived in Moscow for talks with Boris 
Yeltsin. According to him, he has brought a whole package of 
economic proposals, the purpose of which is the integration of 
the two republics' economies. 
  [Chernyshova] Serious economic issues were discussed. The 
market of our closest neighbor may be assessed as being in an 
even greater plight than that of Russia. The inflation rate has 
risen to more than 25 percent per month. The official rate of 
exchange is 4.5 coupons for a ruble. The difference between 
imports from and exports to Russia ranges from $36 to 100 
million. Enormous amounts of money are being spent on 
eliminating the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. 
  Today, according to our correspondent, there was a wave of 
rallies throughout the republic staged by industrial trade 
unions. The main slogan called for halting the collapse of 
production. 
  Recently, both in political circles and in the mass media, 
there has been discussion of the desire of the two countries to 
sign agreements on setting up an economic alliance and ruble 
zone of a new type. These agreements will make it possible to 
remove the technical barriers which restrict cooperation in what 
is essentially a single people. At the same time, both the 
Belarus opposition press and some Russian observers think that 
such a decision will be detrimental to our countries. Belarus 
will turn out to be subject to Russia once again and will lose 
its sovereignty. Russia will be forced to provide additional 
food to its closest but poor relative. 
  Such suggestions were rejected by Stanislav Shushkevich who 
agreed to give us an interview after meeting Boris Yeltsin. 
  [Shushkevich] Where did all this talk come from about the 
confrontation, lack of understanding, and selling out of the 
interests of Belarus? Read our communique from today. We have 
tried to state in the most concise form that the Republic of 
Belarus and the Russian Federation are seeking ways of achieving 
an extensive, real rapprochement of the two peoples. They are 
seeking ways of expressing this drawing together in a 
legislative document so that people should not experience 
difficulties. We need to conclude a wide-ranging treaty on 
cooperation which takes into account the actual situation today. 
  For us the main issue in setting up a ruble zone is that the 
Russian ruble -- if we set up the zone on the basis of the ruble 
-- should have the same value both in Belarus and in Russia. If 
a variant like this can be found, then it must be done as soon 
as possible. 
  [Chernyshova] If an agreement like this is signed, then a 
new 
basis for the rapprochement of our peoples will be opened up.

  [Text] In the course of the meeting between Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman 
Stanislav Shushkevich in Moscow on 12 January, both sides 
conducted an in-depth analysis of the state of bilateral 
relations, placing emphasis on economic cooperation. The sides 
came to the conclusion that a new Belarusian-Russian treaty on 
friendship and cooperation is necessary, corresponding to these 
states' aspiration to build democracies with socially-oriented 
market economies and the special status of economic, political, 
and human relations that have developed between the two 
countries in the course of history. The sides exchanged 
opinions with regard to the upcoming visit of U.S. President 
Bill Clinton to Moscow and Minsk. It was pointed out that in 
the process of building economic relations with the United 
States it is necessary to proceed from programs of assistance to 
programs of promoting trade and investment, being primary 
prerequisites for the development and integration of CIS 
economies in the world economy.

  [Text] The undue haste in unifying the monetary systems of 
Russia and Belarus caused by one-off political gains is fraught 
with negative implications for their economies, Russia's Deputy 
Finance Minister Andrey Kazmin said. 
  Contrary to widespread reports, he said, no agreement has so 
far been reached with Minsk on how to run the budget systems, at 
what rate to exchange Belarusian currency units into rubles and 
how to readjust the two countries' prices. 
  The main sticking point is prices and fuel prices in 
particular, President of the National Bank of Belarus Stanislav 
Bogdankevich told Interfax. He spoke of waiting until Moscow 
announced uniform prices if the money union agreement was 
implemented. 
  Kazmin says his ministry is insisting that currencies be 
stabilized and the gap in their purchasing power narrowed stage 
by stage as part of implementing the multi-lateral agreement on 
the new ruble zone. At present, 1 ruble fetches 4.51 Belarusian 
coupons at the money market in Minsk. 
  The Russian official also said that the movement towards 
bridging the gap between currency rates must pass through market 
mechanisms which will take some time to achieve. 
  On financing Belarus' budget deficit, Kazmin called for 
forming a consolidated joint budget and establishing a special 
order to grant credits to Minsk to cover its budget deficit. 
However, Minsk opposes this on the grounds it is an 
encroachment on its sovereignty, preferring the deficit to be 
qualified as the country's internal debt instead. 
  The ministry doubts that a final agreement on unifying the 
monetary systems could be signed later this month despite an 
earlier announcement. Kazmin says the Russian ministry wants an 
early but justifiable rapprochement of the two monetary systems 
and is now considering new proposals from Minsk.

<F P=106> ["Text" of declaration signed by Belarusian Prime Minister </F>
Vyacheslav Kebich and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in 
Moscow on 5 January: "On Planned Unification of Belarusian and 
Russian Monetary Systems"] 
  [Text] The Belarusian and Russian Governments' leaders 
confirm their adherence to the goals and principles accompanying 
the creation of the CIS. Consistently advocating the creation 
of a common economic zone, the governments believe that the 
implementation of agreements reached within the framework of the 
CIS -- providing for the strengthening of direct ties between 
economic entities on the basis of the free movement of goods, 
services, capital, and labor as well as coordinated financial, 
monetary- credit, price, convertible currency, and customs 
policies -- can be accelerated by expanding bilateral 
cooperation. 
  The Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation have 
similar economic systems, common borders, and historically 
similar national fates. Reflecting the drive for economic 
integration voiced by the citizens of their states, the 
governments have taken a number of measures aimed at further 
expanding this cooperation without damaging national sovereignty. 
  The implementation of the agreement on unifying the monetary 
systems of the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation 
will become the decisive factor for strengthening economic ties 
between Belarus and Russia. The agreement stipulates conducting 
coordinated monetary-credit, budget, convertible currency, 
taxation, and social policies, as well as the creation of a 
common customs zone with a common system of prices. 
  The leaders of the Russian Federation and the Republic of 
Belarus point out that coordinated measures were carried out 
between September and December 1993, in accordance with the 
agreement on the unification of the monetary systems, and it was 
concluded that these systems have been brought to a high state 
of readiness. 
  The leaders of the Russian Federation and the Republic of 
Belarus declare that preparations for the final unification of 
the monetary systems has been completed. 
  The governments have charged appropriate ministries and 
departments with drafting agreements determining the mechanism 
for the functioning of the Belarusian monetary system after the 
unification of the systems, as well as a common mechanism for 
managing the budgets of the two states and documents determining 
foreign economic, trade, and customs policies. Technical 
aspects necessary for the functioning of the unified system 
should also be discussed, so as to sign the documents on forming 
a bilateral economic union within the framework of the CIS in 
Minsk in January 1994. 
  The Governments of the Republic of Belarus and the Russian 
Federation believe that the unification of the two states' 
monetary systems will serve the cause of safeguarding the two 
nations' economic progress and improving mechanisms for 
cooperation within the framework of the CIS.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 13 Jan -- A wide spectrum of questions 
concerning bilateral Russian-Moldovan relations and Russia's 
contribution toward the settlement of the Dniester problem were 
at the center of discussion at a meeting between Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Moldova Acting Foreign Minister Ion 
Butnaru, which has just ended at the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
"This is a very complex process and it is most important for us 
to convince both sides -- the Government of Moldova and the 
Dniester leaders -- that they should seek ways of reaching a 
political agreement, a political solution", the Russian foreign 
minister told journalists after the meeting. He described the 
talks as useful and constructive, held "in a professional, 
businesslike manner." In their general conversation the 
ministers discussed, in particular, the situation with and 
status of the 14th Army as well as the progress of talks between 
the two sides and relations between their leaders. 
  In response to a question from the ITAR-TASS correspondent, 
Andrey Kozyrev said the Dniester problem will apparently be 
examined during the present Russo-American summit in Moscow. 
"We are conducting a dialogue with the United States and with 
other states because the region is one of the conflict zones 
under discussion in the CSCE and the United Nations," the 
minister noted. "We are trying at all bilateral meetings to 
bring in a wider circles of states to assist our efforts to 
settle this kind of problem. 
  "Of course, no one is going to supplant domestic dialogue; 
this is first and foremost an internal matter for Moldova as an 
integral state to find a `modus vivendi' to resolve the issues. 
Here we can only assist, but Russia, for obvious reasons, plays 
perhaps a special and perfectly defined role here in helping to 
find a settlement." At the same time, the Russian minister 
called for other states to participate "as positively as 
possible" in this process, because the overall problem is an 
armed conflict -- which it has been -- in the heart of Europe 
and cannot fail to worry other countries. 
  In the opinion of Ion Butnaru, essentially all the main 
issues concerning relations between Moldova and Russia were 
discussed. These talks were "one specific step in implementing 
the understandings reached at the last meeting between the two 
countries' presidents." The exchange of views, he believes, was 
useful, particularly in that it helped to dispel all doubts 
about the future of Moldovan-Russian ties. At the same time, 
the Moldovan minister favors involving other "European 
structures" in assisting the efforts being made on a bilateral 
and multilateral basis.

  [Text] Russia's Finance Ministry declared that messages 
published by the mass media stating that Tajikistan is entering 
"the ruble zone" are invalid, deputy Finance Minister Andrey 
Kazmin reported to Interfax. 
  Kazmin explained that in accordance with the interstate 
agreement concluded last November, the Central Bank of Russia 
has granted a cash credit to Tajikistan totalling 120 Bn rubles 
due to the difficult political and economic situation in the 
country. "This does not mean that the republic has actually 
entered "the ruble zone," underlined Kazmin. 
  In his words, the interstate credit has been granted for 
half 
a year under the pledge of gold-currency reserves and real 
estate. The first part of this credit, 30 Bn rubles, was already 
delivered to Tajikistan in early January, 1994. 
  Kazmin reported that the issue on Tajikistan's entering "the 
ruble zone" is in the stage of development and it is premature 
to speak about unification of monetary systems. 
  Tajikistan has already declared its readiness to accept 
Russia's conditions providing for gradual entering into "the 
ruble zone of a new type" and intends to use this credit to 
exchange "old" Russian rubles for "new" ones.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Gavrilenko commentary under "Postskriptum: Events </F>
and Commentaries" rubric: "I Would Like To Add the Final Period 
to the Story of the Arrest of Two Russian Generals in the 
Latvian Capital"] 
  [Text] ...But at the moment I have to make do with 
ellipses. The latest glaring incident is merely the most 
significant episode in a sequence of acts of provocations by 
Latvian nationalists against the Russian army. 
  Latvia's statesmen, embarrassed by this difficult situation, 
did everything they could: They immediately named the culprits 
and apologized to the Russian side. Outwardly everything seems 
to have been done respectably, promptly, and sincerely. It is 
just that I cannot avoid the banal question: Where were these 
people looking before? The Zemessargi (home defense guard), 
emboldened by impunity, have for a long time now quite literally 
been refusing to let Russian officers and soldiers pass: They 
threaten them with weapons and insult them. You get the 
impression that the sole reason for the Latvian military's 
existence is to bug the Russians. And this comes at a time when 
talks are going on, when the date for the withdrawal of the 
troops has been agreed in practice, and when problems of the 
states' normal mutual relations are becoming of paramount 
importance. So did they in the past have to connive with the 
actions of these tin soldiers from the home guard only 
subequently to lower their eyes and admit that these people have 
harmed Latvia's interests? 
  But the harm is clear because the timing of the provocation 
was chosen deliberately: the Russian-Latvian talks, the NATO 
summit, the U.S. President's visit to Russia.... In fact it 
worked out badly. Badly because Latvia is not a ship and cannot 
sail away from Russia's borders waving good-bye from the deck to 
the people of neighboring Pskov, who include assault forces 
among their number. And these are not the "Zemessargi" who chose 
as the object of their "heroic" endeavors the hotel and sports 
complex of the Northwestern Group of Forces. 
  Well, it seems that we can consider the incident closed. The 
reassuring words of the Latvian premier that the government will 
do everything in its power to mitigate the consequences of the 
occurrence are encouraging. But they do not lift from the heart 
the bitter resentment at the fact that the dignity of the 
Russian soldier has been impugned once again.

"There Was No Threat of Invasion of Latvia, Says Russian 
Federation Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Krylov"] 
  [Text] The danger of Russian Armed Forces' invading Latvia 
following the arrest of two Russian generals has been ruled out. 
This was announced by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey 
Krylov in an interview with INTERFAX. 
  He noted that the Russian troops stationed in Latvia and put 
on high alert following the incident did not leave their base 
area and did not undertake any aggressive actions. 
  According to Sergey Krylov, this gross and unprecedented 
action was possibly aimed to provoke Russia into taking 
retaliatory measures. It is regrettable that it took place at 
the time of the Russian-Latvian talks in Riga, when progress had 
just emerged on the key aspects of the issue of Russian troop 
pullout. 
  The diplomat stressed that Russia is not intent on tough 
confrontation and is not interested in seeing the talks 
disrupted. He also noted that the incident in Riga coincided 
with the NATO summit in Brussels. "It is not ruled out that 
Russia's sharp retaliatory moves could have become a weighty 
argument for Latvia in favor of the earliest possible accession 
to the North Atlantic alliance." The deputy minister suggested 
that this was precisely the design by the action's organizers.

<F P=106> [Own Correspondent Arif Useynov report: "Neighboring </F>
Countries: Will They Agree?"] 
  [Text] Baku -- Azerbaijan's opposition parties have 
reacted cautiously to a visit to Baku by Andrey Nikolayev, 
commander in chief of Russia's Border Troops and leader of the 
Federal Border Service. Newspapers abounded with headlines like 
the following: "Russia Is Trying to Return Border Troops to 
Azerbaijan." At the "Musavat" party headquarters the visit was 
evaluated as a demonstration of "a new form of Russian 
expansionism," bearing in mind that the northern neighbor has 
not repudiated the idea of stationing Russian troops in 
Azerbaijan and switching the protection of the republic's 
external borders to their jurisdiction. 
  During a meeting with President Geydar Aliyev the Russian 
Federation Border Troops commander in chief clarified the aim of 
his visit: "The Armenia-Azerbaijan border is a matter for the 
politicians of these two states. It is the question of 
protecting Azerbaijan's external borders which interests Russia." 
  In a situation where the republic's southwestern regions are 
occupied and the Armenia-Azerbaijan border is to all intents and 
purposes non-existent there, while 170 km of the Iran-Azerbaijan 
border is under the control of Armenian armed formations, the 
proposal for Russia and Azerbaijan to collaborate in protecting 
the external borders, according to the head of state's reaction, 
has not been perceived in a positive light. AYNA writes that it 
is obviously pertinent to take account of the actual state of 
play in the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict and the situation on the 
fronts. In this connection Geydar Aliyev noted that Azerbaijan's 
border has in point of fact become an arena for military 
operations. 
  According to commentators, the question of collaboration 
between the two states is directly linked with resolving the 
Karabakh conflict under rigorous compliance with international 
norms -- the guarantee of territorial integrity and the 
immutability of republic borders. Nowadays Azerbaijan is also 
concentrating on this in trying to alter the course and nature 
of the Karabakh war. To all appearances it was this 
interpretation of the approach to proposals from the Russian 
Federal Border Service that led to the decision to continue the 
talks. 
  On this subject Andrey Nikolayevich gave a clarification: 
For talks to continue, the forms and methods of cooperation 
between the two states will have to be defined. To a question 
on the possibility of stationing Russian troops on the 
Iran-Azerbaijan border, the Russian Border Troops commander in 
chief gave an evasive reply: "It all depends on what both sides 
agree." 
  On the eve of the visit Gasan Gasanov, leader of 
Azerbaijan's 
foreign policy department, discussed the aforementioned 
questions with the higher political leadership of Iran and 
Turkey. The Azerbaijan Foreign Ministry Press Center announced 
that agreement has already been reached between Turkey and 
Azerbaijan on transforming the border treaty between Turkey and 
the former USSR into a treaty between Turkey and Azerbaijan. 
Working commissions have been set up to study the question. 
Among other things, the two sides arrived at an agreement that 
efforts to alter the borders of the Nakhichevan Autonomous 
Republic and Azerbaijan by force will in general be evaluated by 
them as a breach of the Kars Treaty, and in that event Turkey 
will not remain a detached onlooker.

"Kazimirov Ends Visit to Baku. Russia Intends To Enlist the 
Support of All Parties to the Karabakh Conflict"] 
  [Text] On 12 January, Ambassador at Large Vladimir 
Kazimirov, the Russian Federation president's special envoy, 
ended his two-day talks in Baku; he discussed with the 
Azerbaijan leadership the situation in the Armenian-Azerbaijan 
conflict area and the prospects for continuing Moscow's 
mediation efforts. The republic's presidential press service 
said that the meeting between the Russian diplomat and President 
Geydar Aliyev was held behind closed doors. It is noteworthy 
that in the run-up to the visit to Baku, Kazimirov went to 
Tehran where he sought to enlist the support of President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani over the issue of Russia's peacemaking 
mission in the region. 
  At the same time, no attempts are forthcoming from Moscow to 
coordinate its steps in resolving the Karabakh crisis with 
Ankara. This suggests that the Russian Federation leadership is 
aware of Iran's growing role in the region. Characteristically, 
at present Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Russia are seeking close 
cooperation with Tehran. Yerevan has not abandoned hope that 
the Armenian-Azerbaijan talks on the construction of a gas 
pipeline, which have been going on for more than one year now, 
will be concluded by this spring with the signing of a protocol 
whereby the Iranian side will begin deliveries of natural gas to 
Armenia. 
  On the other hand, the administration of President Geydar 
Aliyev warns Tehran against such a step because after resolving 
its energy problems, Armenia may intensify its military pressure 
on Azerbaijan. Baku avoids any rash moves that could complicate 
its relations with Tehran. This apparently accounts for 
Aliyev's refusal to approve the proposal by the Russia border 
troops command on stationing Russian border guards on the border 
with Iran. Azerbaijan Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov, who 
visited Tehran, assured the Iranian leadership that Azerbaijan 
is opposed to the construction of an "iron curtain" on the 
border with Iran. The absence of a common border between 
Azerbaijan and the Nakhichevan autonomous area also makes the 
republic dependent on Iran. In a recent offensive by the 
Azerbaijan Army in the south the strategic and transportation 
center of Goradiz was captured, and now it has again become 
possible to use Iranian territory to ship major cargoes from 
Azerbaijan to Nakhichevan. 
  Russia's interest in cooperation with Iran on the issue of 
peacemaking efforts in the Transcaucasus is most likely linked 
with its aspiration to prevent a possible intervention by Tehran 
in the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict and thus to prevent that 
war's internationalization. It cannot be ruled out that 
Kazimirov has sought to obtain clarifications from the Iranian 
side as to whether the Afghan mujahidin have really been 
recently transferred across Iranian territory to Azerbaijan. 
Baku, as is known, categorically denies this information. 
  The severe fighting that is going on today between Armenian 
and Azerbaijan formations occurs mostly in direct proximity to 
the Iranian border. The Azerbaijan Defense Ministry has 
announced that approximately 40 km of the Azerbaijan-Iran border 
has been won back from the Armenian side. The Armenian side 
therefore now controls some 120 km of territory. 
  The Azerbaijan side so far refrains from continuing 
offensive 
operations, but reports from military sources leave no doubt 
that in the next few days an attempt will be made to liberate 
the districts of Dzhebrail, Agdam, Fizuli, and Kelbadzhar, 
occupied by Armenia. Geydar Aliyev has entrusted the preparation 
of this operation to Lieutenant Colonel Mikhail Bayramov, who 
has been appointed the defense minister's aide on combat 
operations. So far, according to the same sources, the Armenian 
Defense Ministry is hastily moving additional forces to the area 
to create a second defense echelon.

  [Text] Tokyo January 13 ITAR-TASS -- One should not speak 
about any delay of the meeting of the Russian-Japanese working 
group drafting a peace treaty between the two countries, as the 
date for it has not been set, an official of the Japanese 
Foreign Ministry's Russian department told ITAR-TASS on Thursday 
[13 January]. 
  The official reminded that, during Russian President 
Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October, the two states expressed 
the wish to hold the meeting soon after the elections to the new 
Russian parliament. The mass media believed it meant that the 
date for the meeting was officially fixed for late in January. 
But in point of fact it was only an approximate date. 
  Japan's viewpoint remains unchanged. It seeks to hold this 
year's first round of the talks as soon as possible. However it 
takes into account the difficulty of Russia's domestic 
situation, the workload the Russian Government is faced with 
because of the beginning of the parliament's work, the Japanese 
Foreign Ministry's official said. The official refused to 
express some supposition when the Russian-Japanese working 
group's meeting may be held.

  [Text] Tokyo, 13 Jan -- "The Kurils do not need Japanese 
humanitarian aid in the form it is now being offered, especially 
as we have not asked for it, because we believe that it is 
degrading for Russian people to turn to Japan for help," said 
Nikolay Pokidin, head of administration of the South Kurils 
region, in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. He is 
currently in Japan to attend Russian-Japanese consultations on 
the question of visa-free exchange between the inhabitants of 
the Kurils and Japan. 
  Nikolay Pokidin noted that within the framework of Japanese 
humanitarian aid, the goods reaching the South Kurils are mainly 
those which the region does not need. "For example," he went 
on, "we were recently sent a consignment of television sets and 
tape recorders that one would hardly describe as an urgent 
necessity. At the same time, we cannot get hold of medical 
supplies and medical equipment for which we have an acute need. 
If Japan herself has declared a desire to assist us she should 
listen to our wishes so as not to waste her money." According 
to Nikolay Pokidin, over the past year the South Kurils and 
Kurils regions have been granted Japanese aid totalling 1.5 
million dollars. 
  Meanwhile, Gennadiy Dolin, the head of administration of the 
Kurils region, noted in an interview to an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent, well-organized Japanese assistance may help to 
solve the many complex problems that exist. Last year, for 
example, within the framework of humanitarian aid, Japan 
delivered a major consignment of medical supplies for the Kurils 
regional hospital, thus rendering invaluable help to the local 
people. "However, we are interested not so much in humanitarian 
aid as in long-term economic cooperation which so far, 
unfortunately, Japan has refrained from doing," Gennadiy Dolin 
pointed out. 
  Both local administration chiefs described the economic 
situation on the Kurils as critical. In their words, the 
Russian Government only says it cares about this part of Russia 
which is remote from Moscow, and is not doing anything practical 
at all. Workers at a number of local enterprises have not 
received their salaries for several months now, the local 
authorities' budget is falling apart, and there are insufficient 
funds even to ensure that transport functions normally and that 
basic social needs are met. In addition, the crime situation is 
deteriorating rapidly on the Kurils -- the number of robberies 
and thefts is rising and shots ring out, fired by "fighters" 
from opposing groups of the "car Mafia." 
  In these circumstances more and more people are leaving the 
islands. In the past year the population of the "Northern 
Territories," as the Japanese call the South Kurils, has fallen 
by around 1,500 people. "This spring we are expecting another 
surge in the flow of people away from the islands. Many 
families have already sold their homes and got ready to leave 
for the mainland once the navigation season starts," Gennadiy 
Dolin said. 
  Nikolay Pokidin noted bitterly that the grave economic 
situation was making the view that the South Kurils should be 
handed over to Japan increasingly widespread among the local 
population. The head of administration of the South Kurils area 
expressed the view that in the foreseeable future the South 
Kurils would not be handed over to Japan. "There is no Russian 
politician who would take such a step," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo January 13 TASS -- The first Russo-Japanese 
consultations on the problem of the two countries' cooperation 
in the field of environmental protection are due to be held in 
Tokyo on January 26-27, an official representative of the 
Japanese Government told journalists today. 
  At the consultations both sides plan to discuss such issues 
as the prevention by joint efforts of dumping liquid nuclear 
waste in seas of the world ocean by Russia, cooperation in the 
struggle against pollution of air space, and in ecological 
protection of tracts of forests in Siberia which have essential 
influence of the planet's climate. 
  The consultations are called upon to become the first step 
towards working out concrete programs of cooperation between 
Russia and Japan in the sphere of environmental protection. 
  The forthcoming talks will be held for the first time since 
April 1991 when Japan and the former Soviet Union concluded an 
agreement on bilateral cooperation in the field of environmental 
protection. 
  One of the major results of this cooperation is that Russia 
will stop dumping nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan, according 
to an official from the ecology department of the Russia Defense 
Ministry. 
  So far Russia has had two tankers being used to store liquid 
nuclear waste which are now full to the capacity. Japan is 
reported to have offered its storage tanker to save the 
situation. 
  Japan shows a particular interest in the settlement of this 
problem because Russia allegedly dumped 900 tons of liquid 
nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan in October 1993. This aroused 
a storm of protests in Japan which is making great efforts to 
protect environment. At that time Russia explained the incident 
by the absence of storage space for nuclear waste and financial 
difficulties.

the transaction for the sale of Russian submarines with 
completed service life to North Korea. Indeed, such a contract 
was signed in full compliance with the existing rules and agreed 
with the Russian State Committee for Property. 
  A Japan firm will be engaged in dismantling Russian 
submarines, and they will be delivered to the buyer in a 
condition fit only for metal scrap, informed sources from the 
Russian Navy told ITAR-TASS today. 
  Thus, there are no grounds for the allegations that Russian 
submarines after necessary repairs can be put into service by 
subdivisions of the North Korean Navy.

  The Korean disapora on Sakhalin consists mostly of those who 
were deported to the island by the Japanese before and during 
World War Two, as well as from their ancestors. 
  The press conference was devoted to the work of a trilateral 
Russian-Japanese-South Korean Commission which studied the 
problems faced by Koreans in Sakhalin. 
  The Korean diaspora demands a compensation of 10 million yen 
for each Korean, dual Russian-Korean citizenship and free 
private housing in Korea. 
  However, foreign diplomats told reporters that the demands 
would [word indistinct] hardly met. 
  10 million yen is too big a sum and dual citizenship is 
problematic in South Korea, they said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed reply to reader's letter under the "Briefing </F>
for the Readers" rubric: "The 1,641th Underground Hiroshima"] 
  [Text] Will China's recent underground nuclear explosion 
not encourage Russia and the United States to carry out new 
nuclear tests? 
  [Signed] S. Boychenko, Lipetsk 
  The underground test in the PRC of a nuclear explosive 
device 
with a yield of 80-90 kilotonnes carried out 5 October last year 
has indeed complicated the situation. So far the leading 
nuclear powers have abided by their voluntary unilateral 
commitments to refrain from such actions ideally until the 
signing in 1996 of an agreement on a complete ban on underground 
nuclear explosions. Tests in the atmosphere, in space, and under 
water were banned earlier by the international treaty of 1963. 
  However, the members of the "nuclear club" decided not to 
follow China's example and will continue to observe the 
moratorium on underground explosions although both Russia and 
the United States proclaimed a little over four months ago their 
readiness not to hold such tests only so long as the other great 
powers refrained from them. So far only the leadership of 
France has expressed the theoretical possibility of staging a 
series of tests in the period up to 1996. 
  As of now the nuclear powers have officially given notice of 
2,166 nuclear test explosions (954 by the United States, 936 by 
the USSR, 192 by France, 44 by Britain, 39 by China, and one by 
India). Of that number the 1,641th nuclear device has now been 
detonated underground at the test sites shown on the attached 
map. [Note: A map accompanies the article showing test sites at 
Nevada, Mururoa, Novaya Zemlya, Semipalatinsk, Lopnor, and the 
Tar desert] 
  As far as is known, neither Russia nor Britain intends to 
detonate even those test charges that they have stored in 
underground galleries: In Russia's case at the test site in 
Semipalatinsk, in Britain's at the U.S. site in Nevada. So let 
us hope that 1994 becomes nuclear-free at least on the territory 
of the main nuclear countries.

Delegation of the Unrecognized Republic of Serbian Krajina 
Visited Moscow. Volunteers From Among Russian Cossacks Do the 
Fighting in the Former Yugoslavia"] 
  [Text] A delegation of the Republic of Serbian Krajina 
under foreign minister Slobodan Jarcevic visited Moscow at the 
invitation of the joint staff of Russia's Cossack troops. The 
republic and the Cossacks Union of Russia signed an agreement on 
cooperation in providing humanitarian aid to Serbian Krajina, 
and exchanging cultural and sports delegations. They also plan 
to engage in joint publishing activity. In the near future, 
wounded Serb soldiers will be rehabilitated in guest houses and 
sanatoriums on Cossack lands in Russia. 
  "What remains in the current situation is for the Serbs to 
rely on support from their Russian brothers," Mr. Jarcevic said. 
"The Islamic world stands behind the Bosnian Muslims, the 
Croats rely on support from the Catholics, and the Orthodox are 
historically destined to be friends with Russia." The minister 
said he highly appreciated the assistance provided by Russian 
volunteers to Serbian Krajina's army, although, in his view, it 
was primarily moral in nature. The number of volunteers from 
Russia, Bulgaria, and Romania remains very small. According to 
Ivan Chernikov, commander of Cossack troops and minister of 
economic and cultural ties in the Cossacks Union of Russia, as 
of today there are a few Cossack units of no more than 10 men 
each fighting in the former Yugoslavia. "If a Cossack goes to 
war, the commander cannot ban him from doing so," he said. 
  The Russian Federation Foreign Ministry learned about the 
foreign guests' visit from the mass media. Staffers from the 
European Department, to whom your SEGODNYA correspondent turned 
for comment, said only that the Republic of Serbian Krajina does 
not have an official status and that the same applies to any 
agreements signed with it. The Russian Foreign Ministry has not 
received any requests in that regard from either side, nor did 
they have any consultations on the subject.

  [Text] Another meeting took place in Moscow on 13 January. 
Viktor Yerin, Russian minister of internal affairs, met Moshe 
Shahal, Israeli minister of police, energy and infrastructure. 
As a result, a protocol was signed on talks about cooperation 
between the two ministries on combatting international crime. 
Our correspondent Georgiy Sovtsov reports. 
  [Sovtsov] The main themes of the protocol are the prevention 
of crime in the sphere of law enforcement, public safety, the 
prevention of the illegal narcotics trade with the cooperation 
of police forces at lower levels. Viktor Yerin, the Russian 
minister, confirmed that at present work is being actively 
conducted to conclude a full-scale agreement between Russia and 
Israel, but as this is being done at government level, the two 
countries' police ministers can for now sign only the present 
protocol. 
  Viktor Yerin also stressed that the restoration of 
diplomatic 
and economic relations with Israel made it necessary to draw 
closer on questions of operational and criminal pursuit work and 
there are cases of this happening already; for example, in 1993 
Israeli police seized over 100 kg of narcotics. 
  Moshe Shahal cited one of the points of this protocol, on 
confirming the posts of liaison officers under the ministers of 
each country to provide operational information. Israel has 
already established such relations with the United States, 
France, Turkey, Ukraine, and Russia. Asked whether a Russian 
mafia existed in Israel, Mr. Shahal replied that the level of 
crime among former emigrants from Russia and other CIS countries 
was no different from those living permanently in Israel.

nuclear reactors for electricity production." This was reported 
by Energy Minister Moshe Shahal, currently visiting the CIS 
republics. 
  According to Shahal, the implementation of the deal depends 
on Israel's ability to purchase the Russian reactors in view of 
the technical, political, and economic constraints. 
  The minister explained that the Russians are willing to sell 
five [as published] energy products to Israel, in addition to 
nuclear energy: crude oil, natural gas, petroleum distillates 
(such as benzine), and know-how for the production of 
alternative energy. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report on "special" interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, </F>
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, by Moscow correspondent 
Gid'on Kouts; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Here is another facet, perhaps a new one, of the 
terrible Vladimir Zhirinovskiy: this time, as a conditional 
lover of Israel and the Jews. At the outset of a special 
interview he gave to Qol Yisra'el, I said to him: I heard that 
you would like to transfer Israel elsewhere. 
  He replied: I said Israel was put in a region where there 
are over 100 million Arabs, and there has always been a war 
between Israel and the Arabs. Had an island been chosen for 
Israel, such as Madagascar, Cyprus, Malta, or some other island 
where there are no neighbors and where there would be 10, 20, or 
30 million Jews, there would have been no problems and the whole 
matter would have been over. You have been at war with the 
Arabs for over 40 years, however, and this war will continue. 
You signed a peace, but the war has continued and there are 
casualties every day. 
  I asked: Do you recognize Israel's right to exist? The 
State of Israel must exist, Zhirinovskiy replied soothingly, but 
Russia and the United States should work together to finalize 
Israel's borders. We have influence with Syria and Iraq, while 
the United States has influence with Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and 
Egypt. We should reach a definitive agreement about Israel's 
final borders and never change them again. War and extremism 
would then be over. Everything possible must be done so that 
life is calm for a long time, forever. 
  Should the Jews of Russia emigrate to Israel? Zhirinovskiy 
replied: If Russian Jews want to go to Israel, let them. After 
all, the communists barred them from doing so for a long time 
and even threw them in jail. If they want to stay, however, 
they are most welcome, seeing that the Jews have always been 
highly educated people who can contribute a great deal to their 
country of residence. 
  Are there any Jews in the Liberal Democratic Party? An 
incredulous Zhirinovskiy repeated after me: Are there any Jews 
in our party? Then he regained his composure and answered: 
There may be one, two, or three of them. I do not know their 
exact number, because when people join our party we do not ask 
them to disclose their nationality. 
  There has been talk that you are of Jewish origin, that your 
father was a Jew, I said to him. It is all propaganda, 
Zhirinovskiy exclaimed. People say my father was Jewish, that I 
am an anti- Semite, a Zionist, an extremist, a fascist, a 
communist, and that Saddam Husayn gave me money. The latest 
tale about me is that the communists in East Germany gave me 80 
million German marks, but what I said was: Give me 8 marks. 
These are outright lies. 
  So, you are not dangerous, I said. No, I am not dangerous, 
Zhirinovskiy answered. The magazine BILD carried photographs of 
a young girl and reported that Zhirinovskiy had a sexual liaison 
with her when he was in Austria. He said: Where is that woman? 
I would gladly meet her, but where is she? It is sheer 
propaganda, as always. 
  If you are invited to Israel for a visit, will you come? 
Yes, we will come, Zhirinovskiy replied resolutely. 
  I guess we had better start getting ready.

<F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Bovkun: "Western Special Services Seek </F>
Sources of LDP Funding"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- At first it seemed that it was only kindred 
spirits from the radical right-wing "German People's Union" who 
were interested in Zhirinovskiy in Germany. It has now become 
clear that the Federal Investigation Service is putting together 
a file on him. 
  It is now known who invited "Adolfovich" (as one local paper 
said) to a mythical "European conference" in Berlin. The names 
of industrialists who have established cooperation with 
Zhirinovskiy have also found their way into the press. 
  The news story about the sources of the Liberal Democrats' 
capital seems far more convincing than the conjectures about aid 
from Saddam Husayn and Gerhard Frey [name as transliterated]. 
  So, what is the source of the Zhirinovskiy party's capital, 
according to the new version? 
  His relations with the well-known Netherlands firm Global 
Money Management, and with GMM in Russia, which is headed by 
Anton Nenakhov, continue to be discussed. A Dutch journalist 
spoke about this in an interview with Radio Liberty. 
  At the beginning of January, FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE wrote 
about Netherlands sources of the LDP's money, citing the Dutch 
newspapers DE VOLKSKRANT and ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD. The weekly 
WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE reported that Austrian police and German 
intelligence service personnel photographed Zhirinovskiy and his 
entourage in Austria. The magazine prints photographs of 
Zhirinovskiy, Vedenkin, Stoilov, and Neuwirth. 
  Nenakhov was among the industrialists who were hovering 
around Zhirinovskiy in the Reinsberg hotel in Reichenfels 
(Austria), WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE writes. German intelligence has 
corresponding photographs received from Austrian police, whose 
agent, disguised as a skier, secretly filmed what was going on 
in the hotel. 
  In Austria Zhirinovskiy's financial interests are 
represented 
by 23-year old Dmitriy Klinkov, who calls himself the commercial 
director of "IBS GmbH" and is constantly traveling between 
Moscow and Klagenfurt, WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE writes. One firm which 
is involved in trade with the East belongs to a former timber 
dealer, Josef Hambrusch, who is known to have maintained close 
contacts with Zhirinovskiy's partner Aleksey Vedenkin for a long 
time. According to the periodical PROFIL, he stated in Austria: 
"I am concerned that the party should have enough millions of 
dollars at its disposal. We are trading with this aim in mind, 
and this includes trade with local businessmen." The objects of 
trade are -- "petroleum, lumber, and everything that brings a 
profit." 
  With Hambrusch's help Zhirinovskiy has established 
connections with another entrepreneur -- Edwin Neuwirth, a man 
with a very curious biography. At 16 he voluntarily joined the 
SS and to this day remains a member of "Fellowship No. 4," which 
brings together former SS men. In 1950 he obtained Austrian 
citizenship and started to trade in lumber; he traveled to 
Russia and Yugoslavia. It is believed that the LDP conducted its 
financial transactions in Austria through him. 
  The third thread runs through Austria to the Balkans. A 
Bulgarian with an Austrian passport, Svetoslav Stoilov, is 
acting as middle-man for Zhirinovskiy; they met in Moscow a few 
years ago. He has a warrant personally signed by Zhirinovskiy 
28 December 1993. It says (I cite the translation from the 
German): "I hereby confirm that Mr. Svetoslav Stoilov is my 
adviser on questions of economics and entrepreneurship." 
  An Austrian police camera also captured Stoilov the 
consultant. However, he does not even hide his relationship 
with Zhirinovskiy. He willingly admits to journalists, for 
example, that he flew with him illegally (without a visa) from 
Austria to Greece, to Salonika, where "Vladimir bathed in the 
Aegean, and told him (Stoilov) there that he would be a most 
suitable president for Bulgaria, WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE writes. 
  Through Stoilov Zhirinovskiy maintains ties with Balkan 
entrepreneurs. One of them is the Serb Petar Ivanovic, who has 
lived in Austria since 1968 and owns the OWK petrochemical 
company. 
  Finally, another thread runs through Germany, to Berlin. 
There, on Kaiserin Augusta Allee, is the "Society for the 
Organization of Guardianship and Administration," which is 
officially involved in buying up enterprises in the former GDR 
and belongs to Werner Girke [surname as transliterated] and 
Werner Neumann. Both of them came to Austria in order to meet 
Zhirinovskiy. 
  In actual fact the firm is involved in something quite 
different. It has become known that until May 1990 it belonged 
to the Swiss holding "ORVAG AG," which laundered Socialist Unity 
Party of Germany [SED] money in Switzerland and Liechtenstein, 
multiplying the wealth of the GDR's party-state leadership. 
Following unification, the legacy of the SED fell to the Party 
of Democratic Socialism, the richest of all the FRG political 
parties. 
  FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU writes that Girke is suspected of 
laundering SED party money and that his contacts with 
Zhirinovskiy have seriously alarmed the Guardianship Council. 
  The same newspaper writes that the Berlin police have 
searched the premises of Girke's firm. According to its 
reports, Zhirinovskiy received at least 3 million German marks 
for the election campaign with Girke's help. Proof of this is 
provided notably by bank accounts and receipts seized by the 
Berlin police during the search. According to these documents, 
Zhirinovskiy received this money via transfers into bank 
accounts in Moscow and Prague in the form of payment for 
"consultations."

<F P=106> [Eduard Gonzalez article: "Cosmetic Reorganization of the </F>
Government Could Conceal Any Intention You Like"] 
  [Text] The publication of the Russian president's edict on 
the structure of the government has made a bizarre impact -- 
everybody has started to conjecture who will stay on as vice 
premier and who will be stripped of the title. As for the rest, 
the structural changes to the executive branch are unanimously 
acknowledged to be cosmetic: There were 30 ministries, now 
there will be 23; some the committees have been renamed, others 
have been transformed, and still others have been abolished. Is 
that all? 
  At first glance it is. But if we take another look, it 
becomes obvious that we now have a two-tier executive branch: 
The Russian Federation Government and the federal organs of 
executive power. This is the "cosmetic" aspect -- there used to 
be one tier, now there are two. And what are we to understand 
by the government? Is it the executive branch or is it a kind of 
special superstructure with the federal organs of executive 
power below? 
  Let us assume that this is so. But who then is in the 
government? According to the Constitution, it is the premier, 
his deputies, and the federal ministers. At the same time it 
has always been thought that the chairman of an intersector 
state committee is even higher than a sector minister. 
Provision has now been made in the structure for federal 
ministries and "other federal organs of executive power." We 
may assume that, in accordance with the Constitution, ministers 
will be part of the government unless the cabinet decides to 
restrict itself to five members. But what will happen to these 
"other organs"? 
  I do not wish to belittle anyone, but I think everyone will 
understand that the government will not include the directors of 
the Russian Insurance Activity Oversight Service or the Taxation 
Police Department. But what will be the position of the 
committees for industrial policy or machine building, or the 
counterintelligence and employment services? Finally, what 
about the Committee for the Management of State Property? I 
mean to say that their place among the "other federal organs" is 
fixed. But what is their position vis-a-vis the government? 
  It should be noted that, at this top level of political 
leadership, it is normally the case that nothing is ever "just 
so." Privatization began two-and-a-half years ago, and an 
appropriate law was adopted at the time. Among other things, it 
said that the chairman of Goskomimushchestvo [the State 
Committee for the Management of State Property] was a member of 
the government and an ex officio deputy premier. I cannot 
recall anyone rescinding that law, but the law, of course, is 
not the main issue -- the matter goes deeper than that. It is 
clear that at the time this committee was "elevated" because 
privatization had only just gotten under way. But what now? 
Maybe it has finished? 
  The privatization program is supposed to have been adopted 
quite recently, so it is continuing. Although it must be 
admitted that by no means everybody is enthusiastic about the 
way it is developing. Surely it would be better if 
Goskomimushchestvo were to forfeit all its influence over the 
members of the government -- the federal ministers -- and 
through them its influence over regional authorities? 
  Maybe Goskomimushchestvo has dropped down into the category 
of "other federal organs" because it has trodden on too many 
people's toes? In that case permit me to ask the central 
question: Generally speaking, what kind of government structure 
are we discussing? Everyone agrees that we are talking about a 
reform government. But privatization is at the heart of the 
reforms. Moreover, it is the part of the reforms, which gives 
something to people rather than taking it away from them. 
Incidentally, it is the only aspect of the reforms that has a 
clear, approved, and detailed program for the coming year. What 
reforms would the government implement if it were to drop this 
program? 
  My conjectures could be mistaken, however: After all, the 
edict says nothing about Goskomimushchestvo's being outside the 
government framework. The fact is that anyone can, if he so 
desires, interpret the words of the edict in whatever way he 
pleases. But in such cases it is usual practice to issue an 
interim, trial document, which includes room for maneuver rather 
than a totally definitive text. And, depending on the reaction, 
the lacunae are then filled in with specifics. The proposed 
structure, it should be recognized, could be filled with any 
content whatsoever, right up to state sector regulation of the 
economy. 
  It seems that the innovation involving dual subordination of 
certain organs belongs in the same experimental category. The 
Ministries of Defense, Internal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, and 
dozens of different services are part of the executive branch 
structure, but are also subordinate to the president. There is 
supposedly nothing unnatural about this, because the entire 
executive branch is subordinate to the president. He manages 
his own branch through the government, but how is he going to 
handle the elected representatives? He will apparently have to 
establish a special apparatus. But this is just another guess. 
  No, I am still not going to describe the changes in the 
government structure as cosmetic -- these changes raise too many 
questions. Serious questions to which we have not yet received 
any answers. However, there is a rule of thumb: If you want to 
find out answers, you first of all have to phrase your questions 
in such a way that they lead to the desired result. Or you may 
not wish to phrase any questions at all. You can simply wait 
for additional information to appear; which apparently will not 
be long in coming.

  [Text] Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko met 
with journalists in the press house today. Our correspondent 
Yelena Kuznetsova reports. 
  [Kuznetsova] At the start of the news conference, Vladimir 
Shumeyko analyzed the difficult situation that developed on the 
second day of parliament, when they were just one vote short of 
electing him chairman, and the way this situation changed by the 
third of work of the chamber. 
  [Begin Shumeyko recording] I would say this was a normal 
thing in a situation in which the chamber did not want 
confrontation of any kind among political groupings or factions. 
Nevertheless, there were people who hold pretty much polarized 
views over what is happening in the state right now. On the one 
hand you have the prevailing concept that we have to get 
parliament all working together. But many people think that in 
order to achieve this it is necessary to elect a leader who 
shares their political views. And gradually yesterday's voting 
showed this; it was natural that in the first instance 
everything should move apart. 
  Subsequently, an analysis of the situation overnight showed 
that if they continued in that direction no single group would 
gain more votes and the split would continue. This would 
eventually lead to mutual insults and so on. 
  The situation today showed that in fact common sense 
prevailed. [end recording] 
  [Kuznetsova] In response to a question about what should be 
avoided in the chamber's work, the Federation Council chairman 
said he will try to avoid behind-the-scenes intrigues and he 
hopes that there will be no factional activity in parliament. 
  Asked about possible cooperation with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
should the latter be elected speaker of the State Duma, Vladimir 
Shumeyko said quite unambiguously that he is obliged to 
cooperate since the law exists, regardless of one's attitude to 
one's partner. 
  Speaking of the Federation Council's obligation to ratify 
major international agreements, Vladimir Shumeyko said: 
  [Begin Shumeyko recording] If we are to speak about 
treaties, then we really are faced with complicated tasks. And 
here I would express solidarity first of all with the statement 
made by Foreign Minister Kozyrev, who said quite clearly that 
the West should stop moralizing and preaching at Russia. Russia 
is not a state that needs to be told what to do and so on. That 
is one thing. Another thing is that one of Russia's main 
priorities should be concern for the interests of what is 
referred to today as the Russian-speaking population. [end 
recording] 
  [Kuznetsova] Replying to a question about the appearance of 
a tough Communist opposition within the Federation Council, 
Vladimir Shumeyko named 12 people from various communist parties 
and noted the existence of quite a large group who share this 
ideology. Much will depend on which deputies are elected by the 
chamber. It is precisely this question that will be the main 
focus of the Federation Council's work on 14 January.

minister of Pakistan who is currently on an official visit to 
our republic. During the conversation, questions of the 
development of bilateral relations between Kazakhstan and

international issues. The minister said that the leadership of 
his country highly assesses the initiative of Nursultan 
Nazarbayev on confidence-building measures in the Asian region 
as a reliable basis for comprehensive international cooperation. 
  The Pakistani side expressed their wish to expand the system 
of transport communications. Due to the opening of new 
automobile routes, the first motorcade with a cargo of 
Kazakhstani goods will depart for Pakistan this summer. Also, 
the possibility of building a new railway and oil and gas 
pipeline between the two states is likely to be examined. The 
president of our republic proposed an agreement on holding a 
summit meeting of the heads of states of the Asian continent, 
suggesting that the United Nations Organization discuss the 
problematic issues in the life of the region, and displaying 
maximum diplomacy in order to reach calm and peace by joint 
efforts. 
  On the same day, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan 
Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali was received by Vice Premier Kuanysh 
Sultanov. The Pakistani side expressed their wish to develop 
cultural and scientific ties. The Pakistani diplomat said:"We 
are ready to tell you about the traditions and history of our 
state and in our turn are interested to learn as much as 
possible about Kazakhstan." It was suggested that a Pakistani 
book fair be organized in Almaty. Possibilities of exchanging 
TV programs were discussed as well as an exchange of guest 
performances of artistic collectives and opening an exhibition 
of paintings by artists from both countries. Educational 
institutions of Pakistan are ready to receive students from our 
republic. 
  Today at the Foreign Ministry of Kazakhstan, Tuleutay 
Suleymenov and Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali signed a protocol on 
consultations between the two sides on the issues of development 
of cooperation in the political, financial, economic, 
diplomatic, and other spheres. A news conference was held where 
the two foreign ministers answered numerous questions of 
Kazakhstani and foreign journalists. It was announced that the 
head of the Pakistani Government is going to visit Kazakhstan.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Berezovskiy report: "Kyrgyzstan: Eve of </F>
Referendum"] 
  [Text] Tashkent -- Kyrgyz sociologists are foretelling a 
heated political struggle over the upcoming 30 January 
referendum on confidence in President Askar Akayev. Recent 
polls conducted by the "Sotsiomarket" Research Center show that 
the people are by no means delighted with the state of affairs 
in the republic. Some 46.4 percent of respondents in principle 
do not approve the very idea of a referendum. Almost a quarter 
of them are prepared to vote against the incumbent head of state. 
  The reason is plain to see: 38.9 percent of respondents 
believe that the republic is rushing headlong into a crisis, 
while 29.3 percent are convinced that disaster has already 
struck. You can understand their viewpoint. The average wage 
in the republic is under 150 soms (around 20,000 rubles). While 
unemployment is putting more and more "surplus" manpower out of 
work at plants and factories. 
  The newspaper VECHERNIY BISHKEK has reported that the 
opposition wasted no time in holding a "Last Supper" to discuss 
the possible situation: What is to be done if Akayev does not 
win the people's support? It was decided then to "nominate" for 
president Feliks Kulov, a 44-year-old militia general and head 
of the Tashkent Oblast Administration, and offer the post of 
parliament speaker to 75-year-old Turdakun Usubaliyev, the 
former "top man," who ruled the republic for almost 25 years. 
  Interestingly, the latter seems to be already prepared to 
take on this role. When asked whether he would cope with the 
workload, Usubaliyev calmly remarked; "Gaydar Aliyev is doing 
OK...." Kulov, however, quickly rejected the "honor" he was 
accorded by the opposition and said that he is convinced that 
Askar Akayev will be victorious. 
  There is every indication that the president has no 
intention 
of letting the referendum take its own course. Local observers 
assessed Askar Akayev's recent statement of his readiness to 
grant dual citizenship to Russians and Germans as a desire to 
win their votes -- and they represent almost one-fourth of all 
voters. 
  But the president immediately met with opposition. 
  Communists, republicans, and social democrats who think that 
dual citizenship will halt the wave of Russian migration and 
strengthen ties with Russia as Bishkek's strategic partner side 
with Askar Akayev. 
  Political circles do not hide the fact that Askar Akayev is 
very much counting on Boris Yeltsin's support; the latter is 
expected to visit Kyrgyzstan on the eve of the referendum.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- Presidents Bill Clinton 
and Boris Yeltsin began their discussions in the Kremlin today 
in an atmosphere of sincere partnership, according to the 
Russian president's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov. Both 
sides were proceeding from an understanding that nothing is 
possible in this world without Russia and the United States, he 
said. 
  Despite the fact that Clinton's Air Force One landed in 
Moscow later than scheduled, the official ceremony of greeting 
in the Kremlin began a mere 11 minutes behind the schedule on 
Thursday morning. Bill Clinton arrived in the Kremlin from 
Hotel Radisson- Slavynskaya, where he stayed overnight, at 
09.11. The official ceremony of greetings took place, according 
to a tradition, in St. George's Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace. 
  President Boris Yeltsin recalled his first meeting with 
President Bill Clinton in Vancouver during which they laid the 
groundwork for Russian-American partnership as well as for their 
personal rapport and friendship. He said the atmosphere of the 
hall where they were meeting was conducive to the profundity and 
success of discussions. 
  Bill Clinton responded to Yeltsin's "welcome to Russia, 
welcome to Moscow" by stressing that cooperation between Russia 
and the United States at the present historical stage aimed to 
create a new security structure in Europe on the basis of 
democratic values and free economies which will further define 
the greatness of Russia. 
  The two presidents then spent almost 90 minutes together in 
the Green Hall of the Kremlin Palace discussing the latest 
developments in the two countries in the presence of the 
presidential aide Dmitriy Ryurikov, special advisor to the U.S. 
secretary of state Strobe Talbott and interpreters. 
  While the two presidents conferred in the Green Hall, the 
leaders of the diplomatic departments of Russia and the United 
States Andrey Kozyrev and Warren Christopher were working in the 
nearby Yellow Hall brushing up the package of Russo-American 
agreements and statements which the presidents were due to sign 
later. Three agreements are already fully ready for signing -- 
on air communications, on cooperation in the field of health 
care services and biomedical research, and cooperation in the 
study of radiation effects on humans and the environment. 
  A memorandum of intent to cooperate in export controls has 
also been prepared for signing, as well as a joint 
Russian-American statement on the Middle East. 
  The two presidents would also sign the main document -- the 
Moscow Declaration and make a statement on human rights and 
another on the nuclear non-proliferation. 
  After a walkabout between buildings of the Kremlin and a 
visit to the Assumption Cathedral, Yeltsin and Clinton returned 
to the Grand Kremlin Palace where they were joined by other 
officials to continue discussions which lasted until 14;00, 
longer than scheduled. 
  Commenting on the second session, Yeltsin's press secretary 
Vyacheslav Kostikov said the summit was taking place in a new 
political situation - after Russia adopted a new constitution by 
a popular vote. "Russia has joined the club of revolutionary 
democracies, and this cannot be overlooked in the process of 
discussions", Kostikov said. 
  He also pointed out that "the role played by the great 
powers 
in the world" will continue to enhance". Kostikov recalled that 
hopes for stabilization after the end of the Cold War failed to 
materialize in some parts of the world, including Yugoslavia, 
transcaucasus, and Latin America, and said that "the world needs 
a strong new order, and Russia will play its role of a great 
power in it". 
  Kostikov said Clinton and Yeltsin touched upon relations 
between president and legislature. Yeltsin recounted the latest 
developments in Russia following the December parliamentary 
elections. The two presidents also touched on the Brussels 
meeting of the NATO member states. Clinton set forth the key 
points of his Partnership for Peace initiative. "Russia does not 
yet know much about this initiative, and its full meaning has 
yet to be understood, but in any case the formula sounds 
attractive and gives food for thought," he said. 
  Clinton also touched upon the proposed extension of NATO. 
Both presidents said they understood the need and had the 
desire to work towards eliminating all lines of division in 
Europe. 
  The two presidents also considered ways of implementing the 
accords reached at the G-7 meeting in Tokyo. 
  Clinton-Yeltsin discussions will continue on Friday after 
the 
early-morning trilateral summit in which Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk will take part.

  [Text] "Russia will continue reforms and there is no 
question of their slow down." This remark, made by Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin when he met with his U.S. counterpart 
Bill Clinton at the head of a larger delegation, became the 
theme of the second hour-long meeting of the two presidents in 
the Kremlin Thursday. 
  Following the end of this round of talks Oleg Lobov, 
secretary of the National Security Council, told Interfax that 
the meeting had demonstrated "America's willingness to provide 
effective support for the Russian reform by paying some of its 
social costs." 
  In particular, Clinton assured the Russian president that he 
had succeeded in having Congress appropriate $900 Mn [Million] 
for aid to Russia in 1995. 
  Furthermore, numerous funds, especially one supporting small 
business, would be launched. The U.S.A. is prepared to allocate 
$300 Mn for that purpose. The Clinton Administration is making 
$100 Mn available for a recently established American-Russian 
reconstruction of large factories fund. 
  "Solid support" has also been pledged for Russia's joining 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Duties will be 
lifted from 4400 Russian products in the U.S. market. The U.S. 
secretary of commerce will arrive in Russia in March with a team 
of experts to study the possibility of closer contacts between 
U.S. businessmen and Russian state and privately owned 
businesses, Lobov said. In his words, Clinton asked Yeltsin to 
help in finding partners for U.S. businesses.

  [Excerpts] The first day of U.S. President Clinton's visit 
is drawing to a close. Our observer Yuliy Semenov is now live 
on the air from the president's country residence at 
Novo-Ogarevo, where Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin are at 
present. 
  [Semenov] [passage omitted] What is happening here now is an 
unofficial dinner, well, it is official for a small number of 
participants, the presidents of Russia and the United States and 
the officials accompanying them. 
  The Russian president arrived here a bit earlier and we had 
an opportunity to ask him a few questions about today's results. 
He is satisfied with the course of the talks. He said they 
discussed a very broad circle of questions, fundamental and 
global questions. He expressed his attitude to the concept of 
the Partnership for Peace and supported it. But in the main, 
the work of the two delegations was devoted to economic 
questions, questions of economic relations between Russia and 
the United States. In response to a question from correspondent 
about what sort of help Russia hopes to receive from the United 
States, the Russian president answered briefly: no more than was 
promised. 
  Tomorrow, he said, they will discuss mainly problems of 
Ukraine's nuclear disarmament and international questions. 
  Then President Clinton arrived. The Russian president, as 
the host, welcomed him, told him a little about local beauty 
spots and the features of the locality, and invited him to the 
table, noting that today Russia is marking the old-style New 
Year. 
  On this pleasant detail I end my report.

  [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- The Russian and US 
Presidents agreed to detarget their strategic nuclear missiles, 
aimed at each other's country by June 1994, thus ending nearly a 
50-year period when the two superpowers viewed each other as the 
main adversaries. 
  "The Presidents announced that they would direct the 
detargeting of strategic nuclear missiles under their respective 
commands so that by not later than May 30, 1994 those missiles 
will not be targeted", according to the Moscow Declaration 
signed by Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton on Friday. 
  "Thus, for the first time in nearly half a century -- 
virtualy since the dawn of the nuclear age -- the United States 
and Russia will not operate nuclear forces, day-to-day, in a 
manner that presumes they are adversaries", according to the 
document. 
  The Presidents also urged to end nuclear tests and observe 
the nuclear and other non-proliferation regimes. 
  They "strongly supported completion of negotiations on a 
comprehensive test ban at the earliest possible time" and 
"expressed concern over increasing challenges to global 
non-proliferation regimes", the declaration said. 
  The Presidents "agreed upon the need to strengthen those 
regimes and... to create a new mechanism to enhance 
transparency and responsibility in the transfer of conventional 
arms and sensitive dual use technologies", according to the 
document.

  [Text] The room is on the seventh floor of a hotel in the 
center of Vienna. It is a standard one. Aleksey Vedenkin set 
up his headquarters here at the beginning of the year. Vedenkin 
is the "number two" man behind Zhirinovskiy, the 
ultranationalist victor in the Russian elections, who has been 
frightening the world with threats to use nuclear weapons for 
weeks and has been making constant headlines. The room is full 
of files. There are thousand of photographs and some 
videocassettes on the window sill. There is a pile of business 
cards on his desk. The telephone keeps ringing. "They are 
businessmen," said Vedenkin, "who want to have contacts with us. 
They are literally falling over each other to get through the 
door." 
  Vedenkin took a sip of soda and with an air of superiority 
said: "They know who they have to bank on. Volfovich 
[Zhirinovskiy] will be the new Russian president and I will be 
his foreign minister. At the moment, I am the Liberal 
Democratic Party's [LDP] financial adviser and its spokesman on 
Europe." Zhirinovskiy's LDP, with 25.3 percent of the vote, was 
the clear winner in the Russian elections. In the new Duma 
(parliament), it has 66 seats. Right after the first parliament 
meeting Zhirinovskiy presented himself as the "new strong man" 
and announced the formation of a coalition with the communists. 
  Vedenkin said: "Thus, we finally have a say. In addition, 
we are Russia's richest party. I could rent entire floors of 
hotels, but that is something that we do not do." 
  Vedenkin's contact man in Austria is 60-year-old Svetoslav 
Stoilov, a Bulgarian by birth who has lived in Austria for about 
30 years. Stoilov has placed his automobile, office, and 
business contacts in Austria at the disposal of his Russian 
friends. He also organized Zhirinovskiy's trip to Bulgaria, 
which provoked a great furor. While Zhirinovskiy then flew 
directly back to Moscow from Bulgaria, Vedenkin, his companion, 
the 23-year-old Dimitriy Klinkov, and a bodyguard flew back to 
Vienna. Dimitriy Klinkov has lived in Austria for two years and 
is employed as a commercial director at the IBC trading company 
in Carinthia. He acts as an interpreter and money courier for 
the Zhirinovskiy team. 
<H5>  Apparatchiks and Ex-Nazis </H5>
  Working over a period of a few months, Vedenkin and his 
colleagues have succeeded in establishing a network of companies 
all over Europe. Zhirinovskiy's "Liberal Democratic Party" 
already has subsidiaries in Austria, Germany, Italy, France, 
Holland, and Switzerland. The "Russian Hitler's" team has been 
successful at skillfully operating on two levels: On one level, 
with his constant provocations, Zhirinovskiy keeps making 
headlines. Recently, he condemned President Clinton: "If he 
does not want to shake hands with me, then he should stay at 
home and play the saxophone." Thus, all public interest has 
focused on the figurehead, Zhirinovskiy. 
<H5>  Is the Mastermind a German? </H5>
  Vedenkin, on the other hand, stays in the background and 
directs things: He links up old Nazis such as the notorious 
German Gerhard Frey (the publisher of NATIONAL-ZEITUNG) or Edwin 
Neuwirth, the Carinthia-based timber trader, with the 
nomenklatura in Russia and the former east bloc. 
  Werner Girke from Berlin is supposed to be one of the 
masterminds. In the GDR, Girke was the financial director of 
the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany]. He had the 
authority to manage SED bank accounts in the FRG, Switzerland, 
and Luxembourg. Following the collapse of the GDR, he 
transferred millions for the SED successor party, the PDS [Party 
of Democratic Socialism]. He transferred about 100 million 
Austrian schillings to a Luxembourg bank account. He received 
the 100 million in cash and without signing a receipt. However, 
last summer, he returned the money to the Berlin Trust Agency. 
It is, however, suspected that Girke transferred millions for 
the KGB as well as the PDS. 
  Werner Girke was "on vacation" with Zhirinovskiy in 
Carinthia. He was accompanied by a smartly dressed man with gray 
hair who spoke with a Saxony area accent. Vedenkin said 
evasively: "All I can say about the second man is that in the 
past he had quite a say in the GDR's financial sector." 
Vedenkin went on to say: "Girke is one of our best friends. I 
spent six weeks with him in the fall and worked in his office in 
Berlin. He advised us and gave me a lot of good tips. The 
German authorities have know that for a long time. During my 
stay, the fiscal authorities even conducted an audit at Girke's 
office. No irregularities were found." 
<H5>  Zhirinovskiy on the NEWS Telephone </H5>
  Talking about the special relationship between Girke and his 
leader, Vedenkin said: "Girke visited also visited us in 
Carinthia during our vacation. However, he certainly did not 
move any millions around for us." 
  The short, thick-set 30-year-old paused and said: 
"Zhirinovskiy will confirm that, let's phone Volfovich." 
Vedenkin dialed a Moscow number. At the first attempt, a male 
voice replied at the other end of the line. Shortly afterward, 
Zhirinovskiy himself was on the line. He does not talk, but 
shouts: "Yes, I know Girke well. He is a respected businessman 
and a good friend of mine. However, his T.V.O neither financed 
me or my election campaign. The searches at his home are simply 
an act of revenge, because Girke invited me to Germany. 
Unfortunately, he sent the invitation to the German Embassy in 
Sofia, and that is how the authorities established that I am in 
contact with Girke." 
  Zhirinovskiy's voice became hoarse as he shouted down the 
phone. Then, he went on the offensive: "The KGB no longer 
exists, just as the CPSU no longer exists. In the past, the 
state controlled their accounts, and today, those accounts are 
controlled by former party members, who have transferred 
billions to the West following the putsch. Why is no one angry 
about that? There are also hundreds of former Communist Party 
companies in Austria, which are now doing marvelous business. 
These people are suddenly highly respected in the West. 
However, the game is over now." 
  Toward the end of the conversation, he announced that we 
wants to visit France and Spain in the next few weeks and also 
expects Germany to grant him an entry visa once again: "If I 
insulted the German people, then I want to apologize for that in 
every possible way. I am very sorry, it was not my intention to 
do so. Please pass that on to my German friends." 
  Then Zhirinovskiy put the phone down, but not before he had 
praised "Austria, that wonderful land of culture." We have 
reported on how much "culture" Zhirinovskiy experienced in 
Austria. However, the fact is that he returned to Vienna after 
his sojourn in Carinthia. He rented a penthouse apartment on 
the tenth floor of Vienna's Plaza Hotel before leaving for 
Bulgaria on Christmas Day. Actually, Zhirinovskiy also wanted 
to visit Slovenia and Croatia. Belgrade was also on his 
itinerary. The 57-year-old Montenegrin Petar Ivanovic wanted to 
organize a trip to Belgrade for Zhirinovskiy. Ivanovic operates 
the "Oweka Trading" company, the headquarters of which are on 
Vienna's Neuer Markt. "Oweka" is involved in trade between the 
former East Bloc and the West: "We buy and sell oil, copper, 
steel, everything," argued Petar Ivanovic and pointed out that 
his "Oweka" had sales of almost 700 million in 1990. In 
addition, Ivanovic is also an executive director for numerous 
other companies. "At the moment," conceded Ivanovic, "some of 
our companies are experiencing problems. The UN embargo against 
Serbia and Montenegro has particularly affected our companies." 
Is that why he is trying to get close to Zhirinovskiy (Ivanovic 
hired a special stretched Mercedes limousine for his trip to 
Carinthia)? Ivanovic: "Of course, Zhirinovskiy is the new man 
in Russia. Everyone who wants to do business with Moscow must 
come into contact with him." 
<H5>  Sinister Billionaire </H5>
  While Ivanovic was only one of the businessmen who just 
wanted "to establish contact" with Zhirinovskiy, Zhirinovskiy's 
true financial backer is supposed to be a woman. Aleksey 
Vedenkin said: "She is French and is called Miriam Selen." [name 
as published] She is supposed to be close to Jean Marie LePen. 
Vedenkin boasted: "She has contacts at all the highest levels 
and is considered one of the richest women in Europe." However, 
neither the editors of LE FIGARO's commercial section nor DER 
SPIEGEL's Paris bureau had heard of a "super-rich woman" of that 
name. 
<H5>  Broom Handles Made of Titanium </H5>
  However, having lit his tenth Marlboro within half an hour, 
Vedenkin insisted that "the world will be astonished when it 
sees what doors this businesswoman will open for us." He drew 
on his cigarette with obvious pleasure, then blurted out: "Both 
Zhirinovskiy and myself know exactly which members of the 
Communist Party have transferred billions to the West and are 
still doing so." He then cited an example: "Recently, a 
high-ranking CPSU functionary sent three train loads of brooms 
to Europe. Everyone was wondering why one would send brooms 
from Russia to Europe. The broom handles were not made of 
aluminum, but of titanium." 
  Business transactions worth billions are supposed to have 
been carried out in this way through Western front companies. 
"They trade weapons and drugs, and launder money. We will 
bring these people back to Moscow and make them appear in court. 
The contents of their bank accounts will be seized, and we will 
use the money to fly in food from Austria." 
  However, before then, Aleksey Vedenkin has got another 
problem: His Austrian visa is about to expire.

  [Text] Regarding the federal border guard service at the 
Russian border troops main command. This structure was set up 
very recently in accordance with the Russian president's decree 
of 30 December 1993. It is headed by Colonel General Andrey 
Nikolayev, commander of the border troops. At a recent briefing 
he summed up the results of the work of the border troops in 
1993, and also defined future tasks. In particular, it was 
stressed that the Russian border troops will continue to defend 
the external borders of a number of CIS states. This is what 
Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev said on this subject: 
  [Begin Nikolayev recording] In 1994 the units and subunits 
of 
the border troops will continue to defend -- on a contractual 
basis, worked out on an inter-governmental and interstate level 
-- the state borders in Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and 
Tajikistan, and to participate in the defense of state borders 
in Turkmenia. The documents on the joint defense of the borders 
have been signed, and now they must be put into practice. 
  In this connection it is important to stress that, first, 
the 
defense of the external borders of the commonwealth states is 
being carried out, first and foremost, for us Russians, in the 
interest of Russia itself. Second, this involves the guarantee 
of its national interests in the most important geo-political 
regions, where Russia's strategic interests exist, existed, and, 
hopefully, will continue to exist. 
  I agree that cooperation in defending the border, when 
sovereign independent states cooperate in defending the border, 
is a completely new thing. There is no such precedent in 
history. But history also has seen no such thing as a state 
breaking up into 15 states in the twinkling of an eye. You 
understand, two years have gone by, and we finally realized that 
it is very important to have not only rights in the CIS, but 
probably obligations as well. [end recording]

  [Text] Defending the rights and interests of Russian 
Federation citizens in the near abroad is one of Russia's main 
foreign policy tasks, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev declared 
today at a conference on issues of foreign policy regarding the 
CIS and Baltic countries. Andrey Kozyrev singled out a number 
of foreign policy trends in this region: strengthening economic 
positions, enhancing the effectiveness of actions taken, and 
creating new mechanisms for cooperation. 
  Speaking about problems relating to how the CIS economic 
union functions, the foreign ministry head commented that Russia 
should try to avoid hasty decisions, in particular where 
creating single currencies is concerned. At the same time, he 
gave a positive evaluation of the recent agreement between 
Russian and Belarus on the forthcoming unification of currency 
systems, describing this as a good example of a well-considered 
agreement, INTERFAX reports.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Aleksandr Krylovich and Georgy </F>
Shmelyov] 
  [Text] Moscow January 18 TASS -- Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev said on Tuesday [18 January] that it is necessary for 
Russia to keep its "military presence" in former Soviet 
republics in order to prevent forces hostile to Russia from 
filling in the "security vacuum". 
  The minister told a meeting of Russian ambassadors in the 
CIS 
and the Baltics that raising the issue of a complete end to 
Russian military presence is an "extreme approach". 
  According to Kozyrev, the solution lies in the middle 
between 
a complete withdrawal and full military presence. "We should not 
withdraw from those regions which have been the sphere of 
Russian interests for centuries and we should not fear these 
words about the military presence", the minister said. 
  A "security vacuum" will emerge as soon as the Russian 
troops 
leave the region which will be "inevitable filled in by forces 
which are often not friendly, and in many cases even directly 
hostile to Russian interests", Kozyrev said, adding that the CIS 
and the Baltics comprise a region of "priority vital interests 
for Russia which also poses the major threats to the interests". 
  The conflicts and problems in the former USSR directly 
affect 
Russian internal developments and everyday life, according to 
the minister who added that at the same time the region opens 
vast possibilities for better relations and friendly contacts, 
as well as for enhanced Russian influence. 
  Kozyrev listed the protection of the rights of Russians in 
the former Soviet republics as a major strategic foreign policy 
task and added that the issue of dual citizenship is the key one 
in the policy. "A better mutual understanding has been reached 
in this aspect of late", he said. 
  Other priority tasks include the creation and improvement of 
cooperation mechanisms, the drafting of a short-, medium- and 
long- term strategy of creating an economic union, according to 
Kozyrev. 
  He said an "individual approach" is necessary in this 
aspect, 
especially in monetary unification. "An all-round assessment of 
the issues is necessary and such mechanisms should be created 
which would allow Russia to avoid unjustified expenses while the 
republics would not feel themselves pushed aside and would not 
look for new partners", the minister said. 
  The CIS has already reached such a degree of maturity when 
it 
feels it desirable to "become a member of world processes". "It 
is developing from a regional into a global factor", Kozyrev 
said.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 14, BNS -- Estonian, Latvian and 
Lithuanian delegations to the Council of Europe [CE] decided in 
Vilnius Friday [14 January] that Russia must not be admitted to 
the organization until its troops are withdrawn from the 
territory of Latvia and Estonia. 
  The three delegations also discussed other conditions of 
Russia's membership in the CE, the head of the Lithuanian 
delegation, Algirdas Gricius, said at a press conference Friday. 
Russia has already fulfilled part of the demands -- it has a new 
Constitution and a new parliament, he said. 
  But, Lithuania and Estonia, as members of the council, and 
Latvia, which enjoys special guest membership, will insist that 
Russia solve national and ethnic problems on its territory. The 
Baltics also want Russia to assess the Soviet aggression upon 
the three states in 1940. Russia must also promise not to 
interfere with the internal affairs of other countries and "must 
become a normal state," said Tunne Kelam, member of the Estonian 
delegation. 
  In Vilnius, the three delegations coordinated their 
positions 
for the upcoming session of the CE General Assembly. The session 
will start in Strasbourg Jan. 24 and will reportedly focus on 
possibilities of expanding Europe politically. The three Baltic 
states agreed to support the idea of including the Caucasian 
region in the political map of Europe. 
  Lithuanians and Estonians decided to circulate a joint 
statement on the recent NATO summit in Brussels and a joint 
resolution of the Baltic Assembly on Russian army presence in 
Estonia and Latvia. 
  Roland Blezurs, secretary of the Latvian delegation, said 
this week's incident with the Russian military in his country 
revealed the kind of pressure that may be caused by the presence 
of foreign troops. 
  The three delegations also discussed the economic and 
political situation in the Baltic states.

  [Text] The Lithuanian and Estonian delegations at the 
parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe will object to 
Russia's admission to that organization. That position was 
stated at a news conference on Friday by the heads of the 
delegations, Algis Gricius, the Lithuanian parliamentary foreign 
affairs committee's deputy chairman, and Tunne Kelam, deputy 
chairman of the Estonian state assembly. 
  The stand on the issue was coordinated in Vilnius at a 
meeting of the Baltic delegations to the Council of Europe. The 
Lithuanian and Estonian position was supported by Latvia, which 
so far has guest status at the Council of Europe. 
  The Baltic states' key argument against Russia's admission 
to 
the Council of Europe is the presence of its troops on Latvian 
and Estonian territories. Besides, the heads of the Lithuanian 
and Estonian delegations said Russia must first solve its own 
problems and stop interfering in the internal affairs of other 
states. We are waiting for Russia, as the successor to the 
rights of the Soviet Union, to make an official statement on the 
1940 occupation of the Baltic states, Algis Gricius said. 
  The parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe is due 
to 
open in Strasbourg on 24 January.

  [Text] Unless Belarus' parliament ratifies the CIS Charter 
before January 23, the republic will be automatically removed 
from the composition of the Commonwealth, CIS Executive 
Secretary Ivan Korotchenya declared in his interview with 
Interfax. 
  He recalled one thesis from the CIS Charter confirmed by 
heads of states January 22, 1993 in Minsk. The document 
stipulates that "those sponsor states which adopt commitments 
according to the present Charter within a year after its 
adoption by the Council of Heads of States are member-states of 
the Commonwealth." At the same time Korotchenya stressed that 
"the Charter is brought into force for all sponsor-states, from 
the moment they hand over instruments of ratification for 
storage or for sponsor-states which will hand over their 
instruments of ratification in a year following adoption of this 
Charter." 
  According to Korotchenya, as of today only six states have 
ratified the CIS Charter, namely Armenia, Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Korotchenya 
said that they expected ratification from Azerbaijan and Georgia 
in the near future. Russia, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan have 
already forwarded their instruments of ratification to Belarus' 
governmental archives, to the country-depository of the CIS. 
  At the Ashgabat summit leaders of the Commonwealth countries 
have prolonged the term of ratification of the CIS Charter for 
Moldova for three months more, said Korotchenya. 
  The session of the Belarussian parliament is to resume its 
work in Minsk on January 18. Korotchenya, a people's deputy of 
this representative body, believes that the issue on 
ratification of the Commonwealth Charter "must be considered 
without any delay during the first day of the session's work."

  [Text] The council of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly 
is to resume work shortly. A session of the working group to 
elaborate a model civil code of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States will be held in the latter part of January in St. 
Petersburg. Also at the end of January, there will be a 
roundtable in St. Petersburg of the Interparliamentary Assembly 
for problems of development of the CIS with the participation of 
representatives of government bodies on interstate cooperation. 
Planned for early in February is a seminar on constitutional 
reforms in the Commonwealth countries. 
  The press service has also indicated that a more important 
start-of-the-year event will be held in February -- a session of 
the council of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, invited for 
which will be all the speakers of parliaments of CIS member 
countries. It will elect a new chairman of the council of the 
Interparliamentary CIS Assembly because the powers of the 
previous chairman -- Russian Parliament Speaker Ruslan 
Khasbulatov -- terminated at the end of last October. Andrey 
Mazhorov, head of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly press 
service, stated that the new head of the Russian Federation 
Federal Assembly will hardly seek this office. If the council's 
chairman should be elected in accordance with the positions the 
CIS countries occupy if ranked in Russian alphabetical order (as 
is accepted in some organizational structures of the 
Commonwealth), this seat could first be contested by Azerbaijan 
Parliament Speaker Rasul Guliyev. A CIS Interparliamentary 
Assembly chairman's term of office is one year. 
  The heads of parliament will also approve during the meeting 
a plan for 1994, and the rules of procedure and the agenda of 
the next plenary session of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly 
council.

  [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- Evening TV news focused 
today on the Russian-U.S. summit underway in Moscow. 
  According to the Novosti First Channel news program, Friday 
was the most saturated day of the Moscow visit of U.S. President 
Bill Clinton. 
  The final round of negotiations confirmed the two countries 
are working for partnership, said Novosti. A proof to it is the 
Moscow declaration and other documents signed here today. 
  In the opinion of the Russian TV Vesti news program, the 
tripartite agreement on elimination of nuclear arms stationed in 
Ukraine signed today by the Russian, U.S. and Ukrainian 
presidents is "historic". The document confirms non-nuclear 
status of Ukraine. 
  Novosti offered a report from the Spaso-Perovskiy Hospital 
visited by wife of the Russian President Naina and wife of the 
U.S. President Hillary. "Charity and sympathy are genuinely 
female feelings and it is good wives of the two presidents 
personify them," said the TV program. 
  Evening TV news also focused on work of the Russian 
parliament. Vesti reported in detail voting on candidates for 
deputies of the Federation Council speaker. 
  Federation Council members are "very independent, they will 
not blindly follow instructions of the president or the 
government head," Chairman of the Chuvash Council of Ministers 
Valeryan Viktorov told Novosti. Viktorov was elected today a 
deputy of the Federation Council speaker. He expressed the 
assurance Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko "will not 
involve in unnecessary confrontation between the president and 
the government". 
  "This can mean the beginning of the rouble exchange rate 
stabilization at a new level," said Vesti commenting on today's 
tenders at the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange when the 
exchange rate of DM [German mark] lowered by eight points. The 
dollar exchange rate remains the same. The cable stated 
preservation of a high demand for hard currency.
