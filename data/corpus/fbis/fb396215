  [Text] Moscow January 15 TASS--NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the 
Russian-U.S. summit: 
  "The latest summit has not introduced anything particularly 
new to the two countries' relationships. Expressions of Bill 
Clinton's support for Boris Yeltsin and his policy of economic 
reforms have been coming from across the ocean ever since 
Yeltsin himself broached the subject of reform. 
  "At the final press conference the two presidents did not 
say 
anything sensational similar to that which had been agreed upon 
in Vancouver or the Tokyo G-7 summit. 
  "In reference to Russian-U.S. relations, the Moscow summit 
can be referred to as a working, scheduled, and routine one 
rather than historic. Were it not for the Ukrainian nuclear 
weapons issue and the Friday signing of the 
Russo-Ukrainian-American agreement to eliminate them, one could 
not have derived from Clinton's visit to Moscow what is usually 
expected from a meeting between the presidents of great powers". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the live broadcast of Bill Clinton's 
remarks from the studio of the Ostanikino television centre: 
  "The Americans did not miss the opportunity to show their 
president in what he is at his best: producing impression on the 
audience and winning it over. Who knows what moved Russian 
citizens more--the political results of Bill Clinton's visit or 
his sociability and openness (at the needed moment) before 
ordinary people". 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA on U.S. President's first European tour: 
  "The first European tour along the 
Brussels-Prague-Kiev-Moscow-Minsk-Geneva route was apparently 
conceived, firstly, with a view to giving a boost to the 
international prestige of the U.S. President and, secondly, once 
again showing support for Boris Yeltsin, the support which the 
Russian president is permanently in need of". 
  ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA carries an article by Igor Vlasov, a 
section head at the committee to the president of the Russian 
Federation on convention-related problems of chemical and 
biological weapons. 
  "All stocks of chemical weapons of Russia are now stored in 
special arsenals of the Russian Defence Ministry--seven chemical 
'thorns' in the body of Russia.... The aggregate amount of 
chemical weapons is 40,000 tonnes.... The process of 
eliminating the weapons, provided the Paris convention is 
ratified, is expected to be started in 1997". 
  IZVESTIA on Moscow diplomatic circles' irritation with 
Azerbaijani president's actions: 
  "In Moscow diplomatic circles, there is felt a certain 
irritation with the actions of Azerbaijani President Gaydar 
Aliyev. In words he favours a political solution to the 
conflict (in Nagorno-Karabakh -- note by ITAR-TASS) while in 
actual fact he is not in a hurry to discontinue the use of force. 
  "This is possibly accounted for by the fact that the 'war 
party' in Aliyev's entourage is much more influential than the 
advocates of power politics among the associates of Armenian 
leader Ter- Petrosyan. One gathers the impression that the 
internal political positions of former Politburo member Aliyev 
are hardly better than those of his unlucky predecessor 
Elchibey". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) carries an interview with police 
Colonel-General Mikhail Yegorov, Russia's first deputy minister 
of the interior and chief of the main department for combatting 
organised crime. 
  "As of the end of 1992, 2,800,000 crimes were committed as 
against 1,200,000 in 1987, that is, the number of crimes grew by 
almost 150 per cent, that of grave crimes by 160 per cent and 
murders -- by 150 per cent. Last year we manage to break the 
dynamics of crime growth from 26 per cent (1992) to 1.4 per cent 
in 1993. The grave crime rate decreased from 31.2 to 23.6 per 
cent respectively," Yegorov told the newspaper. 
  TRUD on the discovery of Americium-241 near Chernobyl. The 
newspaper maintains that Americium-241, a radioactive element 
which is utterly hazardous to human health, has been found in 
the area of the chernobyl nuclear power station. The element's 
"semi-decay period is approximately 430 years. It is extremely 
toxic and brings about strong mutations in living organisms". 
  Another element ostensibly discovered in the area -- 
Americium- 242 (which disintegrates into beta particles) has a 
period of existence of almost 16 hours. "But the element has an 
extremely small critical mass -- i.e., it is capable of 
exploding even in minute quantities. The `sarcophagus' which 
protects the world from the damaged reactor (of the Chernobyl 
nuclear power station -- note by ITAR-TASS) now possibly cracks 
and literally bursts at the seams precisely due to the 
microexplosions of Americium which accumulates in the 
sarcophagus walls". 
  VECHERNY PETERBURG reports that the city police 
headquarters' 
emergency rescue service has summed up the results of the past 
year. There were 29,336 fires last year, 5,815 more than in the 
previous year, with 350 people dying in the fires or being 
mortally poisoned with carbon monoxide. There were 12 children 
among the victims of the fires. The aggregate damage inflicted 
by the fires amounted to more than 138 million roubles.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, January 18 (TASS) -- Yegor Gaydar's 
statement about his resignation from the post of the first 
vice-premier of the Russian Government is the leading topic in 
today's Moscow-based press. 
  ROSSIISKIYE VESTI carries pronouncements by prominent state 
and public figures under the front-page banner headline: "A 
Cabinet Reorganisation All of a Sudden Resulted in a Sunday 
Governemtnt Crisis". 
  The newspaper runs the text of Gaydar's letter to President 
Boris Yeltsin. In the letter, gaydar expressed regret over the 
fact that decisions, in the preparation of which he did not 
participate and which he categorically objected to, used to be 
adopted increasingly often recently. 
  IZVESTIYA: 
  Gaydar's resignation was unexpected but not more than an 
earthquake in a quake-prone area. One can take various views of 
the policy suggested by Gaydar two years ago, but "the 
liberalisation of prices..., privatisation -- all are directed 
associated with Gaydar and his team, just as, incidentally, the 
decline in the living standards of a large proportion of people, 
shut-downs of factories and other hard problems connected with 
attempts to cure the chronic totalitarianism by means of a shock 
therapy". 
  TRUD queries whether the resignation of the first 
vice-premier signifies a cardinal change in the reform policy, 
pointing out that "if a future government will lack Gaydar, 
Fedorov, Chubays and Pamfilova (the latter three are ministers 
in charge of finance, privatisation, and social protection of 
the population), the world community would view that as a sign 
that radical reforms in Russia are done away with." 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on First Vice-Premier Yegor 
Gaydar's resignation: 
  Noting that Gaydar's example is being followed by other 
members of the Russian Governemnt, the newspaper points out that 
this happens at a noteworthy moment -- elections to the Federal 
Assembly (parliament) were held recently and parliamentary and 
political blocs have undergone a considerable regrouping. Next 
crucial moment in the life of Russia will be not so distant 
presidential elections. 
  "Since representatives of the blocs hurried to distance 
themselves from the present government, it is quite logical to 
suppose that this is more advantageous that sharing 
responsibility with it". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the same subject: 
  The newspaper believes that Gaydar's resignation "cannot 
change in any way the nature of an economic policy of the Viktor 
Chernomyrdin government, because the governemnt had no policy to 
this effect even after Gaydar's comeback". 
  "The point is that reforms-related theorising receded into 
the background six months ago with regard to the cabinet's 
trouble- shooting activities". 
  PRAVDA strongly criticises the shock therapy policy, at the 
rise of which Gaydar stood. 
  "Is it not his policy of slashing credits to industrial 
enterprises that leads to their shut-down everywhere and a steep 
increase in unemployment? Was it not he who wanted a common 
rouble zone within the CIS when the International Monetary Fund 
wanted it? Why then does he lament this?" 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, touching upon the work of the State 
Duma, 
points out in particular: 
  "Fully confirmed has been the forecast that not a single 
side 
in the duma would have a solid edge while political clashes 
would get exacerbated and become even keener than was the case 
in the Supreme Soviet". 
  TRUD carries an interview with President Nikolay Fyodorov of 
Chuvashia. "I am convinced that Chuvashia can develop and really 
prosper only as part of Russia", he said.

  [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
have signed here today, after the third round of the 
Russo-American summit talks, an agreement on cooperation in 
studying radiation after-effects with a view to minimise 
radioactive pollution hazards to human health and the 
environment. 
  The purpose of this document is to lay the foundations for 
close and long-term cooperation in studying radiation hazards to 
human health and to the environment. 
  Russia and the United States will jointly study the 
aftermaths of the exposure of humans to ionising radiations, 
will organise the collection and processing of data on radiation 
hazards, will study the environment, and will conduct 
corresponding scientific research. 
  A joint coordination committee will be set up to study the 
after-effects of radiation. The document notes that the sides 
shall ensure an adequate and effective protection of 
intellectual property, created or handed over under the current 
agreement, and conclude corresponding accords on its 
implementation. 
  The agreement will remain in force for five years, subject 
to 
repeated prolongation for the same term.

  [Text] Moscow, 14 Jan -- U.S. President Bill Clinton, while 
addressing President Yeltsin and his wife Naina Yeltsin at an 
official dinner in the Faceted Hall of the Moscow Kremlin, 
pointed out that Russia's revival is due, to a great extent, to 
the Russian president. The U.S. leader said that "under your 
leadership Russia is building a market economy," and that "this 
great multi-ethnic democratic state is being cemented with the 
ideals of freedom and trust." 
  Bill Clinton went on to say that "yesterday I visited the 
Kazan Cathedral. The ancient church was recently rebuilt from 
new materials but nevertheless, its stands on its ancient 
foundations. It is exactly the same with Russia, Mr. President, 
which is creating a new society, yet it has its roots in the 
greatness of your history and your people." 
  Raising a glass to the Russian president, Bill Clinton 
proposed a toast "with deep respect and admiration to the great 
peoples of Russia and the United States and to the bright and 
firm prospects of freedom which enlightens our common future."

  [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin spoke at the state dinner given in honor of U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, in the Kremlin 
Hall of Facets Friday evening. Follows the full text of his 
toast: 
  "Mr. President, Mrs. Clinton, dear guests, ladies and 
gentlemen, 
  I think you will agree with me in saying that these last 
days 
brought a special meaning to our life and activity. The world 
is watching the events in Russia. Amid the stormy political 
developments which dominate Moscow's current life, the visit of 
the president of the United States of America nonetheless 
attracted particularly close attention. 
  Our meeting testifies to the fact that Russia is concerned 
not only with its own problems, but feels itself an integral 
part of the world community, and shares in the world's anxieties 
and hopes. 
  Time flies unbelievably fast during official visits. 
Literally all of the available time is scheduled, and we, Mr. 
President, have succeeded in making the utmost use of every 
minute. The key is not only in the fact that the visit was 
thoroughly prepared in advance. Most importantly, both the 
Russian and American sides had a sincere desire to reach a 
mutual understanding and give our partnership a new, global 
scope. 
  Each of our discussions with President Clinton was direct 
and 
honest. We spoke about the most important problems and didn't 
shun acute issues, looking for unconventional solutions to them. 
This, I believe, is the way of both the Russian and American 
peoples. 
  The ground-breaking results of the Russian-American summit 
in 
Moscow are not the only reason why this day is important. 
Russia celebrates January 14 as the first day of the New Year, 
according to the Russian Orthodox calendar. We have always 
observed this day, even in the hardest times. 
  In line with Russian tradition, I would like to wish our 
American guests and all those present good health and well-being 
in the new year. The year that has begun is new for Russia in 
every sense of the word. The country has entered this year with 
a new constitution which meets modern, civilized standards. The 
Federal Assembly, elected by free and democratic vote, has begun 
its work. In these past elections, the citizens of Russia 
reaffirmed their commitment to internal peace and stability, 
democracy, and Russia's renewal. 
  Along with this, it is as clear as always that all 
developments in Russia are of vital importance for the whole 
world. Now we need to be sincerely supportive of each other's 
success, since the resolution of Russia's problems is a key 
factor in achieving global stability and confirming the basic 
values of the modern world. 
  It is not enough to mouth these values. It is necessary to 
bring one's actions into line with them in order to achieve 
tangible results. Only then will the recognition of these 
values in every country lead to the success of the entire world 
community. 
  Life in a free and democratic society must be better both 
for 
the common people of every single nation, and for the whole 
world community. This is not only about upholding ideals, but 
also about providing people with everything necessary for a 
worthy life. This goal cannot be attained without pooling our 
efforts, without defining our partnership in practical terms. 
Together we shall overcome. To me, this famous phrase means 
that only together can we ensure the triumph of freedom 
everywhere in the world and, most importantly, in the hearts of 
the people who live in it. 
  We appreciate the active role played by the present U.S. 
Administration in mobilising international support for Russian 
reforms. But of course, we would welcome the further 
intensification of these efforts. Economic interaction is now 
moving to the centre of the Russian-American partnership in all 
its diversity. 
  It is necessary to speed up the implementation of the Tokyo 
Accords. It is very important for us to have a respite in 
repaying our external debt. We want fair access to the American 
and world markets, an expansion of trade and investments, and 
assistance to Russia in creating the infrastructure needed for a 
civilized market economy. 
  Ever more people in our countries are now keeping an eye on 
the rouble exchange rate against the dollar and the dynamics of 
stocks and shares on exchange markets in Moscow and New York. 
This is an encouraging sign of our transition to a normal, 
civilized financial system. 
  I can say more: For the first time, it is now becoming 
possible to form long-term, diversified links between our two 
economies. This is a reliable foundation on which to build our 
strategic partnership. The prospect of creating a free trade 
zone between the two countries deserves special attention. 
  On the whole, a variety of bilateral ties between Russia and 
the United States is now being actively developed. 
  The Russian-American dialogue is increasingly centering 
around relatively new problems, including the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction and their delivery-vehicles, 
regional arms races, as well as outbursts of nationalism and 
other kinds of extremism. 
  All this does not mean, of course, that there are no 
problems 
in the Russian-American relationship. But the main thing is 
that both we and the Americans consider the solution to these 
problems attainable through dialogue in which both sides are 
equally interested and which is based on commonality of our 
long-term national interests. 
  In closing, I would like to recall the words of the 
far-sighted traveller and thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, who 
wrote more than 150 years ago that there are two great nations 
in the world at present, which began their movement from 
different starting points, but seem to be progressing towards 
the same objective. I mean the Russians and the Americans. 
Their origin is different, and their paths are dissimilar, but 
nevertheless both appear to be among God's chosen nations. 
  History has offered us a unique chance to realize the full 
potential of partnership and friendship between our two great 
states. Democratic Russia is ready to make full use of this 
potential. Permit me to propose a toast to the health of the 
President of the United States and his wife and to the 
well-being and prosperity of the American and Russian peoples."

for U.S. President Bill Clinton at the Kremlin in Moscow-- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed Mr. President of the United States, 
esteemed Mrs. Clinton, esteemed members of the U.S. delegation: 
  The first official visit by the U.S. President to Russia is 
drawing to a close. I want to express my opinion that this 
visit has been extremely successful. It has demonstrated once 
again that we must indeed be partners and must deepen that 
partnership. We must indeed live together on this small planet 
and try to ensure peace and security, not only in our two 
countries but throughout the world. 
  I thank you, Mr. President, for taking advantage of the 
opportunity and for getting to know the people of Russia, the 
people of Moscow--in the streets, in shops, at Ostankino, and in 
other places--and for seeing for yourself that the people want 
reform and for seeing that the people want freedom and democracy. 
  I think that you have obtained a better knowledge of the 
people of Russia during the visit, and the people of Russia now 
have a better idea of the President of the United States of 
America. 
  I want to wish you bon voyage on your return journey, 
happiness to your families, and prosperity to America and the 
American people.

  [Text] Moscow January 15 TASS--U.S. President Bill Clinton 
and his wife have just left here by air for Minsk at the close 
of a three-day official visit to Russia. 
  The chief result of the Russian-U.S. talks in Moscow is in 
the signing of a Moscow declaration by the two presidents, the 
declaration which reaffirmed the importance of Russian-U.S. 
cooperation for global stability, as well as in a joint Russo- 
American-Ukrainian agreement on the removal of nuclear weapons 
from Ukraine's territory. The agreement became a breakthrough 
in the field of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
  In all, 12 bilateral documents were adopted during the 
summit.

  [Excerpts] Moscow, 14 Jan--U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
visit to Moscow was packed with important talks, meetings with 
public and political figures, and protocol events. [passage 
omitted] 
  At a routine briefing today, a high-ranking White House 
spokesman, who asked not to be named, summed up the preliminary 
results of the Moscow summit. He said that President Bill 
Clinton had fulfilled the tasks before him: to confirm 
partnership relations between the United States and Russia that 
were established in Vancouver, to express firm support by the 
United States for the economic and political reforms in Russia, 
and also to develop ties with a wider spectrum of political 
forces in the country. 
  According to the briefer, the main themes of the talks in 
Moscow were economic reforms in Russia, the "Partnership for 
Peace" program, and also disarmament. The White House spokesman 
said that the most important event was, perhaps, the signing 
this morning of a trilateral agreement between Russia, Ukraine, 
and the United States on eliminating nuclear weapons deployed on 
Ukrainian territory. 
  He said also that the leaders of both countries had 
discussed 
both yesterday and today the question of the presence of Russian 
troops in Latvia and Estonia. "We think that progress has been 
made in this area and very much hope that agreements on troop 
withdrawal will be concluded soon between Russia and Latvia and 
between Russia and Estonia," the White House spokesman said.

  [Text] As Russia's Foreign Minister Kozyrev reported to 
Interfax on Saturday [15 Jnauary], President Yeltsin's return 
visit to U.S. was scheduled for autumn this year. 
  Turning back to the Russo-American summit in Moscow, he 
noted 
that its main task to hold it in the conditions of mature 
partnership was completed. "The main sensation of the summit is 
the absence of a sensation. We are proceeding to institutional 
and systematic partnership," Kozyrev stressed. 
  In his opinion, the Moscow meeting marked a stage in the 
development of smooth Russo-American trade. He singled out "the 
uranium bargain" as supplementary to the space deal and said 
that both contracts covered a long period (10-15years) and could 
fetch billions in profit. 
  He noted that in Moscow the presidents also discussed 
economic partnership. "In economics, partnership means 
something other than a short-term credit or a portion of 
humanitarian aid. It's day-to- day work to integrate markets in 
international systems rather than to "patch up a hole." It 
means negotiations with a long prospective and realization that 
Russia is a great economic power. That's precisely what was 
done at the Moscow summit, Kozyrev said. 
  He specifically stressed that "least of all" did he regard 
the Russo-American-Ukrainian understandings as the chief result 
of President Clinton's visit to Russia. 
  The agreements concerning the withdrawal of nuclear weapons 
from Ukraine "are important, but they will bear fruit only 
during their implementation. There is nothing new in these 
accords," he said. 
  Kozyrev recalled the signing of similar accords with 
Ukraine. 
"At a CIS summit in Almaty two years ago, an agreement was 
signed to oblige Ukraine to follow Belarus and Kazakhstan in 
becoming a nuclear- free country and remove weapons... Then, 
numerous meetings followed in Crimea, Moscow, Kiev, etc. 
Interaction on this problem with Americans is nothing new 
either since the Lisbon protocol was signed with U.S 
participation." 
  Nonetheless, Kozyrev hopes that now when the accords are 
fixed at the level of Russian, American, and Ukrainian 
presidents, they will yield result. "All of us are full of 
optimism. It would be strange, if the agreements, signed by the 
presidents, remained on paper," he noted.

  [Text] Moscow January 17 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's top adviser academician Andranik Migranyan hailed the 
success of the U.S.-Russian summit meeting that was held in 
Moscow last week. 
  Commenting on the achievements of the summit meeting 
Migranyan said that "the president of Russia admitted the need 
to seek a new architecture of European security, saying that the 
partnership for peace concept born within the NATO is not the 
only possibility." By this he indirectly admitted the need to 
establish such a system of European security in which all 
countries of eastern Europe would have equal rights in adopting 
decisions to maintain peace and stability, the academician said. 
  Secondly, the U.S. side confirmed "Russia's special role in 
maintaining stability on the territory of the post-Soviet 
space," Migranyan said, referring to the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian 
agreement to eliminate Ukrainian nuclear weapons. 
  Additionally, "the U.S. President went further than making 
declarations and or giving advice, he concluded concrete 
agreements with Russia to open the American market to Russian 
goods and include russia into the GATT as an equal member," as 
well as integrate it into other international financial and 
economic structures. 
  The academician also welcomed Clinton's decision to help 
defend the rights of Russian minorities in the Baltic states.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Gornostayev report in the "Summit Meeting" column: </F>
"The Expression of Support and Gratitude. In Addition to This, 
the Yeltsin-Clinton Meeting Also Has Some Other Results"] 
  [Text] The just concluded meeting between the Russian and 
U.S. Presidents has not brought anything new in the relations 
between these two countries. Bill Clinton's expressions of 
support for Boris Yeltsin and his course toward economic reforms 
have been heard from across the ocean ever since the moment when 
Yeltsin himself started talking about them. The presidents did 
not report anything sensational at their final press conference, 
like what they agreed on in Vancouver or at the Tokyo G-7 
meeting. The Moscow summit with respect to Russian-U.S. 
relations can be described as working, regular, and transient 
rather than historic. Were it not for the issue of the 
Ukrainian nuclear weapons and yesterday's signing of the 
Russian-Ukrainian-U.S. agreement on their abolition, Clinton's 
visit to Moscow would not have justified the usual expectations 
of a meeting between the presidents of great powers. 
  An exception here might be a $12 billion contract signed 
yesterday in Moscow on the sale of Russian weapons-grade uranium 
to the United States over a period of 20 years which will be 
processed into nuclear power plant fuel with U.S. assistance. 
But this question too could have been dealt with during the 
visit to Russia by Vice President Albert Gore, which was 
precisely of an economic character. 
  Yet the latest meeting of the presidents has its own results 
which are perhaps worth elaboration. The most outstanding among 
them may be the accord on lifting most of the discriminatory 
economic restrictions on Russian goods entering the U.S. market. 
This is far more important for the prestige of the Russian 
Federation than the reception of economic aid packages some of 
which -- for instance, the Tokyo one last July -- are allocated 
only in word. Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin at the 
final press conference with his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton 
stressed that Russia needs full-fledged collaboration with the 
West, not "humanitarian aid." Therefore, by renouncing the 
status of a state being dragged out of the mire of economic 
crisis by others, Russia is putting itself in the same rank with 
the developed countries. This is also evident from Yeltsin's 
words, which showed that he sees the prospect of G-7 soon 
turning into G-8. Possibly this will happen in July at the G-7 
Naples summit to which the Russian president has been invited. 
  He told journalists that relations between Russia and the 
United States "have been developing in a stable and partner-like 
manner," but they need adjustment, especially in the social 
sphere. Russia is not expecting direct social assistance from 
the United States because, according to Yeltsin, "such support 
is needed by the United States itself": It is impossible to 
help Russia overcome unemployment without having overcome its 
own unemployment in the first place. 
  Touching on this social issue, Boris Yeltsin thus apparently 
sought to hedge against possible attacks on the part of a number 
of opposition forces in parliament who are accusing him of 
lacking a social security policy. Furthermore, the president 
uttered a seemingly flattering phrase with respect to the 
parliamentarians: "I do not think that we have a bad parliament. 
It is more intelligent and more intellectual, and with great 
experience. The upper chamber will follow the president's line 
and the State Duma will come around to that." Although it was 
spoken in linkage to the issue of ratification of international 
treaties, Boris Yeltsin apparently also had the domestic aspect 
in mind. The implication behind this phrase is approximately as 
follows: "I am commending you and you should learn to listen to 
me. If you do, I shall praise you again." 
  The joint statement by the Russian and U.S. Presidents on 
securing human and ethnic minority rights, which primarily 
applies to the Baltic countries, was fairly important but 
unfortunately little more than a mere declaration. Boris 
Yeltsin described this statement as "having teeth." After its 
concessions to Moscow on the issue of NATO expansion the United 
States has once again shown who is more important for it. And 
here, judging by how feebly Clinton agreed with Yeltsin's 
statements at the press conference, presumably there was some 
pressure involved there. In the situation of misunderstanding 
that has developed between Russia and the Baltic republics, the 
White House has in the end taken the Kremlin's side. 
  As for NATO, by inviting the East European countries into 
the 
Partnership for Peace, the North Atlantic alliance, according to 
Clinton, is giving a chance to all of them to become 
full-fledged members of this structure. Today the Partnership 
for Peace will be conducive to preventing a division of Europe 
and Russia's separation from it. 
  Both Clinton and Yeltsin noted that there have been 
disagreements in the course of the talks. But at the press 
conference only one such issue cropped up on which the 
presidents hold different points of view -- the conflict in 
Bosnia and the possibility of bombing it with NATO forces. On 
this problem the heads of the two states did not come to 
agreement but, in Clinton's words, a frank conversation on this 
subject created the foundation for future discussions. 
  Apparently fearing "embarrassing" questions, especially 
after 
the words about disagreements between the two friends, 
Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian Federation president's press 
secretary, gave no opportunity to representatives of Russian 
newspapers to ask any questions. Journalists from third 
countries were also denied this possibility. 
  So, it can be stated that the main result of Bill Clinton's 
visit to Moscow has been the signing of the trilateral agreement 
on the destruction of Kiev's nuclear weapons. Importantly, on 
Yeltsin's initiative. As for Russian-U.S. bilateral relations, 
there have been no particularly outstanding moves. But then, 
where is one supposed to move as long as things in this respect 
are as good as they can possibly be: President Boris Yeltsin is 
friendly with Bill Clinton and the people of the Russian 
Federation with the people of the United States.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS news analyst Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 15 TASS -- The importance of U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's official visit to Russia on January 
13-15 was outlined in the most general form in remarks made by 
his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin at a joint news conference 
in the Kremlin: the two powers' relationhip have finally entered 
the stage of mature strategic global partnership in very respect. 
  This originated during the Vancouver summit in April last 
year. It was not fortuitous that the word "Vancouver" was 
pronounced repeatedly in Moscow these days. And still, the 
Moscow dialogue of the two presidents has its own value: 
intentions and promises predominated last year, whereas this 
time the two sides stated that they begin to work. 
  This is of importance in itself because not every intention 
gets rapidly translated into life, which has been evidenced, in 
the opinion of the Russian side, by its experience of contacts 
with the Group of Seven (G7) as a whole. Out of all G-7 
leaders, Boris Yeltsin believes, only Bill Clinton fulfilled all 
his promises to Russia. 
  Mr Cliton also attained the goals of his current trip, 
according to his own estimates: To reaffirm partnership 
relations between the U.S. and Russia and express U.S. support 
for economic and political reforms in Russia. Singled out among 
subjects of discussion can be economic reforms in Russia, a 
European security system in the post- cold-war era, disarmament, 
and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
  Partnership is the leading idea of the Moscow declaration -- 
the central document signed by the two presidents. It is stated 
in the declaration in particular that "the two presidents 
announced that they would direct the detargeting of strategic 
nuclear missiles under their respective commands so that by not 
later than May 30, 1994 those missiles will not be targeted. 
Thus, for the time in nearly half a century, virtually since 
the dawn of the nuclear age, Russia and the United States will 
not operate nuclear forces, day- to-day, in a manner that 
presumes they are adversaries." 
  In a joint statement, the two presidents undertook jointly 
to 
seek ways to strengthen guarantees of security for states which 
renounced the possession of nuclear weapons and strictly observe 
their obligations. 
  The January 14 signing of a Russo-american-Ukrainian 
agreement on the removal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine's 
Territory became a real breakthrough in this respect. President 
Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, who had arrived in Moscow by air 
expressly for this purpose, described this as a historic moment. 
  Ukraine in actual fact agreed to become a non-nuclear 
country. In exchange for that, Kiev received guarantees of 
security and compensation for getting rid of nuclear arms in the 
form of fuel- grade uranium which Russia together with the U.s. 
will produce by processing weapon-grade uranium, and the removal 
of obstacles to the development of Ukraine's economic relations 
with foreign countries. 
  Support for Russian reforms was, perhaps, the principal aim 
of Bill Clinton's mission. Only provided there is a stable and 
democratic Russia with a free economy, it is possible to build a 
new world order in the post-cold-war era on the basis of those 
values which are close to America and other civilised nations. 
  Previously, Washington declared its support for the 
liberalisation of the Russian economy in general -- the quicker 
the better. This time Bill Clinton placed social problems 
related to the transition to a free market economy almost in the 
centre of attention. 
  Although Clinton, during the Ostankino teleshow, jokingly 
remarked that he was not going to give up Alaska, in response to 
pronouncements by another well-known hero of live broadcasts, 
everything seems to indicate that the leader of the country with 
the classical liberal economy has come to realise the essence of 
the problem: disregard for social welfare development may cost 
one dear. 
  Mutual understanding was also reached to the effect that 
Russia does not count on U.S. direct assistance in this respect 
but suggests opening the U.S. market to Russian commodities and 
technologies and lifting trade restrictions, proceeding from the 
assumption that Russia itself, according to Boris Yeltsin, will 
seek ways to resolve social problems upon effecting an economic 
restructuring. 
  Among the 12 documents adopted during the summit, there are 
those which mark the beginning of the removal of cold-war 
obstructions in the trade-and-economic sphere. 
  With the consent of other countries concerned, the U.S. 
announced the Export Control Committee (COCOM) -- the body which 
hindered the export of high technologies to Russia -- would be 
dissolved not later than March 31. Discriminatory restrictions 
on the export of Russian uranium have been lifted. 
  The understanding of the role of Russia as a great power, 
the 
position of which has a decisive influence on the development of 
events in the world, on peace and security, also manifested 
itself in the fact that the U.S. president brought with him to 
Moscow the "Partnership for Peace" concept which had been 
endorsed by NATO leaders during the Brussels summit. The day 
before in Prague, those former Warsaw Pact countries which seek 
to join NATO as soon as possible had also agreed with the 
concept. 
  Boris Yeltsin supported the concept which makes it possible 
to avoid the division of Europe again into two camps but this 
time along the border of the former Soviet Union. America's 
reaffirmation of the role of Russia as a great power also 
manifested itself in the fact that the influential group of 
seven economically most developed countries may soon become G-8. 
Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton will meet next time precisely at 
a G-7 summit in Naples in July. 
  The problem of Russia's relations with the Baltic states was 
discussed as well. Although a joint Russian-U.S. statement on 
human rights contains rather general formulas, Bill Clinton 
publicly warned "other countries" that they should respect the 
rights of ethnic Russians and with this end in view promised to 
have talks with the leaders of Latvia and Estonia. In response, 
Washington expects that those states and Russia Conclude 
agreements as soon as possible on the withdrawal of Russian 
troops from there. 
  Of course, a lot of differences were revealed during the 
Russian- U.S. summit talks, in views on a settlement of the 
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular. But the two 
presidents pointed out that there was a basis and goodwill to 
look for joint solutions. Herein is the chief result of the 
Moscow summit.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Kuzar and Mikhail Pogorelyy: "New </F>
`Flight Plan' for Russia and the United States"] 
  [Excerpt] The second working day of U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's official visit to Russia began, by the normal 
standards of diplomatic protocol, uncommonly early. Even before 
the talks in the Kremlin, the U.S. head of state paid his 
respects to the great people who saved humanity from fascism -- 
Bill Clinton laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in 
Aleksandrovskiy Garden by the Kremlin Wall. 
  Then an extremely intense work session began. The third and 
final round of the Russian-U.S. summit talks took place in the 
Yekaterinskiy Hall of the Great Kremlin Palace. On the Russian 
side, Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation defense 
minister, took part in the talks together with other delegation 
members. This enables us conclude that the subject under 
discussion was Russian-U.S. military-political cooperation. One 
aspect of this was the retargeting of both countries' strategic 
nuclear missiles. On this issue, it was announced, a mutually 
acceptable understanding had been reached. 
  At the subsequent joint news conference, President Boris 
Yeltsin announced among other things that new flight plans had 
been prepared not just for the missiles (which in itself would 
have been a major sensation just a couple of years ago), but for 
the whole complex of Russian-U.S. relations. They will become 
partners on the global strategic level. 
  It is precisely the fact that his intentions are sincere, 
together with the fact that he is firmly protecting his own 
interests, that seems to explain the persistence of President 
Clinton's mediation efforts to settle the Russian-Ukrainian 
crisis with regard to the nuclear missile problem. The 
agreement signed after the trilateral meeting in Moscow 
guarantees that the missiles stationed in Ukraine will finally 
be dismantled and that the warheads will be transported to 
Russia to be destroyed. All the work involved in eliminating 
the third most powerful nuclear complex in the world should be 
completed in record time -- 10 months. It is true that a 
specific schedule for withdrawing nuclear warheads from 
Ukrainian territory has not yet been published in accordance 
with the mutual agreement of the parties involved. [passage

<F P=106> [Pavel Shinkarenko report: "Aim Was To `Get a Result.' </F>
That Is Why Results Are Impressive. This Was How Boris Yeltsin 
and Bill Clinton Assessed Their Talks in Moscow"] 
  [Text] All's well that ends well. In accordance with this 
Russian popular saying, the participants in the Russian-U.S. 
summit completed their dialogue with a whole range of joint 
documents. As Boris Yeltsin said at the press conference, the 
aim was to "get a result." 
  The list of agreements and statements signed indicates that 
relations between Moscow and Washington have now indeed entered 
the phase of mature strategic global partnership in all spheres. 
The fundamental element in this partnership is enshrined in 
particular in the Moscow Declaration signed by the presidents, 
which, as Boris Yeltsin said, "reflects and enshrines the 
historical improvement in Russian-U.S. relations in Eurasia and 
the world as a whole." The two countries' cooperation in 
strengthening strategic stability and security is also given new 
substance. "A milestone that it proved possible to overcome in 
Moscow was the adoption of a decision leading to the elimination 
of nuclear weapons in Ukraine," Boris Yeltsin said. He 
described this decision by the Russian, U.S., and Ukrainian 
presidents as an "historic document from which everyone stands 
to gain, particularly the Ukrainian people." The accord on 
eliminating nuclear weapons in Ukraine saves money, removes 
disagreements, sets other countries a good example, and bolsters 
the Russian-U.S. statement on the nonproliferation of 
mass-destruction weapons. 
  The lofty assessment of the "Partnership for Peace" 
initiative adopted at the NATO Council in Brussels recently was 
also evidence of the harmony between Russia and the United 
States. Bill Clinton briefed his Russian partners at the talks 
on the content of this initiative. The Russian president 
pointed out that this initiative contains the "beginnings of 
Russian-U.S. joint activity." It precludes the argument of 
unequal security and the possibility of new demarcation lines 
forming "from Vancouver to Vladivostok." The Russian side sees 
this idea as "one, but not, of course, the only scenario for the 
development of a new Europe." Yeltsin expressed willingness to 
"fill this channel for cooperation with concrete substance." 
The U.S. President also agreed to that approach. "I came to 
Europe in the hope of starting to build new security based on a 
common commitment to democracy, a free economy, and mutual 
respect for security and territorial borders," he said at a 
press conference. "I dream of Europe being politically and 
economically integrated from the security viewpoint." Bill 
Clinton confirmed that the United States wants "to be an equal 
partner in relations with Russia." Backing Boris Yeltsin's 
reformist course, particularly in the social sphere, and noting 
that Russia is a great country, the U.S. President said that 
"the whole world and Europe want Russia to be successful in its 
reforms." 
  The concerted approach was also backed up by specific 
actions. The heads of the two states made pointed statements in 
support of human rights and on nuclear weapons nonproliferation, 
while the leaders of the foreign policy departments ratified 
with their signatures several agreements improving cooperation 
between the two countries in the sphere of public health, 
environmental protection, and air transport, as well as a 
memorandum on export controls.

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Popov article: "Results of U.S. President Bill </F>
Clinton's European Tour. Back Again Empty-Handed"] 
  [Text] So far Clinton has not been too lucky in the field 
of international policy. Admittedly, this is no longer giving 
rise to pointed remarks as it did at the beginning of his 
presidency: It was said that all his knowledge had been 
acquired at the international club of blini lovers. But so far 
the U.S. President has not won any laurels in this field. 
  His first European trip to Brussels, Prague, Kiev, Moscow, 
Minsk, and Geneva was evidently undertaken in order to, first, 
enhance and strengthen the U.S. President's international 
prestige and, second, once again demonstrate support for B.N. 
Yeltsin, of which the Russian president is permanently in need. 
  The problem is, however, that these aims are to a 
considerable extent mutually contradictory and this became clear 
during the first stage of Clinton's European marathon. In 
Brussels he made public the new U.S. "Partnership for Peace" 
concept. The package of measures -- as always bedecked in a 
fine propaganda wrapper -- comprises a program for the phased 
integration in NATO of the East European countries that were 
formerly members of the Warsaw Pact. 
  The North Atlantic military alliance was at one time 
propagandized in the West as a strictly defensive alliance and 
its very existence and strengthening was attributed to the 
existence of the "Soviet threat." You would have thought that 
after the elimination of the Warsaw Pact and the 
self-destruction of the Soviet Union, after the United States 
was left as the world's only superpower, NATO should have 
disbanded immediately -- being totally redundant. Especially 
since, according to this military bloc's strategists, NATO no 
longer has any enemies and Russia is now regarded as a friendly 
democratic power. But they are not even thinking about 
dissolving NATO! The United States is leaving its 
100,000-strong expeditionary corps in Europe. What is more, the 
latest phase in the policy of "rolling back" and forcing Russia 
out of its traditional spheres of influence is beginning in its 
new geopolitical form. 
  The White House administration has already declared NATO's 
rapprochement with the countries of East Europe and their 
subsequent integration within the military bloc as a "highly 
important aspect of U.S. security." NATO Secretary General 
Manfred Woerner does not conceal the fact that: "In the future 
the countries of the former Warsaw Pact will be given a seat in 
NATO. It is just a matter of time." 
  But at the moment Washington is maneuvering, preferring to 
use the well-known sophistic method of describing as half-empty 
a glass that is half-full and giving Yeltsin the opportunity to 
do the same. 
  U.S. General Shalikashvili said: "We cannot simply move the 
Berlin wall several hundred kilometers eastward." This cannot 
be done "simply" -- there are not only organizational-technical, 
but also psychological difficulties! 
  Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev issued an exploratory 
statement: Russia may also decide to join NATO. To which 
Polish President Walesa responded that he would support this 
decision on one condition -- that Russia hands its nuclear 
arsenal over to NATO control. 
  That is quite possibly what NATO strategists already want! A 
few days ago Deutsche Welle reported a curious information leak 
from NATO's Brussels headquarters: U.S. Secretary of Defense 
Les Aspin suggested a concept, which presupposes "measures 
including air and missile raids on arms production sites." 
There was no reference to Russia and the concept has not 
hitherto won official approval, but you will agree that the very 
direction of NATO strategists' thoughts cannot fail to elicit 
profound alarm. 
  All the more so since the NATO Council session involving 
President Clinton has already adopted a decree couched in the 
same adventurist vein: This is the first time that all the 
military bloc's 16 countries have backed a long-standing U.S. 
threat capable of causing an explosion of tremendous destructive 
force in the "Balkan powder keg." The NATO countries agreed to 
the possibility of carrying out air strikes on Bosnian Serb 
positions. 
  This decision also constitutes a direct challenge to Russia. 
After all, even Kozyrev's Foreign Ministry has recently begun to 
talk (finally!) of a traditional Russian-Serb partnership. You 
would have thought that the response to the NATO provocation 
should have been immediate condemnation of this adventurism. 
But no! Russia seems to have once again perceived a diplomatic 
slap in the face as something fitting, once again sacrificed the 
interests of its friends and, moreover, its own. 
  Before Clinton's meeting with Yeltsin, rumors came from the 
Russian Foreign Ministry that were picked up by some 
publications: If the U.S. President takes it into his head to 
encroach on Russia's vital interests and, in particular, "tries 
to introduce the concept of internationalizing the conflicts on 
the territory of the former USSR, the Russian side intends to 
put up stiff opposition to these attempts." 
  However, the rumors of a "stiff" Russian stance were simply 
bluff. In effect, it was once again a one-sided affair and 
Clinton understandably secured the diplomatic success planned in 
Washington. 
  The U.S. President was particularly proud of the fact that 
he 
succeeded in persuading Ukrainian President Kravchuk to sign a 
tripartite statement and memorandum, in which Ukraine pledged to 
eliminate the nuclear arsenal left on its territory following 
the breakup of the Soviet Union: It is a question of 176 ICBM's 
and 15,000 nuclear warheads. Clinton described this as an 
historic agreement although he acknowledged that it will give 
rise to frenzied debate in the Ukrainian parliament. 
  Be that as it may, the first aim of Clinton's European 
marathon seems to have been achieved -- at any rate, to some 
extent. Things are far trickier as regards support for B.N. 
Yeltsin. After all, the latest geopolitical concessions have 
occurred against a new backdrop. Britain's THE GUARDIAN points 
out that "pro-U.S. rhetoric has gone out of style in the Russian 
capital." And as for Clinton's latest promises "of support for 
Russian reforms," they are already generating ridicule, the 
newspaper remarked sarcastically. 
  ...During the solemn ceremony in St. George's Hall in the 
Grand Kremlin Palace Bill Clinton delivered a welcome speech, 
which might be an illustration for Paragraph 545 of the primer 
by John Wood and Dzhan Serre [name as transliterated], 
"Diplomatic Ceremonial and Protocol," since it had all the 
components befitting the occasion: a greeting to his host, the 
general ideas behind the meeting, and, last, a desire for the 
prosperity and happiness of the country and people. There was, 
however, one blunder in the impromptu speech: The U.S. President 
uttered the words "Soviet nation." But a quick-witted 
interpreter omitted the careless phrase. 
  The host of the reception also observed diplomatic protocol 
and, in the best U.S. traditions, "kept on smiling" as if saying 
the English word "cheese" in front of the television camera. 
Cheese is best supposed to "suppress the appetite" at 
receptions! It was announced that Clinton has promised Russia 
$900 million next year for aid with pro-Western reforms. This 
is probably the "piece of fresh free cheese in the mouse trap" 
that Aleksandr Rutskoy mentioned humorously before the summit in 
Vancouver when describing Western "aid"....

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Success of Reforms in Russia Will </F>
Benefit Everyone"] 
  [Text] Washington, 13 Jan -- "U.S. President Bill Clinton 
has arrived in Moscow for his meeting with President Boris 
Yeltsin, the stakes of which are high," CBS noted. "The 
president had earlier been on a three-day trip around Europe, 
where he had to contend with the difficult problems of security 
in the world which have arisen since the end of the Cold War." 
  Clinton stopped off in Ukraine en route to Moscow and 
concluded a deal there whereby all the former Soviet nuclear 
missiles on Ukrainian territory will be handed over to Russia, 
the report commented. "There has actually been no use 
whatsoever for these weapons. They have been targeted on the 
United States, with which Ukraine most of all wants to enjoy 
friendly relations." 
  London, 13 Jan -- THE DAILY TELEGRAPH writes: The American 
president's television address to the people of Russia could be 
the most important feature of the American president's visit to 
Moscow. If Clinton strikes the right note, appeals to the 
Russians' pride and patriotism, and refrains from delivering a 
lecture on the theme of the free market and democracy he will 
improve relations between the two countries. But if he is 
unable to do this, it will only intensify skepticism regarding 
the "American Dream," which is something now manifest not just 
among extremists. 
  Paris, 13 Jan -- The success of the political and economic 
reforms in Russia will lead to the reform of the Russian state's 
foreign policy, LE MONDE thinks, noting that this explains 
Clinton's desire to support Yeltsin. The American president is 
convinced that a democratic Russia will not threaten its 
neighbors or show hegemonic tendencies in Europe, but not all 
members of his administration share such a viewpoint. In 
assessing the Russian-American summit talks now under way the 
newspaper opines that the United States will pressure the IMF to 
be more energetic in granting financial aid.

<F P=106> [Yelena Ovcharenko and Leonid Timofeyev article under the </F>
general heading: "A Loaf of Bread -- Half Each. Is U.S. 
President Bill Clinton Prepared To Share It with the Russian 
People?"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- If we take a look at the outward aspect 
of the visit, it was arranged in the best traditions of "warm 
hat and suit" diplomacy. The "walkabout" included some curious 
details: The U.S. President looked in at a store which sells, in 
addition to fish and meat, the widely advertised U.S. slimming 
products called Ultra Slim Fast, which fact usually perplexes 
quick-witted foreigners -- if the Russians do not have enough 
money for food, are they really prepared to shell it out on 
dietetic substitutes? In the bakery, which the inquisitive guest 
from across the ocean also visited, a mass of people were 
standing in line for bread. Clinton pulled rubles from his 
pocket and asked for a long white loaf. But his political 
flexibility is evidently complemented by an equally quick 
personal reaction, for he unhesitatingly took the saleswoman's 
advice: "Take the black bread, it is fresher." 
  Moscow was the only stop on Bill Clinton's current tour 
where 
he dispensed with impromptu gastronomic shows. In Brussels 
there was a visit to a cafe, and in Prague a portion of 
schnitzel with a glass of beer in a small restaurant, while in 
our country he had to make do with supper at "Ogarevo," where 
the Yeltsins served caviar, pickled mushrooms, elk meat, and 
suckling pig around the family table. 
  As for political delicacies, these too were provided for in 
the program of the visit. Reformers of various kinds were 
invited to meet with the President for the first time. Let us 
leave without comment the statement by Mr. Zhirinovskiy, who was 
not invited to Spaso House: "He is a coward. He is afraid of 
me." On the other hand, the appearance of 25-year-old banker 
Maksim Travkin, who was taken to be the representative of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, at the lofty gathering did 
not go unnoticed. Nor was it a coincidence that Anthony Lake, 
adviser to the U.S. President for national security affairs, 
spent a whole half-hour talking with Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader 
of the Russian Communists. 
  Finally, even after the visit to Moscow, Boris Yeltsin's 
policy of reforms, which the U.S. President supported publicly 
and fervently, should be expected to have a big question mark 
over it with many people in America -- congressmen, scientists, 
and experts. At the final news conference one of the U.S. 
journalists asked Boris Yeltsin: Maybe the "shock" therapy 
ought to be eased somewhat, mindful of the high price the people 
of Russia are paying for this? "No," the president replied 
curtly. There will be no indulgence. He implied that even the 
loss of public support in the last elections will not turn the 
Kremlin away from tough measures. This statement by the Russian 
president was at once publicly applauded by the U.S. consultant 
and adviser Jeffrey Sachs, who believes that it certainly is not 
the "shock therapy" but panic that is to blame for the 
calamitous situation in the Russian economy. When the panic 
ends, economic stabilization will supposedly begin. But 
Professor S. Cohen, the well-known political scientist, thinks 
differently. "I do not know how to describe what B. Yeltsin's 
government has been doing in the economic sphere since 1992 -- 
'shock therapy' or something foolish," Cohen said on strolling 
around Tishinskiy Market with a CBS-TV presenter. "For the 
people we see hear this policy has meant the loss of all their 
life savings and a disastrous drop in living standards. I am 
afraid that President Clinton has not discerned the real Russia 
in the time he has spent in Moscow. The real Russia today is 
more like this flea market." Let us stay silent on the flea 
market, but it is correct that our political leapfrogging is a 
kind of "shock therapy" for Washington.

satisfied with the discussion that a group of union leaders 
conducted with President Bill Clinton at a formal reception in 
the U.S. ambassador's residence in Moscow on Thursday." 
  In his words, at a brief meeting the sides touched upon the 
problems of the workers' movement in Russia at a time of 
economic reform, international cooperation between free unions, 
and prospects of its development. 
  At the end of the meeting, according to Sergeyev, Clinton 
instructed one of his aides to prepare a detailed report on the 
world trade union movement.

<F P=106> [Marina Lebedeva report: "Human Rights Campaigners </F>
Concerned at Violations in Russia and Intend To Speak to Clinton 
About It"] 
  [Text] A news conference has been held at the "Memorial" 
human rights society. 
  In the opinion of the conference's organizers -- the 
Russian-U.S. Human Rights Bureau, the "Memorial" human rights 
center, "Helsinki Watch," the "Civil Aid" committee, and other 
organizations -- over the past six months and particularly in 
connection with the October events the situation with regard to 
human rights compliance in Russia has deteriorated sharply. 
  "We intend to express our concern at the present situation," 
the director of the Moscow branch of the Russian-U.S. Human 
Rights Bureau said, "and to bring to B. Clinton's notice 
specific instances of human rights violations." 
  S. Ganushkina, cochairman of the "Civil Aid" committee, 
pointed out that, although Russia subscribed to the Geneva 
Convention on Refugees and adopted the Russian law on refugees 
in its spirit, it is fulfilling neither document. Refugees are 
virtually denied this status. In particular, refugees from the 
Caucasus and Central Asia end up in a grave situation. 
Ganushkina pointed out that they are being combated with all 
kinds of decrees, both covert and overt. The latest decision is 
to expel from hotels and hostels refugees who have already lived 
in Moscow for four years. As of 1 January this year they are 
obliged to pay the full cost of the room, which is totally 
impossible for the absolute majority -- sick people and 
pensioners. 
  V. Abramkin, director of the Center To Promote Prison Reform 
in Russia, said: 
  "There are now approximately 1 million prisoners in Russia. 
According to physicians' estimates, 100,000 prisoners are ill 
with tuberculosis, 20,000 of them in an acute form. There is 
insufficient meat, bread, and milk in the prisons and detention 
centers where they are held. There are many complaints about 
prisoners being beaten up and tortured. Prisons and detention 
centers in large cities are overflowing."

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian 
at 1200 GMT on 14 January broadcasts a report by Anton Grishin 
on the news conference given by Ukraine President Leonid 
Kravchuk at Ukraine's Embassy in Moscow today, which contains 
recorded remarks by Kravchuk. 
  Kravchuk says: "I would like to express my satisfaction that 
people have shown understanding of Ukraine's situation and have 
not simply tried to force it to agree -- I really did not want 
to use this expression, but it is being used in some political 
circles -- I mean the idea of exerting pressure, of forcing 
Ukraine to agree. We insisted all the way through that people 
should understand our situation, our position, and we achieved 
this without damaging other states' interests; on the contrary, 
in a way beneficial to other states." 
  Grishin summarizes the agreements signed today, and adds: 
  "Leonid Kravchuk denied outright information that Ukraine is 
to receive $1 billion in compensation for the uranium deal. As 
for the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, the leader of Ukraine 
said that Moscow and Kiev can settle the issue in a way that 
takes account of both sides' interests, and that Ukraine is 
ready for dialogue."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Taranov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk expressed satisfaction with his meeting with Russian 
and U.S. Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton here on 
Friday [14 January]. 
  "This is a historic moment," he said at a news conference at 
the Ukrainian Embassy in Moscow, noting that "Ukraine, along 
with other states, is marching along the road of nuclear 
disarmament." 
  In Kravchuk's opinion, the joint Russian-American-Ukrainian 
agreement, signed in Moscow, on the withdrawal of nuclear 
weapons from Ukraine gives it a guarantee of security and will 
help to receive compensation in nuclear fuel. 
  The agreement will also help to step up economic relations 
with other countries. The withdrawal of strategic nuclear 
weapons from Ukraine is based on the Russian-Ukrainian treaty. 
  As for tactical nuclear weapons withdrawn from the republic, 
Russian, U.S. and Ukrainian experts will have to determine their 
value, the Ukrainian president stressed. 
  Later, Ukraine will be compensated in the form of 
subtraction 
from Ukrainian debts to Russia for energy carriers. 
  Noting that Russian-Ukrainian relations were given a new 
impetus, Kravchuk expressed confidence that the problem of the 
Black Sea Fleet will be settled in 1994 and "then our countries 
will have a good prospect for the future". 
  "In geopolitical respect, we have to live on this earth of 
ours, and there is no other way out," the Ukrainian president 
stressed.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine says the three- 
nation agreement that Russia, the U.S., and Ukraine signed in 
Moscow on Friday [14 January] to withdraw the nuclear weapons 
his country inherited from the former Soviet Union is an 
indication of understanding of Kiev's problems rather than the 
result of pressure or arm twisting. 
  Speaking at the Ukrainian embassy in Moscow on Friday, he 
said the new agreement would be make it possible to send the 
Start-I treaty for parliamentary ratification because the 
conditions set in a resolution by the Supreme Soviet have now 
been removed. 
  Kravchuk says his country is given assurances of security 
guarantees, territorial integrity, financial incentives for the 
weapons and help in dismantling them, and no threat of economic 
pressure. 
  For its part, Moscow is committed to supply fuel grade 
uranium to Ukraine, minus the cost of dismantling the weapons 
and reprocessing the nuclear warheads, Kravchuk told Interfax. 
  He said that experts on all sides are yet to estimate the 
amount and form of compensation for the tactical nuclear weapons 
to be withdrawn from Ukraine. One option is to write off the 
Ukrainian debt for fuel imports from Russia, Kravchuk said. 
  IF [INTERFAX] Note: Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
told Interfax Friday that as a result of the dismantling of 
Ukrainian missiles Kiev would receive nuclear fuel in the form 
of rods for uranium reactors, but "there is no question about 
writing off the Ukrainian debt to Russia." 
  In response to Kozyrev's statement his Ukrainian counterpart 
Anatoliy Zlenko underlined in his conversation with Interfax 
that this form of compensation is foreseen in the tripartite 
Russian- American-Ukrainian agreement on the withdrawal of 
nuclear missiles from the Ukraine's territory signed in Moscow. 
  The Ukrainian leader denied allegations that his country was 
offered $1 billion as compensation for the withdrawal of its 
nuclear weapons. He said the question was not on the agenda. 
  As a next step, said Kravchuk, Moscow and Kiev could try to 
resolve the dispute over the Black Sea Fleet this year, 
proceeding from the interests of Russia, Ukraine, and Crimea. 
If the two problems are removed, he said, this will help to put 
bilateral relations on a friendlier footing as befits partners 
and good neighbors.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has drawn 
attention to the danger presented by the political movement 
headed by the leader of the Liberal Democrats Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy. 
  At a news conference in Ukrainian Embassy in Moscow Friday 
[14 January], Kravchuk recognized that the deputy to the State 
Duma Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had been legitimately elected by 
Russian people, but he called him a dangerous phenomenon from 
the point of view of the concept he declares. 
  The Ukrainian President said that the difference should be 
seen between the declarations of ideas and their implementation. 
He called on the Russian and Ukrainian Democrats to unite to 
nip in the bud the political movement led by Zhirinovskiy, even 
though the movement is already represented in parliament. 
  This movement is dangerous for everybody, not solely for 
Ukraine, said Kravchuk. There is no need to think that only 
Ukraine will be the victim of nationalism if it wins in Russia, 
he said.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama"] </F>
  [Text] A write-off of Kiev's debt for fuel imports from 
Russia for the dismantling of nuclear warheads it inherited from 
the former Soviet Union cannot be recognized as a form of 
compensation, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told Interfax. 
  He was commenting on the outcome of the three-nation summit 
ending in Moscow on Friday [14 January]. 
  "After all, all those missiles are part of the former Soviet 
Union's property and each republic, including Ukraine, can claim 
for part of it. We will handle it in a way wanted by the 
Ukrainians," the minister said. "As far as I know, they prefer 
to obtain fuel grade uranium reprocessed from the nuclear 
warheads, he said adding "we respect their right". 
  On the other hand, said the minister, "the Belarussians want 
to receive their share of the weapons in money, and why not?" 
  The minister ruled out any extra payment to Kiev, saying it 
would be humiliating to Ukraine itself and a very strange thing 
for Russia to do. 
  Kozyrev said the United States had agreed to allocate some 
$60-70 Mn to pay for the cost of transporting the weapons from 
Ukraine to Russia. He described the spending involved as high 
but inevitable, given that the operation must be carried out in 
a way that would preclude any new Chernobyl-style accidents. 
  Incidentally, said the minister, the operation was caused by 
a technological necessity rather than by a desire to snub 
Ukraine. The missiles must be dismantled where they were 
assembled and Russia alone had such facilities, Kozyrev said. 
  More importantly, he went on to say, the leaders of the 
three 
countries meeting in Moscow on Friday reaffirmed their political 
will to get the problem resolved. The minister believes 
technical problems to be secondary. 
  The assurances of security guarantees given to Ukraine by 
Russia and the United States were similar to those which the co- 
founders of the non-proliferation treaty - the U.S., Britain and 
Russia - offered to all signatories under a Security Council 
resolution, Kozyrev said. These automatically covered any 
country, including Ukraine, if it gives up its nuclear status, 
he said. However, the minister said that security guarantees 
would be effective only after Kiev joined the non-proliferation 
treaty as a denuclearized nation. But he does not rule out the 
possibility of some sort of "Ukrainian specifics." 
  On the Russian-American summit itself, Kozyrev said human 
rights had also been high on the agenda. The two sides were 
somewhat at odds on the issue of Russian pullout from the Baltic 
states and the plight of ethnic Russians there, he said. 
  Unlike the Americans and other western countries which start 
with troop withdrawals, said the minister, we think it more 
correct to begin in reverse order. "We are ready to pull out 
troops," he said, "but will the Balts be prepared to observe 
human rights in full measure?" While sharing President 
Yeltsin's position on the issue, I think Mr. Clinton's statement 
of commitment to the human rights situation in the Baltic states 
is one of the achievements of the Moscow summit, the Russian 
minister said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Sizov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- The documents on the 
complete destruction of Ukraine's nuclear arsenal by its 
transfer to and scrapping in Russia, which were signed in the 
Kremlin, also determine the procedure of the payment of 
compensation to Kiev for their loss, Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev said in an interview with ITAR-TASS. 
  This loss, according to Kozyrev, will be made up with 
uranium 
fuel, which Russia will obtain after recycling the weapon-grade 
uranium in collaboration with the United States. Part of the 
profit gained from the sale of uranium on the world market 
belongs to Ukraine, Kozyrev noted. The uranium after all is the 
property of the former Soviet Union, which is why the profit 
from its sale will be divided, he said. "We ourselves will 
obtain weapon-grade uranium, recycle it and sell to America, and 
the share belonging to Ukraine will be paid in the form of 
uranium fuel," he clarified. 
  According to the Russian foreign minister, there is no 
provision for any additional payments by Russia, and also of 
writing off a part of Ukraine's debts. 
  Andrey Kozyrev said that the United States will provide 
additional resources so that Moscow and Kiev can both ensure 
safety during the dismantling of the nuclear arsenal, its 
transportation and other necessary procedures. Naturally, the 
dismantling of the arsenal - the nuclear contents and the 
warhead - will be carried out in Russia only. Not because, 
Kozyrev emphasised, Moscow wants to humiliate or offend Ukraine, 
but because the appropriate plants are located in Russia and a 
warhead can only be dismantled where it was made, otherwise 
there would be a real danger of monstrous environmental 
consequences. 
  The signed agreements really are historical. A political 
decision has been made and the political will has been 
displayed, now only "purely technical work" is needed to go 
ahead, Kozyrev said. First of all we should determine the share 
belonging to Ukraine, deduct from it Russia's expenses on 
recycling it and other works and repay this part "in whatever 
form the Ukrainians want and the Russians can manage," he said. 
But it is a purely technical question, the Russian minister 
said. 
  Speaking of security guarantees given to Ukraine, Andrey 
Kozyrev emphasised that they are basically standard ones. These 
are the same guarantees which the three countries, the United 
States, England and Russia, give to all the participants in the 
non- proliferation of nuclear weapons treaty. It is quite 
natural that the signed documents will come into force only 
after Ukraine joins the nuclear weapon non-proliferation treaty 
as a non-nuclear state, the Russian minister said.

  [Text] Russia's deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov, in 
charge of relations with the United States, believes that Russia 
should give priority to relations with Ukraine but not with the 
United States. In his interview with Interfax Mamedov expressed 
opinion that the tripartite Russian-American-Ukrainian agreement 
on nuclear weapons withdrawal from the Ukrainian territory is 
one of the major results of the U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
visit to Moscow. "We have all grounds to be satisfied," he said. 
  Mamedov specially stressed that Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin was initiator of the proposal to hold a tripartite 
meeting in Moscow. 
  According to Mamedov, "the uranium contract" which has also 
become one of the major results of the Moscow summit would not 
have been signed if we had failed to agree with Kiev. 
  When asked about the scale of compensation which Russia 
would 
pay to Ukraine for the nuclear weapons to be withdrawn from its 
territory, Mamedov answered that "on the whole this problem has 
been coordinated." "The agreement signed in Massandra (Crimea) 
fixes the volume of the compensation, cost, sums, etc. The 
Americans have repeatedly declared about their support to the 
Massandra agreements. One can view the Moscow agreement as their 
further development," he said. 
  As Mamedov said, a compromise formula was agreed "primarily 
not at the tripartite Russian-American-Ukrainian talks in 
Washington but between the Ukrainian leadership and us." 
  "The thing is that we are withdrawing nuclear weapons from 
Ukraine to Russia, dismantling it, extracting uranium, and 
selling fuel uranium to America. A part of these funds with the 
exception of expenditures attributed to transportation, storage, 
and re- processing of uranium Russia will hand over to Ukraine 
as compensation," he continued. 
  Mamedov does not rule out possibility that at first Russia 
would give uranium to Ukraine as fuel for its atomic power 
stations. "We shall probably retain part of this fuel for 
ourselves. Nobody is going to rob us," he noted. 
  Mamedov also reported that the Moscow summit had discussed 
"very interesting proposals regarding the fact how one can re- 
focus international package of assistance to Russia given our 
difficult economic situation." "The Americans understand quite 
well that Russians should feel that democracy gives something to 
them that it is not just a trap into which they have been 
pushed," her said. 
  As an example Interfax interlocutor mentioned the following: 
"Russia delivers oil to its neighbors, former Soviet republics. 
We increase the prices to the world ones. But it can occur 
that our partners will not be able to procure oil in our 
country. Then we shall be deprived of markets. They can be 
occupied by rich oil producing countries which can offer more 
beneficial conditions. What has America done? - The Americans 
have persuaded the "G-7" and International Monetary Fund to 
grant subsidies to our neighbors so that they would continue to 
buy Russian oil. It's an absolutely new form of partnership."

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1725 GMT on 14 January carries the regularly 
scheduled "Details" program. The program, hosted by Nikolay 
Svanidze, contains excerpts of interviews with Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, and Ukrainian Ambassador to Russia Vladimir 
Kryzhanovskiy, by unidentified correspondents. Places and dates 
of the interviews are not given. 
  The program opens with an excerpt from Kravchuk who says 
that 
14 January is New Year's Day according to the "old calendar." 
Therefore, he wishes the people of Russia and everybody a Happy 
New Year. Kravchuk says, "And on the whole, this month is, let 
us say, a new beginning because today is the beginning of a new 
account because today's document is the beginning of a new page 
for Ukraine, for Russia, and for the whole world." 
  Svanidze then says that in Moscow today the presidents of 
Russia, the United States, and Ukraine discussed nuclear 
weapons, and Ukraine agreed to withdraw to Russia 176 
intercontinental missiles and approximately 1,500 warheads for 
dismantling. 
  Next follows an excerpt of Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy's 
interview. He says: "Ukraine is not backing down. I would call 
it a trilateral compromise. All three sides made some 
compromises. I would not say that the biggest compromise was 
made by Ukraine." 
  In a further excerpt of the Kravchuk interview, Kravchuk 
says: "To embark upon the path of confrontation or ambition is a 
bad thing. Most in Ukraine understand this, I know. 
Unfortunately, there are people who see things differently. 
Fortunately, such people are in the minority." 
  Then Kryzhanovskiy says in his interview, "The president, in 
this case, is carrying out, in full and in principle, the will 
of the people. Moreover, there are even certain, I would say, 
contradictions between him and the parliament, which wants these 
weapons to remain on the territory of Ukraine for a certain 
time, until certain conditions prevail." 
  Svanidze says that Kravchuk is in a difficult situation. He 
has been performing a balancing act for the past two years -- 
balancing the temptation to be leader of a nuclear state and the 
impossibility of keeping these "expensive toys." 
  Kryzhanovskiy is then shown saying, "We are not thinking of 
servicing of these nuclear weapons. We were counting on them 
being serviced by Russian specialists alone." 
  Next is an excerpt from Kravchuk, who says, "The nuclear 
weapons which we inherited from the former Soviet Union could 
not be used by Ukraine, speaking frankly, as a guarantor of 
security or as weapons of deterrence, because they were 
manufactured in Russia: the codes in Russia, the buttons in 
Russia. Therefore, that is all an illusion." 
  An excerpt from the Kozyrev interview follows. He says, 
"Against whom were the nuclear missiles in Ukraine, which were 
installed by the former Soviet Union, directed? Against the 
United States and NATO, and they are aimed at the United States. 
They are not aimed at Russia. And the missiles which are in 
America? They used to be aimed at the Soviet Union -- and now 
in Moscow... [pauses] and incidentally, that bilateral, 
Russian-American agreement is much more important for us. Why? 
Because American weapons used to and are still to this day 
aimed at Moscow. Nuclear weapons, each of which is capable of 
wiping out in a second what we have here. 
  "Well, the agreement reached on not targeting them, the 
flight assignment is to be canceled, and that process will be 
finished in about two months. That is what the Presidents of 
Russia and the United States agreed in Moscow. That is to say, 
you and I are no longer rabbits. At least, in two months we 
will not be in a situation where any madman may at any moment 
press that infamous button by accident and a missile will fly 
according to an assignment set years ago - namely towards us. 
It will fly, but most likely, into space. Do you understand 
[word indistinct]? That is a substantial thing. The Ukrainian 
missiles -- that is those in Ukraine -- are not aimed at us. 
Therefore, it may be important for the Americans for the 
missiles are aimed at them." 
  Svanidze, shown sitting on a sofa beside Kozyrev, asks if 
the 
missiles can be pointed at a new target. Kozyrev replies: "But 
it is not that easy to retarget them, and Moscow is the one who 
has to retarget them because that infamous button for these 
missiles is in Moscow. Naturally, we will not do that. We will 
not point these missiles at ourselves." 
  Svanidze says that pressure has been brought to bear on 
Kravchuk from domestic and foreign forces. He was beset by 
crisis in 1993 and anti-Russian feeling is running high in 
Ukraine, but compensation is promised Ukraine for giving up its 
nuclear weapons. 
  Kravchuk is shown saying, "Taking account of the fact that 
there will be compensation for the tactical and strategic 
nuclear weapons, that there will guarantees of national 
security, financial, economic, technical and guaranteed aid. 
All of that is in Ukraine's interest." 
  Svanidze then says that Ukraine has not managed to step out 
of Russia's shadow and embark upon independent dialogue with the 
West, but Kravchuk did what he had to do as president of a 
country beset by economic problems such as Ukraine's. 
  Kravchuk is again shown. He says, "It is not that one will 
be 
the older and the other the younger, that one is the older 
brother and one the younger brother, that one is the leader and 
the other is subordinate. The peoples will be equal. Equal in 
all their relations, one a bit more, one a bit less." 
  A further fragment of Kozyrev's interview follows: "The 
episode with Ukraine is the clearing away of Russia's old 
obstructions. Do you see? Essentially, the meeting on the 
Ukrainian theme, unfortunately, took place two years later than 
it should have, and this is the reason for the delay in the 
process of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine."

<F P=106> [Vasiliy Kononenko and Aleksandr Sychev report: "Three </F>
Presidents Close Last Chapter of `Cold War' in Kremlin"] 
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Moscow is 
nearing its end, and the results of the meetings, during which 
the head of the Washington administration expressed support for 
the reforms being carried out in Russia, can be summed up. 
  The presidents of the United States, Russia, and Ukraine 
signed a treaty finally defining the fate of the 176 ICBM's and 
their 1,600 nuclear warheads on Ukrainian territory. "The three 
of us," President Yeltsin said, "met to close the last chapter 
[postavit tochku] on the last problem of the 'Cold War.'" 
  Kiev gets a full security guarantee and pledges to dispatch 
its entire arsenal to Russia for dismantling and for the removal 
from the warheads and storage of the highly enriched fissionable 
material. After being processed the uranium from the warheads 
will be sold in the United States for use in nuclear power 
stations, and the money raised -- $1 billion -- will be given by 
Washington to Kiev, and will also be returned to Ukrainian 
nuclear power stations. At the same time, agreement was reached 
on the purchase by America of uranium worth $12 billion removed 
from the Russian nuclear weapons to be destroyed under the START 
II Treaty. The contract covers a 20-year period. 
  The treaty on the nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory -- 
the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world -- is undoubtedly 
Clinton's most important achievement. But the signing of the 
document was overshadowed by reports of the reaction of deputies 
in the Ukrainian parliament. Sergey Golovatyy, a member of the 
Supreme Council's Foreign Policy Committee in Kiev, said: 
"Kravchuk can sign anything he likes. But if parliament does 
not ratify the treaty, it will remain a piece of paper." 
  The Ukrainian president has waiting for him back at home a 
seriously deteriorating political situation whose outcome hardly 
anyone will venture to predict. The problem of nuclear weapons 
in Ukraine has by no means been settled with the signing of the 
agreement. 
  Another agreement signed during the visit was the document 
on 
the retargeting of Russian and U.S. strategic missiles. Some of 
them will be targeted to empty areas of the high seas, while no 
flight plans at all will be entered into the computers of the 
others. It is virtually impossible to verify compliance with 
this agreement. But, despite its symbolic nature, Thomas 
Pickering, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, said that "it is of 
enormous importance for the strengthening of confidence between 
the two countries." 
  It is said in the U.S. President's entourage that Clinton 
was 
greatly impressed with "Russia's progress along the road to a 
free market." Presumably a definite role in this was played by 
Moscow's numerous booths, stalls, and private stores, as well as 
by his meetings with Muscovites, which illustrated what Clinton 
learned from his talks in the Kremlin and during dinner at 
President Yeltsin's residence near Moscow. Addressing 
Muscovites directly, Clinton said: Everyone earning their daily 
bread in dogged work "should know that ultimately they will be 
rewarded." He also reported that the talks touched on issues 
whose resolution should "make their lives better." 
  Clinton did not propose a new package of aid for Russia -- 
nor had Moscow expected him to, incidentally. The Russian 
leadership had set itself two tasks -- to get Washington to lift 
the restrictions on Russian exports to the United States (it 
remains to be seen how far this problem was solved) and to get 
the money it had already been promised. 
  Russia received the first $1.5 billion from the IMF last 
June. A second package of another $1.5 billion should have 
followed soon after. But it was not transferred to Moscow, 
which was unable to reduce the inflation rate and the budget 
deficit to the agreed level. 
  Moreover, it has been learned that the World Bank is 
prepared 
to grant Russia $500 million out of previously allocated funds 
in order to improve the position of Russian citizens. Michael 
Blumenthal, treasury secretary in the Carter administration, 
will head a ($100-million) program to help privatize major 
Russian companies. Despite the United States' economic 
difficulties, President Clinton hopes, according to his 
entourage, to find another $1 billion for Russia this year. 
  Main attention during the talks was devoted to measures to 
accelerate the reform program and define its goals. The sides 
agreed that it is necessary to make a greater effort to control 
inflation and support the least protected sections of the 
population by saving funds on programs to finance inefficient 
state enterprises. Clinton called for additional measures to be 
taken to encourage Western private investors to invest more in 
the Russian economy. In the meantime, U.S. entrepreneurs are 
known to be among the most cautious. Their investment is 
estimated at just $700 million.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev report: "Elimination of Ukrainian </F>
Nuclear Arsenal Is Success For Secret Diplomacy"] 
  [Text] "In the event, God forbid, of a conflict between 
Russia and Ukraine over the Crimea, who would the United States 
-- which has just proposed that Kiev join NATO within the 
framework of the `Partnership for Peace' program -- side with?" 
  A well-known American reporter revealed that this was a 
question he wanted to put to U.S. President Bill Clinton if the 
opportunity arose. It is a good question and one directly 
linked with the truly sensational agreement which, contrary to 
expectations, Moscow, Kiev, and Washington have managed to 
acheive, proposing to turn Ukraine into a nuclear-free zone. 
  The reporter did not particularly philosophize about his 
question. The terms of the agreement -- even now that its text 
has been published -- clearly leave a lot unrevealed: Some 
aspects will need detailed explanation, and it is not ruled out 
that modifications will be required "in the course of business" 
[v rabochem poryadke]. 
  It is becoming clear from the discussions with the Americans 
who accompanied the President that Washington was just as hasty 
a partner in this deal as Kiev -- although for entirely 
different reasons. It was Washington, insofar as we understand 
it, which insisted that the Russian and Ukrainian delegations 
conducting the talks in the U.S. capital postpone their return 
home 5 January in order to use the time to intensify the search 
for a solution to outstanding problems. The delegations 
tarried, but when Clinton left Washington for Europe on Saturday 
8 January he still had no confidence that the deal would go 
ahead, although he had been told that there had been "a certain 
amount of progress." 
  The deal was struck on Monday, 10 January -- that was when 
the U.S. ambassador in Moscow and the leader of the U.S. 
ambassadorial mission in Kiev informed the State Department and 
the Clinton team touring Europe that Presidents Yeltsin and 
Kravchuk had initialed the agreement reached by their 
delegations. 
  Why was Clinton in a hurry? Among the explanations we have 
heard the most rational is the simplest -- over the past few 
months the problem of preventing nuclear arms proliferation has 
been top of his personal agenda and personal list of priorities. 
The U.S. President saw Ukrainian nuclear disarmament as his 
most realistic chance to take the first and most most 
substantive step in this direction. If such an agreement were 
reached it would, moreover, be another foreign policy triumph 
for Clinton -- the second following the reconciliation between 
Israel and the PLO. Such a triumph would not be out of place 
for the President at a time when he faces growing scandals at 
home -- scandals which many are already comparing to Nixon's 
Watergate. 
  Achieving this goal on his personal agenda was made 
considerably easier for Clinton by the fact that, Ukraine, as 
one of my interlocutors put it, was by then "pretty much ready 
-- it had virtually doomed itself to isolation in the 
international arena, as demonstrated by Clinton's refusal, 
widely trumped by the Washington White House, to visit Ukraine 
during his tour of the former Union, and to restrict himself to 
Moscow and -- a particular blow to the Ukrainians -- to Minsk." 
Kiev clearly understood that going further down the road which 
Ukraine had followed since essentially refusing to ratify START 
I would mean depriving the country of Western aid. The 
agreement to get things moving opened up some nice prospects for 
Kiev -- in the form of an extension of aid not so much through 
bilateral channels as through the channels of international 
organizations such as the IMF, the World Bank, and the European 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 
  Moreover, Washington could not fail to notice the personal 
ambitions of Kravchuk, who has an undoubted interest in gaining 
genuine recognition from the international community and 
achieving the standing of a statesmen with whom you can "do 
business." 
  One other point -- the Ukrainian lobby, which is very strong 
in those states of America which play a key role in the 
presidential election, was exerting very great pressure on the 
Washington White House to ensure that Ukraine was properly 
treated and certainly not dealt with on a lower footing than 
America's relationship with Belarus. 
  That was the backdrop against which the search for a 
compromise was accelerated. Very substantial people were 
involved on the American side -- the man in charge was Strobe 
Talbott, number two at the State Department; the team also 
included Lynn Davis, another under secretary of state, and Nick 
Burns, a leading specialist on the former Union at the National 
Security Council. Tactically, the U.S. delegation's job, which 
met with understanding from the Russian delegation, was based on 
creating additional incentives for Ukraine in the shape of firm 
guarantees of economic and financial aid and help in contacts 
with international departments where the United States 
traditionally wields great influence. A key factor was, as 
sources put it, Washington's readiness to respond appropriately 
to Kiev's longstanding concern that, in giving up its nuclear 
weapons, it would be exposed to the threat of a strike, say, 
from the East, from Russia. Formerly Washington had avoided any 
pledges on this score, apart from quite simply referring to the 
fact that Ukraine's accession to the nonproliferation regime 
would automatically give it the guarantees it wanted. Kiev was 
not satisfied with this and insisted on more. The proposal to 
join NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program will, as Washington 
explained to Kiev, satisfy its longstanding wishes and demands. 
  Admittedly, there immediately arises the question about a 
hypothetical war over the Crimea which the American reporter 
would have liked to have asked the American President. 
  But, alas, there are plenty of other questions too.

<F P=106> [Andrey Vaganov report under the "Cooperation" rubric: </F>
"Russia Will Sell Weapons-Grade Uranium in the United States. 
Contract Signed to This Effect. Everyone Should be Pleased, 
Including Ukraine"] 
  [Text] An executive contract between Russia and the United 
States on deliveries of Russian weapons-grade uranium to the 
United States was signed at 1000 yesterday in the secluded 
atmosphere of Collegium Hall of the former Ministry of Medium 
Machine-Building (now the Ministry of Atomic Energy). Making a 
short speech before the signing of the document, Viktor 
Mikhaylov, Russian Federation minister of atomic energy, pointed 
out that the ceremony was taking place in a historic room: All 
decisions on the creation of nuclear weapons in Russia had been 
made right there, and foreign visitors were present there for 
the first time. 
  One should think that in citing this fact the minister 
wished 
once again to emphasize the historic importance of the event. 
Indeed, this contract (from the Russian side it was signed by 
Albert Shishkin, president of the "Tekhnosnabeksport" foreign 
trade company of the Russian Federation Ministry of Atomic 
Energy, and on the American side by the director of the U.S. 
Enrichment Corporation -- USEC -- William Timbers) signals the 
start of real disarmament. In line with its provisions, 500 
tonnes of weapons-grade uranium are supposed to be sold to the 
United States over 20 years (Russia's aggregate stocks of 
weapons-grade uranium are 1,250 tonnes). Thus, more than 20,000 
nuclear warheads will be destroyed. During the first five 
years, 10 tonnes will be sold each year, and 30 tonnes a year 
will be sold during the following years. This schedule is 
explained by the fact that neither Russia nor the United States 
has the production facilities at the moment for the depletion of 
enriched uranium (from 90 to 5 percent). Nonetheless the level 
of such technology in Russia proves to be higher than in the 
United States. 
  To implement the contract, the world's largest joint 
Russian- 
American uranium company is being created. It should be 
stressed in this connection that the United States controls 50 
percent of the world uranium market today; Russia controls 5 to 
6 percent of the market while having the same uranium production 
facilities. The contract that was signed means in fact that the 
United States is letting Russia use one of the segments of its 
market. 
  Answering a question from your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
correspondent on how it had become possible to resolve within 
the framework of the contract the question that proved to be a 
stumbling block while the document was in preparation (the U.S. 
Government insisted on sharing profits from the sales of uranium 
between Russia and Ukraine), Mikhaylov said that there too it 
became possible to find a mutually acceptable option. Profit 
from the sales of weapons-grade uranium from strategic nuclear 
warheads, if any, will be partially returned to Ukraine in the 
shape of fuel compacts for its nuclear electric power stations. 
As for battlefield nuclear weapons, according to the minister, 
experts of Russia and Ukraine are yet to determine whether any 
profit is possible there at all. Russia is already spending 
millions of dollars on the dismantling and transportation alone 
of battlefield nuclear weapons from Ukraine. (Incidentally, the 
dismantling and storing of one nuclear warhead in the United 
States costs between $30 and $100,000; in Russia the cost is a 
tenth of the amount because our personnel are paid less). 
  Viktor Mikhaylov also stressed that, in his opinion, Ukraine 
should be pleased with the signed Russian-American document: 
"Unless this problem is solved today, Ukraine itself in a couple 
of years would have to pay someone who would undertake to 
dismantle its nuclear missiles. 
  Neither will the United States come out a loser: during the 
first year alone of the implementation of the contract, weapons- 
grade uranium from Russia will provide fuel for 15 American 
nuclear reactors. Energy generated by them would provide 
electricity for 10 million homes. 
  At the same time, despite the substantial sum of the 
contract 
-- nearly $12 billion -- the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Atomic Energy will only be able to pay part of its nuclear 
warhead recycling costs out of it.

<F P=106> [Interview with the head of the Moscow Center for Arms </F>
Control, Anatoliy Dyakov, by Andrzey Rybak; place and date not 
given: "Still Under Control"] 
  [Text] [Rybak] Russia stores some 180 tonnes of 
weapons-grade plutonium, which is enough to produce 90,000 
nuclear warheads. But the Russians go on producing plutonium. 
Why? 
  [Dyakov] This situation is far from logical to me also. 
Three reactors -- two in Tomsk, one in Krasnoyarsk -- are still 
producing weapons-grade plutonium. But they also generate 
electricity. If they were closed down, many people would be 
without electricity and heating. Yet, the government says there 
is another reason as well: The fuel used in the reactors cannot 
be stored for a long period. It has to be processed if even 
greater risks to humans and the environment are to be avoided. 
  [Rybak] Russia is in the midst of an economic crisis. Does 
this have an effect on the destruction of nuclear weapons, as 
laid down in the START Treaties? 
  [Dyakov] This is, indeed, a major financial problem. A 
total of 30,000 nuclear warheads are to be destroyed. Storing 
one gram of plutonium costs between $1 and $2 per year. The 
warheads contain a total of 60 tonnes of plutonium. This means 
that storing them alone would cost $60 to $120 million a year. 
The entire nuclear complex consumes some $1.5 billion per year. 
Using about 20 percent of capacity for disarmament would cost 
some $300 million per year. And the work will take 10 to 15 
years. 
  [Rybak] The United States promised Russia financial support 
for disarmament. 
  [Dyakov] There is a $800 million fund. But this has been 
almost completely exhausted. 
  [Rybak] The rich threshold countries are very much 
interested in Russian nuclear scientists. How big is the danger 
that they might sell their knowledge? 
  [Dyakov] I, personally, do not know of any scientist of the 
"inner circle" who has emigrated to these countries. 
  [Rybak] But an increasing number of them lose their jobs. 
Scientists at the secret nuclear complex Arzamas-16 were on 
strike recently because their salaries had not been paid. 
  [Dyakov] The scientists' situation is very bleak. But I do 
not think this will lead to mass migration. 
  [Rybak] In Germany and Poland there have been several cases 
of smugglers being arrested with nuclear material. 
  [Dyakov] This was only slightly enriched uranium that is not 
suitable for weapons. As to the military nuclear complex, the 
situation is still under control. 
  [Rybak] Corruption is on the increase within the Russian 
Army. All kinds of weapons are being stolen and sold. Why not 
nuclear weapons? 
  [Dyakov] Your concern is justified. If everybody steals, 
including government personnel, you cannot expect the Army to be 
any better. 
  [Rybak] The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty will expire in 
1995. What will happen then? 
  [Dyakov] I think that the Treaty will simply be extended. I 
hope that we will finally achieve a ban on tests. 
  [Rybak] In spite of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iraq and 
North Korea have almost finished developing the bomb. How can 
such things be prevented in the future? 
  [Dyakov] We have to put heavy pressure on such countries, 
impose economic sanctions. But we must also stop discriminating 
against the threshold countries. We cannot modernize our 
arsenals and prohibit them from developing the bomb. The First 
World must set an example by completely destroying its nuclear 
weapons.

  [Text] Despite significant progress in Russian-U.S. trade 
and economic relations, they are not yet free from the legacy of 
the Cold War, Oleg Davydov, Russia's minister for foreign 
economic relations, told Itar-Tass in Moscow. 
  He recalled that United States has not yet canceled the 
Jackson-Venik amendment which discriminates against Russia. The 
solution of a number of financial and commercial issues is tied 
to various political conditions and to progress in the 
implementation of market reforms in Russia. 
  The minister added that the policy of strict quantitative 
regulation of Russian imports is still in force. Russia, in the 
opinion of Oleg Davydov, should first and foremost seek the 
lifting of restrictions on the export of its goods to the United 
States and develop a mechanism for bilateral consultations.

<F P=106> [Konstantin Eggert article: "Ambassador Thomas Pickering Is </F>
Clinton's Man in Moscow"] 
  [Text] "Pickering does not need an umbrella. He can make 
it through the rain" -- this figurative description coming from 
a journalist gives you an extremely accurate idea of the U.S. 
ambassador in Moscow: 62-year old Thomas Pickering is a 
top-flight professional. 
  His involvement in Bill Clinton's talks with Boris Yeltsin 
is 
not only a case of paying tribute to the norms of protocol. 
Pickering's prestige among the U.S. political elite is 
exceptionally high. Despite having spent just over six months 
in the Russian capital, the ambassador's view of what is 
happening in our country carries weight in the White House and 
is given consideration by Clinton. 
  The unanimity of views is impressive. Americans, Russians, 
Israelis, and Arabs point to his brilliant analytical mind, good 
memory, rapid responses, and ability to conduct a conversation. 
"Pickering is a textbook diplomat," a U.S. correspondent in 
Moscow believes. 
  His post in Russia is the seventh ambassadorial posting for 
a 
lawyer and historian with two university degrees. He first 
heard himself addressed as "Mr. Ambassador" in 1974, when he was 
appointed head of the U.S. mission in Jordan. 
  Since then he has been to Nigeria, El Salvador, and Israel, 
led the U.S. mission to the United Nations, spent time in India, 
and lastly Moscow. "Late in the evening of 1 August 1990 I was 
attending a farewell dinner at the home of Britain's permanent 
UN representative," Pickering said. "The report of the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait found me there. The Security Council worked 
the whole night through and at 0600 hours adopted the first 
resolution condemning Saddam Husayn." From that day on the 
diplomat became a television star. Journalists literally did 
not leave his side. The general opinion is that Pickering's 
openness played a cruel trick on him -- Secretary of State James 
Baker ultimately decided that his subordinate's popularity was 
greater than his own. With the result that in 1992 Pickering 
was dispatched to protect U.S. interests in Delhi. 
  His appointment to Moscow heralded a kind of triumphal 
comeback for him. Fears whether Pickering, who had not 
previously tackled Russia, would be able to rapidly bring 
himself up to speed were dispelled. Smolensk Square does not 
conceal its respect for the ambassador. "He is very active and 
in just a few months has been able to set up such broad contacts 
at the highest level that some people who have spent two or 
three years in Moscow might envy him," an informed Russian 
diplomat said during a private conversation. 
  The Foreign Ministry believes that, in tandem with Richard 
Miles, the new minister-counselor (the number two man at the 
embassy) and an expert on Russia, Pickering is capable of doing 
a great deal to develop bilateral relations. 
  Of course, impeccable professionals do make blunders. It is 
rumored that, in the morning of 13 December, total confusion 
reigned at the traditional meeting of leading embassy staffers. 
No one was prepared for the dramatic Russian election result. 
  It is a desire to avoid these kinds of surprises in the 
future, rather than hypothetical disappointment with Yeltsin and 
Gaydar, that accounts for the Americans' desire to expand 
contacts with various political forces. Pickering carefully 
avoids answering questions like "Will you invite Zhirinovskiy 
for cocktails?", although he does not conceal the fact that his 
subordinates have had contacts with "liberal-democrat" 
representatives. [Communist Party of the Russian Federation 
leader] Gennadiy Zyuganov was one of the guests at a reception 
in Vice President Gore's honor. 
  "Less shock, more therapy" -- since the 12 December 
elections this phrase, highlighting Washington's renewed 
approach to offering Russia financial and technical aid, has 
become a stock phrase. Pickering confirms that the money 
granted to our country will be used to create social support and 
professional retraining centers designed to ease the impact of 
future unemployment. Conversion, the reconfiguration of 
enterprises, and the creation of new jobs all figure in the 
programs funded by the West and the United States directly. 
"The attention given to the social aspect of reforms does not 
mean that we can forget to combat inflation," the ambassador 
remarked. "It is necessary to rid ourselves of this evil for 
other than economic reasons. Historical experience reminds us 
that the development of hyperinflation jeopardizes the existence 
of democracy." 
  Pickering is actively learning Russian (his sixth foreign 
language after French, Spanish, Arabic, Hebrew, and Swahili) and 
traveling a great deal -- in just over seven months he has 
managed to visit St. Petersburg, Tula, Nizhniy Novgorod, 
Ulan-Ude, Irkutsk, and the Far East. On weekends the ambassador 
and his wife go out of town -- they are very interested in 
Russian estate and church architecture. 
  The ambassador loves Baroque music (particularly Bach), 
collects books on military history and biographies of famous 
people, and loves reading thrillers, particularly spy novels. 
  "Some day Thomas Pickering will undoubtedly be deputy 
secretary of state," a U.S. journalist friend said when he 
learned that Clinton had appointed his personal friend and 
Russian specialist Strobe Talbott to this post at a reception in 
the vice president's honor. "Admittedly, he will most likely 
never get the post of head of the Department of State -- that is 
generally given to political appointees."

  [Text] The American administration has been following 
developments in the Russian leadership. A more detailed 
reaction can be expected from Washington after the official 
announcement of the makeup of a new Russian government, the U.S. 
ambassador in Moscow Thomas Pickering declared in an interview 
with Interfax on Monday. 
  He explained that his administration's position towards 
Russia's reforms did not depend on concrete personalities but 
was based on the principles they advocated. 
  Commenting on the First Vice Premier Yegor Gaydar's decision 
to resign, Pickering said that it did not take Washington aback, 
since rumors on Gaydar's possible resignation from the 
government had circulated long before his public announcement 
about it. 
  He voiced satisfaction with Gaydar's intention to carry on 
his duties in the Duma, where he led one of the major 
parliamentary factions, "Russia's Choice." 
  Pickering said that in the current situation the American 
administration regarded President Yeltsin's attitude to further 
reform as crucial. He recalled that at the recent summit, U.S. 
President Clinton had been firmly assured by Yeltsin that reform 
in Russia would be continued and stability there would be 
preserved.

  [Text] Moscow January 17 TASS -- The launch of the U.S. 
"Discovery" space shuttle on which a Russian cosmonaut is to 
make the first flight was postponed from January 20 to February 
3 because of malfunctions in the craft's engines, TASS learned 
from reliable sources in the Russian space business on Monday. 
  35 year-old Sergey Krikalyov is the first Russian cosmonaut 
to fly on board the U.S. space shuttle, according to a 
U.S.-Russian agreement. 
  Krikalyov made two space flights on the Russian "Mir" space 
station, the first lasted for 151 days in 1988-1989 and the 
second - 312 days from May 1991 to March 1992. 
  Krikalyov who was trained for the shuttle flight in the 
United States said the Russian training programme is better in 
many aspects. 
  Krikalyov, who is a computer engineer, said the computers 
installed on the "Discovery" had been designed long ago and are 
considerably inferior to the computer centre onboard the "Mir". 
  He also complained about an inconvenient work schedule in 
orbit - in two shifts. There is only one sleeping-bag for two 
crew members and they have to sleep in turn, according to him. 
  Krikalyov was surprised that after the training programme 
was 
completed astronauts did not have to pass any exams or tests. 
It is the captain who bears all responsibility for the flight 
preparations. 
  This is the second delay in the launch of the space shuttle. 
Initially it was planned for last November 10, but was also 
postponed.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelyov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 15 TASS -- The Partnership for Peace 
program recently approved by the NATO summit in Brussels is an 
important step forward in the development of partnership between 
Russia, the United States and other NATO countries, Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told correspondents on Friday. 
  It seems NATO membership of new states could be the most 
simple and quick solution to the problem, this is naturally 
their sovereign right. However, swift implementation of this 
right would result in new barriers in Europe, said the minister. 
  "NATO has listened to us, Central and East European nations, 
it listened to Russia, Boris Yeltsin who said in Poland it is 
the right of each state to decide whether or not to join NATO; 
but there are realities that require a more well-considered 
approach," he noted. 
  The Brussels decision provides for a long period of 
partnership which will help concentrate efforts and determine 
the fate of Europe. The problem has been discussed with the 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at the Moscow summit. 
The U.S. and Russian presidents exchanged their opinions on the 
issue and expressed satisfaction with the program of Partnership 
for Peace, said Kozyrev. 
  It is too early to say what the period will end with. It may 
be so that many states, possibly, Russia (it is not excluded) 
will join NATO. But the period will not obligatory be a 
preparatory one. Other options are possible as well. 
  Broader security systems may be created and the Council of 
North Atlantic Cooperation may be consolidated. The more so, in 
the opinion of the Russian side, all areas should be developed 
parallelly. It is a new quality of partnership and not new 
membership in NATO that matters. Kozyrev said they should 
concentrate on partnership, fill it with specific content and 
see the final result. The most important is stability and 
cooperation in Europe.

  [Excerpts] Continuing the theme of international military 
political events, I would like to draw your attention to the 
results of the NATO meeting in Brussels last week. [passage

Pavel Grachev assesses the situation. 
  [Begin Grachev recording] We take an understanding attitude 
toward the sovereign right of every state, including those of 
eastern Europe, to choose a path for ensuring its own security. 
Such a choice could be participation in military political 
alliances. We would not like the states of central and eastern 
Europe, or the Baltic region, to speculate on a mythical threat 
from Russia. We do not understand their aspiration to defend 
themselves from Russia by membership of NATO. We, for our part, 
welcome the decision by the meeting of the NATO council, at the 
foreign minister level, in Brussels on 3 December, to remove 
this question from the agenda. 
  We are supporters of the kind of path which leads to a 
genuine all-European system of security, that is, collective 
actions--but not by the criteria of belonging to blocs--with a 
view to preventing and settling the crises and conflicts 
currently convulsing Europe. We believe that security and 
international stability should be indivisible and rely on 
all-European structures. Russia takes as its premise that our 
relations with NATO should be richer and develop across a broad 
range of interaction. Russia's rapprochement with NATO, it 
seems to us, should proceed at a rapid pace. The east Europeans 
could, of course, also join this process. 
  We have met with Mr. Woerner, the president has met him, and 
I was there, and we reached this agreement--that we set up 
groups, they have already been set up, expert groups of 
specialists, from NATO on the one side and Russia on the other. 
Over the course of January we are going to study a plan for 
Russia to cooperate with NATO, and sometime in January, perhaps 
in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, where I have been invited, so as 
fully to explain every text of our military doctrine to the 
members of NATO and other interested persons, and maybe we'll 
sign this agreement there, if the president instructs me to do 
so, on behalf of the government. This matter has been studied. 
In addition, I have had a meeting with the commander in chief 
of the joint armed forces in Europe, an American general, with 
whom we also agreed during January to study an agreement, at a 
purely military level--the other one was at a military political 
level, while this is at a purely military level--between the 
commander in chief of NATO's joint armed forces in Europe, and 
the Russian armed forces. [end recording]

  [Text] In an interview with Interfax, Vice Governor of 
Russia's Central Bank Vyacheslav Solovov categorically refuted 
Gaydar's assertions that the Russian-Belarusian inter-bank 
agreement would reproduce chaos in the monetary sphere. 
  He said that the inter-bank agreement did not have anything 
to do with the unification of the monetary systems. This may 
happen when both Russian and Belarusian governments take a 
corresponding decision, he said. So far, the Russian and 
Belarusian prime ministers have only signed a statement on the 
forthcoming, not actual, unification of the monetary systems, he 
continued. Moreover, the agreement envisages a detailed analysis 
of all aspects of both countries' monetary emission and credit 
policies. 
  Solovov believes that Gaydar deliberately distorted facts 
and 
that the financial policy, pursued by the government has pushed 
the Russian financial system on the verge of ruin. Moreover, 
"many people claiming to be experts are in fact dilettantes 
looking for a way out of the crisis in the banking policy, 
instead of concentrating on economic restructuring," he said. 
  He stated that Gaydar's resignation was not motivated by the 
inter-bank agreement. "Gaydar used it as a pretext for covering 
up more complicated problems," he said. 
  An attentive reader of the inter-bank agreement will not 
fail 
to see that the actual unification of the monetary systems will 
occur when the purchasing power of the Belarusian monetary unit 
will become equivalent to the Russian ruble. Only then will it 
become possible to exchange the national banknotes according to 
the 1 to 1 rate. This work is already being done by experts of 
ministries, by the Committee for Prices and by the Central Bank. 
This requires a serious analysis not slogans," he said. 
  To quote Solovov, Russian industrial enterprises owe Belarus 
211 Bn rubles (as of December 1, 1993). If this money were 
repaid to Belarus, the exchange rate between the Russian and 
Belarusian rubles would not be so striking, he said. The 
Russian enterprises' insolvency was largely caused by the 
economic policy pursued by the government in 1992-93. It had a 
strong impact on the exchange rate and strongly influenced the 
economic processes, stated Solovov.

  [Text] Moscow January 18 TASS -- "The merger of Russian and 
Belarussian monetary systems mainly concerns non-cash turnover," 
Aleksandr Shokhin, vice-premier of the Russian government, said 
in an interview with ITAR-TASS. 
  "Unlike Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, which used old Soviet 
cash 
money and attempted to accelerate the merger of the monetary 
systems, Belarus did nothing of the kind. Now, all mechanisms 
of the merger, including both monetary and economic systems, 
should be worked out. This concerns interbank relations, 
budgets, customs systems, etc.," Shokhin said. 
  He went on to say that Belarus is, perhaps, the only country 
of the former Soviet Union which encourages the development of 
mixed forms of property. This process of encouraging mutual 
interests should be strengthened. Shokhin pointed out that ill- 
considered political statements should not impede real 
possibilities for integration which might be advantageous for 
Russia.

  [Text] Moscow, 14 Jan -- Ion Butnaru, Moldova's acting 
foreign minister, today ended a visit to Moscow that lasted 
three days. In the course of the visit, I. Butnaru held 
intensive talks at the Russian Federation's Foreign Ministry 
with Andrey Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Krylov, 
deputy foreign minister and head of the Department of CIS 
countries. He also talked to Michael Emerson, the head of the 
European Union's delegation in Moscow. 
  A wide range of issues on Russian-Moldovan relations and 
assistance to Russia in the settlement of the Dniester problem 
were the main topics at the talks with Andrey Kozyrev held on 
Thursday [13 January]. 
  This is a most complex process, and the main thing for us, 
Andrey Kozyrev told journalists at the end of the talks, is to 
persuade both sides -- the Moldovan Government and the Dniester 
leadership -- to seek ways of achieving political accord and 
political solutions. He described the conversation that took 
place as a useful and informative conversation which proceeded 
"in a professional and business-like manner." 
  Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Andrey 
Kozyrev said that the Dniester problem would be examined at the 
Russian-U.S. summit, which is currently taking place in Moscow. 
We are conducting a dialogue with the United States and other 
countries since the region is a matter of concern for the CSCE 
and United Nations. At all bilateral meetings, we are seeking 
to expand the range of countries involved to enhance our efforts 
in resolving similar problems.

  [Text] Pskov has become the first oblast in Russia where 
the Latvian Republic has opened its consulate. This is not 
accidental. The whole state border between Russia and Latvia 
goes through Pskov oblast. 
  A lot is being expected from the new consulate. It will make 
it possible for people who have been suddenly divided by state 
borders to preserve kinship and friendly ties. In the past one 
had to travel from the border to St. Petersburg to get a visa. 
  Strengthening economic contacts between Russia and Latvia is 
another important thing. Around 40 joint ventures are operating 
in Pskov oblast alone. 
  Today's event is the first sign. Estonia's consulate and an 
office of the Russian Foreign Ministry are to be opened in Pskov 
in the future.

  [Text] The next meeting of the warring Bosnian sides to be 
held in Geneva on Tuesday is "extremely important; it may prove 
to be decisive from the viewpoint of viability of the present 
plan for a settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina." The special envoy 
of Russia's president, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, 
said so in an interview with INTERFAX before his departure for 
Geneva. 
  According to him, "very intensive" consultations were 
conducted in the past few days in the framework of preparations 
for the Geneva round of talks. This issue was discussed at the 
meeting between the Russian and American Presidents in Moscow, 
and at the parallel negotiations between Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher and the head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey 
Kozyrev. 
  According to the diplomat, progress reached in the talks on 
territorial concessions is the principal positive factor in the 
efforts to resolve the crisis. Some 33.5 percent of the 
territory in Bosnia-Herzegovina claimed by the Muslims have been 
guaranteed to them at last. It was a key demand of the European 
Union, and a top- priority issue at the talks, Churkin said.

Defense Secretary Favors Cautious NATO Approach to Bosnia"] 
  [Text] NATO should show great caution regarding potential 
air strikes in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This opinion was 
expressed in an interview on BBC radio by UK Defense Secretary 
Malcolm Rifkind, commenting on the decisions of the session of 
the North Atlantic bloc council which has ended in Brussels. He 
stressed that London feels no special enthusiasm for the policy 
of intimidation by air strikes because British servicemen form 
part of the NATO forces on the ground engaged in delivering 
humanitarian aid to the population. 
  Ending the war in former Yugoslavia is not the task of the 
United Nations: It cannot be achieved by military measures from 
outside, the head of the military department pointed out. The 
international contingent's objective is to ensure the normal 
delivery of humanitarian aid to tens of thousands of innocent 
people.

  [Text] Four Russian submarines, currently in the Pacific 
Fleet, will leave Russian territorial waters in the near future 
to join the naval forces of North Korea. TOKYO SHIMBUN 
newspaper reported in its evening issue [date not given] that a 
contract on export of the submarines has already been signed by 
representatives of Moscow and Pyongyang. Quoting a high-ranking 
source in the Pacific Fleet command, the newspaper claims that 
talks with North Korea on delivery of four submarines have been 
conducted by representatives of the Russian naval forces in 
complete secrecy. 
  The sum of contract is not known. Currently, the submarines 
schedule to leave for DPRK are being used for training purposes 
and are practically unsuitable for combat missions. They were 
all built in the sixties. A source in the Pacific Fleet command 
assessed that after necessary repairs, the submarines would join 
the North Korean combat subunits. However, it is not out of 
the question that they would be dismantled, and the spare parts 
used to repair other North Korean submarines.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Sychev report: "Kim Il-song Has Bought From Us </F>
Submarines That Cannot Sail"] 
  [Text] North Korea is experiencing an acute shortage of 
raw materials for smelting steel and is purchasing old weapons 
for scrap whenever the opportunity arises. Four Russian 
submarines are destined for that country's metallurgical plants 
in the near future. 
  The submarines in question are SS-60's, known in the West by 
the designation "Foxtrot." These diesel-powered torpedo-armed 
submarines were constructed in the Soviet Union in the 1960's 
and have already completed their intended service life. Of the 
40 or so submarines of this class which remain in the Russian 
Navy, some are still used as training vessels. The rest, 
however, are permanently laid up and are quietly poisoning the 
environment at naval bases. 
  Navy commanders have been authorized to sell off these 
decommissioned vessels on their own initiative. Because Russia 
lacks adequate production capacity suited to preparing warships 
for melting down, and also because the country's economic 
position boosts the attractiveness of freely convertible 
currency, foreign buyers naturally have priority rights. 
  The contract to sell four decommissioned submarines to North 
Korean buyers was signed by the Russian Pacific Fleet command. 
  The Japanese newspaper TOKYO SHIMBUN has conjectured that, 
having obtained the submarines, North Korea will carry out 
repairs and put them into service in its navy. In the opinion 
of Russian specialists, however, it would be economically 
disadvantageous to carry out a complete overhaul of the 
"Foxtrots." Moreover, under existing rules all armaments and 
guidance systems will be dismantled before the submarines are 
dispatched to North Korea.

The report says that the Pacific Fleet has sold to North Korea

contract had indeed been signed for the sale of 12 obsolete 
diesel submarines with a Japanese firm. However, at present

  [Text] It is necessary to make a decision concerning 
possible return of the Sakhalin Koreans to their historic 
homeland and provide compensation for moral and material damage 
inflicted on them, according to the results of an opinion poll. 
This is the conclusion drawn by members of a joint 
Japanese-South Korean delegation, on a visit in Sakhalin. 
  According to various information, 30,000-40,000 ethnic 
Koreans are living on the island now. 
  Deputy chief of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's Northeastern 
Asia Department Fudzi Arata and chief of the Korean Foreign 
Ministry's Northeastern Department Sin Gak-su were at the head 
of this joint delegation. Yevgeniy Lishakov, an official from 
the Russian Foreign Ministry's Asia Department, and 
representative of the State Federation Committee Gerasim Yugay 
attended the negotiations of the delegation with the Association 
of the Sakhalin Koreans as supervisors. 
  During the pre-war years the Japanese Government deported 
the 
Koreans to the island of Sakhalin by force to fulfill hard labor 
needs and after the defeat in WWII they left them there. For 
more than 40 years the Sakhalin Koreans have had no opportunity 
to write to their relatives and have had no information from 
their homeland because the former USSR recognized only the 
Korean People's Democratic Republic and pursued the policy of 
the Korean population's assimilation. 
  The Coordinating Council of the Association of the Sakhalin 
Koreans has formulated its demands in an address to the 
governments of Japan, South Korea, and Russia. These include: 
Re-settlement of old people (born before 1930) to South Korea 
for permanent residence, granting accommodation and benefits to 
them, granting of Russian pensions and benefits to the people 
under repatriation, and payment of compensation totalling 10 Mn 
yen for the inflicted moral and material damage to every 
Sakhalin Korean who preferred to stay in Russia. In addition, 
they are asking the governments of South Korea and the Russian 
Federation to sign an inter-governmental agreement on dual 
citizenship for the Sakhalin Koreans. 
  Participants of the consultations held in Sakhalin also 
agreed to transform bilateral talks on ethnic Koreans into 
tripartite ones, having included Russia into this process.

<F P=106> [Anastasiya Romashkevich report: "Territorial Disputes With </F>
Japan. Talking About Derailed Talks Is Premature"] 
  [Text] On Thursday evening REUTER reported a Japanese 
Foreign Ministry statement on indefinitely suspending 
Russian-Japanese talks on territorial demarcation. It is 
noteworthy that this report coincided with the first address by 
Vladimir Shumeyko as Federal Assembly speaker [as published; 
Shumeyko is Federation Council speaker], in which he made it 
clear that there is no territorial problem and that the islands 
belong to Russia. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr 
Panov comments on the situation at KOMMERSANT-DAILY's request. 
  By the time of Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo in October, 
when it was decided to hold a regular meeting of a working group 
on the peace treaty (it discussed the territorial question among 
other things), experts had not been in session for more than a 
year. At the time the meeting was tentatively scheduled for 
December. Now, however, according to REUTER, Moscow decided to 
postpone the talks "indefinitely," citing the fact that many 
Russian politicians were involved in the election campaign. 
  According to Mr. Panov, this report, which was published a 
few days ago in a Japanese newspaper, was news to him. 
Incidentally, the diplomat noted, a number of Japanese mass 
media have already refuted this information. The meeting, 
indeed, is unlikely to be held in January, because the sides 
have yet to resolve a number of technical matters related to its 
organization. The Russian Foreign Ministry, however, has not 
sent proposals to Tokyo for an "indefinite" postponement, Mr. 
Panov said. Moreover, talking about postponement is simply 
irrelevant because no specific decisions on possible dates of 
the peace treaty group's meetings had been made earlier. Mr. 
Panov pointed out that to all appearances a Japanese delegation 
would arrive in Moscow in February. The meeting's precise date 
will be announced "in the near future." 
<H5>  Commentary </H5>
  When a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry said that 
talks on the territorial problem were allegedly postponed at 
Moscow's request, he cited his counterparts from the Russian 
Foreign Ministry. They allegedly attributed the delay to the 
fact that their representatives, many of whom were involved in 
the election campaign, were not ready for the talks. We may add 
that the supervisor of the Japanese sector at the Russian 
Foreign Ministry has also changed in the wake of the elections: 
Georgiy Kunadze left for Seoul as Russian ambassador, and 
Aleksandr Panov has yet to get into the swing of things. After 
all, it is not so important whether the talks will take place in 
January or February. Rumors about the postponement are only a 
sign of Tokyo's concern about the results of such talks. The 
key word here -- "election campaign" -- brings to mind the fact 
that Russia's foreign policy has been more and more affected by 
the "Zhirinovskiy factor;" he, having succeeded in his 
nationalist rhetoric in general, has repeatedly said that the 
Kremlin is allegedly ready just about to "give up the islands to 
Japan." 
  At a time when economic populism literally costs a lot and 
is 
constrained by the realities of the Russian budget deficit and 
ever- lasting inflation, political, or rather foreign policy, 
populism may just as well be chosen as a weapon in the struggle. 
All the more so because not only has it brought Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia leaders great dividends, it has also 
enabled them to leave the voters in the dark as to the party's 
economic program. 
  As a matter of fact, addressing the Federal Assembly, its 
new 
chief, Vladimir Shumeyko [as published], having successfully 
evaded all acute angles regarding economic policy, made a point 
of voicing his support for Viktor Chernomyrdin on the South 
Kuril islands problem: Kunashir, Iturup, Shikotan and the 
Habomai islands "belong to Russia, and there is no question of 
their transfer." While he acknowledged that his view diverged 
from Moscow's official point of view (which boils down to 
admitting that "the problem exists"), it is clear that any talks 
about the islands are doomed to a stalemate. Nikita Khrushchev, 
who officially promised two of the islands to the Japanese, has 
probably been the only politician who could act without paying 
heed to the voters. It is also evident that a period started by 
Mikhail Gorbachev, when the fact of recognizing the existence of 
a territorial problem (without visible breakthroughs in its 
settlement) was modus operandi in relations with Japan, is 
drawing to a close. No arguments about "fostering cooperation 
on the basis of compromise in the settlement of territorial 
disputes" will work any longer given a formidable nationalist 
opposition.

<F P=106> [Sergey Agafonov report: "Talks Postponed, But Japanese </F>
Shocked by Shumeyko's Statements"] 
  [Text] Tokyo -- Late last year Moscow and Tokyo agreed to 
hold at the end of January a meeting of the bilateral group 
which is working on a peace treaty, as well as studying the 
territorial issue. The meeting was of fundamental importance 
for the Japanese side since it was to attest that, following the 
parliamentary elections, there had been no change in Russia's 
acknowledgment of the territorial problem as a real, pressing 
problem. It became known yesterday evening that the bilateral 
meeting has been postponed indefinitely on the Russian side's 
initiative. 
  The reasons given have plunged the Japanese into profound 
depression: The Russian side gave domestic political factors 
linked with the new parliament as the reason. In Tokyo this was 
interpreted unequivocally as meaning that the political changes 
taking place in Russia do not as yet allow Moscow to clearly 
make up its mind about Japan. And this means that the accords 
secured during Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan in October are, as 
it were, up in the air. 
  Japanese concern intensified after the first press 
conference 
given by Vladimir Shumeyko, who has just been elected speaker of 
the Russian parliament's upper chamber. News agencies reported 
that the new speaker said that the disputed islands are Russian 
territory and cannot and will not be surrendered to anyone. 
According to Shumeyko, there is no question of the ownership and 
future of the islands of Kunashir, Iturup, Habomai, and Shikotan 
at all. What is more, the speaker pointed out that the 
government and cabinet of ministers apparatus backs the stance 
espoused by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, which boils down to the 
idea that the territorial question does not exist in 
Russian-Japanese relations. But the most significant point in 
Shumeyko's statements, as reported by news agency channels, is a 
previously unheard-of statement: The speaker said that the 
Russian Government's stance on territorial matters is at 
variance with Russia's official position. 
  Shumeyko virtually admitted that not only does the Russian 
president not have the last word or the deciding say as far as 
the parliament is concerned but even as far as members of the 
cabinet, which the president himself formed, are concerned. 
  People in Japan have not so far commented on this revelation 
-- evidently they are at a loss to find the necessary words and 
phrases straightaway. But ultimately it is not a question of 
Japanese comment but of the fact that Moscow seems to see 
nothing bad in this situation.

<F P=106> [Sergey Viktorov commentary] </F>
  [Text] Iran has once again stressed the peaceful nature of 
its nuclear program. [Word indistinct] Reza Amrollahi, official 
representative of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization [IAEO], 
speaking to an IRNA correspondent on Wednesday [12 January], 
said that a recent report in the U.S. magazine "U.S.A. TODAY" is 
sheer lies and (?part of a) U.S. plot against the world of 
Islam. Sergey Viktorov writes on this: 
  We should recall that normally information by the special 
services of the United States form the basis of reports such as 
those that are being (?recently heard) in a number of Western 
countries. Taking into consideration the special 
characteristics of U.S.-Iranian relations, it is difficult to 
consider such information to be realistic and unbiased. 
  Nevertheless, according to known facts, in their effort to 
portray the Islamic Republic as a country that has been 
(?rejected) by world society, the U.S. special services are 
willing to ignore conclusions that have been drawn by impartial 
international experts, something which Reza Amrollahi justly 
pointed out in his news conference. 
  Last fall a group of experts from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] inspected all the nuclear installations on 
Iranian territory and did not find any proof that Iran is 
manufacturing nuclear weapons. It should be noted that all 
similar IAEA inspections have so far yielded the same 
conclusion. Moreover, it should be added that Tehran has never 
expressed its intention to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Pact and has also signed the agreement on (?banning) chemical 
weapons. 
  Thus it appeared that the exploitation of this issue could 
be 
stopped. But this did not happen. The United States has 
succeeded in its efforts to convince its partners in the G-7 to 
join in boycotting the exports to Iran of so-called technology 
that can be used for dual purposes. Tehran, which was in a 
technoglically unfavorable position, requested assistance from 
Russia and China to complete the construction of incomplete 
nuclear energy installations, and specifically (?agreed) on the 
purchase of two Russian-built nuclear reactors and one Chinese 
nuclear reactor. However, this rekindled a more intense campaign 
in the West regarding Iran's ambitious nuclear programs. 
Russia's assurances were in vain. Russia pointed out that 
Russian-Iranian cooperation in the field of nuclear energy would 
be strictly within the framework of the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Pact and under the constant supervision of the IAEA. 
  Of course, the United States wants a more moderate 
government 
to come to power in Tehran. However, the traditional anti-U.S. 
remarks by the current Iranian leaders do not leave any chance 
for a positive change in the situation, and it seems that the 
West will thus continue to exploit the issue of Iran's imaginary 
nuclear threat. 
  One can agree with Reza Amrollahi's remarks in his recent 
interview. However, Tehran's wish to (?link) itself with the 
world of Islam, which can recently be seen, is also reflected in 
these remarks. If one can [word indistinct] speak about a type 
of U.S. plot, it is highly possible that this plot is only 
against Iran. But this plot must be regarded as a confrontation 
between two unreconcilable ideologies.

<F P=106> [Article by Russian Liberal Democratic Party Chairman </F>
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy: "What Are Germany's Interests?" -- 
introductory passage by DEUTSCHE NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] 
  [Text] The smear campaign against the winner of the 
Russian parliamentary elections, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, worst of 
all in the German opinion industry, is unprecedented. The 
Springer concern, which represents Israel's interests, has taken 
the lead in this respect. Springer's BILD is not even ashamed 
to write: "Russian Hitler -- I Was His Sex Slave." At the same 
time, Peter Scholl- Latour, who was once a foreign legionnaire 
and then press spokesman of the separatist Hoffmann government 
in Saarland, and as such fought for France, describes in BILD 
the "great danger" that Zhirinovskiy would return Koenigsberg 
[Kaliningrad] or northeastern Prussia. In that case, Bonn 
should by no means "give in to Zhirinovskiy's pressure." In DER 
SPIEGEL, Rudolf Augstein is very concerned about the 
allegedly-threatened Poland, which had considered "its present 
western border with the Germans secure." It is true that we 
could not "wage war alone" against Moscow to protect the 
Oder-Neisse line, "nor can (Poland) protect it alone.... We 
must back the country, even though we cannot give it contractual 
guarantees, as the British did in 1939." If future generations 
eventually read in the history books about the great concern 
that Germany might get back some of its territory, of which it 
was criminally robbed, they will think the current generation 
must have been crazy. In the following article, Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy describes the situation as it really is in an 
exclusive for DEUTSCHE NATIONAL-ZEITUNG and DEUTSCHE 
WOCHEN-ZEITUNG. We call upon our readers to distribute this 
newspaper and this article as widely as possible, and thus 
contribute to finding the truth: 
  As chairman of the strongest Russian political party, the 
Liberal Democratic Party, which won the parliamentary elections 
in December, I am trying to find out which German interests 
could have caused the federal foreign minister to refuse to 
grant me an entry visa. 
  It is generally known that hundreds of thousands of sham 
asylum-seekers registered by German courts and authorities have 
not been deported. Jewish citizens from Russia and the CIS 
republics are promptly granted visas for the Federal Republic 
upon request to stay here indefinitely and take advantage of the 
excellent German social welfare network. Hundreds of thousands 
of foreigners cross the Oder-Neisse border and come to Germany 
illegally, and many of them call for and are granted the "right 
to stay," even though such a right does not exist in the German 
legal system. 
<H5>  No Special Role for Germany </H5>
  According to the calculations of prominent Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] politicians, the German taxpayer has 
probably paid 100 billion German marks [DM] over the last three 
years. My stay in Germany would have ended before 11 January, 
the opening session of the Duma, and would not have cost the 
German taxpayer a single mark. 
  My pro-German attitude may appear unusual, if we recall the 
visits of many politicians who have appeared in the Federal 
Republic over the past decades, criticized the German people, 
and were generously rewarded for so doing. By the same token, 
even some media in Germany say that "citing German interests" as 
a reason for refusing entry to me involves many different 
considerations, because "regrettably," I "did not attack the 
Federal Republic, but even courted it" (STUTTGARTER ZEITUNG 30 
December, 1993). 
  Regarding my way of thinking, I ask the Germans to 
understand 
that, as a Russian, I was not brainwashed for re-education. So 
I do not see why the German people, half a century after World 
War II, should be condemned to a special role. I do not see why 
Germans born after 1945, or not yet born, should assume 
collective responsibility and collective liability. 
<H5>  Smear Campaign as in the War </H5>
  The winners of World War II did not repeat the "basic 
mistake" they made after World War I, but staffed the opinion 
industry in Germany, after 1945, with reliable persons of their 
choice. When reading, hearing, or seeing the German media 
spread slander against me, I get the impression that I am at 
war, or as if war were imminent. There is no abuse or 
defamation that would not be leveled against me. 
  My family had to make many sacrifices in the fight against 
fascism. However, the yellow press in Germany has touted me, in 
many ways, as the "Russian Hitler." Even though the elections 
in Russia were not too free in my view, but were still freer 
than they often are in the "free West," the Russian people have 
been disparaged. My voters did not know what they were doing, 
claims the media, and were seduced by demagogy and even 
hypnosis. To fill the cup to the brim, I, being a passionate 
animal lover, have been denounced as an arrant tormenter of 
animals, enjoying even dog fights. In this respect also, the 
truth is exactly the opposite of what the media says. I am -- 
and I have always said so -- an absolute opponent of any kind of 
animal fights and generally any cruelty to animals. 
<H5>  Everlasting Friendship With Germany </H5>
  It is correct that I do not think the Oder-Neisse line is 
history's last word, nor do I think that it is cause for alarm. 
Rather, I was amazed -- and I was not the only one -- that in 
the Two-Plus-Four negotiations, Bonn, under the pressure of 
Western "friends," did not even suggest a peaceful revision 
regarding territories west of the Oder, such as Stettin 
[Szczecin] or Swinemuende [Swinoujscie]. It should be 
remembered that Warsaw occupied these territories by coup de 
main, which was not approved by the then victors. 
  If Russia and Germany had a common border -- in eastern 
Prussia, for instance -- this would by no means lead to the 
extinction of Poland as a state, as malicious people have 
insinuated. Discussing all German-Russian matters in cordial 
harmony with my friend, Gerhard Frey, is no sin. However, our 
friendship does not justify hateful insinuations "that 
Zhirinovskiy and Frey are redrawing the map of Europe from 
Berlin or Munich" (SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG of 30 December 1993). 
  The peaceful revision of borders through negotiations is in 
line with international law. My policy is oriented toward 
lasting partnership and everlasting friendship between Russia 
and Germany. This requires unlimited sovereignty, full equality, 
and mutual non- interference. 
  In Russia, German language and culture are rising fast 
again. 
United Germany is the heart of Europe. It is with great 
sympathy that I watch the German language's apparently tortuous 
journey until it is finally given the rank due to it in 
international bodies dominated by the West. 
<H5>  Bad Blood Through Entry Ban </H5>
  Just as it was impossible for Metternich to prevent a small 
German unity, and for Mitterrand, the smallest German unity, it 
is a hopeless venture, over the long run, to chain the German 
giant and deprive him of his rights. 
  The entry ban imposed on me has also created bad blood in 
the 
Russian Army, which backs me. I advocate the withdrawal of our 
troops from the territory of the former GDR. But how can other 
foreign troops continue to be deployed in Germany, and the 
Bundeswehr be subdivided into multinational units under foreign 
command? 
  My policy is opposed to every degradation and special 
treatment of Germany. We want a normal and sound, a vigorous 
and German Germany, naturally also with a strong national army 
under a German general staff. 
<H5>  Our Friendship Is Directed Against Noone </H5>
  Our friendship is directed against noone, but is the ideal 
guarantee of wellbeing, self-determination, and peace. These 
goals cannot violate Germany's national interests. 
  My model is Bismarck. His great social laws on the one hand, 
and his ingenious foreign policy on the other, have made the 
creator of the small German empire immortal. A renewal of the 
Reinsurance Treaty, which was one of the masterpieces of the 
great chancellor, would have spared our nations World War I and 
thus probably also World War II. Such insanity must never 
repeat itself! 
  Even though I highly respect President Yeltsin, I will run 
in 
the next presidential elections, and I will win. To be sure, 
the Foreign Ministry in Bonn -- which hopefully will be in 
Berlin very soon -- must show consideration for many things. 
But as it is, Russians and Germans are the greatest European 
peoples, and Russia is the world's greatest state. 
<H5>  Germany Must Live </H5>
  Being a democrat, I of course respect the freely elected 
German federal government. Neither an entry ban nor the 
defamatory media campaign can make me change my clearly 
pro-German policy course. The Russian people certainly cannot be 
influenced against me by all the distortions of news agencies 
and press media, television and radio stations from Germany. 
What is rather unavoidable is this: "What will politicians do 
if Zhirinovskiy, who can today be refused an entry visa, sits in 
the Moscow Kremlin as president in two years?" (DIE WELT of 31 
December 1993). 
  The false reports on me will, however, contribute to 
reviving 
anti-German resentment in Russia. My compatriots are wondering 
why a consistent friend of the Germans such as myself should be 
one of the main targets of so many malicious attacks from the 
media that spreads its venom from Germany. 
  I also appeal to the intelligence, admired worldwide, of the 
Germans, the people of poets and thinkers. In the summer of 
1992, I went to Germany for comprehensive talks with Mr. Frey, 
and at a joint news conference in Munich and a rally of the 
German People's Union [DVU] in Thuringia, I expounded my theses 
on everlasting German-Russian friendship. In the spring of 
1993, Mr. Frey and I were at similar meetings in Moscow, the 
Liberal Democratic Party Congress, and a ceremony on the 
occasion of my birthday. In the fall of 1993, we repeated this 
on a large scale at the DVU mass rally in the Passau Nibelungen 
Hall. 
<H5>  The Work of Intelligence Services </H5>
  The speech I held in Nibelungen Hall is accurately recorded 
on the video "Passau 93: Germany Must Live". There has probably 
hardly ever been a non-German politician over the past decades 
who has affirmed and defended the German people's vital rights 
and interests as clearly and thoroughly as I have done. 
  Every thinking person will therefore know what to make of 
those people who, citing an alleged "intelligence service 
recording," imply that I intend to annihilate Germany and, prior 
to its "total destruction," extort huge reparation payments, 
until it becomes a "poor country." 
  I have very often commented to DEUTSCHE NATIONAL-ZEITUNG on 
the fatal work and terrible goals of intelligence services that 
set us at one another's throats and try to destroy our 
friendship. 
  Nothing has changed about my goals -- Germans and Russians 
in 
fraternal unity and everlasting friendship!

  [Text] Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin took "calmly" 
Yegor Gaydar's decision to resign from the post of first vice 
premier, Sergey Yushenkov, the Russia's Choice secretary, told 
Interfax. 
  Yushenkov announced that on Sunday morning the bureau of the 
Russia's Choice faction had held a meeting with Gaydar's 
participation and unanimously supported Gaydar's decision, aware 
that he could not bear the responsibility for the policy he does 
not support. 
  Yushenkov said that Gaydar would concentrate on his 
parliamentary activity and on the creation of a new party on the 
basis of Russia's Choice. 
  To quote Yushenkov, Finance Minister Boris Fedorov is also 
planning to quit the government. Like Gaydar, "he cannot bear 
the responsibility for a policy which will inevitable spur 
inflation". 
  Anatoliy Chubays will stay in the government, said 
Yushenkov. 
  In the new situation, the parliamentary committee for the 
budget, planning and taxes should be led by Russia's Choice 
representative Aleksandr Pochinok, although earlier Russia's 
Choice had not objected to this committee being led by Grigoriy 
Yavlinskiy's nearest associate Mikhail Zadornov.

the Council of Ministers by presidential edict. By doing so 
Boris Yeltsin veered away from his edict No. 66 signed 10 
January, whereby Viktor Chernomyrdin was to name the candidacies 
of his two first deputies and two "ordinary" deputies by 17 
January. Boris Yeltsin moved Anatoliy Chubays outside the 
edict's scope by effectively making him the head of government's 
fifth deputy. 
  According to trustworthy reports, initially the prime 
minister did not consider the State Property Committee chairman 
as a candidate for his "deputy." Moreover, under that same 
edict No. 66, the status of the State Property Committee in the 
government structure was lower than that of a ministry; this 
meant that its chief would "fall" by as many as two rungs. It 
seems that there were two reasons for Boris Yeltsin's somewhat 
unexpected decision. First, Anatoliy Chubays has told the 
president and the prime minister, apparently off the record, 
that he did not want to be reduced to a figure that is moved too 
energetically on the political board. All the more so because 
presently the State Property Committee has to cope with a 
plethora of reforms: the completion of the small and 
large-scale privatization programs, including the voucher-based 
stage that must end by 1 July; the establishment of control over 
state-owned enterprises; and the introduction of the 
restructuring and bankruptcy procedures. Second, Boris 
Yeltsin's edict coincided with the visit of Bill Clinton, whose 
delegation includes Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. Both 
American guests have repeatedly admired in public the scale and 
pace of Russian privatization. 
  Meanwhile, the situation with Finance Minister Boris Fedorov 
has so far remained unresolved. It has transpired from those 
same government sources that he would not accept even the status 
of a deputy prime minister, if Aleksandr Zaveryukha is a 
government member in that same capacity and Viktor Gerashchenko 
remains Central Bank chairman. The much-publicized differences 
of these people's views on the goals and content of reform have 
rendered their cohabitation within one government virtually 
impossible.

"Boris Fedorov's Fate as an Indicator. The Goals of the Prime 
Minister and Those of the President Diverge Again"] 
  [Text] After Boris Yeltsin appointed Anatoliy Chubays 
deputy prime minister, bypassing a lengthy process of forming a 
government, the question of differences between the prime 
minister and the president has taken on a new intensity. Did 
the prime minister know about Anatoliy Chubays' appointment? If 
not, then the war of position inside the executive branch is 
becoming clearly threatening in nature: The president is 
betting everything, and this suggests that the old cabinet's 
volatile balance will remain in the new one. Apparently, soon we 
should expect Boris Fedorov's appointment. This, in turn, will 
mean the reemergence of characteristics of the old confrontation 
-- the Finance Ministry against the Central Bank and the 
government against the parliament ("Russia's Choice" will not be 
able to take the budget commission under control). 
  The only thing one can state with assurance so far is that 
the prime minister's line toward forming a manageable and 
effective government will depend on his consultations with the 
president that are to follow Anatoliy Chubays' appointment and 
will be under way until Monday. The goals of the president and 
those of the prime minister have somewhat diverged. 
Chernomyrdin needs hard-working, not politicized, executives. 
Yeltsin, apparently, needs a steady reform course. 
  Boris Fedorov's fate will be a decisive indicator at this 
stage.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The first reaction to Gaydar's 
resignation is quite contradictory. In the opinion of Sergey 
Zverev, who represents the Most group, Russia's major financial 
association, Deputy Prime Minister Boris Fedorov is the key 
figure in the implementation of financial and economic reforms. 
If he were to follow Gaydar, the situation would be seriously 
affected. 
  Fedorov has not made up his mind yet about his resignation, 
though he does not rule out such a possibility. If Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha becomes deputy prime minister and I am offered just 
the post of minister, I will not join the Cabinet of Ministers, 
he told Interfax today. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Boris Fedorov, Russian Vice Premier and Finance 
Minister, has not made up his mind about his resignation, but 
did not rule out this possibility. 
  In an exclusive interview he told Interfax Sunday that 
everything will depend on the government team, its crediting and 
financial policy and what the prime minister and president have 
to say to him. 
  He said that the distribution of top positions would largely 
dictate his decision. 
  He did not rule out the possibility that the announcement 
that there would be fewer vice premiers in the new governmental 
line up had been made so as to leave out Sergey Shakhray, 
Aleksandr Shokhin and himself. 
  "If there are one or two vice premiers, I will agree to be 
just a finance minister. If, however, there are four or five of 
them and Aleksandr Zaveryukha is one of them while I am to be 
only a finance minister, then I will not be a cabinet member 
because this would be an insult to me," Fedorov said. 
  He thinks that "a reduction of the number of like-minded 
people" among the vice premiers would indicate a policy change. 
  Fedorov said that he had had no prior knowledge of Gaydar's 
resignation but that he had not ruled out that possibility. In 
his words, he reacted "calmly" to the news of Gaydar's 
resignation. 
  "Gaydar was not in the government for months, yet it stayed 
on the reform course and I would not attribute all our 
achievements to his return," Fedorov emphasized. 
  He did not think that Gaydar's resignation would have a 
strong impact on the ruble's rate of exchange but admitted that 
it was not welcome news for the ruble. 
  "The ruble cannot collapse as long as I am the finance 
minister," the vice premier said. 
  He believes, however, that the ruble has been falling since 
December because of the rumors about the government set up and 
that it would be adversely affected by the merger of the Russian 
and Belarusian monetary systems, possible writing off of 
Ukraine's debt, and allocation of immense amounts for 
construction of a parliamentary building. 
  Commenting on the statements made by some Russia's Choice 
leaders about his resignation from all his cabinet posts Fedorov 
said that he had not endorsed them. He was dissatisfied about 
the way the parliamentary group is run. Fedorov emphasized that 
he was not formally a group member. 
  No meetings with the president or prime minister were 
scheduled for Monday, but he hoped that he would have a meeting 
with his superiors because the situation has drastically changed 
with Gaydar's resignation. 
  Fedorov intended to pose conditions for his stay on the 
government but declined to specify them. 
  He said he had scheduled a news conference for about 10:00 
Tuesday and hoped that he would have something to say then.

  [Text] Meeting Boris Fedorov Monday night, Russia's Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin offered him the post of finance 
minister "but not in the rank of deputy prime minister." 
  As Fedorov told journalists in the Duma, he was given one

a half to two hours to think the proposal over and announce the 
final decision on whether he would stay in the cabinet.

<F P=106> [Report by Irina Savvateyeva: "Boris Fedorov May Resign"] </F>
  [Text] It seems time for Boris Fedorov to make his next 
bet. In a recent interview, which the finance minister gave me, 
he joked: 
  "When I resign, I will make a bet.... No, first I will make 
a bet that the exchange rate will reach 2,000 [rubles to $1], 
and the next day I will announce that I am going...." 
  Many commentators today think that there is a very real 
possibility that Mr. Fedorov will resign. Everything depends on 
who will be named as vice premier by Viktor Chernomyrdin on 
Monday. 
  "It is very unlikely that Fedorov will stay if Zaveryukha is 
vice premier," according to, for instance, Sergey Vasilyev, 
leader of the Russian Government's Working Center for Economic 
Reforms. 
  The finance minister and Aleksandr Zaveryukha, 
representative 
of the agrarian lobby in the government, have been engaged in 
long and hard conflict, which is naturally based on the fact 
that the latter persistently demands money from the former while 
he equally persistently denies it to him. But virtually no one 
doubts that Mr. Zaveryukha will become a vice premier. While 
the chances of Fedorov himself becoming one of the four vice 
premiers are seen as minimal. So the prospect of the finance 
minister finding himself not on a par with his antagonist, and 
even in a subordinate position to him, are perfectly real. 
People who know Boris Grigoryevich well claim that he would 
certainly not accept that. 
  Does this mean that the end of financial stabilization is 
nigh? 
  The ruble exchange rate is already falling, and quite 
appreciably. Igor Doronin, expert at the Interbank Currency 
Exchange, considers that "this is a perfectly natural 
phenomenon. The minimium wage has almost doubled. Transport 
fares have doubled. Municipal services have gone up two- or 
threefold. Why shouldn't the exchange rate fall in such a 
situation?" His forecast is 1,800-1,900 rubles to the dollar 
within the next few weeks. 
  Fedorov's departure in this situation will certainly cause 
alarm among commercial structures, according to Igor Doronin. 
"The political situation, the top-level reshuffle, the 
strengthening of the position of the sectoral lobbyists in 
government -- all this creates a background conducive to 
destabilization of the ruble," Doronin contends. In such a 
situation "no normal businessman will sell foreign currency." 
In the Interbank expert's opinion, even the current rate is 
being maintained thanks to massive currency intervention by the 
Central Bank. 
  If reshuffles do take place in the Finance Ministry, much 
will depend on who replaces Boris Fedorov: Will the next 
minister be sufficiently tough and independent? Petr Aven, 
president of the Alfa-Bank and former Russian minister of 
foreign economic relations, thinks that only one person is 
rightly able to claim the post -- Yegor Gaydar. The prime 
minister's opinion on this score is known only to him for the 
time being. Two other names are cited: Sergey Dubinin and 
Andrey Vavilov -- current deputy finance ministers. However, 
those candidates' chances are slim.

  [Text] Moscow, 16 Jan -- "I have decided to decline an 
offer from the chairman of the government, and am not taking the 
post of first deputy prime minister," Yegor Gaydar said today at 
a meeting with journalists. 
  He said the reason for his position is that decisions have 
recently been taken in the government "in a way in which I took 
no part and with which I categorically disagreed." Yegor Gaydar 
gave just two examples: the signing of an Interbank agreement 
uniting the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus, and also the 
government's decision to construct a new building for parliament 
(the provisional cost of which is nearly $500 million). 
  "I cannot simultaneously be in the government and also in 
the 
opposition. I cannot be responsible for the reforms without 
being able to avert actions like those that have been mentioned 
here and without having the necessary levers to consistently 
pursue an economic policy of whose correctness I am convinced," 
Yegor Gaydar said. "Therefore, I deeply regret that I am forced 
to decline the post of first deputy prime minister that has been 
offered me."

  [Excerpts] Moscow, 16 Jan -- "I am forced to decline an 
offer from the chairman of the Government, and I am not 
accepting the post of first vice premier." This was stated by 
Yegor Gaydar at a meeting with journalists today. He added that 
he cannot be in the government and in opposition to it at the 
same time. [passage omitted] 
  At the same time, Yegor Gaydar spoke out for continuing to 
work with the Government. Touching upon the question of 
personalities, the leader of the "Russia's Choice" also spoke 
out for joining Grigoriy Yavlinskiy's government [as received]. 
[Moscow ITAR-TASS in English at 1214 GMT on 16 January, in a 
similar item, renders this sentence as: "Gaydar came out for 
Grigoriy Yavlinskiy to join the government."] 
  The leader of the "Russia's Choice" told journalists that he 
spoke with Boris Yeltsin on 13 January before making his 
decision not to join the new Government. 
  Yegor Gaydar said that he intends to "concentrate his 
attention on work in the State Duma." He noted that in this 
connection "Russia's Choice" intends to do everything possible 
not to allow representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party to 
join the key committees of the lower chamber -- that is the 
committees for defense, security, and international policy.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian 
at 1500 GMT on 16 January 1993 broadcasts a telephone interview 
with Yegor Gaydar in which he is asked if his resignation could 
be considered final. Gaydar replies: 
  "I spoke about this to the prime minister. I spoke about 
this to the president. The decision has been made on this. So, 
it is final. Unfortunately, I am forced to decline the offer 
put to me to join the reorganized Russian Government. 
  "The essence of the reasons that led me to make that 
decision 
is very simple: When they begin to adopt on a broad scale 
decisions on most fundamental issues that I disagree with, it is 
difficult for me to continue to do any useful work. 
  "For instance, I was categorically against the decision to 
build the new parliamentary center. That is no small question. 
As far as the budgetary applications -- which I know were 
presented to the Finance Ministry -- are concerned, we are 
talking about sums roughly equal to four times the amount spent 
on financing culture and art. I do not agree with this decision. 
I am against it categorically. Moreover, I do not understand 
how, in adopting such a decision, one can at the same time 
justify taking a tough economic line, for instance, on 
allocations for ecological needs. For instance, the sums that 
we need for resolving a most acute problem -- the dumping of 
liquid radioactive waste into the world ocean -- is 10 times 
less than those that it is proposed to allocate to these needs. 
If one has to understand and agree with such a policy or line, 
I do not understand that, nor do I agree with that. Then, at 
least, I cannot bear responsibility for it. I cannot implement 
it. 
  "That also is true of other decisions by the government, 
including on the question of expanding the ruble zone. I 
consider this question to be of extreme importance. That 
gradual consolidation of control over the money in circulation 
within the framework of the ruble zone was one of the pivots of 
our policy. Namely progress in resolving this task guaranteed 
the relative stability of the ruble exchange rate, the 
convertibility of our national currency. I consider it wrong to 
introduce once again chaos into money in circulation, without 
clearly regulating all the most complex technical questions of 
the operation of a single monetary system, to put at risk the 
already not very high level of our people's well- being for the 
sake of current political affairs. These are the reasons why I 
made my decision."

  [Text] At the request of our subscribers we present Yegor 
Gaydar's letter to President Boris Yeltsin in full: 
  "Dear Boris Nikolayevich, 
  "Over two years ago you displayed enormous confidence in me 
and my colleagues by entrusting us with carrying out radical 
economic reforms under your guidance. Working as Russia's 
deputy premier, first deputy premier and then acting premier, I 
tried to do my best to enable Russia's economy to stand on its 
feet as soon as possible, to make it possible for the painful 
period of transition to be overcome promptly. Thanks to the 
courage and patience of our compatriots, thanks to your resolve 
and consistency, we managed to not only avoid social and 
economic cataclysms that are shaking many former Soviet 
republics, but even pave the way for the future revival of our 
country. 
  "The conditions of our work in the government have never 
been 
ideal. You are well aware of the fact that we failed to 
accomplish much as a result of unceasing pressure on the part of 
the conservative political circles, not because of objective 
circumstances. Last September, when agreeing to rejoin the 
government, I realized that, while being responsible for 
economic reforms in the eyes of society, I will have only 
limited levers of influence on the economic situation. 
Nevertheless I hoped that the realization of our common 
responsibility for the country will make it possible for the 
government, even if it consisted of people of differing 
outlooks, to rally behind the president and follow a policy 
aimed at stabilizing the economy and preventing a catastrophe. 
  Unfortunately, more and more decisions, in preparing which I 
took no part, and even categorically objected to, have been 
taken of late. I'll make only two examples. 
  An inter-bank agreement on the unification of monetary 
systems has been signed between Russia and Belarus. Such 
unification is possible only if it is carefully prepared and if 
a mechanism of control protecting Russia's interests is created. 
However, the measures envisaged in the agreement will only 
reproduce chaos in the monetary sphere at the expense of Russian 
citizens' real incomes. The implementation of this decision will 
lead to a situation whereby the minimal salary and pension in 
Belarus will exceed the minimal salary and pension in Russia. 
We are not rich enough to sacrifice the welfare of the Russian 
citizens to political considerations. I objected to this 
decision, but my protests fell on deaf ears. 
  Neither is it possible to support the decision to build a 
new 
parliament center costing about $500 Mn. This sum far exceeds 
the resources allocated with great difficulty in 1993 for 
military conversion and is five time greater than the federal 
spending on culture and art. This sum equals one fifth of last 
year's social spending. This destructive decisions was taken 
without my knowledge and despite my resolute objections. Given 
this, it will be difficult for me to justify the rigid policy of 
curtailing expenses on science, culture, education and 
environmental protection. True, vitally important reforms 
involve inevitable outlays, but they have nothing to do with the 
price of thoughtless and hasty decisions. 
  Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich, 
  I cannot stay in the government and at once oppose it. 
Neither can I be responsible for reforms without having an 
opportunity to prevent actions similar to the ones I have 
mentioned or levers for implementing an economic policy which I 
am sure is correct. 
  Therefore, to my great regret, I have to turn down the post 
of the Russian government's first vice chairman offered to me. 
I assure you, however, that I will firmly support You and Your 
policy of reforms.

<F P=106> [By Sergey Shatunov, including recorded excerpts of </F>
resignation announcement by First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor 
Gaydar to journalists in Moscow today; from the "Novosti" 
newscast] 
  [Excerpt] [Shatunov] [passage omitted] It was precisely the 
wish to concentrate fully on parliamentary work and 
dissatisfaction with recent government decisions and the way the 
council of ministers was functioning in general that prompted 
Yegor Gaydar to make a sensational announcement today. 
  [Gaydar] The government has of late and with increasing 
frequency been adopting decisions with which I was either not 
acquainted or against which I categorically objected. I shall 
cite just two typical examples -- I could cite more. 
  [Shatunov] The first was the decision to expand the ruble 
zone and have a joint monetary system with the Republic of 
Belarus. The second, the decision to build a new parliamentary 
center in the center of the capital. 
  [Gaydar] Accordingly, I have decided to decline the offer 
made to me and not accept the post of first deputy chairman of 
the government in its reorganized form. 
  I know that Social Welfare Minister Ella Aleksandrovna 
Pamfilova has said that in this situation she cannot accept 
responsibility for the social policy being implemented, just as 
I cannot answer for the economic policy being implemented. 
  Today we discussed the issue at the board of our 
parliamentary faction. The board backed our decision and 
expressed its readiness for constructive dialogue and 
cooperation with the government. We are ready to support the 
government in all its constructive initiatives and endeavors. 
We shall continue to support the reform policy pursued by the 
president, but at the same time we must make clear our position 
regarding decisions, the political decisions, which we cannot 
support or adopt.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 16 January -- Yegor Gaydar confirmed today 
that the main reason for his resignation was "the lack of levers 
of influence." In an interview for the "Itogi" television 
program he stressed: "One should either do one's job or admit 
that you are unable to do it." Nonetheless, neither Yegor 
Gaydar nor the Russia's Choice bloc, which he heads, intend to 
join the opposition, believing it "possible to support 
constructive dialogue with the government." Explaining his 
decision to leave the cabinet, Yegor Gaydar said: "This will 
stimulate the government to focus more on adopting responsible 
decisions and will force it to tackle the need to curb 
inflation, because now this is the responsibility of the 
government and Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, and not of 
Gaydar." 
  The view of Grigoriy Yavlinskiy was heard on the same 
television program. He said that Gaydar's departure from the 
government was political rather than economic. "In September 
Yegor Timurovich was invited in as a decorative figure to adorn 
the government for a period of very difficult change. Now that 
the main political gestures have been made, the decor can be 
changed."

  [Excerpt] Moscow, 16 Jan -- "I am still on the side of the 
president and I will be supporting the president", Yegor Gaydar 
told Sunday's information-analytical program "Itogi". Today's 
resignation of the first vice premier with whose name, as 
"Itogi" noted, "people in the country and in the world associate 
the very meaning of economic reforms in Russia", was the main 
theme of the program. 
  "I fully understand the responsibility of this decision", 
Gaydar said. But, as he put it, "it is impossible to work or do 
what one has to do without having the necessary levers. In that 
case, one is not doing any real work but just going through the 
motions". "I believe that we have managed to do certain things 
in the past four months despite real difficulties which existed, 
he noted. Many decisions which we proposed have been 
implemented. 
  But at some stage, when decisions that you put forward are 
not accepted, while decisions which you regard as dangerous and 
to which you resolutely object are adopted by the government, 
then your continued membership in the government becomes 
something apparently connected with the fact that you like 
staying in your post. And this, at least as far as I personally 
am concerned, is not so." 
  Gaydar intends to become the leader of Russia's Choice 
faction in the State Duma. "I am going to concentrate on the 
work aimed at creating political structures that have to solve 
two key tasks: first, to prevent Russia from being drawn into 
another military escapade, and second, to avert social 
cataclysms and a new redistribution of property." In his words, 
Russia's Choice faction in the State Duma is going to continue 
"constructive dialogue with the government, we are going to 
support all its useful initiatives, we are not retreating into 
opposition to the government, it is just that we are clearly 
defining the range of responsibility, the range of decisions 
within which we are prepared to cooperate and share the burden 
responsibility." 
  "I fear a new wave of enthusiasm in connection with 
decisions 
on spending, a sharp increase in the amount of money in 
circulation caused by this, aggravating budgetary problems, a 
fall in the [exchange] rate [of the ruble] accelerating rate of 
inflation, attempts to beat it using administrative measures, 
recreation of certain attributes of a shortage-ridden economy, 
the undermining of the effectiveness of all market mechanisms. 
This threat is there, it is real, and one has to reckon with 
it," Gaydar warns in connection with the situation in the 
government. 
  "It was the wish to concentrate fully on work in parliament 
and dissatisfaction with the latest decisions of the government 
and with work in the government as a whole that today forced 
Gaydar to make his sensational statement," "Ostankino" Channel 
One's "Voskreseniye" program remarked. 
  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, who is spoken of as a possible 
candidate 
to the post of first vice prime minister of the government, but 
who, in his own words, has not received such an offer, gave his 
assessment of what has happened in an interview to "Itogi": "In 
September Gaydar was invited as a figurehead to adorn the 
government for a period of very complex changes. Now the main 
political gestures have been made, the decoration can be 
changed." He assessed its prospects thus: "It will be a 
conventional Soviet government." 
  "Itogi" presenter Yevgeniy Kiselev pointed out that a high- 
ranking member of the presidential administration who had asked 
not to be named, had remarked in an interview to "Itogi" that 
Gaydar's statement on his resignation very much resembled an 
ultimatum. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Yegor Timurovich Gaydar by Sergey </F>
Dorenko; from the "Details" program -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Dorenko] [passage omitted] Yegor Timurovich, 
hello. This afternoon did you see the prime minister? 
  [Gaydar] No, I did not see the prime minister today. 
  [Dorenko] You did not have any telephone conversations with 
either the president or the prime minister -- no contacts? 
  [Gaydar] No. Today I did not speak either with the prime 
minister or the president, and there is nothing surprising in 
this because after all the matter had been decided earlier. 
Indeed, on Sunday the fact of my resignation, my statement on 
my resignation was just made public but I had already had a talk 
with the president on Thursday, and overall the main question 
was decided then. 
  [Dorenko] Did the premier and president try to dissuade you 
from resigning? 
  [Gaydar] No, the president regarded my position with 
understanding. 
  [Dorenko] Naturally, and Kozyrev's visit? 
  [Gaydar] Andrey is an innate diplomat; he always tries his 
utmost to find a point of contact. [passage omitted] 
  [Dorenko] Will the communists be able to force Chernomyrdin 
to change his policy, do you think he might perhaps willingly do 
that himself? 
  [Gaydar] I do not think the communists will manage to force 
Chernomyrdin to change his policy, and I do not think Viktor 
Stepanovich will himself want to radically change course. It is 
another matter that politics consists of pretty difficult 
decisions that are being taken every day. 
  [Dorenko] But he is already under pressure, pressure from 
the 
communists in the Duma. And if we were to talk of a coalition 
government, then there would be the Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord -- Shokhin -- and many from Russia's Choice and 
Zaveryukha from the Communists and the Agrarians. If you are 
going now, and Zyuganov is not satisfied with the policy of 
Chernomyrdin and the remaining Russia's Choice people, he may 
find himself under double pressure from Russia's Choice and the 
Communists, may he not? 
  [Gaydar] In the first place, in realistic terms, following 
the adoption of the new constitution, the government's 
independence is substantially greater than it was in 1992-93. 
Therefore, I would say that today it is not a matter of 
political pressure from one or another group, but rather of 
pressure of circumstances, pressure from branches of industry, 
from major complexes and enterprises, which of course would not 
want to part with their subsidies, would not want to restructure 
production, would of course want their problems to be resolved 
through new inflationary taxes, at the taxpayer's expense. 
  [Dorenko] How soon do you reckon your party comrades in 
Russia's Choice will quit the government, or how soon will they 
be forced out? 
  [Gaydar] Well, that is a hypothetical question, almost a 
conjectural one. I reckon that in many aspects, where the 
policy being conducted by the government merits support, our 
colleagues can and must work. I would mention here 
international affairs, and in general the privatization policy 
which one would wish to sustain. 
  [Dorenko] Is that because they are approved by and directly 
supervised by the presidential staff, or because ...- 
  [Gaydar, interrupting] I would even say that it is not the 
presidential staff but simply the president. In Russia it was 
traditional for international affairs to be outside the 
competence of the Cabinet of Ministers, however this was 
composed, and this has been the case recently, too. This is 
primarily the president's sphere, and he determines things. 
  [Dorenko] So Russia's foreign policy will, to judge from all 
indications, remain as before, and the minister of foreign 
relations, the minister of foreign affairs, will stay. [passage 
omitted] 
  Boris Fedorov, it is reported, was today offered the post 
only of minister of finance and not vice premier, that is, he 
may not replace you in your post. At the same time he evidently 
put forward some requirements, and the Council of Ministers 
session has been put off to tomorrow. What do you think, what 
are the requirements in which your party comrade will stay? 
  [Gaydar] I think they will be quite simple and impersonal: 
sufficient control of monetary and credit policy if everyone 
believes anyway that he is responsible for it. 
  [Dorenko] Organizationally speaking, does that mean control 
of Gosbank? 
  [Gaydar] As to organization, it primarily means effective 
interaction with the Central Bank. 
  [Dorenko] To what extent is Chernomyrdin ready to support 
Fedorov today? 
  [Gaydar] That is a question for Viktor Stepanovich. 
  [Dorenko] You know the atmosphere in the government. Who is 
closer to Chernomyrdin, Gerashchenko or Fedorov with his demands 
as regards economic policy? 
  [Gaydar] Viktor Stepanovich would, I think, like to keep 
both. 
  [Dorenko] Both. And both directions of policy. 
  [Gaydar] And both directions of policy. 
  [Dorenko] Is that in order to set them against each other or 
... 
  [Gaydar, interrupting] Simply because to a certain extent 
this is in keeping with his approach to the conduct of economic 
policy. 
  [Dorenko] The leak of information which we have that Skokov 
may be made vice premier; is it likely? 
  [Gaydar] I would not rule out such a possibility, although 
it 
seems to me unlikely. 
  [Dorenko] I see. To all appearances there is another option 
for the development of events in which there remains just Oleg 
Soskovets as vice premier. In that case the whole scheme of the 
government changes, and would that, in your view, resolve the 
crisis? 
  [Gaydar] You see, the economic crisis cannot be resolved by 
a 
redistribution of portfolios. It is being resolved by change or 
continuation of policy. Concentration of attention on 
redistribution of portfolios greatly personalizes what is 
happening. In my view it is much more important how many and 
what kind of expenditure decisions are made by the government in 
the course of the next two weeks than the question of who is in 
what office. 
  [Dorenko] I also wanted to ask a question about your party. 
Now you are heading the faction in the Duma and your first 
deputy Gennadiy Burbulis has already twice -- or at least once 
-- declared this and twice tried to organize a presidential 
party. Will you attempt to set up a party or structure your 
faction in an attempt to create a presidential party? 
  [Gaydar] In the first place, the development of events, 
including the development of events as manifested in the 
elections on 12 December, fully and obviously indicate the need 
for the establishment of an effective structure supporting 
democracy and reforms in Russia. 
  That is obvious. How is this task to be embarked on? How is 
it to be done? How is it to be made non-sectarian? That still 
has to be tackled and ways have to be found of doing it. 
  [Dorenko] And you will head this government? 
  [Gaydar] You know, this is again much less a question of 
personality than of content. This organization, largely from an 
historical point of view, now has two tasks: To prevent 
military ventures which we are now being nudged towards, and to 
prevent a fresh division of property with its accompanying huge 
social cataclysms. The movement, the party, the public force 
which makes this its tasks merits, in my view, the most serious 
support. 
  [Dorenko] Thank you, Yegor Timurovich.

<F P=106> [Olga Kuchkina report: "Will There Be a Third Coming of </F>
Gaydar?"] 
  [Text] Sunday. The "White House" is deserted. There is a 
small number of people in the Blue Room, where Gaydar's letter 
has been disseminated and where he is giving a short news 
conference. 
  "When I accepted the offer of the president and the premier 
to resume my work in the government in September 1993, it was 
clear to me that, while being responsible, of course, for 
everything happening in the economy and with the economic 
reform, I would have only a limited range of tools for 
influencing the shaping of current policy. Nevertheless, 
mindful of the tense situation, I remained convinced that the 
government would be able to rally around the president and 
nonetheless pursue a sufficiently responsible policy of 
stabilizing the situation in the economy...." 
  In his opinion, some things have been done: The rate of 
inflation fell sharply from 26 percent in August to 13 percent 
in December; the economy has been opened up; a whole package of 
documents has been adopted to ensure the start of reforms in the 
housing sphere; on the whole, a certain movement toward general 
economic stabilization has been begun. At the same time, with 
increasing frequency decisions have been made in the government 
with which either the first vice premier was not familiar or 
objected to them categorically. Deeming it not possible under 
these conditions to be responsible for other people's decisions, 
Yegor Gaydar is leaving the government. Ella Pamfilova is 
leaving too. 
  I put several questions to Gaydar: 
  "Have you weighed the consequences of your step insofar as 
your places and positions may be taken by directly opposite 
figures and directly opposite positions?" 
  "Yes, of course. Naturally, we hope that the government's 
course will still not be radically changed. But there is a 
rigid logic of life here. It makes sense to hold some position 
for as long as you can operate from this position. Or at least 
block actions with which you disagree. Otherwise you simply 
make common cause with decisions you consider harmful and 
irresponsible." 
  Earlier Gaydar had cited two examples. The decision on a 
joint monetary system with Belarus, which is possible in 
principle if it is clearly formulated and if control systems are 
defined. In fact the ill-conceived version of the signed bank 
agreement will reproduce chaos in the monetary sphere and 
unlimited subsidizing of Belarus at the expense of Russian 
citizens -- something that we were getting away from with 
tremendous difficulty during 1992. The second was the decision 
to construct the Parliamentary Center at a cost of $500 million, 
which Gaydar calls immoral. 
  The former vice premier was slow to answer my question as to 
whether Gaydar had already met with the president and what 
Yeltsin's emotional reaction was, but the expression on his face 
caused the assembled people to laugh in concert. Gaydar 
hastened to remark that the president understands the situation 
perfectly and that they had spoken calmly. 
  "Are you shifting the center of your work to the 
parliament?" 
I asked. 
  Gaydar replied in the affirmative. In all cases, he 
remarked, we will struggle to ensure that the key committees -- 
defense, security, and international policy -- do not pass into 
the hands of our opponents; here we adhere to firm 
ultimatum-like positions, and our civilized, considered policy 
will be aimed at keeping out of power adventurists capable of 
drawing the country into war. 
  "Are you thinking of working with society and winning it 
over 
more intelligently than you have done before?" 
  "Yes, we will endeavor to work by rectifying all our serious 
mistakes which were undoubtedly made." 
  Asked when he felt himself to be the leader of the 
democratic 
movement, Gaydar replied that he still does not feel himself to 
be this, although maybe this happened on the night of 3-4 
October, unexpectedly, which was a rather unpleasant surprise. 
  In the end I asked: 
  "What mood are you in? Do you regard what has happened in 
terms of a 'defeat' or in some other terms?" 
  "I would say this: We have lost a battle, but I certainly do 
not believe that we have lost the war. Moreover, we are simply 
obliged to win it. Our departure marks not the end but the 
continuation of the struggle. The logic of 'the worse, the 
better' is categorically unaccaptable to us." 
  One way or another, we have gotten a new political quality, 
whose further development is hard to predict today.

  [Text] Yegor Gaydar's possible resignation from the post of 
first vice premier "would seriously weaken the president's 
reformatory flank", the president's Press Secretary Vyacheslav 
Kostikov told Interfax special correspondent Vyacheslav Terekhov 
in an exclusive interview on Sunday [16 January]. 
  Kostikov expressed hope that Boris Yeltsin would not accept 
Gaydar's resignation while the reasons for Gaydar's decisions 
"were not strategic" and that a compromise was possible.

  [Text] Moscow January 17 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin accepted the resignation of the architect of Russian 
reform, First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar on Monday and 
assured that reforms in the country will continue. 
  "Giving tribute to the competence, courage and the 
contribution which Yegor Gaydar made into the course of economic 
reform, I understand the arguments and motives which made him 
offer to resign", Yeltsin said in a statement received by TASS. 
  "Accepting this resignation I would like to stress the 
irreversibility of the course of reform aimed at a deep and 
democratic transformation of the Russian society, its economy 
and political institutions. The policy of reform will continue 
proceeding from democratic principles which are the basis of the 
new Russian Constitution and with account, first and foremost, 
of the national and strategic Russian interests", the president 
said. 
  "I express conviction that while working in the State Duma 
Yegor Gaydar will proceed from the supreme interests of serving 
Russia like he did in his previous activities", according to the 
statement distributed by presidential spokesman Vyacheslav 
Kostikov. 
  This is the second time that Gaydar has to abandon his post 
in the government. In December 1992 Yeltsin replaced him with 
Viktor Chernomyrdin after a severe conflict with the parliament 
on the course of reform. 
  Gaydar returned to the government as first deputy premier in 
the middle of September 1993. 
  After December 12 parliamentary elections Yeltsin said at a 
press conference that Gaydar will remain in the government and 
reforms will continue.

  [Text] On Sunday [16 January] Russia's First Deputy 
Premier Yegor Gaydar, who leads the Russian Choice bloc, 
announced his decision to reject the post of first deputy 
premier in the reorganized government. 
  According to him, he notified President Yeltsin and Premier 
Chernomyrdin accordingly. Their attitude to his decision was 
"sympathetic". "I discussed it with the president, and he 
understands the situation perfectly." 
  When Chernomyrdin asked him about his attitude to the 
possibility of giving this job to the prominent economist 
Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, Gaydar said that he "would warmly welcome 
his candidacy". 
  The Finance Minister, Boris Fedorov, "will take his own 
decision in the next few days", Gaydar said (Interfax's note: 
evidently he meant Fedorov's joining Russia's reorganized 
government). 
  "We discussed this situation in detail with Chubays and 
decided that it would be expedient to continue his work in the 
government, at least till the time, when the privatisation 
program to be concluded before July 1st, 1994, is implemented," 
said Gaydar. 
  "We hope that the government's policy will not be 
drastically 
altered after all," Gaydar noted. 
  According to Gaydar, the Social Security Minister, Ella 
Pamfilova, has said that "under the circumstances she cannot 
assume responsibility for the social policy, since she cannot be 
responsible for the economic policy". 
  As Gaydar said, the Russian Choice faction in the State Duma 
supported Gaydar's decision and "expressed its readiness for a 
constructive dialogue and cooperation with the government". 
  Gaydar believes that "the presence of our colleagues in the 
government is sensible and prudent in a number of directions, 
particularly in all that is connected with international 
politics and privatization". 
  "At the same time we must grant government members the 
opportunity to consider everything once again and decide to what 
extent they are capable of following the policy they and 
ourselves view as responsible, and take a decision concerning 
our participation in the new government proceeding from this," 
Gaydar said. 
  According to Gaydar, he has no claims on the post of 
chairman 
of the State Duma's planning and budget commission, and the 
Russian Choice faction will support the Yavlinskiy bloc's 
candidacy for it.

  [Text] Moscow, 16 Jan -- "Yegor Gaydar's refusal to enter 
the new government was not unexpected for Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin," Valentin Sergeyev, chief of the Russian 
Government's press service, said in an ITAR-TASS interview. The 
first deputy prime minister's decision was already suggested by 
the mere fact that he was elected leader of the Russia's Choice 
parliamentary faction, he added. 
  Touching upon accusations by some democratic parties that 
the 
government will be cut at the expense of its reform wing, 
Valentin Sergeyev stressed: "The government, headed by Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, was, is, and will continue to be a government of 
reform."

  [Text] Everyone has been waiting to hear what Russian 
Finance Minister Boris Fedorov has to say in response to Yegor 
Gaydar's announcement that he is quitting -- or rather that he 
is not accepting -- the job of first deputy prime minister. 
  Boris Fedorov said today in an interview with the Ekho 
Moskvy 
radio station that he looks upon Yegor Gaydar's decision with 
understanding. Fedorov called this move the beginning of a 
turning point. 
  As far as he himself is concerned, in the finance minister's 
words, he has not yet received an offer to enter the new 
government. If he does receive one, Fedorov remarked, he will 
reach his decision this Monday or Tuesday.

  [Text] Russia's Finance Minister, Boris Fedorov, told 
Interfax on Sunday [16 January] that Yegor Gaydar's statement 
that he will not join the reorganized government was a "complete 
surprise" to him. 
  Fedorov himself declined to give any information concerning 
his own plans. 
  It's not clear whether Fedorov will join the number of the 
new deputy premiers or remain as finance minister. 
  In the meantime Interfax learned from Russia's prominent 
banking circles that for them Fedorov symbolizes reforms in 
Russia, and that his withdrawal from the highest government 
echelons may come to be viewed as a symptom of the possibility 
that the direction of economic reforms in Russia might change.

  [Text] Moscow January 17 TASS -- Russia's Finance Minister 
Boris Fedorov said he understood First Vice-Premier Yegor 
Gaydar's decision to resign from the government, announced on 
Sunday [16 January]. The government's last decisions indicate 
the "beginning of changes", Fedorov pointed out in an interview 
with the "Echo of Moscow" radio station. 
  "I did not have any advance notice of Yegor Gaydar's 
intention", Fedorov said. 
  He said he had not yet got an invitation to join the 
reshuffled government. If such a proposal is made, he will make 
a decision on Monday or Thursday, Fedorov added.

  [Excerpt] Yegor Gaydar's statement on his resignation is 
either an emotional step or a tactical manuever. At any rate, 
the reasons he gave are clearly not enough to resign over. This 
is what Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin said 
today in an interview with Interfax. He did not rule out the 
possibility of it simply being an attempt to achieve a 
pro-Gaydar government cabinet. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Russian Vice Prime Minister, leader of the PRUC 
[Party of Russian Unity and Concord] faction in the State Duma 
Sergey Shakhray told INTERFAX tonight that emotionally he 
regarded negatively Yegor Gaydar's resignation as first vice 
prime minister. Shakhray said he was amazed at the intentions to 
reorganize the government without Gaydar. He said "there were 
more question marks and minuses than pluses." At the same time, 
he said he had met neither with Gaydar nor with Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin on the issue. "It is necessary to weigh all 
the factors before making a close analysis of the new 
composition of the government," he said. 
  Prior to this, Shakhray told journalists he was not prepared 
to tell who might replace Gaydar as he did not know more of the 
situation than the journalists themselves. He supposed that 
Gaydar's resignation will almost certainly lead to granting new 
credits and another drop of the ruble. In his opinion, the 
government's policy will be the most likely to be adjusted to 
meet the needs of the industrialists. 
  Asked about the government's intention to allocate $500 
million for the construction of a parliamentary center in 
Moscow, Shakhray pointed out that "this money would be useful 
for the economy." At the same time, the vice prime minister 
noted that achieving the same goal will cost much higher in a 
year. 
  Commenting on the election of deputy speakers and heads of 
parliamentary committees by a single list, Shakhray said that on 
the whole the State Duma gained from using this approach. "Had 
we nominated heads of parliamentary committees person by person, 
the political spectrum would have been more uniform, and the 
factor of professional qualification for the post would not have 
been always taken into account," he pointed out. At the same 
time, he said deputies elected from single-mandate 
constituencies lost from the voting for the list. Only PRUC and 
the deputies' group "New Policy" stood up for their interests. 
"However, we were in minority and could not influence the 
situation," he pointed out.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian 
at 1307 GMT on 16 January broadcasts a 5-minute report by 
station political observer Valeriy Kiosa who reports on reaction 
in the Russian Government to the resignation by First Deputy 
Premier Yegor Gaydar. 
  Kiosa says he has just spoken to Valentin Sergeyev, head of 
the press service of the Russian Government. Kiosa continues: 
  "In reply to my question about the premier's reaction to 
Gaydar's statement, Sergeyev said that Chernomyrdin's reaction 
was calm. The premier talked with Gaydar about the possibility 
of combining the functions of leader of the Russia's Choice 
faction and that of first deputy premier. As a result of that 
calm and businesslike conversation, a decision was made to think 
things over and to find a solution. Gaydar announced his 
decision today. 
  "In reply to my question as to whether Yegor Gaydar had made 
his decision under pressure from the premier, Sergeyev 
categorically denied such a possiblity. He stressed, moreover, 
that Gaydar's coming -- or rather his second coming -- into the 
government occurred on the initiative of the premier himself, 
and all their relations were businesslike and working relations. 
  "Valentin Sergeyev said that the final composition of the 
Government will be announced at the beginning of next week. I 
think that Tuesday is the most likely day for this." 
  Kiosa recaps that there has been much talk over the past few 
days that if Fedorov and Gaydar leave the Government this will 
mark an end to reforms in Russia. Kiosa continues: 
  "According to Sergeyev, the Government will continue to be 
directed toward the reforms, in keeping with the program which 
has been approved." 
  He adds: "As far as the question of Fedorov is concerned, 
Sergeyev stressed he did not have any information on that yet. 
However, I would draw the conclusion that candidacies for this 
post held by Yegor Gaydar will be examined now, and are probably 
being examined already. 
  "In reply to your question, of course, a lot depends on 
whether Fedorov remains, that is the first thing, and on who 
will take Gaydar's place. Incidentally, it is probably worth 
drawing attention to Gaydar's words on his wish that Grigoriy 
Yavlinskiy should take part in the government." 
  The announcer asks Kiosa if he thinks Yavlinskiy will be 
offered the post of first deputy premier, to which Kiosa replies: 
  "It is really hard to believe that now, although the most 
unexpected things may happen." 
  Kiosa wonders why the financial issues raised by Gaydar as 
motives for his resignation were not discussed in the Government 
with him. "I think that Gaydar's resignation may have a serious 
effect on the alignment of forces, both in the Government and on 
the whole in the higher echelons of power," Kiosa says. 
  Gaydar's resignation may have been undesirable for the head 
of the Russian Government, the announcer surmises. Sergeyev may 
just have been putting on a diplomatic act when he spoke to 
Kiosa, she concludes.

  [Text] Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, a State Duma deputy 
representing the Yavlinskiy bloc and ex-chairman of the former 
parliament's Committee for International Affairs and Foreign 
Economic Relations, told Interfax that he understood and to some 
extent shared Yegor Gaydar's reaction. 
  Ambartsumov said that spending on the construction of a 
parliamentary center was absolutely impossible because it would 
put a heavy burden on the tax-payers. 
  Ambartsumov noted at the same time, that Gaydar's decision 
pointed to growing rifts in the democratic camp, which weakened 
its positions and gave more freedom to Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin. 
  In such a situation the president will have to increase his 
role of a judge standing above various political groupings, he 
said. He also noted that the idea of establishing a 
presidential party had no prospects for the moment. Plans to 
create such a party were announced by the president some time 
ago.

  [Text] Mikhail Poltoranin, a member of the Russia's Choice 
parliamentary faction, told INTERFAX on Monday [17 January] that 
Viktor Chernomyrdin expected Yegor Gaydar to reject the post of 
first deputy premier, and "probably did all he could to make 
this happen." 
  Poltoranin disagreed with the notion that Russia's Choice 
used Gaydar's and Pamfilova's resignations to distance itself 
from the president. "We do not want it, and we hope that the 
president will not deviate from democratic principles. Then we 
will be with him," he said. 
  Poltoranin qualified Gaydar's and Pamfilova's resignations 
as 
"a logical step stemming from the policy pursued by the 
Chernomyrdin group in the government." 
  "It was a well-considered, not an impulsive, step, since the 
outlooks of Chernomyrdin and Gaydar differ greatly. Gaydar and 
the entire group of reformers have no right to serve as a cover 
for the degradation of the economy and management system. 
Gaydar's withdrawal is bad for Russia, but there is no other 
way out," Poltoranin stressed. 
  Russia's Choice, he added, analyzed the situation earlier, 
and suggested a month before December's elections that Gaydar 
should resign and distance himself from the government "to stop 
being in the shadow of errors the government committed in 1993." 
  "At that time this decision was not endorsed, since we did 
not want to introduce an element of destabilization in society 
and lose the new Constitution, because many people could decide 
not to vote because of it," Poltoranin said. "Today this factor 
no longer exists, and so we can make decisions more openly."

  [Text] Yegor Gaydar's refusal to accept the post of first 
deputy premier is "a step in his game against the government," 
said a member of the State Duma, Sergey Baburin, who leads the 
Russian People's Union. According to him, in the present 
circumstances "Viktor Chernomyrdin will have to justify himself 
and defend what Gaydar did over the past two years." 
  In Baburin's opinion, expressed in an interview with 
Interfax 
on Monday, Gaydar's step was prompted by Russia's Choice in view 
of the 1996 presidential elections, "in order to distance 
themselves from the current economic situation, lay all the 
blame on Chernomyrdin and his technocrats, and force the entire 
opposition to start defending Russia's government in connection 
with Russia's Choice's attack on it."

<F P=106> [Unattributed roundup of comments on Gaydar's resignation, </F>
followed by excerpt "`From the Draft Declaration on the Social 
Policy of the Government of Economic Reforms' prepared by the 
Ministry of Social Protection of the Population," carried under 
the general heading "Reorganization of Cabinet of Ministers 
Ended in Sunday's Sudden Government Crisis. Its Essence: Will 
the Character of the Reforms Be Preserved Given the Change of 
Cast?"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Boris Fedorov: The 
Executive's Recent Decisions Herald the Start of a Change of 
Direction 
  I understand Yegor Gaydar's decision to turn down the post 
of 
first vice premier of the government. The executive's recent 
decisions do indeed herald the "beginning of a change of 
direction." 
  I "had no advance information" about Yegor Gaydar's 
decision. 
I have not yet personally been invited to join the new 
government. 
<H3>  Valentin Sergeyev: Gaydar's Decision to Refuse To Join the 
New Government Was Not Unexpected </H3>
  "Yegor Gaydar's decision to refuse to join the new 
government 
was not unexpected for Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin," 
Valentin Sergeyev, leader of the Russian Federation Government's 
press service, stated. The first vice premier's decision, he 
added, was also inevitable if only because he has been elected 
leader of the "Russia's Choice" parliamentary faction. 
  Concerning the charges of some democratic parties that 
reduction of the government corps is being carried out at the 
expense of the reformist wing, Valentin Sergeyev stressed: "The 
government headed by Viktor Chernomyrdin was, is, and will be 
reformist." 
<H3>  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy: Gaydar's Reappearance in Government 
Was Rather a Token Gesture </H3>
  Yegor Gaydar has been unable to pursue his line in the 
government for quite some time now. 
  Gaydar really did have disagreements with a number of 
government members, but he could only try to defend his 
positions, since he was deprived of the opportunity to make any 
decisions. In effect the situation developed without Gaydar's 
influence. Gaydar's reappearance in the government last 
September itself was rather a token gesture. Now the need for 
the gesture has faded. That is why Gaydar is quitting. 
<H3>  Aleksandr Shokhin: Reasons Cited Clearly Insufficient for 
Resignation </H3>
  Yegor Gaydar's resignation statement is "either an emotional 
step, or a tactical maneuver. At any rate, the reasons cited by 
Yegor Gaydar are clearly insufficient for resignation." It 
cannot be ruled out that this could be just "an attempt to bring 
about the formation of a pro-Gaydar government cabinet." If 
Gaydar was really concerned by the problem of uniting the 
monetary systems of Russia and Belarus, he should have 
concentrated on working on this problem. In fact he did not do 
so. As for the question of building a parliamentary center in 
Moscow, this question should be settled with the president, not 
the prime minister. 
<H5>  Vyacheslav Kostikov: A Compromise Is Still Possible </H5>
  The possible departure of Yegor Gaydar from the post of 
first 
vice premier "would seriously denude the Russian president's 
reformist wing." A statement to this effect was made on Sunday 
by the president's press secretary, Vladimir Kostikov. He 
expressed the hope that Boris Yeltsin would not accept the 
resignation and that the factors which caused Yegor Gaydar to 
take this step will be removed. In the press secretary's 
opinion, the arguments with which Yegor Gaydar supports his 
decision to resign are "a considerable weight." At the same 
time Vyacheslav Kostikov stressed that the reasons which 
prompted Yegor Gaydar to resign "do not bear a globally 
strategic character which would make compromise impossible." 
<H5>  Ella Pamfilova: I Worked While Hope Remained </H5>
  I have decided not to except an offer to join the 
reorganized 
government. The point is that I cannot work in a situation 
where I have to answer for the consequences of decisions which 
are made by others. I worked while hope remained that I could 
change something. But now I am finally convinced that nothing 
depends on me. I am sad to observe that the package of 
documents on social questions which was prepared by our ministry 
was simply buried in the government apparatus. Further efforts 
on our part would be simply senseless. 
<H3>  From the Draft Declaration "On the Social Policy of the 
Government of Economic Reforms" Prepared by the Ministry of 
Social Protection of the Population </H3>
  B. Monetary Income of the Population 
  1. Social and legal recognition of income from 
entrepreneurial activity and from property. 
  2. The inadmissibility of any direct state-imposed ceiling 
on income earned, except for the use of the system of 
progressive taxation. 
  3. The establishment by the state of a centrally established 
minimum wage in all sectors of the economy and transition to 
determining tariff rates and salary scales for employees by 
means of contracts between the state, employers, and hired labor 
organizations. 
  4. Obligatory state insurance for the working population, 
including insurance against unemployment. 
  5. Bringing the minimum work wage and the minimum pension up 
to the subsistence minimum (as the economic situation improves). 
  6. The protection of citizens on fixed incomes from 
inflation. 
  7. The preservation of savings in state banks and the 
indexation of these savings in conditions of inflation.

  [Text] Kemerovo January 18 TASS -- "Gaydar's resignation 
from the government is expected to indefinitely halt the 
solution of the most difficult problems of Russia's fuel and 
energy complex," said Mikhail Kislyuk, governor of Kuzbass, at a 
meeting with journalists. 
  In his opinion, during a visit to coal regions of the 
country 
at the end of last year Gaydar managed to realise the situation 
in the coal industry after which documents were signed to ease 
critical tension in miners' collectives. A mechanism of 
interaction between the government and miners was found and 
Gaydar took a great deal of responsibility in the realisation of 
this mechanism, Kislyuk said. 
  "The resignation of the first vice-premier makes miners 
doubt 
that their interests will be understood by the government," he 
said.

  [Text] Leaders of the Yavlinskiy bloc, prominent economist 
Grigoriy Yavlinskiy told Interfax on Sunday that he knew nothing 
about the possibility of replacing Gaydar in the reorganized 
government. 
  "No one has talked with me about this," he said. The news 
about Yavlinskiy's possible government appointment was revealed 
by Yegor Gaydar during a briefing on Sunday with reference to 
his talks with Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. 
  Asked by Interfax if he would accept such a proposal if it 
were made, Yavlinskiy said: "I don't think so, although it's 
early yet to speak about this."

  [Text] [Announcer] We spoke to Grigoriy Yavlinskiy on the 
telephone today. 
  [Begin recording] [Yavlinskiy] The fact that Yegor Gaydar 
did 
not want to be a decorative figure is quite understandable. 
This confirms the thought that it is not right to use one's 
name to adorn the government. Therefore, I believe, this was 
not a surprise. He has been aware for quite a long time that he 
cannot influence the policy, he still continued to create an 
illusion that these reforms are such and such and that they 
should proceed in such and such a way and that this is indeed 
the government's policy of reforms. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Grigoriy Alekseyevich, if you 
are offered a post in the government, will you agree? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Who exactly will offer it to me? 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The prime minister, probably, 
or 
maybe the president. 
  [Yavlinskiy] I think it is unlikely that the president will 
propose this to me. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What about the prime minister? 
  [Yavlinskiy] This is of no importance. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Let us say this happened. Would 
you enter the new government or do you also believe that now it 
is impossible to do anything in the government? 
  [Yavlinskiy] I could formulate very many proposals that I 
believe are the necessary prerequisites for the government to be 
able to improve the situation in a limited period of time, let 
us say over a year. These prerequisites include cadre 
reshuffles, the elimination of corruption in the government, a 
clear-cut political policy with regard to reforms, the absence 
of compromises on what has to be done and, first and foremost, 
the acknowledgment of what was done wrong with the aim of 
correcting it. I think that nobody is ready for this. [end

  [Text] Moscow, Jan. 18, IRNA -- Several Russian 
parliamentarians have termed acceptance of the resignation of 
first deputy prime minister Yegor Gaydar by President Boris 
Yeltsin as a political maneuver and accused Gaydar of being 
incompetent in the administration of affairs. Russian economist 
Grigoriy Yavlinskiy who is said to succeed Gaydar, in an 
interview with IRNA here Monday described Gaydar as an 
incompetent person for membership in the new cabinet. 
  He said that Gaydar always introduced the former speaker of 
parliament Ruslan Khasbulatov as the main obstacle on the way of 
economic reforms but during the past three months since the 
dissolution of the parliament he did not carry out any 
constructive measure. 
  Comparing certain members of the government with that of the 
former Soviet Union, he claimed that some of them only thought 
about having fashionable offices, modern cars and luxury houses 
instead of paying attention to more important matters. He 
reiterated that he would not accept the post of deputy prime 
minister.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A meeting of the bureau of the parliamentary faction 
of the Russia's Choice bloc was held this morning. Sergey 
Yushenkov, secretary of the faction, said that members of the 
bureau unanimously backed Yegor Gaydar's decision to resign from 
the post of first deputy prime minister. Yushenkov also said 
that Minister of Finance Boris Fedorov also intends to leave the 
government because, like Gaydar, he is unable to bear 
responsibility for a policy that will inevitably result in a new 
spiral of inflation. However, Boris Fedorov himself has so far 
declined to give any information about his own plans. He said 
that Yegor Gaydar's statement on his refusal to join the 
government came as a complete surprise to him. 
  Meanwhile, leading Russian banking circles have told 
Interfax 
that they regard Boris Fedorov as a symbol of reform in Russia 
and that they might perceive his departure from the top echelons 
of the government as symptomatic of a possible change in the 
direction of the reforms. 
  At his press conference, Yegor Gaydar stated that Viktor 
Chernomyrdin had asked him during their conversation about his 
view of the possible appointment of Grigoriy Yavlinskiy to the 
post of first deputy prime minister in the new government. 
Gaydar said that he would warmly support his candidacy. As for 
Yavlinskiy, the leader of the Yabloko parliamentary bloc, he 
told the Interfax agency that no one has offered him a place in 
the Russian Government. Asked whether he would accept such an 
offer were it to be forthcoming, Yavlinsky replied: Most 
probably not, but all the same it is too soon to say. Moreover, 
an offer to join the government in the post of first deputy 
prime minister has to come from the president, and I have my 
doubts as to whether I could work with Boris Yeltsin, Yavlinskiy 
stressed.

  [Text] Kirill Ignatyev, the coordinator for the Russia's

will not accept any proposal to return to the government, even 
if the president himself asks him. In an interview with 
Interfax, Ignatyev remarked that Gaydar would not agree to a 
proposal to take any posts in the State Duma. According to the

concentrate his efforts on organizing the work of the faction, 
and also on creating an apparatus and regional structures for 
the Russia's Choice movement. Ignatyev said that the main aim 
of such work is to prepare for municipal elections scheduled for 
the coming months, in which Russia's Choice plans to achieve 
greater success than during the elections to the State Duma.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lydmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 17 TASS -- The "Russia's Choice" 
parliamentary group has just adopted a statement at its meeting 
on the resignation of First Vice-Premier Yegor Gaydar. 
  Group member Fedor Shelov-Kovedyaev told journalists that, 
according to the statement, there are at least two wings in the 
government, one of which, according to the lawmaker, "rests on 
laurels and feels well at the expense of the other". 
  The pragmatic wing parasitizes on reform-minded cabinet 
members, shifting onto them responsibility for all actions by 
the government, he continued. Shelov-Kovedyaev said that the 
group's statement will be soon made public and, according to the 
legislator, will give a helping hand to Gaydar. 
  Shelov-Kovedyaev said that "according to the latest 
information, Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin is interested in 
continuing negotiations" on this issue. 
  Replying to ITAR-TASS, another group member, Gennadiy 
Burbulis, former secretary of state, said: "I believe that 
everything will be clear within the next two days. Then, it 
will be possible to draw conclusions and make comments. It is 
too early now to say anything".

  [Text] Member of the Russia's Choice [RC] faction in the 
State Duma Aleksandr Pochinok says Gaydar's statement about his 
stepping down as cabinet member is an indication that although 
he does want to stay where he is to implement his ideas, much of 
the decision making is done behind his back. 
  Gaydar's resignation should not be taken as an attempt to 
bring down the president or his government, Pochinok told 
INTERFAX on Monday. He pledged no opposition to Yeltsin or the 
government on the RC's part, adding that Gaydar was in the mood 
for constructive dialogue. 
  Pochinok sees Gaydar's move as the most honest option, 
saying 
that one must resign if unable to implement his ideas. 
  At the same time, Pochinok, who is a real contender for the 
post of chairman of the planning and budgetary committee, says 
he sees no replacement for Gaydar.

  [Text] "Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's decision to 
form a new government without Yegor Gaydar is, I feel, final, as 
is the prime minister's decision to weaken the economic reform 
thrust," Sergey Kovalyov, one of the leaders of the Russia's 
Choice group in the State Duma, told INTERFAX. In his view, 
this decision "is likely to bring about serious negative 
consequences." 
  Kovalyov emphasized that it had been a mistake to regard 
Russia's Choice as the government party. 
  "I kept repeating in every speech I made that we could not 
be 
a government party without having a decisive influence in the 
government," he said. 
  The Russia's Choice group intended to nominate Mikhail 
Mityukov to the position of deputy speaker. In his words, the 
group will not let Liberal Democratic Party [LDPR] leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy chair the International Affairs Committee. 
  "We will vote against this, and democratically-minded 
deputies have enough votes to make this impossible. What is 
more, I suspect that the communists also do not intend to let 
the LDPR have that position," Kovalyov explained. 
  He said that his group will support election of either 
Vladimir Lukin of the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc or former 
first deputy foreign minister Anatoliy Adamishin to that 
position.

  [Text] Russia's Liberal Democratic Party will welcome Yegor 
Gaydar's decision to resign, this party's first vice chairman 
and State Duma deputy Stanislav Zhebrovsky told Interfax. 
  He believes, however, that "one private move does not 
determine everything." Besides Gaydar and Ella Pamfilova, the 
government must be quit by vice premiers Anatoly Chubays and 
Boris Fedorov, because "they are responsible for the country's 
ruin." 
  Zhebrovsky is convinced that resignation under such a far- 
fetched pretext as disagreement with the decision to allocate 
$500 Mn to the construction of a parliamentary center and to 
unite the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems" attests to 
the bankruptcy of the current policy. He thinks that for the 
Russian economy $500 Mn is not the sum that determines success 
or failure of a government program.

  [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the LDPR [Liberal

told Interfax that he was pleased with the decision made by 
Yegor Gaydar not to serve as vice premier in the new government. 
  "Some time ago I told both Boris Yeltsin and Viktor 
Chernomyrdin: `Remove Gaydar, Chubays, Fedorov and Kozyrev and 
you'll have a perfect government,'" Zhirinovskiy emphasized. 
  In his view, Gaydar "must be replaced by a normal 
industrialist." Zhirinovskiy made it plain that his 
parliamentary group was "prepared to endorse any government the 
president wants but I am saying on behalf of my group: `Boris 
Nikolayevich, I implore you to accept Gaydar's resignation.'"

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 17 TASS -- "By announcing his 
resignation, Yegor Gaydar set the Russian president before the 
alternative: Either to go on with the reform policy, or to allow 
the government to be controlled by those officials who are 
backed by directors of ineffective economy," Chairman of the 
Economic Freedom Party Konstantin Borovoy told ITAR-TASS. 
  Other business people told ITAR-TASS about their anxiety 
over 
the growing instability on the Russian market, which will 
inevitably follow the resignation of Yegor Gaydar from the post 
of first deputy prime minister. 
  In the opinion of Mikhail Dunin, vice president of the 
Moscow 
Commodity Exchange, "Gaydar's resignation will trigger panic at 
commodity and stock exchanges, as a result of which the dollar 
exchange rate may reach 1,500 - 1,600 roubles before the end of 
January." The growth of the dollar exchange rate will 
"automatically lead to another round of inflation, to the growth 
of prices, including hard currency prices." Dunin stated with 
regret that "hopes for the stabilisation of the situation on the 
Russian market, that emerged after December 12, are not coming 
true, which may enhance the prestige of Zhirinovskiy." Aside 
from it Dunin, the same as other business people, complained 
that "endless cataclysms in the Russian Government do not allow 
business people to implement long-term programmes, because the 
unpredictable character of the policy, pursued by the Cabinet of 
Ministers, does not make it possible to forecast the situation 
on the Russian market." 
  Oleg Vinogradov, chairman of the board of directors of the 
Mosexpo joint-stock company, regards Gaydar's announcement of 
his resignation as an "untimely step". He accused the first 
deputy prime minister of giving up the attempts to form a 
government, which would guarantee the continuation of the 
reform." 
  Sergey Popov, adviser to the president of the Association of 
Russian Banks, has an opinion of his own about Gaydar's 
statement. He believes that Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, a possible 
successor of Gaydar on the post of first deputy prime minister, 
"is more adequate to Russian realities." Popov likes 
Yavlinskiy's desire to get from the prime minister the 
guarantees of the implementation of a clear programme of actions 
and to take upon himself the responsibility for the reform 
course.

<F P=106> [Unattributed roundup: "Dollar Has Increased in Price by 46 </F>
Rubles"] 
  [Text] D.N. Sukhinenko, chairman of the board of the 
RINAKO investment company: One can only express sincere regret 
at Yegor Gaydar's decision to leave the government. 
  "Gaydar could and should have fought to the end despite the 
setback at the elections and the complexity of mutual relations 
in the government." In the opinion of Sukhinenko, who together 
with a number of other representatives of private business calls 
himself a critic of Gaydar's team, in Russia's interests Gaydar 
should have continued working. Now we shall get a traditional 
government. 
  The reformers' setback shows that economic problems cannot 
be 
resolved from above. 
  A.V. Zakharov, general director of the Moscow currency 
exchange: It can be said unequivocally that Yegor Gaydar's 
resignation is destabilizing the currency market even more. In 
general this market has already reacted to the political 
instability in Russia: The lack of clarity as to what kind of 
government their will be and, most importantly, what its actions 
will be, has largely affected the rise in the dollar exchange 
rate since the beginning of the year. And on Monday immediately 
after Gaydar's resignation announcement, the rate changed again 
by nearly 50 rubles and was 1,402 rubles for one U.S. dollar. 
  Of course it is perhaps very hard to speak in detail right 
now of any economic program. At any rate until the budget for 
the current quarter and for the year have been examined, at 
least preliminarily, in parliament. And in this situation the 
participants in the currency market link their hopes with 
specific individuals embodying a particular course. And we know 
what course Yegor Gaydar embodied and what hopes businessmen 
linked with him. 
  M.B. Khodorkovskiy, chairman of the "Menatepa" council of 
directors: I think that right now we should not dramatize the 
situation in connection with Gaydar's voluntary resignation. 
The point is that we are faced with the objective need for a 
small change of economic course caused by the aggravation of the 
nonpayments problem and the need to implement the structural 
restructuring of industry. Of course this could cause the 
intensification of inflation processes and the further decline 
of the ruble exchange rate but at the same time structural 
restructuring will become the basis for subsequent financial 
stabilization, for the removal of social tension in the country. 
  As regards fears that the government is now drastically 
altering its course, then I can say one thing on this subject: 
If investments are made sensibly, if money goes on specific, 
carefully worked through and well controlled programs, then it 
is absurd to speak of a change of course. If the funds invested 
are spent on "propping up" all weak and inefficient enterprises, 
then it will indeed be necessary to sound the alarm. And 
whoever is appointed to the post of minister of the economy will 
shed a lot of light on this question.

  [Text] Gaydar's resignation may alleviate the confrontation 
between those in the government who favor tough and fast 
reforms, and those who prefer gradual ones, the Deputy Chairman 
of Incombank's council of experts, Sergey Popov, told INTERFAX. 
  According to Popov, the possibility that Fedorov may resign 
after Gaydar and Pamfilov did "will not lead to a crisis in the 
government." He views Yavlinskiy as the most acceptable 
candidate for the post of finance minister. 
  The Director of the foreign relations department of 
Stolichny 
Bank, Aleksnder Skvortsov, said he hopes that Gaydar's 
resignation will not be accepted. According to him, only Gaydar 
can conclude the reforms launched in Russia. 
  The Deputy Chairman of NGS Bank, Viktor Shabrov, said that 
"the policy of reforms is not carried out by one man; the 
question is who will replace him." 
  A majority of spokesmen for commercial banks do not link the 
fall of the ruble with the government reshuffling, since Fedorov 
envisaged it at the end of last year. However, the rate of the 
fall heightened "because of instability in the highest echelons 
of power."

<F P=106> [Mikhail Berger commentary: "Gaydar Sees No Circumstances </F>
in Which He Would Retract His Resignation Statement"] 
  [Text] Yegor Gaydar stated to IZVESTIYA Monday morning [17 
January] that he will remain in his post until the new 
government is announced, and sees no circumstances in which he 
would retract his resignation statement. Thus it is neither 
blackmail, nor an ultimatum. Gaydar also said that he does not 
aspire to any parliamentary committee and does not harbor any 
special illusions concerning his possibilities of influencing 
the Duma's work. He will remain only as faction leader, and the 
maximum which he can expect to do is to block, in conjunction 
with the president's veto, the most destructive decisions of the 
lower house. Gaydar believes that, together with some 
affiliated associations and deputies, his faction could muster 
up to 34 percent and prevent the Duma from overturning a 
presidential veto by the necessary two-thirds of the vote. 
  Gaydar's resignation was unexpected, but no less unexpected 
than an earthquake in a seismic zone. It is possible to differ 
about the actual policy proposed by Gaydar two years ago and to 
assess the results of these efforts differently, but the 
liberalization of prices, the appearance of a certain freedom of 
consumer choice, privatization -- all this is directly linked 
to Gaydar and his team. As are also, however, the fall in the 
living standards of a significant number of people, the shutdown 
of production units, and the other serious problems connected 
with attempts to cure chronic, inveterate totalitarianism by the 
use of shock therapy. 
  Even when in late 1992 Yeltsin was forced under heavy 
pressure from the Supreme Soviet to dismiss Gaydar, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin -- at least initially -- continued the Gaydar line. 
This is why Gaydar's second arrival in the cabinet last 
September was seen as an entirely logical development. 
  But in the months that followed Gaydar's return the 
disposition of forces in the country and in the structures of 
power themselves changed substantially. The government and the 
president have shown increasing readiness to soften economic 
policy and support individual sectors and enterprises; that is, 
to save inefficient state enterprises with the aid of the 
morphine of inflation. 
  In this time Chernomyrdin himself, and his political weight, 
have also changed substantially. He has not only formally 
become the state's number two, but he has also managed to 
strengthen his personal influence on the policy being carried 
out. The premier, who a year ago was viewed as a transitional, 
temporary figure, has proved an unusually robust and firm 
politician. And whereas some time ago key economic decisions 
were, as a rule, not adopted without coordination or discussion 
with Gaydar, in recent weeks -- especially following the 
elections -- the first vice premier's influence has been reduced 
virtually to zero. 
  The point is not even that decisions on unaffordable 
expenditure on a new parliamentary center or on terms for the 
unification of monetary systems with Belarus that are 
unfavorable for Russia were adopted without any participation 
whatsoever by Gaydar. It has become obvious that the time of 
the apparatus is coming, when fundamental decisions both on 
economic policy and on personnel are adopted under the influence 
of closest aides, and not first deputies. 
  In addition, the powerful duo of the premier and the 
chairman 
of the Bank of Russia, based, apart from anything else, on the 
personal empathy of Chernomyrdin and Gerashchenko, has made 
possible the adoption of all decisions in financial policy 
directly, so to speak, without discussions in government or 
anywhere else. 
  In these conditions Gaydar had increasingly become a 
"front" for reassuring the Russian authorities' Western fans. 
Moreover, the impression was arising that Gaydar himself agreed 
to such a role. Then last Sunday he declared himself unwilling 
to play this role and to link his name with the economic policy 
being carried out. A considerably bold, but at the same time 
also pragmatic, move for a man concerned about his political 
future. 
  As for the government, in the present circumstances Boris 
Fedorov's decision to go or stay takes on crucial significance. 
If the finance minister goes also, it will be very hard for 
Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin to convince anyone that the policy of 
market reforms is being maintained. In conversation with 
IZVESTIYA Boris Fedorov himself did not say that he would follow 
Gaydar's example. By midday on Monday, when this commentary was 
being prepared, neither the president nor the premier had made 
any proposals on this score. At the same time there are no 
reports that Fedorov has changed his terms for continuing work 
in the government. As we know, he stated earlier that he would 
not work with Aleksandr Zaveryukha. 
  Be that as it may, with the departure of Gaydar the romantic 
period of market economy reform, in which a group of young 
academics tried to complete an economic revolution without 
having sufficient political support or a firm social base, comes 
to an end. 
  Now begins the period of industrial romanticism, in which a 
group of experienced managers, drawing on the support of a 
powerful economic lobby, will try to overcome the crisis with 
the aid of the economic inflation pump. This period, in 
Gaydar's opinion, cannot in any way be a long one.

<F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Kononenko under general heading: </F>
"Resignation of `Father of Reforms' Could Cause Government 
Crisis"] 
  [Excerpts] Ye. Gaydar's unexpected statement on the 
impossibility of staying in the new cabinet is the first 
manifestation of party affiliation in Russia's top organs of 
power and not a manifestation of the individual participation of 
particular politicians in them. [passage omitted] 
  Two options remain for the development of events around the 
creation of a new government team. Since Ye. Gaydar intends to 
demonstrate firmness in his decision (advisers close to him are 
absolutely convinced of this and they rule out the possibility 
of political bluffing in this case) a government crisis could 
most likely arise, to overcome which the president will either 
have to embark on the risky step of proposing something like the 
outline for a coalition government or give the premier carte 
blanche. 
  In the latter version it seems possible that a 
pro-Chernomyrdin will be created in the government and in 
parliament which, representatives of "Russia's Choice" believe, 
could be formed by the factions of the Communists, Agrarian 
Union members, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, the 
Democratic Party of Russia, and "Yabloko." The government team 
thus constituted would inevitably pursue a pro-inflationist 
policy and there would be no place in it for representatives of 
"Russia's Choice." It is not out of the question that with this 
development of events other Gaydar supporters would leave the 
government (A. Chubays remains in his post only by virtue of a 
party decision -- he cannot be responsible for the government's 
economic policy). 
  After the president's meeting with the premier it became 
known that the "Russia's Choice" bloc does not intend to declare 
that it is in opposition to the government.

<F P=106> [Article by journalist Irina Savvateyeva under general </F>
heading: "Resignation of `Father of Reforms' Could Cause 
Government Crisis"] 
  [Text] One must think that on Sunday Viktor Stepanovich 
Chernomyrdin had already laid out the government cards preparing 
to name his four vice premiers. But Yegor Gaydar muddled up all 
the premier's cards by refusing to take the post of first vice 
premier in the reorganized government. 
  Why? This post was guaranteed him through the endeavors of 
the president. Initially it was believed he would be in charge 
of 13 federal organs, including the ministries of the economy, 
finances, and foreign policy relations and the 
Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for the Administration of 
State Property]. But experience of work with Chernomyrdin over 
the past four months (also in the post of first vice premier, 
incidentally) has given Yegor Timurovich no grounds for 
illusions. 
  "Gaydar had nothing to do. He had no functions left. 
Chernomyrdin had plugged every hole for him," one high-ranking 
government official commented on the position of the "father" of 
Russian reforms in the present cabinet of ministers. 
  Obviously, before 13 December Yegor Gaydar was gambling on a 
victory for his bloc at the elections. The press was engaged in 
a thorough discussion of the possibility that he would be 
nominated for the post of prime minister.... The results of the 
elections buried all hopes. Most of all they reinforced the 
positions of Chernomyrdin, who after the victory of Zhirinovskiy 
and the success of the Communists, remained in the role of a 
"centrist" -- a favorite and honored role among Russian 
politicians and soviet directors. 
  To all appearances Gaydar's position would in no way have 
been strengthened in the "renewed" government. The 
Goskomimushchestvo was dropped from the list of departments 
under his control after Chubays was appointed vice premier by 
Yeltsin personally. And what does being in charge of the 
Ministry of Finances mean when Boris Fedorov is alive? Or in 
charge of foreign economic relations when Aleksandr Shokhin is 
in good health? (Rumor has it that Chernomyrdin favors Shokhin 
more than Gaydar -- probably after Aleksandr Nikolayevich also 
declared himself to be a centrist and began to abuse Yegor 
Timurovich). And, finally, what does it mean to be in charge of 
the Ministry of the Economy, controlled by we do not understand 
what, when all sectorial industrial departments are subordinate 
to top-ranking First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets? Probably the 
true role which Viktor Chernomyrdin intended for the second 
first vice premier was the role of whipping boy. After all, 
when prices leap after the unification of the Russian ruble with 
the Belarusian "hare" there will have to be someone to blame for 
the "ill-considered consequences of the shock reforms." 
  Will Yeltsin accept Gaydar's resignation? 
  To judge by the tone of the statement made by Vyacheslav 
Kostikov, the president's press secretary, on Sunday, Boris 
Nikolayevich would very much like to refuse it. But to refuse 
it would mean not simply leaving Gaydar and repealing (or 
deferring) a decision on the unification of the Russian and 
Belarusian monetary systems and putting a ban on the 
construction of the parliament building. To refuse Gaydar's 
resignation would mean embarking on strengthening the reformist 
wing in the government. And ultimately embarking on 
confrontation with Chernomyrdin who has essentially become the 
second man in the country and who, incidentally, relies on the 
support of two very powerful lobbies -- the industrial and 
agrarian lobbies. The president can hardly allow himself such 
whims in the present political situation. 
  Incidentally, if you compare this with September 1993, when 
Yeltsin imposed Gaydar on Chernomyrdin (although the latter 
hastened to state that it was his own initiative) then the 
difference is not only in the strength of the president's 
political positions. At the time the economic situation was 
somewhat different: The country was sliding toward 
hyperinflation. But today, not least thanks to Gaydar's 
efforts, the ruble does not look that bad. So that there would 
seem to be no urgent, insurmountable need for so-called 
"monetarists." In addition Boris Fedorov is still in the 
government for the time being. 
  Incidentally, if Gaydar goes the post of first vice premier 
will be free. And the prime minister could very well offer it 
to the finances minister. If, of course, Viktor Stepanovich or 
Boris Nikolayevich is interested in Fedorov remaining in the 
government. Then, you see, the Zaveryukha-Fedorov conflict would 
be resolved, even if only partially. 
  It is true that this would scarcely make any easier the 
further fate of the Ministry of Finances leader in a government 
of sector lobbyists. But if you consider that in the present 
situation the positions of Boris Fedorov's long-standing 
opponent, Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko, are 
automatically strengthened, then it may be supposed that 
following Gaydar and Social Protection Minister Ella Pamfilova, 
the Ministry of Finances leader will also think of resigning.

<F P=106> [Ivan Zasurskiy report in the "Perspective" column under </F>
general headline: "Yegor Gaydar Has Made His Choice, and So Has 
Boris Yeltsin. The Game of Radical Economic Reforms in Russia 
Has Ended for the Time Being"] 
  [Text] Yegor Gaydar's resignation is in no way capable of 
changing the character of the economic policy pursued by Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, because the incumbent government had none even 
after Gaydar's comeback. The fact is that it has been more than 
six months now that the reformist theoretical mood has been 
pushed into the background relative to the cabinet's ongoing 
fire-fighting activity. When, in responding to questions about 
his possible appointment to replace Gaydar, Grigoriy Yavlinskiy 
described the government as "Soviet," it was not his intention 
to use profanity. Simply, the "Soviet" government has always 
been a secondary organ with respect to the ideological apparatus 
structures in Staraya Ploshchad. And now, when the government 
has meekly moved into the White House (while the president's 
administration went into Staraya Ploshchad), everything has been 
put into place. It is another matter whether there is a 
perception about the need for an economic policy in Staraya 
Ploshchad. 
  From the start, Yegor Gaydar claimed starring roles in the 
cabinet. After the election defeat Viktor Chernomyrdin demoted 
Gaydar to the "second" first vice premier. The formal sharing 
of the status of first deputy with Soskovets, who can be defined 
as the cabinet's industry leader, effectively deprived the 
ex-premier of the opportunity to influence the government's 
conduct of any economic policy. In this context the mention of 
the ambitious and rational Yavlinskiy as a replacement for the 
ideologically reformist decoration can only evoke a smile. 
Although it needs to be recognized that if the EPICenter head 
had no substantial material and ideological basic structure, he 
would have had to consent. 
  What then substitutes for economic policy in the present 
cabinet of ministers? Here one should go back to the trinity 
that featured in Chernomyrdin's speech in parliament. 
Apparently, this is social policy as a method of preserving and 
multiplying the well-being of the (entire) people; the second, 
that is to say, "anti-shock" wind for the reforms; and support 
and assistance for producers. Naturally these are guidelines for 
practical people, not a concept for long-term development. The 
practical peoples' weight in the Russian cabinet of ministers is 
so substantial, however, that the interests of industrial, 
agrarian, and financial lobbies will acquire the character of 
economic policy in the very near future. At the same time, since 
Gaydar's pressure on the president has after all led to his 
effective resignation, the entire spectrum of economic policy 
options will be presented in parliament. It is clear that such 
a scenario can result in a curious lineup in the system of power 
distribution. The government, while remaining a purely working 
body, will be implementing political decisions by the 
president's administration and economic decisions by parliament. 
  Radical reform advocates will consider such a scheme typical 
for a third-world country. It is necessary to admit, however, 
that an alternative to this at the present stage is only a 
reformist dictatorship, and therefore many, many upheavals. 
  The evolution of the above scheme on the contrary 
contributes 
to political stability, which is necessary to overcome many 
complexes of the post-socialist power, including the 
irrationality of the politicized populace. Specifically this 
will mean for the Russian economy the maintaining of inflation 
at its current level with the haphazard flourishing or 
degradation of various branches. Until a new perception has 
come about of what is a real economic reform for Russia.

  [Text] Moscow January 17 TASS -- Russian chief foreign debt 
negotiator Aleksandr Shokhin will agree to remain in the 
government only in case he keeps the post of a deputy prime 
minister. 
  "I may occupy the post of the minister for CIS affairs only 
in case it envisages the status of a vice-premier", Shokhin told 
TASS on Monday. 
  He added that the government is currently facing a 
complicated situation as it has to combine financial 
stabilisation with the policy of promoting production which 
needs enormous finances. 
  The current reorganisation of the government also 
complicates 
the situation, according to Shokhin. 
  "The existing situation in the country calls for two 
necessary things: a strict definition of concrete measures and 
the sharing of roles in the government", he stressed.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Gurevich report: "Who Does Chernomyrdin Like? </F>
Viktor Stepanovich and Vladimir Volfovich: a Secret Alliance?"] 
  [Text] To obtain a solid gain in an election campaign it 
is not at all necessary to take part in it. Among politicians 
experiencing a feeling of profound satisfaction from the results 
of the 12 December voting is apparently Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. 
  Back in November, when few doubted the success of Russia's 
Choice, representatives of this bloc were complaining to 
MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS' correspondent about the constant 
counteraction on the part of the head of the Council of 
Ministers which, according to them, went as far as telegrams 
with direct instructions to sink the Gaydarites. Naturally 
there was no doubt that in the event of Choice's victory (the 
convincing victory on which it was counting at the time) the 
premises of the head of the Russian Government could have 
received a new occupant. 
  In order not to fall out with Viktor Stepanovich completely, 
Russia's Choice made a statement about supporting his candidacy, 
specifying that the ongoing reform course must remain unchanged. 
On the other hand, Shakhray's Party of Russian Unity and Accord 
from the very start of the campaign was far more definitive in 
its statements: "coalition," "a compromise figure," "the 
premier must stay on," and "Gaydar has no chances," which evoked 
strong sympathies on Chernomyrdin's part. 
  However, the current head of the Council of Ministers is 
looking for friends not only among the more or less decent 
Shakhray followers. Russia's Choice, having refused to 
participate in preliminary "consultations," cited among its 
reasons the "fickleness" of its interlocutors, who are 
constantly changing earlier approved candidacies. On 4 January 
Zhirinovskiy said that the Liberal Democratic Party would 
propose for this post 61-year-old Vladimir Gusev, former first 
secretary of Saratov Obkom and former deputy chairman of the 
USSR Council of Ministers, who is currently listed on the 
Liberal Democratic Party slate (although not a member of this 
party) as vice president of the Promyshlennik corporation. 
According to information at MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS' disposal, 
Chernomyrdin has asked Zhirinovskiy to propose his candidate for 
the post of speaker. 
  Viktor Stepanovich also has another trump up his sleeve: 
Under the constitution, he may perform the president's 
functions for four months, should the president resign. And 
then? It is silly to make guesses, but the mass media are being 
very actively placed under government control (meaning its 
apparatus-"economic" half). Consider the fact that they have 
their own press minister (head of the Council of Ministers press 
service); the recent attempts to take control of the former 
Parliament Hour program; a certain list of a dozen papers worthy 
of generous state subsidizing; and the actually revived State TV 
and Radio Committee, directed according to the government 
concept. It should be noted that some mass media organizations 
are already confidently calling Chernomyrdin not only the number 
two man in the state (which corresponds to his post) but also as 
catching up with the president in the charisma of a "nationwide 
leader." "Master," "real man" [muzhik], "our man," "tough," 
"laconic" (therefore intelligent), "a strong hand," and so 
forth: the image being created is very impressive indeed. 
  The former head of Gazprom received his high post 13 months 
ago as a "compromise figure." "A sound economic manager" was 
how he was described: It is thanks to him that our homes are 
still warm. A world-level manager; our gas workers have outdone 
Ruhrgaz and included lucrative contracts (according to experts, 
Ruhrgaz has already recovered and is again picking up). It is 
difficult, however, to enter big-time politics and stay "a mere 
specialist." For instance, Gaydar, who in November 1991 was a 
little-known cabinet theoretician, by the time of his second 
coming to the government had Russia's Choice and the Association 
of Private and Privatized Enterprises to his credit. There is 
no doubt that Viktor Stepanovich too has had enough time to 
acquire numerous political, economic, and commercial contacts 
presupposing certain obligations. 
  Chernomyrdin promised to make public his ideas about the 
personal composition of the Council of Ministers on 17 January. 
So far it is only known that in response to the supposition 
that Gaydar and Soskovets will be first vice premiers and Yarov 
and Zaveryukha plain vice premiers, he said: "You nearly got 
it." And also that he has invited Shokhin to stay in the 
government. Boris Fedorov, on the contrary, will apparently be 
shown the door. Nonetheless, Yeltsin's decision to leave 
Chubays as vice premier no matter what has added optimism to the 
Russia's Choice part of the cabinet. Which after the latest 
events (the decision to build a new parliament complex and the 
"ill-advised and destructive" agreement with Belarus on the 
exchange of its currency for the ruble at a 1:1 rate) has 
started talking about the need "to distance itself" from the 
mistakes of the government, and it may be ready to distance 
itself too far.

<F P=106> [Andrey Bagrov report: "Personnel Shakeup in the </F>
Government. Chubays Keeps His Status"] 
  [Text] The president has sharply thickened the plot of 
appointments to a new cabinet by his edict yesterday under which 
Anatoliy Chubays stays on as chairman of the State Committee for 
the Management of State Property and is appointed deputy 
chairman of the Russian Government "over and above the number of 
deputies determined by the edict of 10 January." 
  Vladimir Mau, aide to Yegor Gaydar, says that the 
confirmation of Anatoliy Chubays' status is in line with the 
provision of the 1991 law on privatization stating that head of 
the State Committee for the Management of State Property 
simultaneously has vice premier status. Thus, the decision that 
Chubays should keep his "privatization minister" office has 
automatically led to keeping him in the number of government 
leaders. Remarkably, his status is now in fact higher than that 
of the other deputy chairmen because the president decided his 
fate apart from the government as a whole. According to 
unofficial information, Chubays's appointment came as a surprise 
also for the head of the cabinet. 
  If one is to stay in the legal fairway, certain conclusions 
can be drawn from the reservation that Anatoliy Chubays was 
appointed "over and above" the quota of deputy government 
chairmen set three days before that (four vice premiers). The 
president's edict sets down a 4+N formula of the number of vice 
premiers. This was also indirectly confirmed yesterday by 
Vladimir Shumeyko, elected chairman of the Federation Council, 
who let it be known that the Russian political Olympus is 
inclined to regard leaders of the Federation Council as having 
been "posted" from their former jobs. Thus he can nominally keep 
his position of first deputy premier, in which case the number 
of deputy chairmen grows to six. 
  Amending one edict by another increases chances of 
unexpected 
decisions. It has become known from sources close to the 
president that another vice premier, Aleksandr Shokhin, is seen 
as a candidate for the position of minister for cooperation with 
CIS member countries, but he cannot keep his vice premier rank. 
Shokhin's realm has already been dealt a painful blow. The 
Russian Agency for International Cooperation and Development, 
whose chairman he was, has been placed under the Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations with the obscure status of a "state 
institution." Neither does Shokhin have any chances whatever to 
take the place of the premier's long-time friend Oleg Davydov as 
head of the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations. Shokhin, 
tipped as a candidate for the head of the Duma's international 
affairs committee, let it be known guardedly, after the Duma 
session yesterday, that he did not rule out chances of filling 
the post of minister for CIS affairs. His uneasiness about 
whether this position would include vice premier rank was 
betrayed by the persistently repeated idea that "relations with 
the CIS should be directed by a specially trained vice premier." 
  It is not clear whether one more vice premier, Boris 
Fedorov, 
would be able to carry into effect his plans of control over the 
entire financial sphere including the steering of the ruble rate 
policy and the external debt problem. Fedorov announced a press 
conference for 18 January (the composition of the government is 
to be announced on 17 January) where he is expected to announce 
whether he is happy with the position of finance minister which, 
according to its status, has always measured up to that of a 
vice premier.

  [Text] Aleksandr Zaveryukha and Yuriy Yarov will apparently 
retain their present posts of vice premiers in Russia's 
government and Yegor Gaydar and Oleg Soskovets will remain on 
the posts of first vice premiers, reported sources in the 
apparatus of the Russian government who preferred to stay 
anonymous. They are convinced that on January 18 Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin will call these names along with the name of 
Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays, who has already been appointed to 
this post by a presidential decree, as Chernomyrdin promised at 
the meeting with the Federal Assembly deputies - heads of 
administrations on previous Friday. 
  The same sources drew attention of Interfax to the fact that 
federal executive bodies, including 23 ministries and 44 state 
committees, committees, departments, federal services and 
agencies (their list is applied to Yeltsin's decree "On 
Structure of Federal Executive Bodies" dated January 10) have 
been distributed according to the principle of "five verticals." 
  According to the sources, "these verticals" will be spread 
among functions of vice premiers as follows (according to the 
order in which ministries and departments were presented in the 
supplement to the presidential decree on corresponding 
ministries and departments): 
  - Oleg Soskovets will be entrusted with monitoring of 
federal 
bodies' structures by the first of the "verticals" - fuel and 
energy complex, transport and communication, construction and 
architecture, industrial policy and defense industry, metallurgy 
and machine building, chemical and oil-chemical industry, space 
agency; 
  - Yegor Gaydar will be in charge of economics and finances, 
foreign economic relations, and cooperation with CIS countries, 
antimonopoly policy and support to new economic structures, 
management of state property, customs and tax services, currency 
and export control, extraction, production, and export of 
precious metals and stones; 
  - the issues of education, science, and culture, labor and 
employment, social security, youth's problems, physical culture 
and tourism, mass media and cinematography, migration and 
archive services will be conferred on Yuriy Yarov; 
  - along with the issues of the agricultural industrial 
complex Aleksandr Zaveryukha will be responsible for the 
problems of trade, environmental and natural resources security, 
land survey and cartography, hydrometeorology and environmental 
monitoring; 
  - and, finally, President Yeltsin will apparently take 
responsibility for the fifth, "power vertical," that is 
beginning with defense, foreign and domestic affairs and ending 
with nuclear and radiation security, report the same sources in 
the governmental circles. 
  Consequently, the number of deputies of the chairman of the 
RF government, including the two first deputies, will not exceed 
four, as it was foreseen in the presidential decree "On 
Structure of Federal Executive Bodies." 
  As far as Chubays is concerned, he is not included into the 
"big four" determined by this decree but according to one of the 
next presidential decrees was appointed additionally to them. 
This is "an absolutely logical move," believe the sources in 
the Cabinet, "because his major responsibility - privatization 
- is a process underway in Russia which is to be concluded 
earlier or later." 
  Sources in the governmental apparatus do not rule out 
possibility of slight changes in distribution of duties between 
the future vice premiers.

<F P=106> [Interview with Agrarian Party Leader in the Russian </F>
Parliament Anatoly Lukianov by Pierre Celerier in Moscow; date 
not given: "Development of The System in Russia And Bill 
Clinton's Visit to Moscow"] 
  [Text] [Celerier] You are a deputy in the Duma [the new 
Russian parliament], but also, at the age of 63, one of its most 
senior members. For health reasons you are not attending your 
trial as a participant in the August 1991 putsch. How, then, 
can you take part in sittings of the Duma? 
  [Lukianov] I am genuinely sick, suffering from complications 
linked with pneumonia, which is why I will have to return to the 
hospital in two weeks. That explains my absence from the trial. 
However, as you know, in the Duma every vote counts and costs 
dearly. That is why I preferred not to take my temperature or 
spare my efforts to place myself at the service of the Duma. 
Furthermore, contrary to all expectations I have been appointed 
the senior representative of the block of independent 
representatives. Consequently, I will have to shoulder the 
responsibility of temporary president of the chamber while 
awaiting the election of the real president. 
  [Celerier] You were president of the Supreme Soviet, the 
parliament of the USSR. What common points do you see between 
that body and the Duma? 
  [Lukianov] Our Duma is an institution which has barely seen 
the light of day, but it still bears traces of its Soviet 
predecessors. Above all, it defends the interests of the people 
who elected it. 
  Thus, the voters are entitled to recall their deputy if he 
fails to respect the urgent mandate entrusted to him. The 
deputy is bound by an indissoluble link with the people who 
elected him. 
  [Celerier] And the differences? 
  [Lukianov] In the era of the Supreme Soviet and the supreme 
body of the Congress of People's Deputies, the multiparty system 
only appeared at the very last moment, just before our Soviet 
system was destroyed. Unlike in the West, back then our parties 
had emerged from political groups that had broken away from the 
Communist party. 
  With the Duma, for the first time in more than 70 years, 
party- based elections have been held. In the future, many 
issues will have to be settled by agreement between these 
parties. 
  [Celerier] Is it possible that the Communists and the 
agrarians, of whom you are one of the leaders, will join forces 
with the ultranationalists led by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Lukianov] You are wrong, the only group with which we could 
really collaborate is the democratic party of Nikolay Travkin. 
For, you will be surprised to hear, in my considered opinion, 
the positions adopted by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy are closer to 
those of the Choice of Russia (the presidential party - LE SOIR 
editor's note) than to ours. For instance, he supported the new 
Constitution and its presidential regime as well as the 
abolition of the old Supreme Soviet by the coup d'etat in 
October. All these being measures that we fought, but which fit 
in remarkably well with the slogans of the "democrats." 
<H5>  "The West Should Not Try To Destabilize Us" </H5>
  [Celerier] How do you value Bill Clinton's visit to Moscow? 
  [Lukianov] This meeting with Mr. Yeltsin is necessary, but 
it 
will only prove beneficial if the U.S. President understands 
that our president did not succeed in winning a vote of 
confidence in the elections of 12 December. Unfortunately, I 
fear that the U.S. Administration is not ready to take account 
of the new hand that has been dealt, or of the fact that in 
Russia the specter of politics looms much larger than the 
"democrats" in power would like to have them believe. 
  If I could meet with President Clinton I could ensure him 
that we are not anti-American. However, on the other hand, 
neither the United States nor Europe should try to destabilize 
our geopolitical position, especially with NATO. 
  [Celerier] Precisely, how do you see Bill Clinton's efforts 
at mediation in the dispute between Russia and the Ukraine on 
nuclear weapons? 
  [Lukianov] In private I would dissuade him from becoming 
involved in either our internal or external affairs. However, 
if he really wants to lower the popularity of Boris Yeltsin, 
then he should by all means interfere. Remember Gorbachev. Any 
foreign arbitrator in a conflict involving two Slavic countries 
runs the risk of being sorely disappointed. Nonetheless, I wish 
him good luck.

  [Text] Viktor Luchin has been reinstated as a 
Constitutional Court (CC) justice and ended his hunger strike. 
  "I do not feel triumphant," he told Interfax Friday morning 
[14 January]. "The justices acted as professionals." He said 
that the court members reinstated him in a nine to four vote by 
secret ballot. 
  Luchin went on a hunger strike Tuesday demanding a vote on 
his membership which was suspended on December 1 because of his 
alleged political activities. 
  A CC source told Interfax that in a seven to six vote by 
show 
of hands the court had put off consideration of reinstating 
Valery Zorkin. 
  The source believes that by reinstating Luchin the CC 
justices "disavowed the presidential decree advising that the 
seats occupied by Luchin and Zorkin should be regarded vacant."

<F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Akkuratova: "Will Journalists Become </F>
Shareholders at Last?"] 
  [Text] A Russian Federation Government decree has been 
adopted on "Providing Printing Products for the Publication and 
Distribution of the Media." The document envisages suspending 
Government Decree No. 1233 on the revaluation of fixed capital 
at national economic enterprises for three months in the 
printing industry sphere. 
  As is known, the revaluation and resultant major increase in 
the value of printing enterprises' fixed capital will mean 
approximately a sixfold (according to PRESSA and IZVESTIYA 
publishing houses' experts) increase in the prices of printing 
services. It is doubtful whether even the richest and most 
prosperous publication would be able to stand a such a price 
rise. To protect their rights, the collectives of the major 
Moscow and a number of local newspapers were even prepared to 
declare a strike. Although the strike was averted when, at a 
meeting with the chief editors of newspapers and the leaders of 
journalists' organizations, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
promised to give the journalists' demands rapid consideration. 
  The promise was carried out within the agreed period. But 
what position will the papers be in in three months' time? By 
then, Vladimir Kapelkin, general director of the Association of 
Publishers and Chief Editors, believes, a mechanism for 
compensating press organs for extra costs will be in place. It 
is to be devised by the Finance Ministry, the Economy Ministry, 
and the Committee on the Press. The new decree instructs the 
Committee on the Press to join interested ministries, 
departments, and organizations in preparing proposals on tax 
concessions for the printed media and also for publications 
printing children's, academic, and other socially significant 
literature. The Communications Ministry is to joint interested 
organizations in preparing proposals within a month on improving 
the system for the delivery and distribution of newspapers and 
journals. 
  But perhaps the most important element in the government 
decree is the point which gives the Russian Federation State 
Property Management Committee and the Committee on the Press, in 
conjunction with interested ministries, departments, and 
organizations, two months to submit to the government proposals 
on the procedure for privatizing printing enterprises, including 
those that are members of publishing and printing complexes -- 
proposals connected with the participation of media and book 
publishers' editorial board collectives in their flotation and 
privatization. If these additions are adopted, the editorial 
boards' collectives, that is those who produce the papers, will 
be able to participate in the flotation and privatization of 
printing works and, consequently, also end up owning them. 
Hitherto, the journalists responsible for the end product, the 
news, which the printing base was created to print, have been 
entirely dependent on the latter. Suffice it to say that our 
paper in particular has had to make a difficult choice on 
several occasions: either pay large fines for being forced to 
miss the deadline for making up the pages, when an important 
event occurs in the country and the time when the news comes in 
does not fit the deadline, or report the event 24 hours late. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI has written more than once of the need for 
journalists to participate in the flotation and privatization of 
printing works. Journalists managed to get this provision 
included in the privatization program for 1993. Unfortunately, 
it was not implemented. Is this going to happen again?

  [Text] Speaking on national TV, Ukraine's Foreign Minister, 
Anatoliy Zlenko, said that "the document signed in Moscow is not 
subject to ratification by Ukraine's parliament." Under the 
bill on international agreements adopted by Ukraine's parliament 
recently, such statements are not subject to the process of 
ratification, he pointed out. The document signed by the 
Russian, American and Ukrainian presidents in Moscow "serves to 
develop the resolution on the ratification of START-1 adopted by 
the Ukrainian parliament, Zlenko said. 
  According to him, no nuclear country recognized the way 
Ukraine's parliament ratified START-1. "International isolation 
could bring Ukraine to its knees. Its independence would be out 
of the question," the foreign minister said. 
  Earlier a number of influential members of Ukraine's 
parliament strongly criticized the trilateral document on 
Ukraine's nuclear disarmament signed in Moscow.

  [Text] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko has 
expressed surprise and disagreement with his Russian counterpart 
Andrey Kozyrev's statement saying Moscow will not write off 
Kiev's debt for fuel imports from Russia as compensation for the 
withdrawal of the nuclear weapons Ukraine had inherited from 
ex-USSR. He spoke in an interview with Interfax on Friday. 
  Ukraine's debt for fuel imports from Russia ran at more than 
1 Tn rubles as of December 1, 1993, according to Russia's 
government statistical committee. 
  Earlier in the day, Kozyrev told Interfax that Kiev would 
receive fuel grade uranium for its nuclear reactors but "any 
write-off of the Ukrainian debt is out of the question." 
  For his own part, President Kravchuk, speaking at a news 
conference in the Ukrainian embassy on Friday, said Moscow was 
committed to compensating Ukraine both for long range and 
tactical nuclear weapons. 
  Kravchuk said Ukraine is to receive compensation in fuel 
grade uranium for the withdrawal of the long range weapons from 
its territory but Moscow will be solely in charge of exports of 
500 tons of the uranium reprocessed from the nuclear warheads. 
  The Ukrainian leader said experts on the three sides were 
yet 
to define the amount and form of compensation for the tactical 
nuclear weapons to be withdrawn from Ukraine. He believes one 
option is to write off Kiev's debt for fuel imports from Russia. 
  As he rejected Kozyrev's statement, the Ukrainian minister 
said the write off formula was laid down in the tripartite 
agreement.

  [Text] In the opinion of Ukrainian Foreign Minister 
Anatoliy Zlenko, the efforts of the Ukrainian, Russian, and U.S. 
presidents and diplomats have been successful. Mutual 
compromises, unconventional approaches, and the consideration of 
national interests of all three states, including, primarily, 
Ukraine, have brought to realization the political decision to 
withdrawal nuclear weapons from Ukrainian territory. Specific 
mechanisms for the political, economic, technical, and financial 
promotion of this difficult process by the states of the EEC 
have already been worked out. Anatoliy Zlenko said that the EEC 
has to objectively evaluate the desire of Ukraine to acquire 
nonnuclear status.

<F P=106> [Discussion program entitled "A nonnuclear Ukraine -- </F>
Outcome of the Ukrainian-U.S.-Russian summit," the first program 
in a series, presented by correspondents Eduard Kotenko and Ihor 
Storozhuk, with Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Mikolayovich 
Shmarov, Foreign Minister Anatoliy Maksymovych Zlenko, and 
Defense Minister Vitaliy Hryhorovych Radetskyy] 
  [Text] [First speaker] As we already reported, a trilateral 
Ukrainian-U.S.-Russian summit took place with the participation 
of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. A document of a 
history-making significance was signed. 
  Today, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, 
Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko, and Defense Minister Vitaliy 
Radetskyy are taking part in our television [as heard] program. 
  I think we will be able to talk about the significance of 
this document and analyze in detail the signing process [word 
indistinct] etc. Valeriy Mykolayovych [Shmarov], let us begin 
with the preceding events so as to understand how exactly we 
achieved the signing of the document. 
  [Shmarov] I think it will be interesting to tell you briefly 
a little bit more than those dry reports. The government 
entrusted me to head [words indistinct]. 
  First, what happened yesterday was, as a matter of fact, 
[words indistinct], the completion of a rather lengthy marathon, 
a political and diplomatic marathon which we have been running 
for a long time, for several months. Undoubtedly, it was 
preceded by very intensive and complicated work. That was the 
Massandra agreement and its achievements, as you know, although 
they were not final. That was also large-scope work on drafting 
the Supreme Council resolution on ratification of the START I 
Treaty. There was further work in line with this resolution as 
of 18 November [1993]. 
  I should say that the Ukrainian delegation was guided by 
that 
very document, because the Supreme Council resolution actually 
mapped out a plan of work to be done to put that resolution into 
effect, that is to say, to make international START I effective. 
So-called reservations or conditions, 13 conditions, were 
formulated. The resolution enables this document to come into 
force, in other words, it gave us the right to accede to START I 
on condition that these reservations are fulfilled. 
  You probably remember these conditions, the principal ones 
[words indistinct]. The first gives security guarantees to 
Ukraine in case [words indistinct]. The second issue deals with 
compensation for the value of the nuclear weapons, especially 
its nuclear part, i.e. nuclear ammunition. The issue of 
compensation deals with the issue of returning this value to 
Ukraine somehow. At the same time, [words indistinct] about 
compensation for those nuclear weapons which have already been 
transferred from Ukraine, the so-called tactical weapons which 
were transferred from Ukraine during 1991 and 1992 [passage 
indistinct]. 
  The third issue deals with rendering economic, financial, 
and 
technical assistance to Ukraine and implementing this 
complicated disarmament project. This is a rather [words 
indistinct] task, particularly in view of the present-day state 
of our economy. 
  Well, there is also the issue, as you remember, [words 
indistinct] deactivating, dismantling, and eliminating nuclear 
weapons in compliance with the agreement. These weapons, these 
facilities -- especially the nuclear warheads -- will have to be 
serviced by those who manufactured them, by those who are 
supposed to service them, who are responsible for guaranteeing 
this technology, these weapons. 
  These are probably the main points we focused on while 
elaborating the framework, I would say, of the agreement, which 
had to answer the questions posed by the resolution. 
  One of the new forms of work we offered at the end of last 
year was trilateral negotiations. Working on this problem, we 
have long proposed involving the United States as a party in the 
negotiations, as a guarantor, and as a source of expertise in 
these matters. I would say that this proposal of ours was a 
success and, beginning in December 1993, we started elaborating 
the set tasks and decisions on a trilateral basis. 
  The first such trilateral negotiations were held in Kiev on 
16 December. I must say that we were not used to this form of 
negotiation, and that round of the was rather complicated. 
However, we arrived at an understanding and realized that this 
was a very effective way of working. Having such a strong 
arbiter involved in a dispute on this issue speeded up the 
adoption of decisions to some extent and made them unbiased. We 
believe that this was a positive factor. 
  The second round of negotiations was held for several days 
in 
Washington from 3 December, where a documented basis was formed 
for the future statement, the trilateral agreement the 
presidents have just signed, as you know. I must say it was a 
rather difficult piece of work, which was already obvious in 
Washington, but all those involved were willing to solve the 
issue by taking into account the standpoint of each of the three 
sides. 
  Our work was a matter of principle. I would not say it was 
in any way idyllic. Solutions came hard, and there were 
continuous consultations. The presidents were constantly in 
touch; the vice presidents and foreign ministers, or the State 
Department, constantly exchanged information. In other words, 
it was not the work of three groups of experts or officials, but 
that of a colossal number of people, starting with the top 
leaders of the three countries. 
  I should also add that the U.S. President was directly 
involved in this matter, by way of his appraisal and his 
conduct, and this did a lot for the final outcome. He received 
our delegation, evaluated the situation, and heard out our 
proposals. I would say that his opinions made quite a 
contribution to the conduct of the U.S. delegation and the final 
agreement [words indistinct]. 
  Secretary of State Christopher was also actively and 
personally involved, as were many other U.S. officials. I 
believe the quality of the work at the stage I have described 
was probably appreciated yesterday in Moscow, because the text 
signed by the three presidents was almost identical with the 
text we drafted in three languages, except for a few minor 
technical or linguistic corrections. 
  I think this is only a chronological account of the 
developments. As for a comment on specific issues, my colleagues 
and I can now answer your questions. 
  [First speaker] Thus, following the summits in Kiev and 
Moscow, the process of Ukraine's nuclear disarmament is 
beginning to take real shape. Vitaliy Hryhorovych [Radetskyy], 
could you tell us in detail about the military-technical aspect 
of this process? 
  [Radetskyy] After the Supreme Council adopted the 
resolution, 
I was summoned to the president who gave me the task of 
reporting today's true situation with nuclear arms. I studied 
the resolution in the greatest of detail, and I would like to 
draw your attention to a few issues. 
  First, taking account of the fact that Ukraine was not 
directly involved in the negotiations on the preparation of the 
START treaty, Ukraine's president and government must be advised 
to hold negotiations with the relevant states and international 
organizations on the following issues: 
  1. On international guarantees of Ukraine's national 
security; 
  2. On the conditions of economic, financial, scientific, 
and technical aid toward the fulfillment of the treaty 
obligations; 
  3. On the manufacturer's servicing of nuclear warheads 
and combat missile systems under guarantee; 
  4. On the negotiation of conditions for the funding of 
the inspection envisaged by the treaty; 
  5. On the possibility of peaceful use of silos under 
fail-safe control; 
  6. On the conditions of using fissionable weapon 
materials released as a result of nuclear arms elimination; 
  7. On the guarantees of compensation for the material 
value of nuclear weapon components. 
  And, 12. [number as heard] the president of Ukraine must 
be advised to approve a schedule for the elimination of 
strategic offensive weapons specified in this resolution and 
ensure that it is adhered to. 
  I would also like to draw your attention to Clause 10 of 
this 
Supreme Council resolution. The conditions of compensation are 
extended to involve also tactical nuclear weapons transferred 
from the territory of Ukraine to Russia in 1992. 
  We went further and prepared a report for the president, 
saying that this clause should involve not only the tactical 
nuclear weapons withdrawn in 1992, but also those withdrawn in 
1991. And, second, I drew the president's attention to the 
issue concerning the possibility of peaceful use of silos under 
fail-safe control. Here, views differed as to the ways of 
implementing these clauses, since they concern our security. 
  [Shmarov] Excuse me, please. I would like to return to the 
issue of package No. 26. May I? 
  [Unidentified speakers] Yes, please. 
  [Shmarov] It has been proposed that we set up an alternative 
to the package. You heard them: Let's set up a button, and 
everything will be okay. 
  [Radetskyy] Yes, such views were expressed. 
  [Shmarov] I would like to respond to this with a final 
clarification. We did indeed give this task to our leading 
scientists in specialist design bureaus dealing with missile 
control systems who are highly qualified in this area and who 
worked on this before. They came to the conclusion that the 
development and manufacturing of what is primitively called a 
button, but what in fact is a special centralized missile and 
strategic force control system, would take about seven years. 
It is what will happen during those seven years what Vitaliy 
Hryhorovych [Radetskyy] was talking about: the guaranteed 
service life of the nuclear warheads will expire, and instead of 
working on what we planned, we would wind up in great trouble. 
As the army general has already said, the expiry of the 
guarantee can lead to uncontrolled developments and a situation 
of nuclear danger. What we are guided by during the 
implementation of these programs is first of all the need to 
avoid any nuclear danger in Ukraine. This is my answer to the 
issue of the button, and experts can provide their own. 
  [Radetskyy] Let me add to this. You know that I read an 
article about the silos. I reported to our president that we 
need the infrastructure currently available within the 43d 
Missile Army -- the people whose training, by the way, will take 
approximately 10-15 years -- in order to tackle other problems. 
Second, it is high-precision weapons that can be regarded today 
as advanced weapons which have prospects for the future. We 
should not forget about these, but I am not going to disclose 
here all the subtleties. 
  I reported to the president, and he agreed with me. 
Accordingly, we will consider this issue in the near future at 
the Defense Council, where I will deliver a full-scale report on 
that state, that condition of our armed forces which is to 
ensure and compensate for the withdrawal of the nuclear weapons. 
I would like the television audience to understand this 
correctly. 
  [Unidentified speaker] Vitaliy Hryhorovych, as a military 
man 
[words indistinct] your life, almost completely diverts you from 
tackling other problems. You are permanently thinking about 
this problem. In my turn, I would like to speak as a civilian, 
as a person who is immediately engaged in international 
politics. 
  I would like to say this: After Ukraine gained independence, 
the issue of nuclear weapons was a great obstacle to ensuring 
Ukraine's full accession to the system of international 
relations. I would say that we spend no less time than you do 
thinking day and night about how to prevent these very nuclear 
weapons from becoming an obstacle and putting our state in a 
very complicated situation. 
  I am not going to go back into history and dwell on the way 
we approached this issue, but I would like to say that it was 
created in a very complicated situation. It was only due to 
extraordinary efforts -- and, I would say, nonstandard 
approaches -- that we managed to avoid many of the consequences 
we were anticipating. If there is an opportunity and if we have 
enough time, I would also like to say how we were moved toward 
this, how we reached those trilateral negotiations, that 
trilateral agreement. 
  [Unidentified speaker] Anatoliy Maksymovych. Some people 
[word indistinct] believed, and I think this opinion still 
exists, that it is not just the possibility of defending 
ourselves that we have lost -- we did not lose it, as we now 
understand -- but also the international prestige which, in one 
way or another due to inertia since Soviet times, was attached 
to our being, supposedly, the world's third nuclear state since 
the Soviet Union's disintegration. How would you comment on our 
prestige today? 
  [Zlenko] First, I would like to say that we managed to save 
the state's prestige till yesterday's meeting in Moscow, until 
the signing of the documents. In this connection [pauses] 
  [Unidentified speaker] And after the meeting? 
  [Zlenko] And after the meeting, certainly. It was 
consolidated to an ever higher degree. Absolutely, 
indisputably. I would also like to say that after the Supreme 
Council ratified START and adopted a relevant resolution, the 
response of the Western world was openly negative. 
  This resolution was not recognized as an act of ratification 
by the United States, Russia, or by almost all the other nuclear 
states. Western countries reacted accordingly, and attempts 
were made to place Ukraine in international isolation. 
Immediately after the ratification, we used appropriate measures 
to prevent this happening. This included my personal 
correspondence with a number of ministers from NATO countries, 
first of all, and from the nuclear states. This included a 
statement to the UN secretary general, a statement to the NATO 
secretary general, and to other world and European structures. 
  Then, I would like to add, there followed an exchange of 
views between our president and the President of the United 
States in telephone conversations, and an exchange of relevant 
letters with the president of the Russian Federation. All this 
was done in order to prevent our being completely isolated, in 
order to check the brewing of an attitude in those circles which 
could bring Ukraine at once to its knees. 
  At the same time, the situation remained extremely 
difficult. 
Very difficult. I would like to say that from the very first 
moment the Supreme Council adopted this resolution, the 
president, as you remember, made his own statement. This very 
statement, saying that he would be forced to return to the issue 
and raise it once again at the Supreme Council, gave us a chance 
to continue our work. This gave us a chance to get our foot in 
the door; it enabled us to make contacts and carry out relevant 
work. It was a great political and diplomatic move. 
  Thus, after strenuous diplomatic efforts, we found the 
mechanism for a trilateral agreement, a trilateral summit, in 
which Valeriy Mykolayovych [Shmarov] took part, heading our 
delegation. And the climax of these efforts was the signing of 
the trilateral agreement. 
  [Shmarov] Excuse me, Anatoliy Maksymovych. It was asked 
whether the signing of the agreement leaves us in a state of 
future dependence and with a loss of authority. I would like to 
comment on this. Anatoliy Maksymovych [Zlenko] summed it up 
from a political point of view, and I would like to give some 
pragmatic information. 
  After we reached agreement on these issues in Washington, 
the 
U.S. Administration confirmed its intention of broad-based 
economic cooperation. It has already been determined that a 
large Ukrainian delegation of economists and financiers will go 
to Washington on 24 January to work at government level on the 
issues of broad-based economic and financial cooperation. 
  Also, I had contacts with many representatives of business 
and financial circles. They all make our future and our 
cooperation dependent on the agreement that has been signed. I 
do not think that Ukraine's future, its prestige, are in its 
stance of some nuclear monster, but I think it is in the way the 
people will live in Ukraine, in the way its economy and people's 
well-being will be shaped and developed, and these issues will, 
probably, be solved through broad international cooperation. 
  [Zlenko] This is an absolutely unequivocal fact. I would 
like to share this opinion completely. Moreover, as far as 
prestige is concerned, I would like to say that prestige, of 
course, is based on relevant authority of the state. This is an 
unequivocal fact. You know, if today the state found itself 
under pressure on all sides, of course, what authority of the 
state can we talk about? Then, the state's authority is based 
on a consistent, planned, balanced, and predictable nature of 
both its domestic and foreign policies. Here is the state's 
authority. 
  Referring to what took place in Moscow yesterday, to the 
preliminary negotiations, I would, first of all, like to say 
that we managed to achieve a certain compromise in real terms, 
i.e. to avert the threat of Ukraine's international isolation. 
It seems to me that this is the main factor. This is what 
future prestige will rest on. We managed to lead our relations 
with the United States of America out of the dead-end street. 
  Economic relations have just been mentioned by Valeriy 
Mykolayovych [Shmarov]. As far as economic issues are 
concerned, today, for example, we solve the problem of fuel 
elements supply. It means that we reduce our expenditures for 
buying these materials, which means that we will be able to curb 
further [word indistinct] prices. 
  [Unidentified speaker] Within the framework of the 
agreement. 
But I have in mind what broad cooperation will bring us -- 
investments. 
  [Zlenko] I understand this [words indistinct]. At present, 
the United States of America is setting up a foundation of 
entrepreneurship for small businesses. It will provide the 
first portion of capital to boost this process. You have 
mentioned the economic delegation that is to leave these days. 
It brings along specific programs, specific projects giving an 
opportunity for initiative. The financing of those 155 million 
[currency not specified] allocated by the U.S. Congress for 
economic reform in Ukraine is getting under way. This 
delegation will have a chance to unlock this money and there are 
assurances on the part of the U.S. President himself. The 
minimum sum of financial aid rendered to us for the purposes of 
nuclear disarmament is $175 million. We know what other 
reserves they are talking about and, of course, we will be able 
to get access to those reserves so as to increase this sum. 
  At present, we are elaborating a whole series of specific 
programs and projects that will allow us to use our financial 
resources accordingly. However, the nuclear armaments issue has 
always been an obstacle and this is why they ask: Why are there 
no investments? Well, they all say that the solution of our 
domestic problems is probably hampered by our legislation as 
well, whose elaboration has not yet been completed by our 
deputies, etc. But at the same time, nuclear weapons caused yet 
another problem, which created a negative political climate 
around Ukraine. We hope and, of course, we take under strict 
control the fulfillment of the agreements that we have achieved 
and this will be our determining policy in relations with the 
United States and Russia, and, of course, in an opposite 
direction as well. 
  This is what people must restore: It first of all concerns 
solutions to these economic issues, a range of economic issues. 
It will make it possible to improve people's living standards 
and check the incessant rise in prices for different goods. 
This will guarantee the economic well-being of both our state 
and of each individual therein. This is how I see it. This is 
where we should now focus our attention, and this is what we 
will continue working on. 
  [Radetskyy] Anatoliy Maksymovych, can I add something? You 
spoke about commitments. The Defense Ministry is drawing up 
proposals on the provision of housing for servicemen, which will 
be also taken into account in the United States, on adaptation 
to conversion, etc. You know the difficult situation servicemen 
are facing today. These problems will be solved. They will be 
solved not only by the United States, but also by other states 
as well. We heard today what the attitude is toward us on these 
issues. I consider this a priority. 
  [Zlenko] I would like to finish. When talking about 
prestige, or importance given to the results, we, and our 
delegation, were guided by Ukraine's national interests. 
However, I think that not everyone in Ukraine realizes the 
essence of these interests. Far from everyone does. Naturally, 
we were guided by the interests of (?stability) and security, 
not only in our state, but also in the whole of Europe and the 
entire world. This is what political pragmatism is all about, 
and this must be the determining factor for state policy, both 
domestic and foreign. 
  [Unidentified speaker] Anatoliy Maksymovych, one could 
hardly disagree with these comments, but do you not think that a 
lot about the implementation of this nuclear package of 
documents and the implementation of these programs, military, 
social, and technical, now depends on parliament, on whether it 
will ratify these documents? Does it have to ratify them? 
  [Zlenko] We must first of all sort out our terminology. 
Some call it a resolution, others an agreement, still others, a 
statement. First of all, this document is a trilateral 
statement. Parliament has just passed a law on international 
agreements. We know that it determines which documents qualify 
for international legal status and which do not. This document, 
naturally, does not qualify as such. One can later provide 
legal clarification in this respect, but in order to make it 
clear for everyone today, since there is no time, we are talking 
about a trilateral statement. I think the media, I mean the 
audio-visual media, have already reported this. The press has 
probably not done so yet, because there has indeed been very 
little time. Anyway, we proceed from the fact that it is a 
statement. 
  It is a statement that, in my view, takes account of all the 
reservations and takes the Supreme Council resolution further. 
We would not like to create the impression that the executive 
power went off and did something different from what the Supreme 
Council instructed it to do. You can compare the resolution and 
the statement, and you will see the relevant difference. There 
is a difference, but the main thing is, as Valeriy Mykolayovych 
[Shmarov] said at the very beginning, that a decision was made 
on political guarantees, reliable guarantees, of our national 
security. By whom? By the United States? We used to solve this 
problem on a bilateral basis. Remember, we had letters from 
Russia, the United States, Great Britain, and so on. Now it is 
done on a multilateral basis, as negotiations have been held 
with Great Britain, and Great Britain has stated its readiness, 
as the third depository of the [START] Treaty, to provide 
Ukraine with relevant guarantees. Thus, we are talking about a 
multilateral basis. 
  A meeting with the diplomatic corps recently ended in [word 
indistinct] where I was approached by French Ambassador Peissik, 
who said he had a letter for me from the French Government, 
again, concerning guarantees. Do you understand what we are 
talking about? What does it mean for our state, which is still 
unsteady on its feet of independence, to receive political 
guarantees from leading nuclear states? It is a guarantee for 
the further implementation of our economic reforms. That is 
what we must pay attention to. It is a guarantee protecting 
Ukraine's political sovereignty, and so on and so forth. 
  [Correspondent Ihor Storozhuk] When we say: Guarantees from 
a certain country, say, Great Britain, what is the meaning of 
the concept: guarantee? What do they guarantee? That they will 
not attack us? That we will not attack them? 
  [Zlenko] Let me, Ihor Anatoliyovych [Storozhuk], quote the 
statement, and make a few comments. The three presidents 
confirmed once again that: They will cooperate as full and 
equal partners. Do you realize what Ukraine is raised to? The 
level of partners: That the relations between them are to 
develop on the basis of respect toward each country's 
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Then, 
second: The presidents recognize the importance of compensating 
Ukraine for the value of highly enriched uranium. Valeriy 
Mykolayovych [Shmarov] already commented on that. Measures were 
determined as to fair and timely compensation during the 
withdrawal of nuclear warheads. Further: The three presidents 
came to a decision on simultaneous actions during the transfer 
of nuclear warheads from Ukraine and the delivery of fuel 
elements for Ukraine's nuclear power stations in compensation. 
We have discussed that. 
  Further: President Clinton is providing ready guarantees. 
What are these guarantees? I quote: First: Respect for the 
independence, sovereignty, and the existing borders. Further: 
A pledge to refrain from any threat of violence or the use of 
force against us, and so on. None, I stress, none of their 
weapons are to be ever used against Ukraine. Further: Again, a 
pledge to refrain from the use of economic pressure to force a 
(?CSCE) state to use its inviolable rights of sovereignty in 
one's interests and thus gain advantage. Understand? 
  Further: Confirmation of commitment to immediate action in 
aid of Ukraine as a nonnuclear state party to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty in case of Ukraine falling victim to an 
act of aggression or becoming an object of a threat of nuclear 
aggression. Further: As I said, Great Britain joins here, 
etc., etc. 
  President Clinton once again confirmed the United States' 
commitment to the granting of technical and financial aid for 
the safe dismantling of nuclear arms and storage of fissionable 
materials, and so on, and so forth. This is what we are talking 
about. We are talking about the implementation of Clause 5 of 
the Supreme Council's resolution. In this connection, I would 
like to quote this clause, if we have time: 
  Ukraine as a state that possesses nuclear arms will proceed 
toward nonnuclear status and gradually get rid of the nuclear 
arms deployed on its territory provided it receives reliable 
guarantees of its national security, whereby states will 
undertake to never use nuclear arms against Ukraine -- I told 
you about that -- not to use conventional arms against it and 
not to resort to any threat of violence -- and I told you, the 
statement rules out any, I stress, any threat of violence. 
Further: Not to resort to any threat of violence, to respect 
Ukraine's territorial integrity and inviolability of its 
borders; to refrain from economic pressure in the settlement of 
any contentious issues. 
  As you see, I compared the two. Let my esteemed colleagues, 
let the people evaluate everything that has been done by the 
executive power in this short period of time. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Could you tell us about the 
schedule for the elimination of nuclear weapons? 
  [Shmarov] I would like to answer this question. The 
appendix to the trilateral statement has an interesting aspect, 
I would describe it as a first step plan. This partly answers 
your question, and there are probably many viewers and citizens 
curious about this issue. We, too, wondered about it. As they 
say, it is an everyday life situation: One may give something 
today and refuse tomorrow. Therefore, there is a first step 
plan that envisages that a section of nuclear warheads, say 10 
percent or 200 warheads, is transferred to Russia for 
dismantling within a specified time, while the same amount of 
uranium fuel, or uranium-based fuel elements for nuclear power 
stations, is delivered to Ukraine within the same space of time 
to be used in atomic power engineering. 
  Then work will proceed according to the principles worked 
out 
by our and Russia's Defense Ministries, because it is a complex 
technical task. If you remember, President Yeltsin said in 
Moscow that a new initiative is being drawn up by nuclear states 
concerning the complete detargetting of nuclear missiles. In 
fact, there is a search for an organizational formula, and I am 
convinced that the European side understands it. 
  But speaking of fuel elements, the main thing is that as 
soon 
as we transfer weapons, we must receive compensation 
immediately. Because, according to our calculations, these fuel 
elements will last us for about seven years. Recently, I met 
directors of about five of our nuclear power stations, and I 
remember how serious they were about the problem. They were 
asking me to do something about it. I made a certain diplomatic 
move to get some help with energy fuel, etc. I think that a 
five to seven year solution to this problem for our nuclear 
power stations is quite a price. It would account for over 30 
percent of our energy balance. We are talking not of millions, 
but billions of dollars. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Unfortunately our time on the 
program is running out. Of course, we will not be able to 
discuss all the problems. Ukraine as an independent state has a 
policy that is consistent not only with the interests of the 
Ukrainian people, but also with those of the world. Yesterday's 
summit, and today's discussion of the problems showed that 
Ukraine unblocked the process of nuclear disarmament on our 
planet. 
  [Zlenko] I will allow myself to continue. We are already 
receiving reactions to what has happened. Yesterday, as soon as 
I came from Moscow, I read some articles, and I noticed how 
crudely it was presented, not just what happened there, but the 
state itself. You must bear in mind the image of the state, its 
international reputation. You must consider carefully what you 
are putting into your words, and what the consequences for the 
state will be. That is what we must draw the media's attention 
to. This is very important. It is absolutely important, 
because sometimes, with our ill-considered and rash statements, 
we are putting our state in a very difficult position. Our 
state, with a population of 52 million does not deserve this. 
It has huge intellectual potential, huge resources. It is a 
huge European state, a guarantor of future European security, as 
the U.S. President said during the negotiations here in Kiev. 
You must think about the state, think of what you can and 
cannot say today. This is where the future of our state, its 
independence, and the prosperity of our people lies. 
  [Shmarov] I would like to say this very briefly. I would 
like our people to know that all this work is being carried out 
under very careful control of the military, scientists, 
involving, where necessary, experts from Russia, from 
weapon-manufacturing enterprises, etc. I would not like people 
to have the impression that something is concealed. Everything 
is under control, in order to prevent any instance of nuclear 
danger in our state.

  [Text] Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov has 
stated that the tripartite declaration on the elimination of 
nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory and the accompanying 
appendix, which was just signed in Moscow, is an historic 
document which has laid the foundation for the actual process of 
ending Ukraine's economic and political isolation. In addition, 
the package of documents on denuclearization will enable Ukraine 
to receive international financial aid, including much-needed 
investment to help resolve conversion issues, overcome the 
economic crisis, and provide for the social protection of our 
people. Scientific studies on the dismantling of nuclear 
warheads and their secure withdrawal from Ukrainian territory 
have already been performed. This process will be completed in 
several stages and controlled by appropriate monitoring 
commissions.

  [Editorial Report] Kiev Ukraiyinske Radio First Program 
Network in Ukrainian at 1305 GMT on 17 January carries the 
"Nezhavisimost" program. The first part of the program is an 
interview with Aleksandr Chalyy, chairman of the Legal 
Department within the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, and Konstantin 
Trishchenko, chief of the Department for Control Over Weapons 
and Disarmament within the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry by 
correspondent Syarhey Omelchuk. The second part of the program 
is a live phone-in question-and-answer program. The subject of 
the cast addresses the activities of Ukraine in the sphere of 
denuclearization and results of the tripartite 
Ukrainian-Russian-U. S. negotiations in Moscow. 
  At 1313 GMT, touching upon opinions of various political 
groupings regarding the Moscow agreement, Aleksandr Chalyy says 
that "this tripartite declaration is the logical continuation of 
Ukraine's political activities on the international arena," and 
it fully corresponds to clause No. 9 of the Declaration of the 
National Sovereignty of Ukraine. In addition, he recalls that 
90 percent of the population backed the text of this Declaration 
and "the Supreme Council has ratified the START treaty with 
reservations." Responding to the reporter's question on whether 
nuclear weapons are a deterring factor in relations with 
Ukraine's neighbors, the chairman of the Legal Department states 
that this theory was born in the USSR, and it demands the 
existence of reliable nuclear weapons and an aggressive military 
policy. "Ukraine has no operational control over its nuclear 
weapons and this policy cannot be used by us. In addition, we 
cannot produce nuclear weapons," he adds. 
  At 1317, when asked to comment on security guarantees, 
Aleksandr Chalyy enumerates the principles -- territorial 
integrity, inviolability of borders, sovereignty, and 
independence of Ukraine -- saying that this document will be 
published tomorrow. Further, the talk shifted to prospects of 
the political development of Crimea. However, Mr. Chalyy 
refuses to answer this question and says that time will show 
what happens, however, the nuclear disarmament process does not 
in any case affect the political processes in the Crimea. 
"There are many regions even in Russia that want to become 
independent, however, Russian diplomacy is very careful in 
meeting their demands." 
  At 1328 GMT, queried on the compensation mechanism, 
Konstantin Trishchenko recalls the Massandra agreement and 
Geneva negotiations on the issue and reminds that "Ukraine will 
receive free fuel for its nuclear power plants and new jobs will 
be created in the atomic power engineering field." 
  In the second part of the program, at 1337 GMT, the 
listeners 
again ask about security guarantees for Ukraine and compensation 
for the Republic. Konstantin Trishchenko recommends that they 
read tomorrow's newspapers and repeats that the United States is 
a stable guarantor of Ukraine's security. Next, some listeners 
ask about the possibility of ratifying this agreement in the 
Supreme Council. Konstantin Trishchenko responds that the 
tripartite international treaty will be ratified "by all means." 
  The final questions concern the general situation in the 
world regarding the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. The end 
of the program is unmonitorable.

  [Text] Kiev January 16 TASS -- Ukraine's political and 
public forces are not unanimous in assessing the results of the 
U.S.- Russian-Ukrainian summit in Moscow. 
  The Ukrainian parliament expects to discuss next week the 
agreement signed at the tripartite meeting. However, some 
opposition deputies, largely representing parties and movements 
of radical nationalist orientation, have already denounced the 
agreement reached by the three presidents and labelled the 
results of the Moscow meeting as "betrayal of independent 
Ukraine's interests." 
  Yuriy Kosenko, head of Ukraine's parliamentary commission 
for 
nuclear disarmament, also gave his view on the matter speaking 
on Sunday in the radio programme "Ukraine and the World." He 
said he would like to read the texts of the documents before 
coming up with any legal conclusions about their lawfulness or 
unlawfulness. This view was supported by Anton Buteyko, chief 
of the presidential international service, who spoke in the same 
programme. He emphasised that some ukrainian leaders had 
rejected the document they had never seen, since it was of a 
purely confidential character. 
  Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaly Radetskyy told reporters 
that the main issue to be addressed at present was deactivation 
of the nuclear weapons, which calls for immediate solution 
because the time of warheads safe keeping was expiring. 
According to Radetskyy, nuclear disarmament is not to affect in 
any way the level of defence capability of the Ukrainian armed 
forces. Moreover, security guarantees and Ukraine's territorial 
integrity and independence which to be ensured by the leading 
nuclear powers are designed to guarantee the republic's economic 
revival and integration into the European and World markets, as 
well as its recognition as an equal partner in cooperation for 
peace.

  [Text] Kiev, 14 Jan -- Ukrainian Parliament Speaker Ivan 
Plyushch is refraining from comment on the matter of the signing 
of the tripartite American-Russian-Ukrainian agreement, in 
accordance with which Ukraine is getting rid of virtually all of 
its nuclear potential, before the relevant documents are 
studied. Serhiy Kolesnyk, a member of the Commission for 
Defense Issues, and Andriy Pecherov, a member of the Supreme 
Council presidium, have refused to comment on the fact of the 
signing of the document. 
  Volodymyr Shcherbyna, leader of the "New Ukraine" faction, 
assessed the fact of the signing of the treaty positively, on 
the whole. Giving the reasons for his stance, he asked his 
opponents to reply to the question of whether they could re-aim 
the Ukrainian missiles from facilities in the United States to 
similar facilities in Russia? 
  People's deputy Vladyslav Nosov, secretary to the 
Constitutional Commission, said that by signing the agreement in 
Moscow today the president of Ukraine had exceeded his 
authority, because in accordance with the current Constitution 
he does not have the right to dispose of Ukraine's state 
property (in accordance with the Vienna Convention, the 176 
missiles and nuclear warheads on Ukrainian territory are 
Ukraine's property). According to Nosov, Kravchuk's actions can 
be assessed as an act of "brutal arbitrariness." As regards 
impeachment, noted Nosov, the Constitutional Court, if there was 
one in Ukraine, would have to institute proceedings against the 
president of Ukraine. Nosov mentioned the vagueness of 
Ukrainian legislation as one of the reasons for Kravchuk 
violating the Constitution. 
  Mykhaylo Shvayko, deputy chairman of the Commission for 
Economic Reform, noted that the discussion of this treaty in 
parliament would be very stormy. It is not ruled out, 
emphasized Shvayko, that Kravchuk will provoke "impeachment" in 
the Supreme Council. 
  Volodymyr Kryuchkov, a member of the Commission for Issues 
of 
Defense and State Security, believes that implementation of this 
treaty is unrealistic both for Russia and for Ukraine. 
  It has been learned from informed sources that America is 
proposing compensation to Ukraine for the dismantlement of the 
missiles, which comes to approximately $1 billion. But the 
dismantlement of one complex of SS-24 missiles costs not less 
than $10 billion according to approximate calculations, and 
there are 46 such complexes in Ukraine. In addition, Ukraine 
currently has 136 (?SS-18) missiles.

  [Text] Deputy head of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs 
Commission Yevgeniy Marmazov says the tripartite nuclear 
disarmament agreement signed in Moscow will be considered by the 
incumbent parliament because a new one will not be able to 
convene until May. 
  In an interview with Interfax-Ukraine, Marmazov said the 
Supreme Soviet would not ratify the deal unless the conditions 
it had set for the ratification of the Start-I treaty were met. 
  Last November, the Supreme Soviet ratified the Start-I 
agreement but with some strings attached. Among other things, 
the deputies demanded security guarantees and sufficient 
compensation for the nuclear weapons Ukraine had inherited from 
the former Soviet Union. 
  Under the parliament-approved deal, Kiev is to transfer 36 
percent of its long range missiles and 42 percent of the nuclear 
warheads to Russia.

  [Text] Opposition to concluding the trilateral 
American-Russian-Ukrainian agreement on nuclear weapons on 
Ukraine's territory has sharply intensified in the parliament of 
Ukraine. Even moderate deputies now come out against the signing 
of such a document. According to them, the members of 
parliament were not even told about the treaty signed in Moscow 
by the presidents of the United States of America, Russia, and 
Ukraine. 
  In the opinion of the members of parliament, the signing of 
the Moscow treaty would mean that the president took a stand 
which totally differs from that approved by the parliament. The 
actions by Kravchuk play into the hands of Russia and the United 
States and were carried out by him under pressure, stated the 
members of parliament. Many of them say that they will come out 
against any attempt by President Kravchuk to ignore the 
reservations which were signed and expressed during the 
discussion dedicated to the ratification of the START I treaty. 
The communist deputies speak out for impeaching President 
Kravchuk if the trilateral Moscow agreement is signed.

  [Text] Kiev -- Asked by a UNIAN correspondent today to 
comment on the documents signed by the Ukrainian, Russian, and 
U.S. Presidents on removing nuclear weapons from Ukraine to 
Russia with the aim of dismantling them, Ihor Derkach, people's 
deputy of Ukraine and a member of the Supreme Council Committee 
for Defense and State Security Issues, stated: "This is yet 
another political step by Leonid Kravchuk who is unable to 
pursue any other policy. I cannot see any security guarantees 
from Russia and America. This simply is intended to deceive 
Ukraine with Kravchuk's help. As for the $155 million allocated 
to Ukraine by Bill Clinton, this is the money that has been paid 
to American specialists who were on assignment in Ukraine." 
  Mykola Shulha, chairman of the Supreme Council Committee for 
Issues of State Sovereignty and Inter-Republican and 
Inter-ethnic Relations: "If after signing the documents Russia 
does not comply with the obligations assumed, this could 
undermine the global authority of such an influential state as 
America, and would have negative consequences for the whole 
world. As for the trilateral agreement, I shall endeavour to 
convince the Supreme Council to ratify this document. I believe 
that a compromise solution can also be found in settling the 
issues of the Black Sea Fleet and Sevastopol. Policy should be 
made through understanding and respect for the interests of our 
states." 
  Volodymyr Filenko, people's deputy of Ukraine and chairman 
of 
the Party of the Democratic Revival of Ukraine: "I expressed my 
opinion even before the documents were signed and can confirm 
that my assessment is positive. First, Ukraine today is 
economically unable to maintain this nuclear potential. Second, 
as a result of signing the agreement it will be provided with 
fuel for its nuclear electric stations, which will partly 
resolve the energy problem. Third, it will become possible to 
set up a certain stabilization fund to introduce the hryvnya. 
However, this is Ukraine's last reserve, and political and 
economic reforms are now badly needed." 
  Volodmyr Klymchuk, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party 
of Ukraine: "I assess the signing of the Moscow agreement to be 
a Ukrainian diplomatic success, implementing the Declaration on 
the Independence of Ukraine. At last its primary provision on 
non-nuclear status is being realized and Ukraine will receive 
certain benefits which are badly needed. As for comments to the 
effect that nuclear weapons will be handed to Zhirinovskiy, I 
would like to stress that this figure is no doubt dangerous. 
However, hidden national communists and national fascists are 
an even greater danger." 
  Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, chairman of the secretariat of the 
People's Movement of Ukraine: "What happened in Moscow is a 
total betrayal of the Ukrainian people, and is bad enough to 
stand trial for." 
  Mykola Bahrov, chairman of the Supreme Council of the 
Republic of the Crimea: "My assessment of the Moscow agreement 
between Ukraine, the United States, and Russia on the 
elimination of Ukrainian nuclear weapons is positive. In 
general, President Leonid Kravchuk's assets are the 
international recognition of Ukraine. His liabilities are what 
has happened to the Ukrainian economy."

  [Text] The Moscow deal on the withdrawal of nuclear weapons 
from Ukrainian soil is part of "President Kravchuk's defeatist 
policy," member of the parliamentary commission for defence and 
security matters Igor Derkach told Interfax on Saturday. 
  He says the agreement is not likely to be implemented given 
further economic recession in Ukraine. 
  Derkach pointed to a lack of convincing arguments in 
statements by the American and Russian leaders about security 
guarantees and technical assistance to Ukraine. "The $175 Mn 
aid to Ukraine the Americans promised a long time ago will be 
used to pay U.S. experts," he said. 
  The dismantling and transfer of long-range missiles from 
Ukraine to Russia will cost $3 Bn, according to the estimates 
local experts made prior to the ratification of the Start I 
agreement by Ukrainian deputies.

  [Text] Lvov, 15 Jan -- The tripartite treaty on the 
elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, which has been signed 
in Moscow, will make it possible to deepen cooperation between 
Ukraine and other states and will meet with the understanding 
and support of the world community. This view was expressed 
today by the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Konstantin Zlenko [name 
as received], Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, and Deputy 
Prime Minister Vasiliy Shmarov at a meeting with representatives 
of the diplomatic corps. 
  At the same time Ukrainian centrist and radical right-wing 
political parties showed a total lack of understanding of the 
signing of the treaty. In particular, the very large Rukh 
organization and the Conservative Republican Party assessed the 
actions taken by President Kravchuk as treachery. According to 
them, the document signed in Moscow covers not only liquid 
fuelled rockets but also solid fuelled ones, which are not even 
mentioned in the START I Treaty. 
  The pointer of the political barometer in Ukraine has moved 
toward tension. The sharp response has been softened to a 
certain extent by the Christmas holidays, which continue until 
19 January.

  [Text] Kiev, 16 Jan -- Delegates to an all-Ukrainian 
conference of the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists [KUN] 
voiced their attitude toward the signing of a trilateral 
agreement in Moscow on Ukraine's unilateral nuclear disarmament. 
The fact that the president of Ukraine signed this agreement is 
regarded by KUN as being counter to Ukraine's national 
interests. KUN demands that the signed agreement be immediately 
examined and rejected by the Supreme Council of Ukraine, that 
the government be banned from taking any action to prepare for 
its implementation, and that the president of Ukraine be 
impeached and held liable. 
  In its election program, KUN will campaign for a clear-cut 
division of power into legislative, executive, and judicial, for 
a reform of law-enforcement bodies, dissolution of the Security 
Service of Ukraine, and the establishment of effective state 
security services. KUN will campaign for adoption of laws on 
government and public service with a strict system of 
accountability for the actions of state institutions. In the 
economic policy area, KUN will campaign for private ownership, 
giving priority to agriculture and industry. In the foreign 
policy area, KUN stands for Ukraine's cooperation with all 
countries. The Congress [word indistinct] for a non-nuclear 
Ukraine in a non-nuclear world.

  [Text] Lvov -- Mykola Horyn, Lvov Oblast council chairman 
and a candidate for people's deputy of Ukraine, said in a 
conversation with a UNIAN correspondent on 14 January that his 
stance regarding nuclear weapons differs from the stance of his 
brothers -- Mykhaylo Horyn, chairman of the Ukrainian Republican 
Party, and Bohdan Horyn, people's deputy of Ukraine, who are in 
favor of keeping nuclear weapons on our territory. Mykola Horyn 
proposed an approach to this issue not from a political, but 
from a technical and economic aspect, for nuclear weapons have 
not only to be stored, but properly serviced too. 
  "These weapons have to be tested. But will Lvov and other 
oblast councils give permission for underground nuclear 
explosion tests to be conducted on their territories?" Mykola 
Horyn posed the question.

  [Text] Our listeners are greatly interested in the results 
of the 16 January presidential election in the Crimea. 
According to reports from our Simferopol correspondent, out of 
the six candidates running, no one received the required number 
of votes for an outright victory. Viktor (Alsufiev), chairman 
of the Central Electoral Commission, said that the commission 
will have to discuss a runoff between the two candidates 
receiving the most votes in yesterday's election. Yuriy 
Meshkov, leader of the Republican Party of the Crimea, came in 
first in both Simferopol and Sevastopol, as well as in many 
rural areas. Yuriy Meshkov received 540,000 votes altogether. 
The second-place candidate for the presidential office is 
Mykola Bahrov -- chairman of the Crimean Supreme Soviet -- who 
received 245,000 votes. Third place is occupied by Serhey 
Shuvaynikov, of the Russian Party of the Crimea, who won 186,000 
votes. Leonid Hrach, leader of Crimean communists, received 
some 180,000 votes.

  [Text] Simferopol, 16 Jan -- Violations of the ban on 
campaigning on 15 and 16 January were observed in some cities, 
including Sevastopol, Simferopol, and Yalta, the Central 
Electoral Commission for the Crimean presidential election told 
UNIAR. These offences were committed by followers of Crimean 
Republican Party Chairman Yuriy Meshkov, Russian Party of Crimea 
Chairman Sergey Shuvaynikov and Communist Party Chairman Leonid 
Hrach. 
  Forty-eight percent of electors voted by 1200, and 60-70

areas of north-western Crimea. 
  By 1800, 70 percent had voted in Dzhankoy, Feodosiya, Sudak, 
and Bakhchisaray, 82 percent in Belogorsk Rayon and 98 percent 
in Razdolnoye Rayon. A total of 80 percent turned out at the 
polls.

  [Excerpt] Simferopol, 17 Jan -- [passage omitted] The 
Central Electoral Commission has confirmed the results of the 
vote and appointed 30 January 1994 for the additional round of 
Crimean presidential elections, with two candidates, Yuriy 
Meshkov and Mykola Bahrov, included in the ballot paper. 
  In an exclusive interview with a UNIAN correspondent, Yuriy 
Meshkov, in the lead in the presidential race, said he would 
have won the first round of elections had it not been for a 
split in the Russian movement blamed on Serhiy Shuvaynykov, who 
had refused to withdraw his candidacy. 
  As for the probability of his victory in the second round of 
elections, the RPK-RDK [Republican Party of the Crimea-Party of 
the Republican Movement of the Crimea] leader did not deny 
rumors of a possible transfer in his favor of votes in support 
of Serhiy Shuvaynykov. In the elections Shuvaynykov had the 
backing of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], 
Zhirinovskiy, and those in favor of the communist Leonid Hrach. 
Meshkov did not rule that it was possible those in power would 
obstruct the holding of the second round of the elections. 
  Also in an exclusive interview with a UNIAN correspondent on 
the eve of the elections, Yuriy Meshkov stated he was convinced 
that in the event of his election he would be able to avert a 
conflict with the Ukrainian leadership. At a meeting with 
representatives of political parties in December, in his words, 
Leonid Kravchuk did not oppose holding the elections of the 
Crimean president (UNIAN has it that Leonid Kravchuk only said 
it was unreasonable to counteract it). In Yuriy Meshkov's view, 
there is a legitimate basis for relations between Ukraine and 
the Crimea, as well as those between Russia and the Crimea, to 
be settled legally. He evaded a straight answer to the question 
on whether his victory would ensure the participation of Crimean 
districts in the elections to the Ukrainian Supreme Council in 
March, which are to be with elections to the Crimean Supreme 
Council. The RDK leader stated that all-Ukrainian elections 
could only be held on condition they would not contravene the 
interests of the Crimea and that he would not take a decision on 
that issue on his own. He did not, however, specify what these 
interests exactly were as seen by him. 
  Yuriy Meshkov is 45 years old. He is Russian. He chairs the 
Republican Party of the Crimea-Party of the Republican Movement 
of the Crimea and is a people's deputy of the Crimea. He 
graduated from the law department at the Moscow State 
University, is married and has two children. The planks of his 
pre-election campaign were the full state independence of Crimea 
and a referendum on this issue; the accession of the Crimea to 
Russia; his negative attitude toward quotas for participation in 
the Crimea's elected bodies being granted to deported peoples; 
and on land being unavailable for private property. [passage 
omitted] 
  Crimean Tartar Majlis Chairman Mustafa Dzemilev on his part 
stated in an interview with a UNIAN correspondent that if Yuriy 
Meshkov was to be elected to the post of the Crimean president, 
then "given his overt program of having the Crimea quit Ukraine, 
we shall regard him solely as a president of his voters but in 
no way as that of the Crimean Tartar people".

  [Text] Simferopol, 17 Jan -- A UNIAR correspondent has been 
told by Borys Kyrylov, Crimean Supreme Council people's deputy 
and member of the Coordination Council of the Republican Party 
of Crimea [RPK], that the RPK leader's victory in the elections 
is a surprise for the party. If any, a referendum on the status 
of the peninsula, in Kyrylov's view, will only be of a 
consultative nature and there is no threat to the integrity of 
Ukraine whatsoever. 
  According to that party's decisions and in order to deprive 
the Crimean president of the executive functions of the head of 
government, changes and amendments to the Law on the president 
of the Crimea will be introduced if Yuriy Meshkov scores a 
victory.

  [Excerpts] There was quite a high turnout in the elections 
for president of the republic on 16 January. [passage omitted] 
  INTERFAX reports that Ivan Yermakov, the Ukrainian 
president's representative in Sevastopol, has been relieved of 
his duties. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk signed the 
relevant instruction on 17 January. 
  Local observers think this is the Ukrainian leadership's 
first reaction to the results of the presidential elections in 
Crimea, and do not rule out that other actions might follow this 
dismissal.

  [Text] The head of the presidential public relations 
office, Nikolay Mikhalchenko, told INTERFAX-Ukraine today that 
"the returns of the recent elections in the Crimea were being 
examined." He added that "specific decisions will be made in 
accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine" in the near future. 
  Mikhalchenko pointed out that the Ukrainian Constitution 
never envisioned presidential elections in the Crimea. He also 
said Ukrainian Speaker Ivan Plyushch had warned the Crimean 
parliament of the impossibility of holding such elections before. 
  The Ukrainian president's press office is expected to come 
out with a statement on the issue in a day or two. 
  As a result of the first round of the presidential elections 
in the Crimea on January 16, the leader of the Republican Party 
of the Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov, led the race with 38.8 percent of 
the electorate. He is widely known as a supporter of the 
Crimea's unification with Russia. 
  Ukrainian patriotic forces will never recognize the legality 
of the presidential elections in the Crimea, according to the 
statement the leader of the Civic Congress of the Crimea, Sergey 
Litvinov, made in an interview with INTERFAX-Ukraine. 
  At the same time, he admitted that the Crimean elections 
were 
a fiasco of nationalist movements whose popularity on the 
peninsula is very low. 
  In his opinion, this is a result of the Ukrainian 
leadership's imprudent policy which left Crimean Ukrainians with 
no support. 
  A deputy of the Ukrainian parliament and one of the leaders 
of the nationalist movement "Rukh," Les Tanyuk, commented on 
the election returns by saying that their main result was the 
failure of Kravchuk's team. 
  "People voted not against Nikolay Bahrov (Speaker of the 
Ukrainian parliament -- INTERFAX) as a politician, but rather 
against Bahrov as Kravchuk's representative," he told 
INTERFAX-Ukraine. 
  He put all the blame for this on the Ukrainian president who 
failed to promptly stand up against the illegal elections as a 
guarantor of the Constitution. 
  Tanyuk said Yuriy Meshkov promised easy ways out of simple 
situations and in this sense he was one of Zhirinovskiy's men to 
a great extent. 
  The repercussions of the elections may be very dangerous and 
disastrous both for Ukraine and Russia, as well as for the whole 
of Europe, Tanyuk said.

  [Text] Simferopol -- A news conference of representatives 
of parties of the Crimea, which have set up an anti-authority 
interparty coalition bloc of opposition forces, took place on 13 
January. The Union in Support of the Republic of the Crimea 
[Soyuz za Pidtrymku Respubliky Krym], the Communist Party of the 
Crimea, the Republican Party of the Crimea, and the People's 
Party of the Crimea [Narodna Partiya Krymu] are part of it. The 
initiators of setting up the bloc have stated that it is not 
ruled out that other parties and organizations of the republic 
will join it too. Yuriy Komov [name as received], a member of 
the political council of the Union in Support of the Republic of 
the Crimea and people's deputy of the Crimea, has stated that 
the association's main task is to act as a united front against 
the current "party of power" in the Crimea and Mykola Bahrov, 
its leader. "We are not rejecting Bahrov as a person," Yuriy 
Komov emphasized, "but the policy that he is conducting on the 
principle `divide and rule' -- a policy of advancing on people's 
backs." In their speeches the leaders of parties accused the 
speaker of betraying the interests of the (Communist) party and 
of plagiarism ("he has collected in his program the cream of the 
election programs of his rivals"); the opinion was expressed 
that Mykola Bahrov bears personal responsibility for the 
poverty-stricken economic state of the Crimea. 
  Fedir Volchan [name as received], a member of the republican 
committee of the People's Party of the Crimea, noted that the 
bloc that has been set up is not a provisional attempt, but an 
attempt calculated for the future to shape relations between the 
parties of the Crimea after the elections. In his opinion, the 
actions of the government and the Central Electoral Commission, 
which has become Bahrov's "doormat" during preparations for 
elections of the president of the Crimea, indicate their 
readiness to agree to falsifying the voting results.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Semena report: "Election Battle in the Crimea: One </F>
Candidate Targeted, Another Has Gone Underground"] 
  [Text] Simferopol -- Several shots, presumably from a 
rifle, were fired at the building of the Communist Party of 
Crimea Republic Committee in Simferopol 12 January. 
  One bullet pierced the glass of a window in the office of 
Leonid Hrach, republic committee first secretary and candidate 
for Crimean president. Fortunately, at the time the office's 
usual occupant was in a carefully guarded republic radio studio, 
where a live debate between the presidential candidates was in 
progress. There were 15 minutes to go until the end of the 
discussion.... 
  An incident of a different kind took place around another 
candidate -- Supreme Soviet Chairman Nikolay Bargov. As he was 
coming of a hall in Yalta after addressing voters, a group of 
women expressed their dislike of the candidate by attempting to 
strike him. The security services came to the rescue. 
  The Crimean presidential elections are scheduled for 16 
January. Six candidates have registered, all of whom are now 
vigorously campaigning. 
  Crimea's law on the presidential elections prohibits local 
mass media sources from publishing candidates' popularity 
ratings, although the results of independent studies, which 
coincide in many ways, are passed around from hand to hand and 
by word of mouth. All observers note that the main rivalry has 
developed between the two candidates with the highest chances of 
victory. That is, current Crimean Supreme Soviet Chairman 
Nikolay Bahrov and Communist Party Leader Leonid Hrach. Both 
are experienced politicians -- however, at times their electoral 
platforms are diametrically opposed. Leonid Hrach is supported 
by structures of the renewed Communist Party, and Nikolay 
Bahrov, although registered as an independent candidate, is also 
supported by influential political forces like the Party for the 
Economic Revival of Crimea, the Agrarian Party, the Party of 
Interethnic Accord, and the Party of Social Guarantees. 
  Again, Bahrov's side is taken by the Crimean Tatar People's 
Assembly, which adopted a decision to participate in the 
elections. As Assembly Chairman Mustafa Dzhemilev [name as 
transliterated] told IZVESTIYA's correspondent, the Assembly 
members analyzed all the candidates' speeches and programs and 
watched the exclusive interview with Nikolay Bahrov on the 
Crimean Tatar television program "Ana Yurt" [as transliterated]. 
It was noted that all candidates apart from him are calling for 
measures which will lead to a revision of borders, and this 
means conflict in the Crimea. Therefore, the Assembly has urged 
compatriots to vote against all candidates except Bahrov. 
  As election day draws nearer, political tension in the 
Crimea 
grows. Cities are covered with leaflets. Every weekend there 
are several meetings, congresses, and rallies. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy brought some quite unexpected tones to 
the political battle between contenders for the presidency. He 
decided to help one of the candidates, and appealed to the 
people of the Crimea: "The LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia] considers the Russian Party of the Crimea [RPC] (leader, 
S. Shuvaynikov) to be the only party in the Crimea capable of 
defending the interests of Crimean or Russian people. Remember, 
the LDPR will be with the RPC in fighting for your rights. We 
will defend Russian people, wherever they may be." 
  Vladimir Volfovich's appeal proves that the Crimean party's 
patron is simply out of touch. In fact, a scandal had occurred 
in the Russian Party the day before: Sergey Shuvaynikov refused 
to stand down in favor of a candidate from the "Russia" bloc and 
even spoke out against joining the bloc itself. Furthermore, he 
gathered together likeminded thinkers and they excluded those 
behind the idea for an electoral bloc from the Russian Party. 
In response, supporters of the bloc assembled their own 
confederation and excluded the chairman himself from the Russian 
Party -- that is, their own presidential candidate Sergey 
Shuvaynikov, who, incidentally, has already succeeded in 
proclaiming himself the Crimea's shadow prime minister. There 
was a positively savage attack on Anatoliy Los, leader of the 
Russian Society of the Crimea and the most fervent supporter of 
the electoral bloc. Medics at the hospital gave him 30 
stitches, while Shuvaynikov, who stands accused of this 
terrorist act, issued his own statement on television, where he 
announced that he is "switching to an unofficial position" and 
requested protection from the security services and the 
prosecutor's office.

  [Text] The ruling body of the Crimean Communist Party made 
public a statement Friday saying that the assassination attempt 
against party leader Leonid Hrach was designed "to frighten the 
presidential candidate" and foil the presidential elections. 
  Shots were fired on January 12 at the windows of Hrach's 
office. One of the party officials was sitting in Hrach's 
armchair at that time. By the latest reports, the bullets 
pierced the table but did not hit the official. 
  The statement expressed its willingness to set up workers' 
self-defense units which would "within the framework of the law 
fight organized crime and stop the Mafia." 
  The Crimean Interior Ministry's press service says, 
meanwhile, that the incident was an act of hooliganism rather 
than an assassination attempt.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>
  [Text] Yerevan security agencies will be reshuffled to 
better respond to their new goals, having emerged since Armenia 
acquired independence. These goals radically differ from those 
pursued in the totalitarian period, according to a decree by 
Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, released here today. 
  The decree liquidates the so-called "operational services" 
of 
Armenia's State Office for National Security which were formerly 
engaged in ideological control over the population. Their staff 
will be paid salaries during next three months, after which 
period they will either be fired or fill other positions in the 
state office departments, according to results of professional 
fitness tests. All security personnel are subject to these 
tests, the decree says. 
  New guidelines for the State Office for National Security 
will be developed, along with a new structure of the agency. 
  Under the decree, the main border-guard administration, 
agencies in charge of guarding strategically important 
enterprises, financial and medical departments of the state 
security office, as well as its technical maintenance services 
will keep functioning until the complete restructuring will take 
place. Possibly, they will form the foundation for Armenia's 
future security service. 
  David Shakhnazaryan, 39, who since March 1993 was an 
ambassador at large under the Armenian president, has been 
appointed an acting head of the State Office for National 
Security. He is to replace Eduard Simonyants, who headed the 
office since February 1993 and now will fill another post.

independent statehood. 
  With the same decree, Davit Shahnazaryan--the Armenian 
president's ambassador on special missions--has been appointed

<F P=106> [Report by Gevorg Nazaryan from the news conference held by </F>
presidential press secretary Aram Abrahamyan in Yerevan on 17 
January--recorded] 
  [Text] In opening the news conference, presidential press 
secretary Aram Abrahamyan said: Azerbaijan has been pressing 
ahead with military operations against Nagorno-Karabakh and the 
Armenian Republic. Its air attack was not directed against 
military objects but peaceful settlements. This clearly reveals 
Azerbaijan's real intentions in its war against Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Despite that, Armenia is not deviating from its policy to 
strive for the peaceful settlement of the problem. 
  In recent days the press reported on a high-level 
quadripartite meeting between Azerbaijan, Karabakh, Armenia, and 
Russia. At present, there is no clear agreement on holding such 
a meeting, although, in principle Armenia favors the idea. This 
is the context in which the meeting was held between the 
Armenian and Azerbaijani defense ministers in Tbilisi on 
Saturday when they examined the military-technical aspects of a 
cease-fire. The press secretary noted that no concrete 
agreement was reached. 
  As already reported, the Armenian president issued a decree 
on 15 January on the restructuring of the State Directorate for 
National Security. In referring to that matter, Mr. Abrahamyan 
said: It is a requirement to revamp our structures to place 
them at the service of national statehood. One of such state 
structures is this directorate, whose specific purpose should be 
exclusively intelligence and counterintelligence work. To 
successfully fulfill these important functions, the directorate 
should undergo structural changes. The former structure was set 
up during the Soviet Union and was serving other purposes, 
primarily surveillance of dissidents. Naturally, such problems 
no longer exist in a democratic country. The Armenian citizens 
can worship and express any opinion freely and without 
restraint, and join any legal political organization. 
  The press secretary added: I consider it important to note 
that the president highly appreciates Eduard Simonyants [the 
former head of the State Directorate for National Security], and 
the planned restructuring has nothing to do with him. No matter 
who headed that directorate, its existing structure was beyond 
reform without any serious structural changes. I can assure 
that Mr. Simonyants' abilities will be properly used in another 
state job. 
  The adoption of the privatization bill by the parliament is 
one of last week's important developments. Mr. Abrahamyan also 
touched on this matter. The implementation of the plan requires 
hard work from the government, and he thinks that the government 
will place that process under its strict control. He said: The 
state's aim is to harmonize and bring in tandem the 
privatization process with two other processes: The first is 
the creation of a system for social protection so that the 
socially unprotected strata can obtain financial assistance and 
goods from various sources, and therefore be able to meet their 
minimum requirements. The second is the creation of the market 
substructures serving the economy. In this, the banking system 
plays the leading role. The Armenian Central Bank should act 
like an orchestra conductor in the system, and here the need was 
also felt to introduce changes. These changes were made last 
week with the efforts of the president and the parliament. 
  He drew the reporters' attention to the president's decree 
on 
15 December and on the course of its implementation. As you 
remember, that decree was designed to create favorable 
conditions for the import and sale of foodstuff. This decree 
gave concrete instructions to the Central Bank and government, 
and some of these instructions have already been implemented. 
The issue here involved introducing changes in the 
decisionmaking process inside the government aimed at 
eliminating bureaucratic infighting and the possibility of 
corruption. An operational staff has been set up under Shahen 
Petrosyan to establish law and order at the airports. The 
president's supervisory service has accomplished enormous work. 
This service set up an operative alarm team and established 
round-the-clock posts in Zvartnots, Yerepuni, and Shirak 
Airports. Despite all these measures, Mr. Abrahamyan said that 
the president's supervisory service and law enforcement organs 
revealed a number of cases of pilferage of money and goods and 
the misuse of official positions. A criminal investigation has 
been opened. The operative alarm teams of the supervisory 
service have resumed their work as of 14 January, not only in 
the airports but also along the highways north and south of 
Armenia. In case of any violation of the law, our businessmen 
could immediately inform the employees at the posts set up by 
the service. 
  Mr. Abrahamyan also replied to reporters' questions.

  [Text] The situation remains tense all along the Karabakh 
battle front. The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] Army units 
are waging heavy defensive battles. The NKR Defense Army press 
service has reported that yesterday the Azerbaijani troops 
continued their incessant attacks against the Karabakh 
positions. The fiercest battles took place in the direction of 
Askeran-Agdam. The enemy used scores of armored cars. 
  After destroying one tank, one armored car, and more than 60 
soldiers, the Karabakh fighters forced the Azerbaijanis to 
retreat to their initial positions. Two were killed and seven 
injured on the Armenian side. 
  No substantial changes took place in the other sectors of 
the 
confrontation line. 
  The Karabakh positions at the eastern and southeastern 
sectors of the front have been coming under intensive artillery 
and rocket shelling since this morning. 
  Also, the Azerbaijani Air Force has again become active. A 
number of Azerbaijani warplanes tried to attack Stepanakert, the 
capital of the NKR, between 1000-1200 today. Details are still 
being verified. 
  The Armenian Defense Ministry Press Service has reported 
that 
it has been relatively calm on the Republic's border since 
yesterday night. No serious incidents have been reported.

  [Text] Morteza Bank, head of the Eastern Europe and CIS 
Department at the Iranian Foreign Ministry, said in a news 
conference at the Iranian Embassy on 13 January that the 
developments taking place in the region naturally have a serious 
affect on the relations between our two countries. The search 
for ways to settle the Karabakh problem, which is one of the 
important regional problems, is the reason for my visit to 
Armenia, Bank said. 
  Asked by an ARMENPRES correspondent if a new Iranian-Russian 
mediation initiative could be expected following his visit that 
came in the aftermath of the recent visit to Iran and Azerbaijan 
by Russian Special Ambassador Kazimirov, Morteza Bank said: 
Naturally, the countries in the region could play a big part in 
the solution of that problem. Iran and Russia, which are the 
largest countries in the region, could engage in effective 
activity both with a separate and a joint initiative. Mr. 
Kazimirov's visit pursued such an aim. We have agreed to 
cooperate and positive developments have already taken place. 
Of course, this does not mean that our activity would not be 
coordinated with the efforts of the CSCE. I think that there 
are reasons for optimism that the will to attain peace is 
gaining ground. 
  In touching upon Armenian-Iranian economic and cultural 
relations, Bank noted that they are underlined by the principles 
and traditions of mutual interest, good-neigborliness, and 
centuries old friendship between the two countries, and these 
ties should develop normally.

Igor Porshnev, Vitaly Trubetskoi and others; from the 
"Presidential Bulletin" feature] 
  [Text] President Levon Ter-Petrosyan hopes that in January 
it will be possible to organize working meetings between the 
representatives of the Armenian and Azeri presidents concerning 
a political settlement of the Karabakh conflict, INTERFAX was 
told by Presidential Spokesman Aram Abramyan. 
  He said that at present Armenia was continuing consultations 
with the Russian leadership on the issue. Such consultations, 
said Abramyan, seem to be held between the Azeri leadership and 
the leaders of the self-proclaimed Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Abramyan said that to achieve a political settlement 
meetings 
at the level of foreign ministers, then at the level of the 
presidents who are to sign an agreement had been planned. So 
far, said the spokesman, it was a matter for the future. 
  Abramyan reaffirmed Armenia's preparedness to continue 
backing Russia's peace-making initiatives. 
  The chairman of the parliamentary commission on 
Nagorno-Karabakh, Seyran Bagdasaryan, said that not a single 
politician, not a single international organization had the 
right to determine the future of Nagorno-Karabakh. It was up to 
the people of Nagorno-Karabakh to decide their future status. 
  He believes, though, that some provisions of the program on 
the settlement of the Karabakh conflict, initiated by the 
Russian president's aide, the well-known political scientist 
Andranik Migranyan, are interesting and deserve to be considered. 
  IF Note: To settle the Karabakh and Abkhazian conflicts, 
Migranyan proposes to grant to Nagorno-Karabakh and Abkhazia 
broad self-rule within Azerbaijan and Georgia. It is also 
necessary to create demilitarized zones around Karabakh

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Bablumyan: "Split in Yerevan Over Whether </F>
Or Not To Recognize Nagorno-Karabakh Republic"] 
  [Text] Yerevan -- People in Armenia want peace for the 
people of Karabakh and for themselves, a peace worthy of the 
losses sustained and the suffering endured. Translated into the 
language of specific action, this means an immediate cease-fire 
without prior conditions, guaranteeing the safety of the 
civilian population of Nagorno-Karabakh, and deciding at the 
negotiating table who is to repay debts, to whom, how much, and 
how. 
  President Levon Ter-Petrosyan is right to believe that he 
has 
the support of all Armenia on this issue. The republic, cut off 
from the outside world by a long-standing blockade, is barely 
able to keep its economy afloat. The war in Karabakh has in one 
way or another affected the well-being of every Armenian family, 
and people realize that it cannot go on endlessly. 
  "We have managed to strike off the agenda the status of 
Nagorno-Karabakh and focus entirely on the main problem: How 
can peace be achieved?", Aram Abramyan, the Armenian president's 
press secretary, told IZVESTIYA. "The two ways proposed by the 
CSCE and Russia are equally acceptable to us. The advantage of 
the Russian scenario is that it contains a specific mechanism to 
prevent the resumption of hostilities -- to whit, the 
introduction of internationally-mandated peacekeeping forces 
into the conflict zone. Both plans of action proposed to the 
warring parties have won the approval of Stepanakert and 
Yerevan, but they were rejected by Azerbaijan. The conflict in 
Nagorno-Karabakh has today reached the stage where its peaceful 
resolution depends not only on the will of the warring parties, 
but also on that of the world community." 
  Armenia's political parties are unhappy that Yerevan has not 
made up its mind to recognize the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic 
[NKR]. Armenia's influential "Ramkavar-Azatakan" 
Liberal-Democratic Party is in favor of recognizing the NKR as 
an independent sovereign state. In the opinion of party leader 
Ruben Mirzakhanyan, this step would make it possible to unravel 
one of the tightest knots of the conflict. It is a question of 
the decision of the then Armenian SSR [Soviet Socialist 
Republic] Supreme Soviet of 1 December 1989 declaring 
Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast [NKAO] an inalienable part of 
Armenia. 
  It was clear at the time that this decision was as futile as 
the Azerbaijani authorities' ensuing decision to dissolve the 
NKAO. However, having effectively changed nothing, both 
documents are still formally in force to this day. Yerevan's 
official recognition of the NKR would, in Ruben Mirzkhanyan's 
opinion, remove the problem. 
  "We do not believe that the process of settling the conflict 
is becoming more productive as the group of international 
mediators expands," he said. In his opinion, this group should 
be confined to the warring parties' immediate neighbors -- 
Turkey, Iran, and, undoubtedly, Russia. 
  "We have very serious disagreements with the authorities in 
our approach to the Nagorno-Karabakh problem," Vagan Oganesyan, 
one of the leaders of the "Dashnaktsutyun" opposition party, 
told IZVESTIYA. "We cannot in particular see whether we are 
complying with the Supreme Soviet decision for Nagorno-Karabakh 
to accede to Armenia or whether we agree with its proclaiming 
itself the NKR? If Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh are in actual 
fact a single state, Azerbaijan is in effect at war with 
Armenia, whereas the latter does not acknowledge itself to be a 
state at war. "If we consider the NKR a separate state 
formation, why do we not recognize the republic de jure?" 
[quotation marks as published] Vagan Oganesyan wonders. 
  Vagan Oganesyan believes that Russia will play a crucial 
role 
in resolving the conflict and its participation in these affairs 
is therefore far more preferable to mediation by any other 
country or international organization.

Armenia?"] 
  [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia, will visit the republic in 
mid-January at the invitation of Armenia's Council of 
Intellectuals, according to local mass media reports. 
  It is hard to say whether the fact is trustworthy and 
whether 
Vladimir Volfovich's coming to Armenia in the near future is 
possible at all especially in the wake of his promise to turn 
independent Armenia into a Yerevan gubernia as part of a Russian 
empire. 
  Armenian social scientists, however, think Armenia does have 
a social base for forces like Zhirinovskiy's, because populism 
and socialist ideas take a far from back seat in semi-starving 
countries.

  [Excerpt] Monday, January 17 -- New Foreign Minister Juri 
Luik said that he accepted the offer of the ministerial post 
since he already had some experience in foreign politics. He 
had also stressed the political aspect in his work as the 
defence minister, Luik added. 
  Luik commended the intellectual potential of the Foreign 
Ministry and hoped that he could exploit it efficiently. He 
also expressed his confidence that the new Defence Minister 
Indrek Kannik will manage well. 
  The main guarantee of Estonia's statehood is its impeccable 
reputation and other countries' awareness of Estonia, Luik went 
on. It is extremely difficult to interfere in the politics of a 
peaceful and stable country and there are few states ready for 
an outright aggression, he stressed. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 14, BNS -- Estonian President Lennart 
Meri and Prime Minister Mart Laar today signed a letter to NATO 
Secretary-General Manfred Woerner informing him of Estonia's 
wish to join the Partnership for Peace program. 
  Meri said after the signing this is "a historic decision 
that 
will have a stabilizing effect not only on Estonia but on the 
entire northern Europe, and which concerns all Estonia's 
neighbors." In the president's view, neither a system of 
agreements nor a well-equipped army offer the most reliable 
guarantees of peace, but a democratic system of government. 
"Democratic states never pose a danger to each other," he said. 
  "Partnership for Peace was the best NATO could at present 
offer to East European states," Meri said. Commenting on 
Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas' bid for full NATO 
membership, Meri said Estonia and Lithuania face different 
problems, and that there are no foreign troops in Lithuania nor 
territorial issues that need solving. 
  Laar said Lithuania did not inform the Estonian Government 
of 
its request for NATO membership alluding to problems arising 
from the differences between the Estonian and the Lithuanian 
Constitutions. He affirmed, however, that the meetings of the 
three states' premiers have repeatedly touched on Baltic 
cooperation in the framework of the Partnership for Peace 
program. The Estonian premier cited the setting up of the Baltic 
peacekeeping battalion as a concrete step in this direction. 
  Asked whether the joint signing of the letter today 
signifies 
"domestic peace" between the president and the prime minister, 
Meri said, "The joint signing of this document should rule out 
such rhetorical questions being asked here today."

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 17, BNS -- Estonia agrees in principle 
to Russia's proposal to withdraw its troops from Estonia by Aug. 
31, but expects Russia to present a detailed withdrawal 
timetable in the next round of talks, Vaino Reinart, Estonia's 
top negotiator at talks with Russia, told BNS. 
  "When we get the timetable, we can say whether we agree to 
it 
or not," he said. "But, it shouldn't affect the final deadline 
of troop pullout, which we are in principle prepared to accept." 
  The head of the Estonian delegation noted that Estonia's 
chief requirement is that Russian combat units should leave 
Tallinn. 
  The next round of Estonian-Russian negotiations was 
scheduled 
to begin tomorrow near Moscow, but it was postponed due to 
Russia's top negotiator Vasili Svirin's sickness. Reinart said 
the new date will be set within a week. 
  Reinart affirmed that his appointment as head of the 
Estonian 
delegation is not going to change the delegation's work. 
  "The general direction of the talks is anyway set by the 
foreign minister, and we work closely together with (Estonian 
Foreign Minister) Juri Luik," Reinart told BNS. 
  Reinart was appointed head of the Estonian delegation last 
week. He succeeded former Defense Minister Juri Luik, who was 
appointed Foreign Minister.

<F P=106> ["ADC" report: "President and Premier Take Divergent Stands </F>
on Penetration of Russian Capital Into Republic's Economy"] 
  [Text] Estonia Prime Minister Mart Laar has termed as 
naive nationalism the statement of President Lennart Meri to the 
State Assembly in which the latter voiced the fear that the 
state had no sufficiently clear idea about the penetration into 
Estonia of Russian capital under the cover of dummy firms and 
dummy persons. Addressing a press conference after the 
government session on 11 January, the premier pleaded that the 
government was taking account of the danger of expansion of 
Russian capital, taking measures and keeping the situation under 
control. While keeping tabs on the activities of major 
monopolies of the neighbor country in the national economy, 
however, the government does not intend to interfere in specific 
deals. Answering a question about possible restrictions on 
Russian capital in Estonia, Mr. Laar said that there was no need 
for that. It would be a rash act for Estonia to bar the inflow 
of capital, investments, and the creation of joint firms with 
businessmen from any country in the East or in the West. "This 
would be disastrous for us," he underscored. In this connection 
the prime minister sharply criticized the president's call to 
support Estonian capital exclusively. "I am not idolizing 
Estonian capital," he stated quoting the Chinese aphorism about 
cats of different colors: white or black, it doesn't matter if 
they catch mice. "We are only against major monopolies" that 
would be able to gain inordinate influence here. 
  As for Russia, it is second to Finland today as Estonia's 
trading partner, as regards import and export, according to the 
Estonian Finance Ministry. Commodity circulation in the third 
quarter of 1993 amounted to nearly 1 million cronas. Russia's 
share in Estonian export reaches 20 percent and nearly 19 
percent in import. Estonia boasts a small but positive balance 
in its trade with Russia. Cars are in first place in importance 
in the overall export structure of Estonia. In the first 
quarter this export item accounted for 185 million cronas; in 
the second, 230; and in the third, 320. Buying cars in the 
West, Estonian firms keep about a third of them, selling the 
greater part in the East at a profit. There is a small stream of 
cars flowing in from East to West (Zhiguli and Moskvich cars). 
This is, according to Sergey Trofimov, chief specialist of 
Estonia's Finance Ministry, quite normal business: buy low and 
sell high. 
  In fourth place is fuel: 174 million cronas in the third 
quarter of 1993. This business is also quite legitimate. 
Estonia buys fuel from Russia and resells it at a profit in the 
West. Notably, Russian firms often ask Estonian firms to act as 
brokers. 
  The fifth position is taken by nonferrous metals. Their 
export in the third quarter was worth 170 million cronas. The 
amount of these metals imported by Estonia, according to Mr. 
Trofimov, was worth several tens of million of cronas. Where 
does the metals for export come from? First, from pilfering 
inside the country. Second, it is being smuggled out of Russia. 
Notably, both countries make money in the process. True, in 
Russia it is private persons rather than the state. But this 
situation is likely to change after Russia takes full control on 
its side of the border. 
  And finally, on 11 January, the Estonian Government 
confirmed 
a treaty with Russia on cooperation in the area of 
standardization, certification, and metrology, which would also 
promote trade between the two countries.

  [Excerpt] Riga, Jan 15, BNS -- Russia is prepared to again 
annex the Baltic states at a moment's notice, Latvian Foreign 
Minister Georgs Andrejevs charged in an interview to BNS. 
  In Andrejevs' opinion, this is witnessed by Russia's 
reaction 
to the Jan. 10 incident in Riga when the arrest of two generals 
led to Russian troops stationed in Latvia being put on standby. 
  Andrejevs said the situation was critical, and that Russia 
gave a vivid demonstration of which methods it plans to use in 
an incident that could be solved through diplomatic channels. 
  The minister met yesterday with members of a CSCE mission to 
Latvia who were interested in how a country in a situation 
similar to the Jan. 10 incident can be helped. Andrejevs said 
that Russia's consent is needed so that international observers 
could attend the handover of Russian military facilities to 
Latvia. [passage omitted]

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian 
at 1100 GMT on 14 January, during its regular newscast, 
broadcasts a report by an unidentified Mayak commentator on the 
Russian-Latvian talks on the Skrunda radar station. 
  Beginning his report, the commentator says another round in 
the Latvian-Russian talks has ended in Riga. The talks were 
held against the background of the recent provocation against 
two Russian generals. The commentator then switches to a report 
by Sergey Zotov, head of the Russian delegation at the talks. 
  Zotov begins by saying: "I think we have witnessed the 
starting point of a new policy by the president, of a new 
Russian policy. The whole package of measures that were adopted, 
first and foremost in the military and foreign policy sphere, 
shows clearly that from now on our concern for our compatriots, 
for human rights, no longer stop at declarations, though these 
are also important. Now, this concern and these slogans about 
defending human rights and our people are underpinned by a real 
mechanism for defending them. But in this case, we are talking 
about the protection of servicemen, direct symbols of the state. 
That is why I think it is very significant that throughout 
these events, we demonstrated our political will and made it 
clear what a repeat of such events would entail." 
  Zotov continues: "In the short term, these dramatic events 
have definitely had a negative effect on the talks, on bilateral 
relations. At the same time, they appear to have lanced the 
boil that has been swelling: It is no secret that, for a long 
time, Latvia has been pursuing the line that the withdrawal of 
Russian troops is to take place without any prior treaty. These 
events have yet again forced many in this country to realize 
that there will be no Lithuanian variant in this case, that for 
the Latvian people, for the Latvian politicians who want to keep 
their posts, it is important that the withdrawal of our troops 
takes place on the basis of a treaty and, accordingly, that all 
issues connected with this be agreed. From this point of view, 
it could be said that these events [the recent arrest of two 
Russian generals] have, to some extent, been a stimulus 
prompting Latvian politicians to adopt a more realistic stand. 
  "This was reflected in the discussion of an agreement 
between 
the two states on the legal status of the radar station Skrunda. 
We have always insisted that for Russia, this strategic 
installation is seen as having a military purpose. The Latvian 
side said it should be civilian. These events have again shown 
that ours was the correct line. This formula was established -- 
Skrunda will now be a military installation. 
  "The second point is the coming together of the two sides on 
the issue of when this installation will function." 
  The commentator ends the report by saying that Zotov said 
agreements on all issues, including Skrunda, are to be finalized 
at a meeting of the sides in two weeks.

<F P=106> [Irina Litvinova report: "Russian Radar Station Will </F>
Probably Continue Operating in Latvia for Another Few Years"] 
  [Text] Riga -- The latest round of interstate talks 
between the Latvian and Russian delegations has finished in 
Riga. Latvian observers are acknowledging that "some progress" 
has been made. 
  The main document concerning the withdrawal of Russian 
troops 
from Latvian territory has basically been prepared over more 
than two years of work by diplomats and military specialists. 
Until recently the stumbling block remained the Russian 
military installation in the Latvian settlement of Skrunda -- a 
radar station which forms part of the overall missile early 
warning system. 
  Skrunda has been the central issue at three rounds of 
interstate talks. On this occasion, it seems, the two sides 
were able to reach a definite compromise. I am couching this 
affirmation in deliberately loose wording: It is clear that 
both sides could still make some adjustment to their positions. 
Thus, for example, coordinating the time frame for operating 
and dismantling the station will be a complex task, since Latvia 
is saying three years plus one, whereas Russia is insisting on a 
total of five years. 
  The talks took place against the background of an incident 
that made the work more difficult and which occurred 10 January 
in Riga, when two Russian generals were arrested. On 12 January 
the head of the Russian delegation, Special Envoy Sergey Zotov, 
told your IZVESTIYA correspondent that he thought it would be 
possible to resume the talks that had been broken off once the 
servicemen had been released, once the blockade of Russian 
installations had been lifted, and once the Latvian leadership 
had submitted an official apology. Envoy Zotov regards these 
events as a possible rehearsal for the seizure of Russian 
civilian installations, and for this reason the delegation 
stressed once again that the radar at Skrunda can only be used 
for military purposes. Deputy Foreign Minister Martins Virsis, 
head of the Latvian delegation, said that the Latvian view was 
as follows: The radar at Skrunda is a military establishment 
under civilian control. In any case, Virsis stressed, the 
station will not be given the status of a military base.

  [Text] Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis has expressed on 
Monday a bewilderment in connection with the pronouncements on 
the problem of human rights in Latvia and Estonia made by the 
U.S. President Bill Clinton during his visit to Moscow. 
  "There are no violations of human rights of the sort which 
was alleged to", the Latvian president stressed at the briefing 
devoted to a regular meeting of the Council of National Security 
of the republic. 
  The results of the meeting of the U.S. and Russian 
presidents 
and the Partnership for Peace program in the NATO framework were 
discussed at the meeting. 
  "I cannot believe that the two superpowers have finally 
decided the fate of small countries" said G. Ulmanis answering 
the questions about the attitude to the references of B. Clinton 
and B. Yeltsin to the Baltic states, in particular to the 
dependence of the schedule of withdrawal of Russian troops from 
Latvia and Estonia on the solution of the human rights problem. 
  The president thinks that "a law on citizenship must be 
passed as soon as possible in Latvia which would exclude any 
speculations on the subject of human rights". Ulmanis said that 
he was expecting information from the Russian and American sides 
on the final deadline of withdrawal of Russian troops from 
Latvia and Estonia and on the conditions of keeping a Russian 
radar station on the territory of Latvia. 
  In the nearest future, said Ulmanis, Latvia will send a 
letter to the NATO leadership with agreement to participate in 
the Partnership for Progress [as received] in accordance with a 
decision taken at the Council of National Security meeting. 
  The president emphasized that in view of joining the 
Partnership for Progress, where Russia will also participate, 
Latvia must "carefully review its relations with Russia". 
  G. Ulmanis also said that the Latvia's joining of NATO is "a 
remote prospect".

  [Text] Riga, Jan 17, BNS -- The U.S.-Russian presidential 
summit could help adjust talks between Latvia and Russia on the 
terms of dismantling the Skrunda radar and the deadline for the 
Russian troops' withdrawal, Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis 
told reporters Monday. 
  The meeting between the presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill 
Clinton could make Russia more compliant in talks with Latvia, 
said a NATO representative in another press conference today in 
Riga. 
  Commenting on the issue of human rights, Ulmanis said he was 
"surprised" by the allegations of human rights restrictions in 
Latvia, voiced during the Moscow summit. 
  Latvia needs to prompt the adoption of a citizenship law to 
stop "philosophizing over these topics," the president said. The 
National Security Council also supports the stance, said Ulmanis. 
  Ulmanis has not received official information on the Moscow 
summit yet, he said.

  [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas has 
declared his administration is assigning priority to cooperation 
with other Baltic republics, integration into the political, 
economic and defense structures of Europe, and the promotion of 
neighborly relations, primarily with Russia, Ukraine, and 
Belarus. 
  The President announced this Monday [17 January] to the 
Vilnius-based chiefs of diplomatic missions. 
  He said he was planning to visit Belarus and invite his 
Ukrainian counterpart Leonid Kravchuk to visit Lithuania. 
Treaties on cooperation and neighborly relations were likely to 
be signed as a result of those visits. 
  Algirdas Brazauskas felt relations had improved between his 
republic and Russia. The discussion, he said, would soon resume 
of an agreement on military transits from Russia to the 
Kaliningrad region via Lithuanian territory. 
  The Lithuanian President told diplomats that calls for the 
revision of the Pottsdam conference's decision on the 
Kaliningrad region had nothing to do with his administration's 
official foreign policy line. The calls were coming from 
certain members of the Lithuanian parliament.

  [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas and 
Ceslovas Jursenas, chairman of the Lithuanian Seimas, received 
Antonin Baudys, Czech Republic minister of defense, who is on a 
three-day official visit to Lithuania. 
  During the meeting with the president, the Czech defense 
minister reported that the Czech Government adopted a decision a 
week ago to sell all types of weapons to Lithuania without any 
restrictions. 
  At the moment Lithuania is buying only pistols from the 
Czech 
Republic. However, Linas Linkevicius, minister of national 
defense, said that a commission of specialists had already been 
set up to investigate other types of arms Lithuania could buy in 
the Czech Republic. 
  The Czech Government also gave Lithuania 2 million kronas, 
which is about $60,000, to pay the fees for five Lithuanian 
military groups that will come to study the peace-keeping 
operation at a specially designed training center in [words 
indistinct]. 
  The Czech Republic pays much attention to this kind of 
operation and the NATO initiative [words indistinct] and this, 
according to the Czech politicians, is the most direct and 
concrete way to NATO. 
  Antonin Baudys also told Algirdas Brazauskas that 
Lithuania's 
wish to join NATO had influenced the position of the Czech 
Government on this issue. 
  Speaking to Ceslovas Jursenas, the Czech minister of defence 
said that his country expected to become a member of NATO in 
five years. 
  Talking to the journalists Antonin Baudys was more careful 
and did not mention any specific date. He only said that this 
would depend on when NATO will see that the Czech Republic was a 
reliable partner, which he said would not take too long. 
Besides, according to Antonin Baudys, not only countries of the 
Visegrad triangle should be simultaneously accepted into NATO, 
but also the Baltic countries and Bulgaria, Slovenia, and 
Romania. 
  The Czech minister of defense also said that the Visegrad 
triangle was not a closed structure, but should embrace all of 
Central and Eastern Europe. At the moment, the Czech Republic, 
without declaring publicly its intentions to proceed toward 
NATO, is making concrete steps in this direction. 
  This year joint military exercises are to be held with (?the 
Netherlands) and France within the framework of Partnership for 
Peace. The military structures are being reorganized according 
to the NATO model. 
(Andrius Vasiliauskas), representative from the Ministry of 
National Defense, who was accompanying the delegation, told the 
journalists that the Lithuanian military structures were 
established according to the NATO model from the start.

  [Excerpt] Vilnius, Jan 17, BNS -- MP Vytautas Petkevicius, 
member of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP], 
was approved as the new chairman of the parliament's National 
Security Committee Monday. 
  Petkevicius was supported by all seven committee members 
present at the meeting. Five other committee members, all 
representatives of the rightist opposition, were not present. 
  The new chairman said he will resign immediately if work 
does 
not go smooth in the new post. Petkevicius said his primary aim 
is to deal with the critical situation in the armed forces. 82 
deaths were reported in the Voluntary State Defense Service over 
the past two years. Legal action in the state defense system was 
taken 162 times for the loss of weapons, assaults and other 
criminal offenses. 
  Petkevicius was elected in accordance with the parliament's 
resolution saying that the post would belong to the ruling LDDP 
faction. But neither Petkevicius, not three other members of the 
committee, have registered themselves on the LDDP faction after 
the new faction registration rules came into effect. 
  Petkevicius was the acting chairman of the committee for 
several months after the resignation of MP Gediminas Kirkilas.

  [Text] Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the Motherland Union 
-- the Lithuanian Conservative party -- held a press conference 
at the Lithuanian Seimas today. 
  Landsbergis urged the Lithuanian officials to show 
solidarity 
with Latvia by making public statements, because of late Latvia 
has become an object of repeated attacks by the Russian imperial 
forces. Because of the circumstances which had developed, Latvia 
is now the weakest link among the Baltic states. Having failed 
to subordinate the entire region, Russia is making efforts to 
split it by first of all becoming firmly established in Latvia 
and later perhaps even to annex it, Landsbergis said at his 
press conference. 
  Such a split in the strategic unity of the Baltic states 
would also weaken Lithuania's security, he stressed. According 
to Landsbergis, Lithuania should draw the attention of 
international organizations, states, and heads of state to the 
dangerous tendencies in Russia's policy towards Latvia. Several 
points in this policy were singled out by the leader of the 
opposition. First of all, this is most vividly manifested by 
the delay and by the ever increasing conditions for the 
withdrawal of the occupational troops from Latvia. Efforts are 
made in order that some units of these troops would remain 
deployed there. Another vivid feature of the aforementioned 
policy is the allegedly existing problem to protect the 
Russian-speaking population. Even the President of the United 
States, who agreed to see that they were not discriminated 
against, has been drawn into this propaganda network. The 
situation is being depicted in such a way as though the Russians 
in Latvia were a historically established minority the 
discrimination against whom had currently begun, Landsbergis 
said, at the same time drawing the attention to the fact that 
this type of propoganda was also a warning to Lithuania. 
  According to Landsbergis, the Russian foreign minister 
accuses Latvia and Estonia of being aggressive towards Russia 
which is exactly what Russia itself is doing. In this way 
attempts are made to establish firmly the right of force which 
Russia was ready to use during the incident with its generals. 
According to Landsbergis, the incident itself was inspired in 
an attempt to compromise the volunteer force. It seems that a 
the Russian military intelligence has been entrusted with a task 
to destroy the volunteer force in the Baltic states, he stressed. 
  In turn, Landsbergis said, the Latvian Government is also 
making concessions to the imperial designs of Russia. According 
to him, the former stance adopted by the government was more 
resolute. Probably Latvia has realized that it cannot expect 
support from the West. Unfortunately, in this case we are 
becoming very much like the West, Landsbergis, leader of the 
Motherland's Union - Lithuanian Conservatives, stressed in 
today's a press conference.

  [Text] Dushanbe, 16 Jan--An ITAR-TASS correspondent at the 
headquarters of the command of the Russian border troops in 
Tajikistan was informed today that one of the border posts of 
the Gandyshskiy border detachment came under intensive mortar 
fire yesterday evening. 
  More than 20 mortars were launched along the stretch of the 
border with Afghanistan, some of which exploded right in the 
outskirts of the Ayvadzh border settlement. Russian border 
guards neutralized the enemy's weapon emplacements with powerful 
artillery fire. There were no casualties among border guards 
and local civilians. 
  On the same day, Tajik opposition fighters fired from the 
territory of Afghanistan at a sector controlled by border guards 
from the Moskovskiy border unit. The Russian border guards 
neutralized the firing points of the mojahedin with answering 
fire.

with these words that President Saparmurad Niyazov of 
Turkmenistan addressed the Russian-speaking population of 
Turkmenistan today. 
  Speaking at the congress of the National Revival Movement, 
the head of state assured the Russian-speaking population that 
in the state he heads, there will be no infringement of their 
civil rights, nor of the national feelings of all those for whom 
Turkmenistan has become the motherland. From the lofty tribune 
of the congress, the president declared that the state and the 
government guarantee equal democratic rights to all their 
citizens -- regardless of nationality. He pointed out the 
importance of the Turkmen-Russian agreement on dual nationality, 
which was signed recently, stressing its role in further 
strengthening peace, stability, and national accord in 
Turkmenistan.

  [Text] Minsk, 15 Jan (BELINFORM-TASS) -- Prospects for 
political and economic cooperation in the future and the 
withdrawal of strategic nuclear forces from the republic's 
territory were discussed during the talks with Bill Clinton. 
The head of the Belarusian Parliament thanked the U.S. 
President for his great personal contribution to the protection 
of human rights and highly assessed the Partnership for Peace 
cooperation program proposed by Bill Clinton. 
  Speaking about the situation in the republic, Stanislav 
Shushkevich said he is advocating a democratic development of 
the state, early elections of supreme legislative bodies, and 
economic reforms. He expressed hope that the new constitution 
-- the Supreme Soviet is to consider it at its current session 
-- will assist in this. 
  Bill Clinton, in his turn, said the United States wants to 
support democratic processes which are under way in the Republic 
of Belarus, and is ready to provide technical aid in holding 
early elections. Bill Clinton said the United States is 
allocating an additional $25 million in order to implement the 
process of withdrawing the strategic nuclear forces from 
Belarusian territory. He also said that an American business 
center will be opened in Minsk, possibly in the next two months. 
  The Treaty on Encouragement and Mutual Protection of 
Investments between the Republic of Belarus and the United 
States, signed today by Stanislav Shushkevich and Bill Clinton, 
will help to develop economic cooperation between the two 
countries.

  [Text] Minsk January 15 TASS -- A joint statement on 
results of Belarusian-U.S. summit negotiations was signed today 
to express satisfaction of the sides with the expansion of 
bilateral contacts and outline measures for cooperation in 
security, trade, investments, non-proliferation of nuclear arms, 
science and technology. 
  The sides noted historic Belarusian steps to fulfill its 
obligations as a non-nuclear state. The Belarusian leader 
informed Bill Clinton of implementation of the Belarusian 
nuclear disarmament program. 
  In his turn, Clinton confirmed high U.S. estimation of the 
Belarusian role in the vitally important sphere and assured 
Shushkevich of further U.S. support to these efforts. He said 
about the additional 25 million dollars to be used for 
dismantling nuclear arms within the framework of the Nunn-Lugar 
Law, which increases the overall sum allocated for the effect to 
100 millions. 
  Bill Clinton told Stanislav Shushkevich about the tripartite 
statement of U.S., Russian and Ukrainian Presidents of January 
14, 1994, and voiced U.S. recognition of the importance of just 
compensation to Belarus of the cost of enriched uranium from 
nuclear warheads that were located on its territory. 
  The leaders confirmed U.S. and Belarusian adherence to 
non-proliferation of nuclear arms and took an obligation of 
close cooperation in the sphere. 
  Shushkevich informed the U.S. President of Belarusian 
economic and democratic reforms and confirmed the course towards 
accelerated privatization of state enterprises. Belarusian 
Prime Minister Vyacheslav Shushkevich [name and title as 
received] told the U.S. President about Belarusian Government 
efforts to ensure transition to market relations and 
transformation of credit-monetary, banking and other economic 
spheres. Kebich and Clinton exchanged opinion on bilateral 
economic relations. 
  The U.S. President announced a new package of technical 
assistance to Belarus to help the financing of privatization of 
small ventures, training of personnel, health care and 
ecological projects. The President supported accelerated 
economic reform in Belarus. 
  Shushkevich and Clinton signed a treaty on investments and 
expressed the assurance the expansion of trade relations will be 
economically beneficial for both states and serve as an 
incentive for development of private enterprise in Belarus. A 
bilateral agreement to enable the U.S. Export-Import Bank to 
expand its operations on financing bilateral trade was also 
announced. 
  The sides exchanged notes to put into effect the agreement 
on 
mutual assistance of their customs services.

<F P=106> [Statement by President Boris Yeltsin at news conference in </F>
Moscow -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, I shall come to the 
main point right away. U.S. President Clinton's first visit to 
Russia has been very fruitful. It could not have been 
otherwise: we know one another too well, there was too much that 
had to be done, and our peoples too were expecting much of us. 
This visit is based upon the realities of today, and at the 
same time looks to the future. Regarding the difficult past, 
the U.S. President and I closed that book very firmly back in 
Vancouver. 
  The work in Moscow proceeded at a tense pace and 
purposefully. Specific accords and agreements have been reached 
which are important both for Russia and for the United States -- 
and for the whole world. The negotiations took place at a 
crucial time for our country. The old habits and stereotypes 
are crumbling, and an active search for something new is under 
way both in our country and in the United States. 
  We could be said to be in the throes of a common 
Russo-American revolution. The citizens of the Russian 
Federation approved a new constitution at free and democratic 
elections, and for the first time elected their own parliament 
without duress. I do not agree with those who think that our 
first attempt was a flop. If one looks deeper than the 
individual names and popularist slogans, then all in all, the 
people have opted for a better life, for legality, and for 
predictability. 
  This is a lesson which we all still have to learn from in 
order to prevent mistakes being repeated. I confirmed quite 
definitely to the U.S. President that our course is aimed at the 
development and deepening of the reforms and with stepping up 
social orientation. I am sure that the country will gain more 
stability and a sound social peace. Bill Clinton has expressed 
a subtle understanding of the peculiarities of our situation. 
You see, the Americans have experienced and are experiencing 
quite a lot, too. We can count on complete support for the 
reforms being carried out by the Russian president, the 
Government, and the reformers in the new parliament. 
  I have talked about both the problems in our economy, about 
the positive changes in it, and about the elements of 
stabilization. I stressed that at the present time it is not 
humanitarian aid that we need but full-blooded cooperation, 
taking into account the transitional nature of the young market 
economy of Russia. 
  Specifically I find that, together with the Tokyo package 
and 
with Clinton's package in Vancouver, that the most tangible 
support for Russia would be for the American market to open up 
to our exports, be it raw materials or machines. 
  I am very content that today an agreement on uranium has at 
last been signed after two years of talks. 
  Cold War restriction must be removed altogether, 
restrictions 
like the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Artificial barriers imposed 
under the pretext that Russia is dumping should be removed, and 
let's just say that the case with our uranium is more likely 
just fear of competition from more advanced technology and 
cheaper material. 
  Bill Clinton has done much since Vancouver. He has kept his 
word as regards dismantling the economic obstructions of the 
Cold War. Discriminatory restrictions have been removed from 
U.S. internal legislation, or most of them. About 5,000 types 
of Russian goods are no longer subject to increased taxes. The 
U.S. President has done much to introduce Russia into 
international financial and economic organizations. I do not 
think it will be long before the G-7 becomes the G-8. 
  Russo-American relations have finally moved into the phase 
of 
mature, strategic, global partnership in all spheres during 
these talks. The partnership has opened the way to general 
understanding, both of the new prospects ahead and of the new 
problems. We are both convinced that the modern world should be 
democratic, open, and integrated. 
  Regarding equality, mutual benefit, and accounting for each 
others' interests, there is no need to talk about this anymore, 
it goes without saying. This principle vector of our 
partnership is set out in the Moscow declaration which we have 
signed. It reflects and reinforces the historical improvement 
in Russian-American relations in Eurasia and the world as a 
whole. 
  Our mutual activities aimed at strengthening strategic 
stability and security are taking on new substance. Thanks to 
them, in the last few months alone the world and our countries 
have avoided many traps and errors. There is also an evident 
positive result -- the strengthening of cooperation in the 
sphere of security and disarmament, peacekeeping, cooperation, 
and economic openness. 
  The ground-breaking step which has finally been taken in 
Moscow is a denouement in documents leading to the elimination 
of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. I consider the document which 
was signed today by the three presidents to be historical. 
Everyone wins from this, first and foremost the Ukrainian 
people themselves. The agreements reached at our trilateral 
summit meeting save resources, get rid of disagreement, and give 
a good example to other countries. They are reinforced by the 
Russian-American statement on strengthening all regimes for the 
non-proliferation of weaponry of mass destruction. And the 
durability of non-proliferation is at present, as is well known, 
being seriously tested. 
  The U.S. President brought us right up to date on the 
Partnership for Peace concept adopted in Brussels. The idea is 
seemingly from NATO, but it contains a primordial element of 
Russian-U.S. joint creative work. This concept is an important 
step in the creation of a security system from Vancouver to 
Vladivostok, which rules out the formation of new divisive lines 
or zones of unequal security. 
  We see in this idea one of the options for building a new 
Europe -- one of them, but not the only one, of course. We 
shall put specific content into this channel of cooperation, 
including in the military sphere. And in doing so we shall not, 
of course, forget the other collective security structures in 
Europe, above all the well-tried institutions of the United 
Nations and CSCE. 
  I briefed the President in detail about the integrationary 
processes that have got under way on the territory of the former 
Soviet Union, and in particular about the latest summit meetings 
within the context of the CIS. There need be no fear of any 
neo-imperialist lust here -- Russia's only interest is in 
stability. It is undertaking honest mediatory efforts to 
extinguish the hotbeds of conflicts on the perimeters of its new 
borders. We are ready to cooperate widely and even to 
coordinate our actions here with the United Nations, the CSCE, 
and with the entire international community. Unfortunately, the 
international community itself has not as yet shown a great deal 
of enthusiasm. There has been a wary reaction to our specific 
proposals, whether in Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, or in 
Tajikistan. 
  I think that the United States and ourselves will now have 
a greater understanding on this very important question. 
  I firmly raised the question of human rights violations 
among 
national minorities, especially in the Baltic area. There 
should be no double standards here, whether it is taking place 
in Haiti or in the Baltic area. As a result we adopted a 
statement with teeth on ensuring human rights, and the President 
confirmed that he personally would adopt corresponding measures 
on contacts with the Baltic countries, so that discrimination 
against the Russian-speaking population there will ultimately be 
abandoned. 
  I do not want things to sound too upbeat. That does not 
reflect the nature of our frank and businesslike conversations. 
There were, and will be, disagreements. But the main thing is 
the desire to seek understandings, which is later embodied in 
specific policies. Such is the flight assignment for the 
Russian-American partnership. It will be a good replacement for 
the flight assignment for strategic missiles, which will now not 
be aimed at one another. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Statement by U.S. President Bill Clinton at news conference </F>
in Moscow -- live in English with simultaneous translation into 
Russian; processed from the Russian] 
  [Text] Thank you very much. Nine months ago, President 
Yeltsin and I met in Vancouver and there we laid the foundation 
for the new partnership of the United States and Russia, a 
partnership based on mutual respect. We have just concluded an 
excellent and productive summit in which we took important steps 
to strengthen this partnership. I thank President Yeltsin and 
all his team for hosting us and for making these days so 
productive. Throughout our discussions I reaffirmed U.S. firm 
support of Russia's commitment to democracy and transition to 
market economy. I informed President Yeltsin that the United 
States has prepared specific projects worth $1.6 billion of aid, 
and I announced in Vancouver that we had already expended 70 
percent of that sum. The president and I also discussed an 
additional $2.5 billion in aid for Russia and for other 
independent states that my administration offered in Tokyo in 
April, and that the Congress fully funded in September. The 
president gave me strong assurances of his intention to continue 
the reform process, and we discussed a number of ways in which 
the United States and the international community can help in 
promoting the reforms, and at the same time to assist Russia in 
cushioning the social hardships which the reform has brought to 
many people in Russia. 
  Concrete expression of the assistance of the United States 
to 
the reforms is that the United States is opening the doors this 
year to the Russian small enterprise fund. It has established a 
fund supporting large enterprises entering the private sector. 
This fund will be chaired by the former secretary of treasury 
Michael Blumenthal. We also signed a contract to purchase $12 
billion worth of enriched uranium within the next 20 years, and 
I have asked the Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown to lead a 
very high-level trade mission to Russia in March, including 
presidents of major companies who will be in position to promote 
trade and investment in Russia. 
  We issued today also a joint statement on human rights, in 
which we express our common goal to combat discrimination and 
all forms of racial intolerance, including anti-Semitism. 
  Today I also had an opportunity to describe further the 
results of the successful NATO summit this week, and President 
Yeltsin assured me that Russia will be a full participant in 
Partnership for Peace. 
  We took several historic steps to make sure that the fear of 
nuclear confrontation be in the realm of the past. Presidents 
Yeltsin and Kravchuk and I signed an agreement which commits 
Ukraine to scrap approximately 1,500 nuclear warheads, all the 
most modern and dangerous missiles in Ukraine, the SS-24. The 
warheads will be removed from those over a period of 10 months. 
  President Yeltsin and I agreed that as of 30 May, the 
nuclear 
missiles of Russia and the United States would not be targetted 
against any country. 
  Third we signed an agreement to work closely in those areas 
where the danger of nuclear weapons proliferation is the 
greatest, including the Middle East. 
  We also agreed that the sovereignty and the independence of 
Russia's neighbors must be respected. I expressed my hope that 
Russia's talks with Estonia and Latvia would lead to the 
withdrawal of troops in 1994. As President Yeltsin has said, I 
agreed that it should be stressed that the rights of the 
Russian-speaking population should be respected in all areas. 
  Let me close by reminding you that President Yeltsin and I 
agreed to meet at the NATO summit in Naples in July, and I am 
pleased that he accepted my invitation to make a state visit to 
the United States this fall. I'm looking forward to the 
meetings. 
  I came to Europe with the hope of starting to build a new 
security founded upon a common commitment to democracy, free 
economics and mutual respect for security and territorial 
borders. I came with a dream that with the end of the cold war 
we might all be able to work together to make a Europe that 
would be integrated politically, economically and in terms of 
security. A Europe that for the first time since the 
establishment of nation states would not be divided by the 
present conflicts or lingering animosities. I now believe we 
have a better chance to create that kind of security, a security 
in which great nations would be able to treat each other as 
genuine partners, and chart their own futures, without being 
dictated to by others. A future in which, I believe, greatness 
would be defined fundamentally by our capacity to enable the 
men, women and children who live within our borders to live up 
to the full extent of their capacities. 
  I thank President Yeltsin for his partnership and endeavor, 
and I assure you that we will continue to work as hard as we can 
towards this vision.

<F P=106> [Question and answer session of news conference with </F>
Russia's President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton 
in Moscow; President Clinton speaks in English with simultaneous 
Russian translation; individual correspondents identified where 
possible -- live] 
  [Text] [Terekhov] Hello, I am Terekhov from the INTERFAX 
news agency. Boris Nikolayevich, you have said repeatedly that 
you are prepared to take account of the results of the election 
campaign - the elections which took place on 12 December - and 
the voters' mood in your domestic policy measures. Do you 
intend to make any adjustments in your foreign policy, 
particularly in relations with the United States? 
  [Yeltsin] I believe that our relations with the United 
States 
are developing in a very stable, precisely coordinated fashion, 
and in a manner that truly befits partners. However, there will 
of course be a certain adjustment, especially with regard to the 
social sphere. We consider that, in contrast to Vancouver, we 
will not bank on the humanitarian sphere and direct social aid. 
That is our business. What we are asking the American side to 
do is to open up the American market, to lift restrictions, to 
help us with our debts, to assist in supporting reforms by 
helping with the conversion of military enterprises, and so on. 
We are not asking for direct social aid, because the people of 
the United States themselves need such social support. It would 
be simply frivolous to help with unemployment in Russia without 
guaranteeing employment in their own country. 
  We think therefore that this is our affair, and from these 
forms of support, the restructuring of the debt, the structure 
of changes in the economy, we will begin to look for some kind 
of social guarantees for our working people in order to reduce 
poverty, the level of poverty that exists in our country today. 
  [Gautness] Helen Gautnuss. Do you mean that you are going to 
retreat from shock therapy a little, to act slightly more 
moderately in order to help people? 
  [Yeltsin] No, we shall continue to act in a resolute manner 
when it comes to reform, and in this respect the President of 
the United States is agreeable to support such a course. 
  [Clinton] Could I respond just briefly to the last two 
questions from my perspective? I commend President Yeltsin for 
his adherence to continuing the path of economic reforms. If 
you look at 1993 as compared to 1992, if you consider to what 
extent the deficit was reduced as a percentage of gross income, 
if you consider how inflation fell and money stabilized, I think 
that very good progress has been made in work on including the 
Russian economy into the global economic system. We had very 
long talks about what can be done, what kind of assistance the 
United States could provide to recognize that there are certain 
difficulties connected with these changes, and to let the 
Russian people know that efforts are being made to solve these 
questions. 
  But I also have to tell you that I believe that people 
(?will 
see the benefits) they could not see last year. This year, as 
investments and trade grow and people in the world see that the 
president is tackling this issue seriously, I think that 
advantages will be created. This is linked to developing a 
system of social support and job training, and all this should 
be created. I think that this will be a great help in many 
respects. 
  In addition, I would like to say in response to your 
question 
that, in my view, President Yeltsin has been, it appears, 
criticized in some quarters for relations with America, the 
implication being that we are somehow trying to direct the 
course of Russian policy. This is not true. The people of 
Russia themselves should determine their future. The only thing 
I would like to do is to say that if we share common values, a 
vision of the future, dreams of political and economic freedom, 
and respect for neighboring countries, I would like to be an 
equal partner because I believe that this is a great country, 
and that the whole world -- and Europe in particular -- are 
interested in Russian reforms succeeding. So I must say that 
our relationships with Russia have been absolutely correct all 
this time, although some people are trying to characterize them 
wrongly. 
  I have come here as a friend and partner. We have our own 
problems in the country, [passage indistinct]. We should be 
partners and Russia should determine its own future. 
  [ITAR-TASS correspondent Sizov] I have a question to both 
presidents. During the Brussels visit the Russian president and 
the Russian side addressed NATO and the United States with a 
request to exert more influence on Ukraine over the issue of 
nuclear weapons. How far have Russia's hopes been justified with 
the signing of agreements just now at the talks which have taken 
place in Moscow with the president of Ukraine? Thank you. 
  [Yeltsin] Well, I think our hopes have been justified 
extremely quickly. Today an agreement was signed with Ukraine 
on the destruction of all nuclear weapons in Ukraine and on 
their transportation to Russia to be destroyed there. Of 
course, as concerns the uranium, we should offer compensation 
and give fuel uranium for weapon-grade uranium. We agree with 
this, since we will also be processing weapon-grade uranium into 
fuel uranium with American help. 
  Given that an agreement was signed today on uranium, I 
believe that today the agreement with Ukraine, the trilateral 
agreement signed by the three presidents, is a historic decision 
in which not only Russia but the United States, and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton personally, have played a major role. 
  [Clinton] I am fully satisfied with this agreement. I want 
to compliment President Kravchuk again because I believe he has 
really shown great interest in obtaining security for his 
country, which has become stronger and which after this 
agreement will become stronger economically over the next years, 
due to the fact that investors will support this decision to be 
a non-nuclear state. Just like [passage indistinct] this was, 
after all, President Yeltsin's proposal that we establish this 
trilateral process. I have enjoyed working on this, we worked 
on it intensly, Vice President Gore worked on it, and of course 
our whole team worked on it. I assure you that I will 
personally continue to work on this intensly. I think that a 
strong and independent Ukraine is very important for the 
creation of an integrated Europe, which we are working on in our 
partnership. 
  [Unidentified correspondent in English] A question for both 
presidents. President Yeltsin, you have undertaken today, and 
President Clinton has agreed, to encourage and continue economic 
reforms on a large scale, but time demands that institutions be 
created which can soften the effects of these reforms. The last 
elections showed that 15 percent of those elected support this 
policy. How can this policy be continued, bearing in mind the 
opposition there will be in parliament? President Clinton, 
without direct aid, what can international institutions do to 
help President Yeltsin? 
  [Yeltsin] First of all I do not agree with your figures that 
15 percent of Russians support the reforms; that is not true, 
absolutely not true. It is necesary to see how people voted for 
the Constitution. The Constitution is the support for the 
reforms, not individual personalities, not voting for individual 
parties and blocs, but voting for the Constitution which 
determines the future of Russia and its reform. This is where 
the citizens of Russia determined their choice, and that was 
around 60 percent. 
  As regards support by world institutions: We talked about 
this. Incidentally we discussed about 30 or more issues -- 
internal issues, Russian ones, U.S. ones, bilateral relations, 
international relations, and so on, security issues -- a large 
spectrum of issues. And I believe that, of course, the fact that 
a package was adopted in Tokyo, and that unfortunately the G-7 
has a very inert attitude toward implementing this decision -- 
this is the main thing. [sentence as heard] 
  Bill Clinton has personally fulfilled his obligations, what 
he promised in Vancouver. He has practically handed over the 
first package -- 1.6 billion. The second package of 
approximately the same amount, which is passing through 
Congress, will also be provided in 1994 and 1995. As regards 
the pledges of the G-7, the seven countries, here unfortunately 
the situation is significantly more complicated. They made a 
decision, but there has only been minimum implementation. This 
pains me, and it also pains my friend, Bill Clinton. 
  [Clinton] Let me respond to your question. I think it is 
important to tell you what we are doing. First of all, the 
agreement on uranium is extremely important. It guarantees a 
steady stream of commercial...[pauses] It is a business deal. 
It guarantees that money will be received each year for a long 
time to come. Now in addition to that, I have asked for $900 
million in aid from the 1995 budget, and if you take that 
together with the 2.5 billion in the second package for all the 
republics of the former Soviet Union -- most of it will go to 
Russia -- there will be more than a billion dollars in aid in 
each of the next two years. 
  In addition, we have reached agreement with the G-7 
countries 
on a number of other things which I think will help as well. We 
are opening an office here headed by an American, a G-7 office 
to make sure that all the commitments involved are complied 
with. We are going to work toward trying to get the funds -- I 
am confident we will -- to Russia's energy customers, so that 
they can pay their bills for the energy that Russia is 
providing. It is a business deal that will give them a 
considerable amount of money. 
  We offer technical assistance, all that the president has 
requested, and we are trying to help to provide for social 
services, [word indistinct] scenario, and the program for staff 
training in order to soften the negative consequences of 
reforms. This week we are again starting to allocate money 
[words indistinct] to the fund for the development of small 
enterprises. I would also like to stress that the willingness of 
President Yeltsin to continue along the path of economic 
reforms, it seems to me, is viewed positively by the 
international financial institutions. This will make it 
possible to free billions of dollars of assistance within the 
next couple of months for investments. 
  Following Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown's visit in 
March, there will be a significant increase in trade and 
investments on the part of the United States. So we intend to 
work very hard on this. It seems to me that this will affect 
[word indistinct] the citizen of Russia. The point is that 
there is always a gap between the time when a decision is made 
and the time when people can actually feel the effect of this 
decision on their lives. This is exactly what I was trying to 
explain during my walkabout yesterday while shaking hands with 
Muscovites. All of us who care very much about the potential of 
this country and the greatness of this country must be 
interested in this. I think that all this will be felt in the 
life of the average Russian citizen. I think that this will 
have a significant effect in the next few years. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Vesti, Russian television. 
Millions of Russian viewers are watching us and smiling. Boris 
Nikolayevich, I have a question for you. Taking into account 
the composition of the new Russian Parliament, can one envisage 
certain problems with the ratification of agreements and accords 
signed with Western partners? It might be that the Parliament 
will toughen its foreign policy. Do you, as president of the 
Russian Federation, feel that the situation restricts and 
complicates your relations with the United States and its allies 
in the face of this fact? 
  [Yeltsin] I do not think we have that sort of Parliament. 
This Parliament is wiser, more intellectual, and more 
experienced. I believe that the upper chamber will, generally 
speaking, pursue the line taken by the president and the 
Government, while the State Duma will gradually reach that 
position and realize that to drag out and fail to ratify major 
international treaties and agreements -- such as that concerning 
the destruction of chemical weapons and so on -- is simply to 
show disrespect for their own people. I also hope that the 
members of Parliament will remember, as I said in my message, 
that they are envoys of the people and that the people have told 
them how they ought to behave. They ought to conduct themselves 
with a high standard of political culture. Of course, our 
parliamentary system is young, but I believe nevertheless that 
it will operate constructively. 
  [Bennett] Nancy Bennett from AP. President Clinton, what are 
your impressions after experiencing Moscow firsthand? What is 
your assessment of the threat the ultra-nationalist movement 
poses to the movement for democracy? 
  [Clinton] Well, those who are in the Parliament are, after 
all, there as a result of democracy. I think these are two 
separate things, because you have to respect the democratic 
process and in every democratic process no one is satisfied with 
the outcome of all elections, I can tell you that. In that 
sense, I do not think they present a threat to the democratic 
process. Now I think what is happening here is that Russia, 
which is and has been a very great country for a very long time, 
is doing what countries are required to do at some point or 
other -- I mean redefining what greatness means and creating a 
vision for the future. When times are difficult, and the 
Russian people have been through some difficult times, there are 
always, in every age and time, people who can generate some 
support by defining greatness in terms of the past. But in the 
end, the only people who achieve real success are those who 
define greatness in terms of the future. That is why I believe 
that the reformist movement will prevail. If you look at the 
nature of the global economy, and if you look at the processes 
that move and change people's lives, I think history has always 
sided with the reformers. I also believe what would happen is 
that you can have some interesting discussions in that Duma, and 
I keenly follow the news at the moment. It is nice to be in a 
place where some other president is having problems with his 
parliament. [laughter] 
  President Yeltsin has made an important point here: When 
these issues are discussed, and when you move from the rhetoric 
of the campaign, which is always abstract, to the real problems 
of real people, there is a possibility of a new consensus 
emerging. The only thing that I would say to all the people in 
this new Duma is that you have enormous opportunities and 
responsibility. You are the first ones in your country to be 
elected constitutionally and democratically. You must be ready 
to listen to Russia and to tackle issues. I would not think 
that America and other countries should dramatize it. I think 
it is a start of a great and exiting path, and we should wish 
you all the best and see what happens. 
  [Moderator Kostikov] The protocol circumstances force us to 
reduce the time of the news conference. So, one last question 
each from the Russian and American sides. Go ahead, Markov, 
RIA-Novosti. 
  [Markov] Vladimir Markov, Russian Information 
Agency-Novosti. 
I would like you to make your point of view, Boris Nikolayevich, 
and yours, President Clinton, more specific as regards the 
latest decisions of the NATO Council on the possible eventual 
entry of other states into the organization, particularly those 
that are contiguous with Russia. Do you see the possibility of 
Russia itself ever joining NATO, and on what terms? 
  [Yeltsin] I think that the initiative of President Bill 
Clinton and some Europeans not to accept anyone into NATO 
country by country, but to declare everyone partners in order to 
preserve peace and security, is a good formula, since drawing 
one more line, dividing once again into black and white as the 
saying goes, is no good. It is another matter that the moment 
will come, at some time, when possibly both Russia and all the 
others will unite, but precisely together, in one packet as 
people say, and that will then ensure security for everyone. I 
am also against dismemberment one by one, and for that reason I 
very actively support the initiative of the U.S. President as 
regards Partnership for Peace. 
  [Clinton] The whole idea behind the Partnership for Peace 
was 
to develop a post-Cold War mechanism for countries that share 
the same commitments -- in this case a commitment to respect the 
territorial borders of their neighbors, a commitment to civilian 
control over the military, a commitment to joint planning and 
training and military exercise -- that these countries could 
work together aiming towards eventual NATO membership, if they 
so wish, and if that is the direction that appears to be the 
best for security of the post-Cold War world. That is, NATO 
members clearly foresaw this possibility of such an expansion, 
but this Partnership for Peace is a real thing now, and even now 
we are inviting everyone, we have invited all the former Soviet 
republics, all the Warsaw Pact nations and the other non-NATO 
members in Europe, to be part of the Partnership for Peace. 
  All were told that this would also lead to eventual 
membership in NATO, but our objective is to create for the first 
time in the history of nation states, an undivided, united 
Europe, united around political freedom, economic freedom, 
military cooperation and respect for one another's borders -- 
something that has never happened before. I think we share that 
vision, and I think that we have a particular responsibility to 
work towards that vision. 
  [Moderator Kostikov] This will be the last question. Rita 
Braver, CBS. 
  [Braver] President Clinton, did you discuss the subject of 
Bosnia and what was the nature of this discussion? Does 
President Yeltsin agree with NATO's stated intention of carrying 
out air strikes if the situation does not improve in Sarajevo 
and Bosnia? 
  [Clinton] First I asked the NATO representatives, my NATO 
colleagues, to discuss this question with great precision. I 
want to describe with great precision what they voted for. They 
voted to reaffirm that air strikes could be considered if 
Sarajevo is in very great danger, in the sense that the United 
Nations is unable to work in Bosnia, if the United Nations is 
unable to work in Sarajevo, if there are no hospitals, if there 
is no humanitarian aid, medicines, and so on. They voted to ask 
the armed forces to consider what can be done on the basis of 
the air force in order to help the transfer of troops from 
Srebrenica and the opening of Tuzla for humanitarian aims. 
  I would like to stress this because there is great 
understanding and a resolution directly aimed at creating a 
peace treaty for Bosnia. All of this is aimed at helping the UN 
mission and also to preserve people's lives until the sides 
conclude measures. 
  I think that I should probably allow President Yeltsin to 
speak for himself about what NATO has done with regard to 
Bosnia. We have different points of view on Bosnia. Yesterday 
evening we discussed whether there is anything else our sides 
can do independently or together to put an end to this conflict; 
that is, we want people to stop killing each other and conclude 
a sensible peace under which they can live normally, even if 
just for their children's sake. We did not reach any final 
results. Quite a frank conversation took place and several 
things were said and I think that we can work together. 
  A more detailed account may give rise to a central hope. I 
think that we had a very honest and frank conversation. [passage 
indistinct] It is very important because these air strikes have 
become a sort of psychological test. NATO enumerated three 
possible spheres of military actions. All of this aimed at 
helping the UN mission. This cannot, in the final analysis, 
resolve the conflict. The NATO leaders said that in the final 
analysis the sides must, themselves, reach agreement on this. 
President Yeltsin and I discussed whether we can do anything to 
help a possible decision. We reached no final results but a 
basis was created for further discussions. 
  [Moderator Kostikov] Thank you, gentlemen, the news 
conference is over. Thank you. Goodbye. 
  [Clinton] Boris said he agreed with my characterization of 
our conversation. 
  [Yeltsin] If you are dissatisfied because I did not reply, 
well, in the first place, you put your question to President 
Clinton and not to me. But to touch on my opinion, then we 
really did have a discussion. There are some differences 
between us but, as I said in my speech, we are not in agreement 
on everything and everywhere. We really do have differences, but 
the most important thing is that there was goodwill, there was 
partnership to find common decisions, and I believe that we 
shall find common decisions. Thank you.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Agureyev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- "Russian can play a 
critical role (in "Partnership for Peace")," President Clinton 
said in an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Friday [14 
January]. He was speaking straight after addressing the Russian 
people from the Ostankino Television studios. 
  Clinton said Russia could do its part "in two ways - first 
of 
all, the Russian military are still one of the best trained and 
best armed militaries in the world. So, for Russia and the 
United States to participate means all these other military 
armies, particularly from the smaller countries, get a chance to 
do planning, and training, and actual exercises at a much higher 
level, than they would otherwise. 
  "In other words, it's a big thing. It increases the capacity 
of their armed forces and their sense of security. 
  "Also, if Russia joins the "Partnership for Peace", one of 
the conditions for joining is saying, "We promise to be good 
neighbors. We respect the terrritorial boundaries of all the 
other countries in the "Partnership for Peace". So it takes 
away one of the big fears that you hear in some countries or in 
the Baltics or wherever. [no end quotation mark as received] 
  Responding to a question about what impressions of Russia he 
will take home, the President said, "I think it's a wonderful 
country and I have had a wonderful trip. And I think you're 
going to have a great future. I know this is a tough time, but 
you'll work through it. You'll figure it out."

  [Text] In answer to Interfax's question concerning Prime 
Minister Chernomyrdin's reaction to Gaydar's decision, the 
leader of the government's press service, Valentin Sergeyev, 
said that it was "calm". According to him, the first deputy 
premier's decision not to join the reorganized government was 
not unexpected. 
  "Evidently it's extremely hard, and maybe politically 
illogical, to be the leader of a parliamentary faction and serve 
as first deputy prime minister at the same time," Sergeyev said. 
"The issue of whether Gaydar should be the leader of 
parliamentary faction or first deputy premier has been raised 
more than once, and now Gaydar made his choice." 
  Chernomyrdin did nothing to nudge Gaydar toward taking this 
decision, Sergeyev stressed, because Gaydar was appointed first 
deputy premier several months ago at Chernomyrdin's initiative. 
  As Sergeyev said, Gaydar's leaving the government will not 
alter the policy of reforms pursued by the Cabinet led by 
Chernomyrdin. 
  "The government has been, and will be, reformist. The course 
of reforms underlies the government's program for 1994- 1995 
approved by President Yeltsin," he said. 
  In answer to Interfax's question as to who may replace 
Gaydar 
in the government, Sergeyev said with reference to Viktor 
Chernomyrdin that "this complicated question will be resolved by 
the president together with the government's leadership".

<F P=106> [News conference by President Leonid Kravchuk with </F>
unidentified reporters at Borispil Airport in Kiev on 14 January 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Can you say if the document that was 
signed by the three presidents in the Kremlin today will have to 
be ratified by the Ukrainian parliament? Will it help resolve 
the issue of disarmament in general, both in Europe and on CIS 
territory? Is this primarily a new step or not? Third, to what 
extent will it help Ukraine's economy? 
  [Kravchuk] The document is a continuation of the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council resolutions. If you recall, the reservations 
that it put forth were about compensation for tactical and 
strategic nuclear weapons, their technical maintenance, 
financial and technical aid, and security guarantees. These, 
approximately, were the main reservations of the Supreme 
Council. When you read that document, and it will be published, 
you will find that all of those demands were met. In other 
words, we can positively state that the executive branch has not 
been acting contrary to the Supreme Council resolutions but 
acting toward fulfilling the reservations put forth by the 
Supreme Council. I would like to emphasize this fact so that no 
one thinks, as some try to imply, that the president and the 
parliament were following their own separate courses. We did 
satisfy the reservations. I said in the past -- and I am 
confirming it now -- that we must join the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. This is my deep conviction, because 
everyone has already joined it -- Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, 
and 131 countries. This is a normal step for Ukraine. This is 
why I hope that when we inform our parliament about our actions 
since December... [pauses] a very difficult time for Ukraine, 
which had to withstand pressure from all over the world. Not 
everyone understood our steps, not everyone understood our 
actions and there were grounds for this. This, I think, is a 
matter of principle. Now about your question as to who this 
document will serve. Both the talks with the U.S. President in 
Kiev and the trilateral talks have confirmed one irrefutable 
truth -- problems can be resolved only on the path of 
compromises and agreements. No reservations, no guarantees 
expressed in documents or agreements or declarations or anything 
else will be realized if one or another state follows the policy 
of confrontation instead of compromise. If, for instance, 
Ukraine... [pauses] now they say that Ukraine has been brought 
to its knees. This is absurd. First, Ukraine has come out of 
the situation with credit. We will be compensated and given 
assistance; we will be respected politically and in other ways. 
If we had opposed the adopted course and stood in the way of 
nuclear disarmament -- and it was anticipated -- if Ukraine had 
failed to fulfill its obligations, it would have blocked the 
further development of nuclear disarmament. It would have 
blocked it. START II depends on the resolution of the START I 
issue. I hope that there will be START III as well, and the 
final goal will be achieved in the total dismantling of nuclear 
weapons on our planet. Thus, Ukraine, having resolved this 
issue, unblocked nuclear disarmament for the whole world, for 
all of humanity. By taking this step Ukraine testified to the 
fact that there are no separate paths for Ukraine -- it follows 
the path of civilization and all human interest. This is the 
main issue for all the European and world community. By taking 
this step we have raised Ukraine's political prestige and image, 
we have confirmed that Ukraine's policies are predictable. 
  Finally, there is one more point. Whatever they might say, 
there is an arrangement of forces in the world, an arrangement 
along political lines. And today, great powers are standing as 
the cornerstones of these forces and lines, including the United 
States of America. Relations among states develop depending on 
the influence made by these great powers. Whether one likes it 
or not, that's the way it is. Ambitions are out of place here. 
This is not a policy but just the basic way of thinking. If we 
-- contrary to the world's civilized development -- failed to 
accept compromises...[pauses] it does not mean that we have been 
humiliated; we have compromised, but the other party has also 
made compromises. Thus, we established normal relations. 
  Let us imagine that Ukraine opposes the good will of other 
states, the good will of the world-wide development of nuclear 
disarmament, and the interests of the world states. However, 
not just their interests, but the common interests of mankind -- 
nuclear disarmament. This is important, because we can take 
into account the interests of the state. However, it will not 
coincide with the interests of mankind. 
  What will be the international opinion of Ukraine? We, three 
presidents, of the United States, Ukraine, and Russia -- have 
reached an agreement and solved the issue in a civilized manner, 
in line with the reservations and the interests of the people of 
Ukraine. There are also economic perspectives opening for us; 
this was mentioned by President Clinton in Kiev. In other 
words, Ukraine is seen as a state that took those brakes off, 
enabling cooperation with the United States, with international 
financial organizations, and with Russia. Our acting prime 
minister, Yukhym Leonidovych Zvyahilskyy, and Defense Minister 
Radetskyy met today with their Russian counterparts and resolved 
a wide range of specific issues. Because, this [as heard] is the 
main barrier. Why is it the main barrier? Take for example, 
the military and technical side of the whole matter. We have 
nuclear weapons that we inherited, but we do not produce. 
Everyone, who understands at least something about this is 
aware that we are not capable of servicing them, providing 
maintenance. We just cannot keep them as a heavy burden on our 
shoulders. We cannot maintain them with due responsibility for 
our future and the future of our neighbors and all mankind. 
This has been proven by specialists and by everyone. Those who 
do not understand this are the ones who do not want to. 
  Who is servicing nuclear weapons today? Russia. Well, when 
the president of Russia says: If you want to have nuclear 
weapons, why should we service them? He is right, is he not? 
This is a military and technical aspect. Further, look at the 
aspect of the use of nuclear weapons. Everybody knows it, and 
our minister said this, that some time in 1999 the service life 
of the nuclear weapons would expire. Excuse me, I am telling 
the entire nation that no reservations, no resolutions or edicts 
will prevent [as heard] the president, the defense minister, or 
the government when the service life of these horrible weapons 
expires. We are obliged to remove them because they are more 
dreadful than all the Chernobyl-type accidents taken together. 
And those people who accuse the executive authority today -- 
they either do not understand this or take advantage so as to 
confirm their particular policy, their particular course. 
  There is yet another aspect. Take, for example, most 
superficial things. They say that recoding is possible, that 
something can be done to retain the nuclear arsenal as a 
deterrent. First, when it comes to the issue of recoding, it 
cannot be an abstract code. A question arises: Who is to be 
given the new code? Well, you ask those extreme forces -- they 
will tell you who -- I do not want to repeat the words. But the 
one who is to be given the new code -- will he wait until we 
finish recoding? What if someone would like it to be done, 
suddenly? 
  Second, nuclear weapons require a nuclear industry. Without 
it these are not nuclear weapons. If all this is summed 
up...[pauses] and also it is necessary to have testing grounds 
to carry out tests. We do not have these. There is a whole 
complex of problems facing Ukraine. 
  The situation can be assessed as follows: We have nuclear 
weapons. You do not touch us because if you come and do 
something suddenly, they can explode spontaneously, therefore 
you risk dying, together with us. In other words, this is an 
inhuman act. We have a dangerous thing in our hands which may 
explode. If it explodes and an opponent dies, it is his 
business, he himself makes his way to such an end. But he wants 
millions of people to die, our neighbors included. Who can put 
up with this? Who can regard this as normal? I cannot stop 
wondering if this is a political game, if this is an election 
game -- one can understand this somehow. But it is necessary to 
sit down at a table, place facts here and facts there. If these 
are facts they are facts. But if these are mere words and 
appeals, and deception of the people who experienced the 
Chernobyl catastrophe -- who knows what it is -- if these are 
attempts to put our people in jeopardy, presenting the people of 
the young state -- which is just in the making -- as a monster 
to the whole world, so that they would not recognize it in 
Europe and the world. This is not serious. This is why I think 
that this is our political, economic, humanistic victory. 
  This is our victory. Not mine, not Ukraine's but our common 
victory. The victory of Ukraine, Russia, the United States of 
America, the victory of the entire world. If we all maintain 
friendship and normal relations with Russia and the United 
States and others, we will have our guarantees. But to oppose 
this, and exhibiting our high ambitions and proceeding from 
postulates having nothing to do with the understanding of the 
situation may be dangerous. 
  I am happy with one matter: Those particularly vocal about 
this are a minority and they demonstrate their total ignorance, 
and second, presenting themselves as patriots they, as a matter 
of fact, do not help Ukraine with their actions, to put it 
mildly. 
  [Reporter, HOLOS UKRAYINY newspaper] Leonid Makarovych, I 
have a question. The answer to it concerns many people: Will 
our state's national security be consolidated after today's 
signing [of the trilateral agreement]? If so, what changes for 
the better can be expected? 
  [Kravchuk] It will be consolidated in the following aspect: 
We have already experienced a completely different attitude 
toward Ukraine--from Russia, for example. You have seen a 
different attitude toward us by the United States during the 
U.S. President's visit. I also have reports that NATO countries 
have come to understand Ukraine after receiving the bit of 
information which we still have to think over today. This way, 
the international environment and our neighbors have accepted 
Ukraine as a state that does not want evil but wants to live in 
friendship, partnership, and cooperation with other countries. 
This is the first point. Second, you understand that it is an 
illusion to say that the weapons we have owned were a deterrent. 
I have already told you about this deterrence; this is just a 
danger of deterrence rather than the deterrent. Because we are 
unable to produce, operate, restore, or service them--because we 
have nothing: neither industry nor testing grounds--what kind of 
deterrence can we talk about? This is an illusion of 
deterrence, but it was hammered into people's heads. The 
weapons have not been a guarantee of security, but a source of 
threat--and not only to Ukraine. This way, having won support 
from certain people and states, including powerful states, we 
have obtained security. Security does not mean signed 
documents. You know how many pacts have already been signed in 
history, how many other documents have been signed. However, 
they have been insufficient because a state policy has been 
against what has been signed. We want our policy to be 
implemented in real terms, in line with our civilized and 
anticipated concept, which has been approved. I am convinced 
that we have obtained security and opened the path to economic 
cooperation. We have also achieved a state's image. We have 
acted in line with our Supreme Council, and I am convinced that 
the majority of the people of Ukraine want this. 
  [Reporter] At the recent news conference with Moldovan 
President Snegur you said something like this: The danger 
coming from the revanchist forces in Russia has increased. If 
such factors in the policy of our neighbor dominate, how do you 
think the signed agreement can be fulfilled and what mechanism 
of ensuring our national security do you see as the head of 
state? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, first, I said this a little differently. I 
said I felt anxiety. [passage indistinct] However, the words 
danger and anxiety have subtle differences in connotation. 
Danger means that this is somewhere here... [pauses] As far as 
anxiety is concerned, it is known to me, and every person must 
feel it when complicated processes are under way. However, I 
will repeat that this is not a state policy but a political 
trend. Political trends have occurred in history, you know 
about that. Let us take the last 300 years, and we will find 
different trends in all spheres of social life: spiritual and 
political spheres, and this is a normal democratic phenomenon. 
However, such a tendency must not become a state policy. To 
prevent this, we must cooperate first of all with Russia. There 
are 205 million of us in Russia and Ukraine. Difficult processes 
are under way in our country too. One should not attribute them 
only to Russia. They are everywhere. Revanchists, nationalists, 
national patriots reveal themselves everywhere; they are coming 
out, because such is the time now. Let us prevent them from 
standing in the way of progressive development. This is a 
democratic way. However, to prevent this from becoming a state 
policy is our responsibility and our common concern. When we 
say that we have signed an agreement by three presidents today, 
this speaks volumes. Normal cooperation begins from this point: 
politically, economically, and spiritually. Those forces that 
today are in opposition will remain there. Opposition must 
exist, and there is nothing scary about this. However, one must 
not allow aggressiveness, and antipeople, antihumanitarian 
moods, hidden under patriotism, to dominate in society. We must 
not allow this. That is to say, I feel anxiety but I also have 
hope, because 14 January is a new page of understanding our 
problems, and a page comprised of new steps. I believe that 
these steps are aimed against what makes all of us apprehensive. 
  [Reporter] At a brief news conference today the President 
of the United States of America noted that by signing the 
documents Ukraine has acquired...[pauses] has become more 
influential, has acquired more significance among countries of 
the world, and that many states will now cooperate with Ukraine. 
Moreover, Kostikov, press secretary of Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin, informed journalists that Great Britain is supposedly 
giving us security guarantees already. Is this true? 
  [Kravchuk] Great Britain has given us security guarantees 
previously, but they were not formalized [ne oformleni]. You 
remember when I visited Great Britain: In the treaty I signed 
with the prime minister of Great Britain, it was noted that 
Great Britain--I do not remember the exact formula [word 
indistinct] -- grants Ukraine guarantees from the point of view 
of national security. However, this was an abstract formula. 
Now, the interpretation in the documents we signed is that both 
Great Britain and France I hope, and others will join in with 
this. But I want to repeat: Life is life. There are our 
hopes, opinions, our philosophical understanding of life in this 
world and society, but there are also practical actions. If we 
act practically and in an understandable way, we will in the end 
understand ourselves. I see that we take many steps that are 
difficult to explain. I will frankly say that December was 
possibly the most difficult time in our life for Ukraine, 
because the issue was real, not ephemeral or illusionary. The 
issue was the real international isolation of Ukraine, and this 
meant... I do not even want to use these words. But, for 
example, under a slogan of ultrapatriotism, all this is 
forgotten and people are deceived that Ukraine can survive in 
isolation or confrontation, or by conducting a policy aimed 
against states [word indistinct] and the interests of mankind. 
This is the truth, and everyone knows it. Excuse me, not 
everyone. Those who want to know -- know this. Those who do 
not want to know, or those who know but think differently, will 
never understand anyone. Due to that, this is what I believe. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, you used the words abstract 
formula 
to describe the agreement (?and so on). However, the statement 
saying that we have gained friends such as the United States and 
Russia also sounds abstract. Will you specify how those 
agreements you signed in Moscow guarantee Ukraine's security. 
  [Kravchuk] First, let us put it this way. It is precisely 
noted that Russia and Ukraine [as heard] respect territorial 
integrity, the inviolability of borders, sovereignty, and 
independence of Ukraine. They respect and support Ukraine's 
independence, and this was stated by President Clinton. He 
always begins his speeches with the statement that Ukraine's 
independence is an important element of U.S. foreign policy. 
This is the first point. The second one is: If we join the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, those guarantees will acquire a 
more specific, I would say precise, nature, since today we are 
an undefined state. We have inherited nuclear weapons. We can 
neither use nor handle them, and I have talked about this, but 
we have not joined the treaty. What do we really want? Do we 
want to proliferate them or sell them? What do we want? The 
treaty has been joined by 131 countries. We must join the 
treaty. Then, the guarantees will acquire real meaning. 
Because they might ask us: Why do you want guarantees if you 
are a nuclear state? You can attack someone, not be attacked. 
This is an illusion, a nonsense that has developed in 
political... [pauses] I would say that this is political 
dualism, of which everyone is sick and tired. Only one who 
never wants to see anything does not see this. This is the 
point. Therefore, it is noted there. Additionally, an entire 
chapter was devoted to the economic situation, which gives 
Ukraine a real opportunity to join Europe's economic structure, 
including with Russia--(?no, not including)--but in the east 
with Russia, and with other states. An economic space is 
opening up, an international financial space. We are received 
as a state that fulfills its obligations, which were announced, 
by the way, during its independence. I would say that it is not 
prestigious for a state to jump from one point to another, even 
more so, in such a delicate and global sphere as nuclear 
(?weapons). 
  [UNIAN correspondent] Do you think Ukraine, the United 
States, and Russia put a different value, I mean material value, 
on the nuclear weapons, which again will bring up the issue of 
disarmament? 
  [Kravchuk] I do not think so. The United States, Ukraine, 
and Russia will conduct a joint examination. In addition, we 
already have international estimates on this. This is in no way 
a new thing. Let us say, each kilogram of uranium, its quality, 
there are evaluations, then, subtract the cost for enrichment of 
uranium, and it will be all taken into account. Given the 
mutual desire, I see no problems here. We said the following: We 
fulfill our obligations and you fulfill your obligations. If 
one party stops fulfilling its obligations, then the other party 
automatically stops fulfilling its part. I said this plainly. 
According to the agreement, we, for example, withdraw strategic 
nuclear weapons, 200 warheads, then we automatically receive 
compensation and the compensation for the tactical nuclear 
weapons. If someone somewhere begins to manipulate, we will 
publish a relevant statement that we are being deceived, let us 
speak plainly. However, I hope that under the current consensus 
of three presidents -- and what we achieved -- three presidents 
have signed this agreement -- when I spoke with the U.S. 
leadership they said: Mr. President, we put our honor at 
stake; we put the authority of a great world power at stake. 
For us, it was the most important thing -- exactly what we were 
pressing for. Not because we do not trust Russia. Complex 
processes are going on in Russia, both political and economic 
ones, just like here. So we should reckon with the 
possibilities of collisions and problems. But this is the state 
today that can be a guarantor, both for us and Russia. We have 
entered this system of thinking, this system of creating, this 
system of understanding, which [word indistinct] for the benefit 
of Ukraine. 
  [Correspondent] What is the term for the withdrawal of 
nuclear weapons and what is the compensation for the strategic 
and tactical nuclear weapons? In addition, are our debts for 
oil and gas to be canceled? 
  [Kravchuk] There are two constituents of this issue. The 
question of tactical nuclear weapons will soon be examined by 
experts from the United States, Russia, and Ukraine; they will 
evaluate the price, taking into account the (?weight) of what 
was transferred by us in 1991-92, and afterward we will 
determine the forms of compensation. Our debts will be taken 
into account, too. Compensation for strategic nuclear weapons 
has been determined long ago. The nuclear weapons will be 
withdrawn, say, these 200 warheads, their weight taken into 
account, and Ukraine will receive heat-generating elements for 
nuclear power plants. That is, we agreed as follows: We 
estimate that we will be secured... [pauses] for four or five 
years, will we not? [Kravchuk asks some of his aides] Thus, we 
will have free uranium for our power plants over a period of 
seven years. You should understand how important our power 
engineering is for us... [pauses] All this will be determined on 
the basis of the strict evaluations which will take into account 
our experience, as well as world experience. The term of the 
withdrawal will be adjusted depending on our capabilities. I 
have informed you that in 1999 the service life of all our 
warheads will come to an end. Is that so? [one of Kravchuk's 
aides replies "Yes"] [18 second passage indistinct] (?I would 
not have signed it) if the Supreme Council, say, (?does not now) 
ratify it [words indistinct]. I do not know. The service life 
of warheads [words indistinct] is coming up in March. And I 
know that the unforeseen could occur (?here) -- for Ukraine and 
for the world. (?So am I) going to look at this document? If I 
do not [word indistinct] it today, then I will be told tomorrow 
-- you work it out yourself. What sort of a state will we be in 
then? And who will understand us? What sort of civilized state 
and country, which (?like a savage) [words indistinct]. It is a 
terrible thing that our country brandishes its weapons and has 
no idea what to do with them. I am terrified to listen to some 
of our politicians who know nothing about politics, who do not 
want to know anything and do not want to take heed of anyone, 
and are driven only by their ambitions. Let me now read you a 
verse written by one of the members of the Ukrainian delegation 
wishing our country all the best. I will not name the author 
(?until afterwards). [Words indistinct] has written this verse. 
I want to speak about that [word indistinct], that spiritual, 
about that climate, which existed here when people could see 
that they had done something good for the state, for Ukraine. 
They did not give in, nor (?bend down), nor get down on their 
knees. When all were equal [words indistinct] it is obvious 
when someone is telling the truth and when [words indistinct] 
[Kravchuk reads the verse] 
  It is good. [words indistinct]. Normal people understand 
what has happened now. A page has been turned. A page of new 
thinking has been turned, a new attitude toward Ukraine. And if 
we act consistently, this page will be filled with [word 
indistinct] words. The main thing is that Ukraine has not [as 
heard] started on the road of the great desire of mankind -- to 
get rid of nuclear weapons. (?It was wanted all the time) that 
it becomes a brake and enters history just in this way. And 
those politicians, who are now shouting something different, let 
them listen to those people. I wish you all the best.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Semena report: "Crimea: Pro-Moscow Candidate Could </F>
Become President"] 
  [Text] Simferopol -- Over 80 percent of Crimea's voters 
took part in the 16 January elections of the republic's first 
president. 
  According to the preliminary figures of the Central 
Electoral 
Commission, the largest number of votes -- around 542,000 or 
approximately 38.5 percent -- went to Yuriy Meshkov, the 
candidate from the Republican Party of Crimea which belongs to 
the "Russia" electoral bloc. In second place, with about 17 
percent, is Nikolay Bahrov, an independent candidate and 
chairman of the Supreme Soviet. These two will run in the 
second round of voting which will be held in two weeks' time -- 
on 30 January. 
  None of the commentators expected such a success for Yuriy 
Meshkov. His rating in independent polls varied from 19 to 20 
percent, in contrast to which the rating of Leonid Hrach, the 
Communist Party of Crimea candidate, reached 40 percent whereas 
in fact he was supported by just 12.5 percent of the voters. 
  Meshkov, age 48, is a well-known political figure in Crimea. 
His mother is Ukrainian, his father is Russian. He graduated 
from Moscow University's Law Faculty. He worked as an 
investigator and a lawyer. He is a people's deputy and 
coordinator of the "Republic" deputies' group in the Crimean 
Supreme Soviet and a founder and chairman of the Republican 
Movement which later became the Republican Party of Crimea. 
  The main planks of his election platform are as follows: 
Lifting the moratorium on the referendum on the status of 
Crimea, the law on which was adopted by the Crimean parliament 
on the initiative of and under pressure from Meshkov and his 
comrades. He believes that the positive results of the 
referendum and Crimea's acquisition of state independence will 
make it possible to restore the republic's union with Russia. 
Meshkov intends to restore Crimea to the ruble area, give the 
inhabitants of the republic the right to dual citizenship, 
preserve a free medical service and education, and lead the 
fight against crime mainly by stepping up the penalties for all 
offenses. Meshkov advocates Russian status for Sevastopol and 
abolition of the act of 1954 [which transferred Crimea to the 
Ukraine]. He believes that the Black Sea Fleet must belong to 
Russia. Meshkov is against giving the Crimean Tatars a quota of 
deputies' seats in the future parliament of the autonomous 
formation. 
  Sergey Shuvaynikov, the Russian Party candidate supported by 
Zhirinovskiy, received 13.5 percent. 
  The results of the first stage of the elections in Crimea 
will undoubtedly provide food for thought for many people, and 
not only in Ukraine. Should they be viewed as the Crimeans' 
desire for a radical change in Crimea's status and state 
allegiance? Or is this just a protest against the general 
crisis in society which spontaneously developed into a vote 
against the man in power who personifies Ukraine more than 
Crimea itself? Kiev, meanwhile, can use the differences in 
Crimean and Ukrainian law to declare the elections unlawful and 
annul the results.

<F P=106> ["Comments by Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik on the </F>
Clinton-Yeltsin Meeting"; place and date not given -- received 
via Internet] 
  [Text] We are very pleased that the two presidents 
[Clinton and Yeltsin] agreed on the need for Russia to respect 
the sovereignty and independence of its neighbours. We are 
especially pleased by President Clinton's strong support for the 
withdrawal of Russian troops in early 1994. Meeting its 
international commitment to do so is, in my opinion, the best 
way to demonstrate Russia's sincerity in respecting Estonia's 
sovereignty and independence. After all, what country can be 
called sovereign and independent if foreign troops continue to 
be based on the territory against its will. On the issue of 
human rights, another topic to come up in the meetings between 
the two Presidents, Estonia is pleased to agree with the 
findings of the United States Department of State in its report 
of January 1993 as well as of the CSCE Commission of the United 
States Congress in its exhaustive study of the issue published 
in September 1993. Those reports found, along with over a dozen 
other international organizations, that Estonia belongs to that 
group of free nations where human rights are not violated. 
  I quite agree with the comments by President Yeltsin that 
double standards should not be applied to the question of human 
rights. We of course know that Russia has used human rights as 
a political tool. President Yeltsin's comments are clearly an 
attempt to sway international public opinion against Estonia 
and, as such, have nothing to do with the actual situation of 
Russians living in Estonia.

  [Text] Riga January 14 TASS -- The command of the Russian 
North-Western troops ordered Russian military in Latvia to open 
fire in case of new attacks on military objects, the 
north-western troops press-centre reported Friday. 
  Officers sent to settle conflict situation are to be 
accompanied by armed guards. Armed units on duty will protect 
military objects which do not have permanent guards. In order 
to avoid misunderstanding commanders of military units are to 
notify local authorities and residents about these measures. 
  The order was issued in connection with the incident, which 
took place in Latvia Monday, when four military objects were 
blockaded and two generals were arrested and delivered in 
manacles to the state border. 
  These actions "cast doubt on promises of Latvia about its 
intention to solve all the problems of Russian troops in Latvia 
in a civilized way, the ability of the Latvian state to control 
activities of local troops under their command",

  [Text] Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis views as 
provocative, an order issued by the command of the Northwestern 
Group of Russian Forces last week. The order allows the use of 
arms in case of attacks on, or other illegal actions toward 
Russian military personnel or military facilities. Ulmanis told 
a news conference this today, adding that such an action by the 
Russian side is not acceptable for him as president. Ulmanis 
believes that this step on the part of the command of the 
Northwestern Group of Forces is not a very correct reply to 
Ulmanis' correct action during the provocation of 10 January 
[when two Russian generals were detained by Latvians in Riga]. 
  As Igor Golin, the head of the press center of the 
Northwestern Group of Forces told the Baltic News Agency, the 
above-mentioned order will not be applicable in cases when 
Latvian border guards detain Russian military personnel who try 
to enter Latvia without the necessary documents. According to 
Golin, the order allows a person who guards a Russian military 
facility located in Latvia to use arms in case of an attack 
after a verbal warning or warning shot in the air, as it is 
provided by the Russian military rules.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas declared 
that his republic decided to seek membership in NATO least of 
all because it wants to separate itself from Russia by "an iron 
curtain." 
  "We have not set such a task and are ready to live in 
friendship and mutual understanding with Russia, Belarus, and 
other CIS states," Brazauskas stressed in an exclusive interview 
with Interfax. 
  Commenting on a recent statement by the Russian President's 
Spokesman, Vyacheslav Kostikov (who was puzzled by such a hasty 
step of the Lithuanian leadership and warned that "the expansion 
of NATO to include the countries situated close to Russia's 
borders can in the long run lead to military and political 
instability in the region so important for the fates of peace"), 
Brazauskas said that Vilnius would stay away from polemics with 
Moscow on the issue. Noting that Kostikov's statement was taken 
into account, the president called for careful analysis of 
Lithuania's decision to understand it properly. 
  "In our step, there is no element of confrontation with 
Russia or an attempt to organize confrontation along with other 
Baltic states," Brazauskas stressed. 
  He reported that he had addressed to NATO's Secretary 
General 
Manfred Woerner an application for membership after consulting 
all Seimas (parliament) factions, which backed up the move. "I 
must respect the parliament's view," he said. 
  Brazauskas warned against making a big stir of Lithuania's 
decision to send an official letter to Woerner. "We realize 
that such an application cannot be approved in Brussels soon or 
as an exception. Writing a letter to NATO today and expecting 
it to grant membership tomorrow would be naive," he noted. 
  The president welcomed the "Partnership for Peace" concept, 
endorsed at NATO's summit in Brussels earlier this month and 
stressed that through it Vilnius was going to promote 
cooperation with the alliance. 
  He disagreed with those who fear that the success of 
nationalists at the elections in Russia on December 12 was the 
decisive factor that prompted Lithuania's application to NATO. 
He recalled that Vilnius had taken the first steps in this 
direction as early as the beginning of last year. 
  "I do not see in our step any demonstration and desire to 
isolate ourselves. We are neighbors with Russia and we'll live 
side by side, all the more so since there is a unique situation 
with the Kaliningrad region of Russia," Brazauskas said. 
Although the region borders with Lithuania and Poland, it has 
no common border with the main territory of Russia. 
  "It is conceivable that a collective security system should 
cover the whole of Europe, and it seems to me that all states, 
Russia included, should come to realize that. All of us want 
peace rather than confrontation on the European continent," the 
Lithuanian president noted. 
  In his words, Lithuania's attitude towards Russia remains 
unchanged, "and we hope that Moscow will not change towards 
Vilnius either," Brazauskas said. 
  At the same time, he warned that if the Russian leadership 
fundamentally changed and so did its policy in the Baltic 
states, Vilnius would have to correct its actions.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 16 Jan--Speaking to foreign journalists, 
Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze called the 
Russian-U.S. talks in Moscow a significant stage in relations 
between the East and West in the post-Communist period. In his 
opinion, the visit by the U.S. President is an important event 
both for the United States and Russia, and for Europe and all 
the republics of the former Soviet Union. "I an grateful to 
Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton and also to NATO for the 
attention paid to Georgia," he stressed. 
  Touching upon the results of the second round of the Geneva 
talks on settling the conflict in Abkhazia, the head of state 
noted that a feasible minimum was achieved in Geneva. "A great 
deal will depend on the resolution of the UN Security Council 
that, in our opinion, should envisage guarantees for 
implementing the commitments," Shevardnadze said. What is 
meant, in particular, is the participation of the peacekeeping 
forces under the aegis of the United States, of observers, and 
of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. 
  The Georgian leader thinks that the consistent continuation 
of the UN policy in resolving the conflict will speed up the 
process of establishing peace in Abkhazia, taking into account 
the positive role of Russia and the interests of the United 
States, France, Britain, and other countries.

  [Text] In his interview with Interfax on Saturday head of 
Belarus' Foreign Ministry Petr Kravchenko declared that Belarus 
hopes to solve the issue on a just monetary compensation for 
uranium to be extracted from nuclear warheads, which Russia 
intends to sell to America, during U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
visit to Minsk. 
  He explained that "in contrast to Ukraine, Belarus does not 
claim for low enriched uranium which is used as fuel for atomic 
power stations. We have no nuclear reactors and power plants. 
Belarus pretends for monetary compensation for this uranium -- 
he underlined -- the American party has given its backing to 
this approach and President Clinton will fix it legally." 
  In Kravchenko's words, the draft of a corresponding 
agreement 
which is expected to be signed on Saturday in Minsk stipulates 
that "Russia will not be able to sell low enriched uranium to 
the United States without preliminary coordination with Belarus, 
Ukraine, and Kazakhstan," said Kravchenko. 
  According to the minister, the visit of the American 
president to Minsk is a historic event. "The visit has broken 
Belarus' obscurity in the world once and for ever. From now on 
Belarus has a chance to be represented in the world as a small 
democratic civilized state with its deep national traditions," 
he said. 
  Kravchenko believes that the Belarusian-American summit 
"helps to correct the disbalance which has been in our bilateral 
relations." "Earlier cooperation between two countries was 
restricted to military strategic problems and problems of 
refugees," he said. 
  The minister stressed the importance of the treaty on 
security of American investments in the Belarusian economy which 
is to be signed in the course of Clinton's visit to Minsk. 
  According to the republican Foreign Ministry, in 1993 the 
volume of turnover between Belarus and United States was $125 
Mn. "In 1994 this number will increase by 10 times after 
signing of the treaty," believes the minister. 
  He reminded that in February 1993 Belarus was granted the 
most favored nation regime in trade with the United States. "It 
means that tariffs higher than common ones will not be imposed 
on deliveries of Belarusian goods to the United States. In 
addition, in some cases Belarusian goods will be entirely 
relieved of any customs tariffs," indicated Kravchenko. 
  In his words, Belarus hopes to receive an assistance from 
the 
United States totalling "several tens of million dollars in 
addition to those $76 [figure as received] as it has already 
received according to the Nunn-Lugar law." "This funds will be 
channelled to prevent transportation of contraband uranium from 
Russia to the Western Europe by transit via Belarus and to solve 
export problems and to re-train retired officers," he said.

  [Excerpts] After the end of the visit by U.S. President 
Bill Clinton to the Republic of Belarus, the government 
delegation headed by Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav 
Shushkevich, and the chairman of the Council of Ministers of the 
Republic of Belarus, Vyacheslav Kebich, held a news conference 
for republican and foreign journalists. In this news bulletin 
we present a report on this event. 
  [Begin recording] [Shushkevich] Ladies and gentlemen, I am 
pleased with the results of the visit. [passage omitted] 
  [Kebich, in Russian] I should like to say that the 
government 
took an active part in setting up the program of the visit, and 
this question was agreed upon personally between Stanislav 
Stanislavavich [Shushkevich] and me. The government commission 
was headed by Mikalay Dzmitryevich Myasnikovich -- he is here -- 
and the visit was well organized. We discussed many topics. 
[passage omitted] [indistinct passage] 
  [Shushkevich, in Russian] First of all, I want to note that 
the question of compensation for the (?fissionable) material 
being removed was raised during the talks for a third time. We 
received an assurance during the talks with Senators Lugar and 
Nunn, then in talks with Mr. Christopher. Today the position 
was categorically confirmed by the U.S. side. This position was 
agreed upon with Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. We, and the 
U.S. side, raised the question many times. So, now it is a 
question of formulating specific accords. 
  Now I would like to tell the esteemed correspondent: The 
question should not be asked as to whether the positions were 
agreed upon between the government and the Supreme Soviet at the 
talks. That is an incorrect way of putting the question, 
because we were one and the same [word indistinct], we have no 
differences of view when it is a matter of the interests of the 
Republic of Belarus. There is no difference, there never was 
and never will be, because it is senseless and useless. 
[passage omitted elaborating on this; Kebich agreeing with him] 
  [Kebich, in Russian] I can just add to what Stanislav 
Stanislavavich said, that before the visit of Mr. Clinton I 
received a letter from Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, saying 
that Russia will take part in payment of this sum from the sale 
of the uranium belonging to the Republic of Belarus. But as for 
this sum, I do not want to name it -- this sum is subject to an 
agreement, but I want to say that this sum will be sufficiently 
large to support the economic condition of our republic. To put 
it briefly, it will be equal to the equivalent of the nuclear 
weaponry being removed. [passage indistinct] 
  [Kebich, in Russian] We have an interest in strengthening 
interaction with NATO countries. We absolutely exclude the 
possibility of political interference in our internal affairs, 
and therefore, we have a very correct approach to those specific 
proposals that are due to be included in the declaration, as you 
understand, and in order to express our attitude to Partnership 
for Peace with the NATO countries, we must conclude a 
declaration with NATO, and in this declaration there must be a 
certain number of articles. There is a proposal from the 
Defense Ministry on this issue, but we specifically did not 
bring them into our negotiations. I think that this a subject 
for discussion in parliamentary commissions and in the 
government. We are working out our attitude to this matter. 
  [Shushkevich, in Russian] We did not bring in these 
questions, since I knew that these questions of (?foreign) 
policy activity are questions that are in the competence of the 
Supreme Soviet. [passage indistinct] 
  [Shushkevich, in Belarusian] Bill Clinton made a good 
statement at the beginning our talks, that he would not want in 
any way to give us advice how to act here in Belarus in solving 
the main political questions. And I am grateful to him for 
this. [passage omitted] [end recording]

resignation was the inter-bank agreement on unification of the 
monetary systems of Russia and Belarus. Concerning this, 
Stanislav Shushkevich, head of the Belarusian Parliament, 
expressed to INTERFAX the supposition that Gaydar had not been 
presented with an analysis of Belarus's expenditure on 
elimination of the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident, on which 
the republic annually spends 15 percent of its annual budget. 
  Minsk believes that Russia should take into consideration 
the 
factor of the Chernobyl tragedy in the talks on creating a 
monetary union with Belarus.

  [Text] Minsk January 17 TASS -- The merger of the monetary 
systems of Belarus and Russia "will not seriously affect the 
rouble," Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich said. 
  In an interview with the news agency BELINFORM, Kebich said 
that "on the contrary, (Belarus's) more modern fixed assets than 
in Russia, highly skilled labour, and well developed 
transportation and industrial infrastructure will ensure that 
the merger of the two monetary systems will become a long-term 
condition of the stabilisation of the common currency." 
  The announcement followed a statement by former Russian 
Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar that the merger of the two 
systems is detrimental to Russia. 
  Kebich believes that the dispute is caused by "the very 
monetary approach towards complex economic processes in the 
economy of the transitional period. Certain circles are tossing 
up an idea that only a monetary system can affect the economy, 
while ignoring other factors which are equally important." 
  Speaking about inflation in Belarus, Kebich stressed that 
the 
devaluation of the Belarusian coupons is partly caused by the 
huge debts of Russian consumers to Belarusian enterprises, as 
well as by a big discrepancy between energy prices in the two 
republics. 
  Earlier today Belarusian First Vice-Prime Minister Mikhail 
Myasnikovich said that the merger of the Russian and Belarusian 
monetary systems is beneficial to both republics. 
  The Belarusian vice-premier said that Belarus is doing 
everything possible to agree the tax, banking, customs and 
foreign economic policies. The talks on these issues were in 
progress during the entire last year. On many of them 
agreements have been reached. "We are working within the 
framework of an agreed tax, licence and quota policy," 
Myasnikovich said. 
  He stressed that the merger of the Russian and Belarusian 
monetary systems aims at removing barriers in trade and monetary 
cooperation that emerged after Russia seceded from the rouble 
zone, starting the chaotic development of independent monetary 
policies in CIS states. 
  In a joint statement signed on January 5, the heads of 
government of Russia and Belarus stated that the necessary 
preliminary work for merging the two monetary systems has been 
completed.

  [Text] Minsk January 17 TASS -- Belarusian First Vice-Prime 
Minister Mikhail Myasnikovich said on Monday that the merger of 
the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems is beneficial to 
both republics. 
  The announcement followed a statement by former Russian 
Vice-Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar that the merger of the two 
systems is detrimental to Russia. 
  Myasnikovich said that "the statement by Yegor Timurovich 
reflects the position not of the whole government of Russia, but 
of one of its members, though very influential." 
  Myasnikovich stressed that during the talks in Moscow on 
January 5 with Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, 
Gaydar did not rule out the possibility of the integration of 
the two monetary systems. He said, however, that this is a long 
process and may take up to six months. 
  The Belarusian vice-premier said that Belarus is doing 
everything possible to agree the tax, banking, customs and 
foreign economic policies. The talks on these issues were in 
progress during the entire last year. On many of them

  [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze says the 
process of resolving the conflict in Abkhazia can be fastened if 
the United Nations succeeds in implementing its policy at 
regional peace in full. He was commenting on the outcome of 
last week's talks in Geneva between Georgia and Abkhazia. 
  He spoke of negotiations being at a stage leading to peace 
calling for firm guarantees that what had been achieved was not 
wasted. Shevardnadze also called to speed up the sending of 
U.N. peacekeepers and observers to the region to become 
guarantors of security for tens of thousands of Georgian 
refugees returning to their homes in Abkhazia. 
  Shevardnadze pointed to the positive role that Russia had 
played in resolving the conflict.

  [Text] Turkey will grant Georgia additional credit worth 
$50 Mn. The understanding was reached Thursday during the visit 
to Turkey by Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze, Interfax was 
told by the spokesman for the Georgian leader, Zaza Kandelaki. 
  The visit has shown, he said, that Georgia and Turkey have 
common interests. At the joint news conference in Ankara, 
Shevardnadze, according to the spokesman, said that Turkey is 
taking a real part in stabilizing the Georgian economy. 
  In an interview with reporters at the Tbilisi airport, 
Shevardnadze said that his visit to Turkey following Georgia's 
entry into the Commonwealth of Independent States was very 
important. He emphasized the package of economic problems 
discussed at the talks. The Georgian leader said that there are 
good prospects for the Georgian economy. "If the process of 
stabilization continues in Georgia, we shall receive more 
essential aid from Turkey," he said. 
  The speaker of the parliament of the Ajarian Autonomous 
Republic, Aslan Abashidze, told Interfax that during the visit 
the two sides reached understanding with the Turkish government 
on Turkish energy supplies to Ajaria beginning January 25. Also 
signed were other agreements on cooperation.

<F P=106> ["Regular weekly" studio interview with Eduard Shevardnadze, </F>
Georgia's head of state and chairman of the republic's 
parliament, by program presenter Oniani -- live] 
  [Text] [Oniani] Good morning, friends, we present you a 
radio interview. Greetings Eduard; a Georgian official state 
delegation last week visited Turkey. What do you think are the 
most important results of this visit? And another question; 
Turkey was brought out of the political and economic crisis by 
the so-called Turkish wonder, as well as the will of the whole 
nation. To what extent is Georgia ready to share this 
experience? Because the instability in Georgia today was 
earlier no less alien for Turkey. 
  [Shevardnadze] Good morning. I spoke widely about the 
results at the meeting of the Tbilisi branch of the Citizens' 
Union of Georgia, and therefore, I will not dwell on them. The 
results, both political and economic, are quite impressive. 
Many contracts and agreements are to be signed. We have signed 
many agreements. Batoni Chikvaidze, who stayed on in Turkey and 
phoned me yesterday, told me that the issue of credits is being 
resolved positively. Other prospects have been mapped out, 
among them being cooperation in the field of science and 
culture, and many others. 
  One important result is our mutual understanding, good 
mutual 
understanding, of the processes which are under way in the 
Caucasus, and, in particular, in Georgia, and on a wider scale, 
in Europe and the world. From this standpoint, the visit was 
undoubtedly a success. 
  The second question, which is of no less interest for us 
all, 
our citizens -- how did Turkey achieve success with its economy 
and in developing democracy and political life? Your question 
in effect implied the answer. I may reiterate it, but I will be 
brief. It achieved it by being patient; by declaring and 
setting genuinely national and state interests as the highest 
goal; by integrating into the European and world economy. It 
did not refuse it. [as heard] From the very beginning it 
refused the policy of being shut out and living in isolation, 
which brought Georgia to this dead-end. Unlike Georgia, Turkey 
followed a completely different course, which has brought it 
tremendous success; it could be called a wonder. At the meeting 
with business circles, where unique dialogues and conversations 
were held with about 200 businessmen and bank representatives of 
Turkey, and where you [Oniani] were not allowed, we saw a 
20-minute movie about Turkey's wonder -- if we call it this. 
Having seen this movie I have drawn a conclusion for myself as 
to how Turkey managed to achieve such success in a comparatively 
short span of history. Turks have tried may forms of rule over 
the last 20 years. You know there has been a coup d'etat and 
military dictatorship. The ruling democracy, as I would call 
it, proved to be the best. There is quite a strong opposition, 
there is political pluralism, but there is the most important 
thing, which you can feel everywhere -- the people's wish, their 
disposition. Common state interests and party interests do not 
damage state interests. I think that if we are to learn 
anything -- and there is much that we must learn -- it is 
establishing this kind of attitude in Georgia. 
  [Oniani] Mr. Shevardnadze, Suleyman Demirel, in an 
interview with us, said that Georgia and Turkey have a lot in 
common and that a lot of Georgians live in Turkey and are very 
good citizens. You met some of them; among them the minister of 
agriculture, Refaettin Sahin, was always with our delegation. 
There were others as well. You were given Georgian magazines 
which are published in Turkey, including CHVENEBURI magazine. 
There were warm contacts there. What can you say about them? 
How important was it to you as the head of state to meet these 
Georgians? 
  [Shevardnadze] To say that I was indifferent to them and 
looking at them casually would not be true. I have always met 
these people this way. [as heard] In this respect -- about the 
Georgians there -- I would like to say, and we in Georgia must 
comprehend it well, that first they are honorable citizens of 
their own country, as Demirel said and you just repeated. They 
are honorable citizens of their country, Turkey. Therefore, for 
honesty and faithfulness to the state, the Turkish Government 
values them greatly, and trusts and respects them. By playing 
such a role they will also play the role of a bridge of 
friendship between Georgia and Turkey. They will do a very good 
service also to Georgia by being faithful to their adopted 
country, being devoted, honest and being good citizens and, as I 
said, they can also play a role as a bridge of friendship. 
  [Oniani] In Turkey you put forward the idea of the 
commonwealth of commonwealths, that is the CIS plus the alliance 
of the Black Sea basin countries plus the CSCE. What is it? Is 
it a continuation of the process of integration or one more 
mechanism of self-defense for Georgia, and not only Georgia? 
  [Shevardnadze] This is what I would call objective 
processes, 
which are under way in today's world. Countries on their own, 
even gigantic countries will not be able to resolve the issues 
they are facing, and integration is one of the most important 
characteristic events of this epoch. Such form of integration 
as the CIS must be reckoned with within the limits of the vast 
general process of integration. But the processes in the south, 
that is, in the Black Sea basin countries, the economic alliance 
of the Black Sea countries, which is making its first steps and 
which is just starting to function realistically, must also be 
taken into consideration. Whatever has already happened in 
Europe must all the more be reckoned with -- the European 
Community has taken 30 years to form, and it has reached 
definite standards and a high level. Generally speaking, when I 
was talking about the commonwealth of commonwealths, what I mean 
by the commonwealth of commonwealths is that this commonwealth 
is not directed against anyone, and must be viewed as a 
constituent part of the general process of integration. The 
commonwealth of commonwealths, as you have just said, is the 
road leading to a space of a single economic or military 
security which can assume either European, Euro-Asian or 
finally, a world scale. The commonwealth of commonwealths is 
the road leading to a space of a single security. 
  [Oniani] Turkey, which has not yet managed to join the 
European Community, must have been interested in this idea. 
  [Shevardnadze] Many ideas voiced by us or the Turkish 
authorities have a lot in common. And one more thing, the 
commonwealth of commonwealths responds to NATO's latest 
initiatives and Clinton's address -- Partnership for Peace. I 
view it as a single complex leading to a vast single space. 
  [Oniani] Mr. Shevardnadze, at the meeting with President 
Demirel and Husamettin Cindoruk, chairman of the Turkish Grand 
National Assembly, your suggestion that the meeting of the 
presidents of the countries of the alliance [Black Sea basin 
countries] be held in Tbilisi, was approved. You said that 
judging from this, you believed that order would be established 
in Tbilisi and Georgia. Establishing order on the highways was 
discussed at the meeting with businessmen. Enforcement of order 
was the main theme at the conference of the Tbilisi branch of 
the Citizens' Union of Georgia, yet rumors circulate that there 
is a pressure from the high echelons of either authorities or 
the government, and that these measures will stop halfway and 
will never be continued. 
  [Shevardnadze] I announced at the meeting the day before 
yesterday that those who oppose the will of the people, 
irrespective of what post they may occupy, will not remain in 
their posts. Order will be established by all means. We cannot 
stop halfway and we will not stop; this movement making the the 
country healthier and clearing the atmosphere will not be 
stopped. If it is stopped, then people will sweep away 
everybody and everything that prevents them from achieving the 
set goal. 
  [Oniani] At the Citizens' Union of Georgia conference it 
was noted that the union's youth organization had been formed. 
This was announced by Giorgi Maisuradze and Giorgi Baramidze. 
What is your attitude toward this fact and how do you assess it? 
  [Shevardnadze] I am proud of the youths who are joining the 
Citizens' Union and those who decided to set up a youth 
satellite organization having the orientation of the Citizens' 
Union. They are wonderful youths. I would say one more thing: 
That the Citizens' Union is an organization for young people -- 
not only of young people, but for them, as well. This 
initiative was raised at one of the sessions of the board of the 
Union, and we all supported it actively. It is a brilliant 
generation, and they will undoubtedly make our union and the 
country too, more beautiful, richer, and they will mature, grow 
up and take over tommorow's Georgia. 
  [Oniani] You said at the conference that the process of 
Russia's change has begun; and later you said that we would 
resolve the issue of returning to Abkhazia. We already know 
about the activities of our delegation in Geneva; a paragraph on 
the inviolability of the Caucasian borders was contained in a 
Brussels declaration at a NATO meeting, where Americans raised a 
peace initiative. In the immediate future, President Yeltsin is 
to visit Georgia. Judging from all these events, how 
advantageous are the circumsatnces for resolving the Abkhaz 
issue and how will Russia participate in this pocess? 
  [Shevardnadze] Resolving the Abkhaz issue without Russia's 
active participation is impossible. However, anegative role by 
Russia at different stages may have been, still, today it is 
such a palpable reality that one should be blind not to be able 
to see it. [sentence as heard] Therefore, I would say that 
Russia's participation in peace-keeping initiatives and in 
resolving the Abkhaz issue in a peaceful manner is a decisive 
role -- of course, together with and under the auspices of, and 
not contradictory to the United Nations. Some people are trying 
to juxtapose them and find a definite contradiction between 
them. There are no contradictins here. We must also consider 
Russia's realistic interests when we are talking about securing 
Georgia's interests in Abkhazia, and not only in Abkhazia. If 
we understand each other so well -- and I think we should 
understand each other well and that we will take into 
consideration each other's interests -- then I believe that the 
Abkhaz issue will soon be resolved and the refugees will soon 
return to their homes. Therefore, I repeat, if we want Russia 
to understand us, then we must understand Russia, the aches, 
difficulties and contradictions which the Russian state is faced 
with now. I think that this process of mutual understanding and 
of building good-neighborly and friendly relations is going well. 
  Now, as for a very important stage in the life of our two 
countries, President Yeltsin's forthcoming visit -- it is still 
early days to talk about dates -- will be a great event. I am 
sure that our citizens welcome his visit. The Tbilisi branch of 
the Citizens' Union, when I asked them how our capital would 
receive him, everyone unanimously expressed their feelings and 
attitude by saying that we must receive him as an honored guest, 
a representative of a great country, our great neighbor, the 
president of a great country. 
  At the same time, I would like to remind you of several 
things that have to be mentioned before his visit. President 
Yeltsin will be a desired guest for Georgia, among other reasons 
because -- Georgians know it well, and those who do not, must 
know -- it is necessary to take into consideration his role in 
dismantling the empire. Yeltsin is one of the most impressive 
and distinguished figures, who has taken decisive steps, 
especially after the August putsch, when he took a course of 
dismantling the empire, and on the ruins of the empire is 
building a new form of relations and cooperation which we today 
call the CIS. It would be a little difficult to talk about 
Yeltsin without this role; his role was undoubtedly an 
historical one. 
  Many citizens of Tbilisi remember that after 9 April 
[massacre of demonstrators in Tbilisi by Soviet Army troops], 
Yeltsin, who was in the opposition, was one of the first people 
to visit Tbilisi to express his condolences. I think this must 
not be forgotten. There is one more thing I wish to recall for 
the population in Tbilisi and throughout Georgia: When, at a 
union congress of deputies, Army prosecutor Katushev accused and 
started to press charges against Georgia, Yeltsin was the first 
man to leave the hall as a sign of protest. He was then 
followed by several hundreds of deputies who also left as a sign 
of protest. Thus, I have always considered him to be Georgia's 
friend and I would like that the Georgian people receive him as 
our friend, a great neighbor and friend. 
  [Oniani] The document signed during the meeting between 
Clinton and Yeltsin, when Clinton arrived in the post-Soviet 
territory, was viewed as one of the full stops at the end of the 
Cold War. What can be done about real wars, either in Georgia, 
the Balkans, or Nagorno-Karabakh, which assumed a horrendous 
scale? 
  [Shevardnadze] I think that the Clinton-Yeltsin meeting is 
an 
important stage, the most important stage for creating a new 
world strategy since the end of the Cold War, in the same way as 
the NATO meeting. These are not contradictory events as some 
people claim by explaining that if NATO becomes stronger and its 
influence widens, then Russia will die. On the contrary, work 
will be directed toward creating and forming the single 
strategic space, to be more accurate, the single security space. 
I think that we must go even more assiduously toward creating a 
new world strategy, a new space for security in the world -- of 
course, including its guarantees, security guarantees for the 
world. 
  Clinton's visit was one of these steps. If we continue more 
assiduously, I am sure that every conflict will be resolved. I 
think that the experience accumulated in the United Nations 
about the Abkhaz and Samachablo issues...[pauses] if we end the 
work which we started it will be a good precedent of how the 
United Nations, the CSCE and great individual countries like the 
United States of America, Russia, France, the Federal Republic 
of Germany, England can combine their efforts in order to 
resolve these local conflicts so that they do not spread. Thus, 
these conflicts will be resolved and settled in the process of 
creating this common space. 
  [Oniani] You mentioned at the news conference held before 
you 
left Turkey that Abkhazia will be a test case for the United 
Nations and Russia. 
  [Shevardnadze] When I said that I meant that the conflict in 
Abkhazia is not of such a vast scale that large states and the 
United Nations could not resolve it, it is at the same time a 
potentially very dangerous conflict and resolving it will be a 
classical example of how a conflict could be settled by means of 
joint efforts by many states and such a great international 
organization. 
  [Oniani] Thank you. It was announced on Georgian television 
yesterday that some persons guilty of finance and credit 
breaches had been exposed. Then it was announced that the 
Caucasus Concern, the Caucasus Exchange was a founder of 
noncommodity operations in Georgia. It begs a natural question 
-- the leader of this organization today is a vice premier of 
Georgia [Amiran Kadagishvili]. 
  [Shevardnadze] In principle, I do not wish to jump to 
conclusions before the investigation is over. I knew that it 
would be mentioned yesterday -- not this particular fact, but 
that 12 criminal cases had been instituted. As for drawing the 
conclusion that the Exchange is mainly to blame, and that it 
caused everything -- I think it is a little hasty and a 
premature decision. I think that a wide-scale investigation 
must be carried out; 12 cases have been instituted, but there 
may be cases coming up. The fact is that cases have been 
instituted, and the beginning of an investigation does not 
define guilt as yet. It will be a complex case and will have to 
go through complex stages; the process of investigation, then 
everything must be examined in the prosecutor's office and the 
prosecutor's conclusion must be confirmed, then court of law 
follows, and nobody knows what the court will decide. 
Therefore, let us not jump the gun; let the investigation carry 
out the task delegated to it by the head of state. I think that 
everything will be clarified, among other things, the role of 
the previous government, which imposed the premature 
introduction of the coupon on parliament and the head of state. 
Instead of finding a common language with Russia, we made haste 
and introduced the so-called national currency, to be more 
accurate, a transitional form of the national currency. The 
coupon had to be devalued, however unpalatable it may be to say 
it, and so it did. I do not want to usurp the name of 
soothsayer, but right from the beginning of the parliamentary 
sessions I made no secret of it, and I said then that 
devaluation was imminent. Then I said that it was a forceful 
step, and not a natural one toward a national currency that is 
slightly different -- like it was chosen by other countries, 
among them our neighbors -- a parallel existence of two 
currencies which painlessly settled the transition to a new 
feature. [sentence as heard] Much has to be said about the 
coupon. The issue of whether we will be able to save it or not 
is problematic. We must try to save it. Once we have made this 
step and parliament and the executive authorities have made this 
decision, we must do everything in order to save it, but not in 
the way they suggest. 
  I watch television and often we are told to forbid selling 
everything in rubles or dollars and so on. Any kind of ban will 
result in repercussions and will lead us to the condition 
whereby products will not be imported; there will be nothing. 
Therefore, the way of introducing a ban is not the way to 
strengthen the coupon and we made a mistake when we stated in 
parliament that it was the sole means of payment. The coupon 
cannot be strengthened by force; therefore, we must seek other 
ways, and the authorities are assessing this today. 
  [Oniani] And yet, our entry into the ruble zone is much 
talked about. How important and useful is it for Georgia if the 
entry means handing gold mines over to Russia, refusing 
independent finance and credit emission, annulling economic laws 
on the Georgian territory for the benefit of Russia, Russia's 
appointing one of the vice presidents of the National Bank, and 
so on? There are many demands from the Russian side. 
  [Shevardnadze] Regarding talks and, moreover, a decision 
about joining the ruble zone -- this issue is unripe. It was 
probably right that talks and discussions have been started, and 
Vakhtang Goguadze was right to have raised this issue that has 
become a topic for discussion. But it does not mean at all that 
we are to make a decision in the immediate future on joining the 
ruble zone. It was hasty to have left the zone -- it was still 
early in the game -- unprepared and unripe in the same way as 
the issue of joining the zone is unripe today. This problem has 
not been studied deeply and substantively by scientists and 
specialists. Yesterday I noticed the opinion poll carried out 
in the street, and there were terrific responses. Ask 
specialists -- I am a consumer, a common consumer -- call 
specialists and let them tell us what the ruble zone is, what we 
shall gain, and what we shall lose. Once again, I repeat, we 
must study this issue as one of the solutions to the problem, 
not the only one. We must seek other ways also. I may say that 
I do not rule out that another more effective way may be found. 
  One more thing: Now that people are insulting Goguadze, 
practically calling him the anti-Christ, and wondering how he 
could have said such a thing, nobody is asking if Russia will 
accept us in the ruble zone. I think it is a problematic issue. 
In his statement yesterday, Gaydar spoke about his disagreement 
over Belarus joining the ruble zone. Russia knows very well 
that such a poor country as Georgia joining the ruble zone would 
mean more of a burden, expenses, additional expenses -- she 
knows it very well. It is not right to kill each other over 
arguments on whether to join this zone not knowing Russia's 
stance. 
  I must say that our political culture is on such a level 
that 
we must beat each other up for having a different view. It has 
become a custom unfortunately. 
  A lot is being said about gold deposits. I do not want to 
say how many kilos we are talking about. The Russians have a 
saying that translated in Georgian sounds approximately like: 
Weight of a cat's tear. This is what our gold deposits equal 
to compared with our rights. It is not significant, it may last 
us 10-15 days, giving us a temporary respite. We have no more 
gold deposits. If we had had a lot of gold then we would have 
been a different country and state, and the coupon would have 
had a different value. Now, this is how I see it. When am I 
going to express my view on whether it is going to be the ruble 
zone, lari [name of the planned Georgian currency], or the 
coupon, or anything else? I shall probably express my views 
after my visits in Paris. 
  [Oniani] It will probably be held this week, will it not? 
  [Shevardnadze] Hopefully. What does the status of a 
developed country, which we have just attained, have in store 
for us? It means a lot. I shall have contacts with those heads 
and directors-general who know this business very well and what 
it would mean for us economically, financially, and so on. 
  I can answer this question more definitely after I meet the 
World Bank and its management, the management of the 
International Monetary Fund, and the U.S. Administration -- 
especially the international organizations like the IMF and the 
World Bank. I must carry out a special investigation and 
account for those $200 million that Sigua says Shevardnadze has 
hidden away. I do not know where it has been hidden, and if 
Christopher Columbus was trying to discover America, I, too, 
shall set off looking for the $200 million and maybe I shall 
discover it. [laughs] God help me, I may find it. After I have 
done all this, I shall be able to say what might happen with the 
coupon and what are the ways out from this state. 
  [Oniani] Your visit to France begins later this week. What 
do you expect from this visit? 
  [Shevardnadze] I am going to France with great hopes. Not 
because I am going to bring back suitcases of dollars and francs 
and so on... 
  [Oniani, interrupting] I hope you will not bring coupons 
with 
you. 
  [Shevardnadze, continuing] ...not only for this. Although 
there may be something interesting in this regard as well. 
  France has traditionally been Georgia's friend. It has 
always been so and that is still the case today. It is 
especially tangible now that the Abkhaz issue is so acute. 
France is one of the initiators of a group called the Group of 
Georgia's Friends, which together with the United Nations is 
aspiring to establish peace in Abkhazia and peacefully resolve 
the conflict there. This envisages the return of refugees, 
restoring the economy of Abkhazia, and so on. 
  It would not be right for a young democratic and independent 
country not to have a legal basis with such a great country as 
France -- a country that has a great reputation and weight. 
  A wonderful treaty on cooperation, friendship, and 
understanding between the two countries has been prepared, and 
President Mitterrand and I will sign it. After that, intensive 
relations between our two countries will start. 
  We are to join the Paris Charter in France. Since the end of 
the Cold War this charter has been regulating relations in 
Europe and not only in Europe. The United States and Canada 
have joined it. This is a charter recognized all over the world. 
  Of course, I am looking forward to a meeting with President 
Mitterrand, who is one the most remarkable politicians of our 
times. Many other interesting and useful meetings are awaiting 
us in Paris, including meetings with UNESCO and other 
international organizations, various parties, government 
leaders, and so on. 
  I think that close ties with Paris and a process of 
establishing closer ties, which is now starting and which lays 
the foundation of our new relations, will undoubtedly help us 
emerge from the crisis as soon as possible. I am leaving for 
Paris with these hopes. 
  [Oniani] Thank you very much. You have been listening to the 
head of state and Supreme Council chairman, Eduard Shevardnadze.

<F P=106> [Address by State Council Chairman Eduard Shevardnadze at </F>
inaugural conference of Tbilisi branch of Citizen's Union of 
Georgia held at the Philharmonic Society concert hall in Tbilisi 
on 15 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] The Citizens' Union, as a political organism, as an 
organization which, if not today, then in the future, must 
become a pillar of the state and our top-level politics, has not 
emerged on the wave of destruction. We did not [words 
indistinct] down with this government and we do not believe that 
a new government will work miracles. We came with the belief 
that destruction must stop in Georgia. Anarchy must stop in 
Georgia. This terrible process must be stopped and let us all 
together start construction. If this happens and if these are 
not our union's empty words, then we will gain a civil 
[Georgian: mokalakeobrivi] right to be a leading and fundamental 
force in a democratic Georgian state, in the state of Georgia. 
  I can draw a more dramatic picture [of the situation in 
Georgia] than the orator who spoke before me. I profoundly 
respect Batoni Chkheidze, who is one of the greatest patriots of 
the [Tbilisi] city and, also, an expert in his profession. I 
can draw an even more terrible picture. I can say how many 
people are perishing, including how many have starved to death, 
how many people are being killed, how much violence there is, 
how many houses are being destroyed, how many streets are full 
of [uncollected] refuse and so on and so forth. 
  You will then, naturally, ask me what we should do. There 
are two ways. One way is to lose heart and say that nothing 
will save this country. I am categorically against this. This 
is not true. The country can be saved. I have said it before 
and I am repeating this for a third time. Georgia will be 
saved. These are not empty words and phrases. The country will 
be saved, if we do something about it, if we start working, if 
everybody minds their own business, if professionals do their 
job, if the government does its job and if citizens and the 
government struggle together to save the country. 
  I spent a day and a half in Turkey. There was a television 
report about (?the visit). One cannot report everything. It is 
impossible to report everything. The television camera fails to 
catch everything. I decided to refrain from a television 
interview only to tell you first about my impression. We were 
received there as worthy representatives of a worthy country. 
And, not only there [in Turkey]. In every country I have 
visited--and there will probably be more visits in future 
because we have no other choice-- we (?were received) as 
representatives of a democratic country which enjoys full rights 
and has a future. They are ready to have relations with us. 
  In Turkey, I remembered Ataturk's words. I think that the 
television carried this. This person who saved Turkey--and you 
can see his pictures anywhere you go in Turkey--said: we need a 
strong and good neighbor east of Turkey, and Georgia will be 
such a neighbor. They are saying this today as well. The 
current president and prime minister are saying this: we need 
Georgia as a good neighbor and friend. When I was talking about 
neighborhood and friendship, [Turkish President Suleyman] 
Demirel said: I do not agree with you, we are brothers, we want 
to build fraternal relations with you, with our strong and good 
neighbor Georgia. They believe in us more than we do in 
ourselves, more than we believe in our (?abilities). 
  I do not share the terrible pessimism which has hit our 
society. We are competing with each other in drawing the most 
terrible picture. This applies to any party. This applies to 
any parliamentarian. Of course, I do not mean our majority 
faction here. [Reference to majority faction in the Georgian 
parliament which supports Shevardnadze]. They all believe that 
the present government should resign and a new government should 
come. I assure you that--of course, this is not an ideal 
authority, nor is the head of state ideal, and (?he) can be 
blamed for many shortcomings and many disasters--a better 
government will come tomorrow. 
  Young people spoke who here today, Zurab [apparently, Zurab 
Zhvania, the secretary-general of the Citizens' Union and the 
leader of the Green Party] and others, will come to the fore. 
However, we, representing an older generation, should show and 
prove that we are able to struggle together with them. We can 
teach them how to live and struggle. We will struggle until we 
are alive.

  [Text] Most members of the Georgian paramilitary group, 
formerly known as "Mkhedrioni," have surrendered arms as of 
Friday, Interfax was told by the group's spokesman. Those who 
are against will be excluded from the group, he said.

  [Text] Tbilisi January 15 TASS -- The Georgian Interior 
Ministry introduced today APCs in key areas of downtown Tbilisi 
and concentrated there almost all personnel of the city police 
due to Zviadist attempts to hold mourning arrangements in 
connection with the supposed death of the ex-president. 
  Although the death has not been confirmed it is believed the 
body of Zviad Gamsakhurdia is buried in western Georgia. 
Zviadists demand a funeral ceremony: a minute of silence with 
the suspension of work of enterprises, organizations and 
traffic, as well as rallies that are banned by the state of 
emergency regime introduced in Georgia on September 20, 1993. 
  No excesses or clashes between the Tbilisi police and 
supporters of the ex-president were reported today.

  [Text] Manana Gamsakhurdia, the widow of the former 
Georgian president, told INTERFAX that his family objected not 
only to making the dead body available for a post mortem, but to 
making it available to the Tbilisi regime as well. 
  "The reports of our consent are the Georgian Interior 
Ministry's exercise in misinformation. I have no intention to 
go to Georgia because I have nothing to do with terrorists and 
murderers. I demand that the body be moved to Chechnya for 
burial," Mrs. Gamsakhurdia said. 
  In her words, she was visited by Chechen President Dzhokhar 
Dudayev, who told her that as a mediator he would insist on 
doing as the deceased's family desired.

  [Text] A message from Manana Archvadze-Gamsakhurdia and 
Chechen Vice President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev addressed to Eduard 
Shevardnadze arrived in Tbilisi from Groznyy yesterday, 17 
January. Here is the text of the message. 
  To Mr Shevardnadze, the Government House, Tbilisi, Georgia. 
  In order to resolve issues relating to the reburial of 
Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia, we inform you of the 
Gamsakhurdia family conditions, upon which the decision to issue 
a written confirmation of compliance with the conditions below 
will depend [as heard]. 
  1. Conditions must be created for an unhindered and 
immediate reburial of the body on the territory of the Chechen 
Republic, where the family is temporarily residing. 
  2. The family, death witnesses and other persons involved in 
procedures connected with the reburial of the body must be given 
guarantees of immunity and permission to leave Georgia 
immediately. 
  3. The family members and death witnesses categorically 
refuse to participate in any investigation or study in 
connection with the death of Gamsakhurdia. 
  4. The family of President Gamsakhurdia categorically 
refuses to allow a dissection or examination of the body of the 
deceased or any other action except on-the-spot identification. 
  5. The family of the deceased demands that an international 
group be set up to monitor the implementation of the 
above-mentioned conditions. 
  The family categorically demands that the above-mentioned 
conditions be implemented in the shortest period. 
  The message is signed by Manana Archvadze and the Vice 
President of the Chechen Republic Yandarbiyev. 
  [Word indistinct] categorical demands give rise to 
controversial questions, which were answered late yesterday, 17 
January, at a press conference held by Georgian Security 
Minister Igor Giorgadze, and Acting Prosecutor-General Jamlet 
[name indistinct]. 
  The Georgian side reaffirmed the guarantees issued earlier 
of 
an unhindered reburial and of security for the members of the 
team of experts and Zviad Gamsakhurdia's relatives and fellow 
fighters who arrive from Groznyy with the aim of reburying the 
deceased. 
  Under international legal norms, a forensic examination is 
necessary to establish the real circumstances of a death case. 
The Georgian side agrees to include in the international 
commission specialists proposed by Zviad Gamsakhurdia's family 
and the official authorities of Chechnya. 
  As reported, in connection with this incident, the 
government 
of the Republic of Georgia has invited a group of international 
experts to Georgia. The director of the German institute of 
forensic medicine, Professor Bonte, and Russian scientists, 
Professors (Igor Banov) and Aleksandr Isayev, arrived in Tbilisi 
on 17 January. In connection with the same incident, a forensic 
sciences doctor, philosophy doctor, member of the royal 
pathological research society, Professor Peter S.. S.. -- sorry, 
I cannot pronounce the surname -- of Glasgow University arrives 
in Tbilisi today.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS freelance correspondent Anatoliy Kholodnik] </F>
  [Text] Tiraspol, 17 Jan -- The press service of the Russian 
14th Army issued a statement today condemning attempts to set 
the population of the Dniester Republic against servicemen. 
Someone thinks it very important to drive a wedge between the 
Army and the population, to make the Army a scapegoat for all 
evils, and thereby to divert public attention from the 
sociopolitical problems that really do exist in the Dniester 
Republic, the statement says. 
  Explaining this statement to the ITAR-TASS correspondent, 
General Lebed, commander of the 14th Army, pointed to 
unscrupulous articles in a number of newspapers, in particular 
PRAVDA, alleging that the Army had been put on combat alert and 
was preparing an assault on the Dniester Republic government.

  [Text] In Tiraspol (an administrative center of 
Transdniester) there have appeared anonymous leaflets accusing 
the commander of the 14th Russian Army, Lieutenant-General 
Aleksandr Lebed of plotting a coup d'etat to overthrow the 
authorities of the self-proclaimed Transdniestrian Moldovan 
Republic. 
  The leaflets say that the plot was masterminded by the 
leader 
of the Russian Party of the Economic Freedom Konstantin Borovoy 
and the leader of the Party's local branch, businessman Sergey 
Manukyan. 
  Speaking over the Tiraspol cable TV "Asket," Lebed described 
the leaflets as sheer nonsense. He said, though, that the 
Transdniestrian leaders involved in what he said machinations 
and corruption and cheating the ordinary people, are trying to 
shift the blame for their mistakes and the deteriorating 
economic situation in the region on the Russian military. The 
commander has said that he was prepared to prove this and 
cooperate in this respect with other bodies to establish the 
truth. 
  Observers believe the authorship of leaflets belongs to the 
Transdniestrian Security Ministry, whose leader Vadim 
Shevtsov-Antyufeyev is in constant conflict with Aleksandr Lebed. 
  Addressing last Tuesday the Tiraspol parliament, he accused 
in public the Russian general of plotting a coup. 
  Commenting in an interview with Interfax on the fact of the 
leaflets appearance, the speaker of the Transdniestrian 
parliament Grigoriy Marakutsa has said that he ordered to 
conduct investigation into the case and establish real authors 
of the leaflets.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 16/1/1994 -- No serious 
politician makes any illusions on the term for Russian factor to 
stay in Dniester, states retired Colonel Anatol Plugaru, former 
national security minister, to the magazine SAPTAMANA [THE 
WEEK]. "Russia's Army will walk out when we become not 
interesting for Russia or other states that it cannot ignore 
will dictate it. Until then, Moldova and Russia, for their 
citizens' life, have to find an acceptable variant for both 
parties" Plugaru believes. Asked about the information saying 
that the National Security Minister is involved in the activity 
of the Ilascu Group, Plugaru said "we supported only those 
forces which acted according to Moldovan legislation. 
Therefore, I think that if someone infringed it, he should be 
made responsible basing on this legislation." The ex-minister 
spoke about various forms of people's fight against Dniester 
regime, including partisans. The National Security Ministry has 
done its best to support all forces that pleaded for territorial 
integrity of Moldova. If he did not do so, the ministry should 
have been dissolved and its employees sued for criminal 
passivity, states the quoted source. Asked about the assertion 
that Ilie Ilascu's arrest was organized by the National Security 
Ministry, Plugaru said: "We must understand the condition of a 
man sentenced to death" but still "we should examine much 
seriously this declaration of Ilascu, since it should worry us." 
Neither Ilascu nor his comrades have done anything against 
Moldova's Penal Code. Three years ago, the new state formation, 
that is the Republic of Moldova, "was unable as it is now to 
make order without bloodshed" on territories where certain 
forces speculating with Romanophobia and difficulties of 
republican power have took the power and declared their own 
republics, ex-USSR's interests on this territory were also 
menaced. Russia has never before had such a rude attitude 
towards the people of this land. "It is an illusion that 
somebody can win in this situation." Russia must pay for its 
presence here, and not raise prices for gasoline and energy, 
says Plugaru.

  [Text] Yerevan, January 18 (SNARK)--The trustworthy sources 
told SNARK the USA official representative offers to solve the 
humanitarian kerosene deliveries problem by purchasing the fuel 
from Azerbaijan. 
  It's known the great amount of kerosene is in the Batumi 
port 
and it's impossible to deliver it to Armenia because of the 
situation at the Georgian roads. 
  So, Azerbaijan has an additional chance to earn using the 
situation. 
  According to the data SNARK News Agency possesses, the price 
for the Azerbaijani kerosene is in 1.5 times more than the price 
for the fuel which could be brought by planes from Russia and in 
2 times more than the Irani kerosene price. Azerbaijani could 
use the acquired currency to go on with the military actions in 
Karabakh, so, can this way be considered as the accepted one. 
Besides, such deliveries are the violations of the "Freedom 
Defense Law", accepted by the USA Congress which prohibits the 
USA Government to finance Azerbaijan because of the blockade 
course he accepted in respect to Armenia and Karabakh.

<F P=106> ["Rough ideas and themes to help formulate letters to the </F>
editor, comments, etc. on the Kozyrev statements today" 
concerning a continued Russian military presence in states of 
the former Soviet Union; "These are not necessarily Estonian 
Foreign Ministry positions": "Ideas for Response to Kozyrev" -- 
received via Internet] 
  [Text] Big bully terrorizing smaller, weaker neighbors 
  Russia's image has been seriously hurt by these statements. 
The only way for Russia unambiguously to demonstrate its 
respect for Estonia's sovereignty and independence is to meet 
its international commitments, specifically by meeting the 
provisions of the July 1992 CSCE final document in which Russia 
pledged to complete the unconditional, rapid and orderly 
withdrawal of its troops from Estonian territory. 
  It is clear from these and previous Russian statements that 
Russia does not take continued Baltic independence very 
seriously. Baltic independence is viewed as a temporary 
annoyance. 
  [Russian Foreign Minister] Kozyrev has again expressed the 
Russian policy of "eminent domain." Balts have long warned about 
the practical implications of concepts such as "near abroad," 
"special interests," "sphere of Russian interests for 
centuries." When Hitler announced his plans, the world powers 
did not take him seriously at first. The West set out on a path 
of appeasement which led to world war. Are we really doomed to 
repeat history? A bite of Baltics will not fill the bear's 
stomach -- it will merely whet his appetite. 
  Clinton has turned into Bush and Kozyrev turns out to be 
Zhirinovskiy. 
  Kozyrev: "Certain elements in those regions (CIS and 
Baltics) constitute a major threat to those (Russian) 
interests." Is Kozyrev referring to the democratically elected 
governments of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania? Will we now hear 
demands for the resignation of some or all of the Baltic leaders 
to be replaced by individuals more "friendly" to Russia???? 
When have we heard things like this before?!? 
  Russia has not lived up to its international commitments and 
obligations, especially on the issue of withdrawing troops 
(Helsinki Final Document, 1992). In a form of appeasement, the 
West has not exerted enough pressure to bring this about. As a 
result, Russia, instead of behaving as a responsible partner in 
the world community, is now making expansionistic, destabilizing 
threats. 
  Clinton's message was fuzzy and seemed to allow conditions 
to 
be attached to troop withdrawal, the Russians have now been 
emboldened. 
  Russia has no real concern for the Russian-speaking 
residents 
in other nations. Those poor people are merely being used as a 
political tool. The tragic aspect to all this is that 
resentment may grow against these people since Russian threats 
will cause them to be viewed as a potential fifth column 
wherever they reside. 
  IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO MAKE RUSSIA STOP. A CLEAR, SHARP 
REACTION FROM THE WEST TO THIS LATEST MOVE WILL MAKE RUSSIA PULL 
BACK AND SAY, "NO, NO, YOU'VE MISUNDERSTOOD. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE 
MEANT AT ALL."

  [Text] Prime Minister Mart Laar believes that Yegor 
Gaydar's resignation from the Russian government means "a turn 
backwards" in the reform policy pursued by Russia. 
  In his interview with Interfax the premier voiced a 
supposition that certain moods to turn away from shock therapy 
and increase state expenditures for social needs spreading in 
Russia have played a certain role here. 
  "It's a pity that shortage of funds for these purposes could 
result in the refusal of reform policy and very hard 
consequences for all Russia's neighbors, as their successes in 
economic development depend upon their eastern neighbor," 
underlined Laar. 
  "It's strange to hear optimistic statements against such a 
background stating that nothing has changed in Russia and after 
the elections everything is continuing as before," he said.

  [Text] During his unofficial visit to Estonia, Lithuanian 
Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius met with his Estonian 
counterpart, Mart Laar, in Tallinn today. 
  After the meeting was over, the Lithuanian premier told 
INTERFAX that the main goal of his visit was to look into 
Estonia's experience in the transition to local sources of fuel. 
He pointed out that his meeting with the Estonian prime 
minister focused on the expansion of bilateral cooperation and 
the preparation for the meeting of the prime ministers of the 
three Baltic states scheduled for January 19 in Jurmala. 
  Slezevicius said that the Latvian and Estonian prime 
ministers intend to put forward the question of extending the 
trilateral agreement on free trade concluded in 1993 over 
agricultural products left outside the scope of the agreement, 
consular protection of the three states' citizens abroad, etc. 
  The Lithuanian prime minister said that during his stay in 
Estonia he examined the weapons the republic purchased from 
Israel. However, he said that Lithuania did not consider 
purchasing arms as the acutest issue leaving it out of the 
agenda. 
  On Wednesday, Slezevicius and Laar will leave for the 
meeting 
of the prime ministers of the Baltic states in Jurmala.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 18, BNS -- The Estonian parliament 
today adopted the law on the health care system with 45 votes 
for, 11 votes against and six abstentions. The law establishes 
the legal status of the country's medical institutions and the 
basis of financing of the health care system. 
  The law defines medical aid as the activity of doctors with 
a 
higher medical education to protect people's health, prolong 
their lives and improve the quality of life. Medical aid is 
arranged on three levels: general and specialized aid at the 
local government level and specialized medical aid on the 
national level. 
  A national Health Care Council is to be set up under the 
government. General administration and supervision of health 
care will be placed in the hands of the Social Affairs Ministry. 
County medical officers are going to shape the state's health 
care policy on the regional level. They will be appointed for a 
term of five years by county elders, who coordinate the 
nomination with the Social Affairs Ministry. 
  The law on the health care system takes effect on Feb. 15. 
  The legislators amended the law on the relation between the 
local and the state budgets, and continued the second reading of 
the surveillance bill. Also Jaan Luik, a member of the State 
Court, was sworn in.

  [Text] In connection with the statements by Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev on a change in Russian foreign policy 
relating to the CIS states and the Baltic region, Latvian 
Council of Ministers President Valdis Birkavs has commented as 
follows: 
  [begin Birkavs recording] Mr. Kozyrev has announced that the 
CIS and the Baltic countries [words indistinct] regions in which 
quite important Russian interests are concentrated, and from 
which the main threat to these interests [words indistinct]; 
speaking of the military presence in this region, complete 
withdrawal from this region, that is, the (?complete lack) of 
military presence in this region is extremely [word indistinct]. 
There is no need to withdraw from those regions which for 
centuries have been in the Russian sphere of interest, and there 
is no need to be afraid of these words. A security vacuum will 
start to form if Russia's troops are withdrawn from here. 
Rather than fleeing, supplementary forces are being brought in, 
which are always threatening, in some cases hostile to Russia. 
  In my opinion, this announcement in fact indicates a serious 
change in Russia's position. Moreover, I cannot but associate 
this position with the recent meeting of U.S. and Russian 
leaders. Latvia must, therefore, absolutely reinforce its 
position, and in my view security policy has become a state 
priority [words indistinct]. [end recording]

  [Text] President Guntis Ulmanis, at the briefing Monday, 
said that he regrets Yegor Gaydar's resignation, since he 
believes that Gaydar's economic policies are rational and 
concrete. 
  Latvia's Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs believes that Yegor 
Gaydar's resignation will not influence Russian-Latvian economic 
relations. 
  He told Interfax that over the past two years the volume of 
economic contacts between the two countries had decreased so 
much that it would not be serious to talk about any further 
deterioration. 
  He believes that whenever possible the Latvian government 
will continue economic dialogue with the Russian government 
irrespective of the changes in it. 
  He described Gaydar's resignation as "Russia's inner 
political games" which will have no decisive impact on the 
neighboring states."

  [Text] Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis has described as 
uncivilized the decision by the command of Russia's Northwestern 
Army Group to authorize the use of arms for the defense of 
Russian servicemen and army property on Latvian territory. 
  Following the incident with two Russian generals on January 
10, the command of the Northwestern Army Group authorized 
servicemen to shoot to kill to rebuff attempts to seize any army 
facility. 
  Briefing newsmen on January 17, Ulmanis described the 
decision as an uncivilized response to the civilized moves he 
made on January 10. He reminded newsmen that action had been 
taken immediately on his orders for the release of the Russian 
generals, subsequent investigation and punishment of those 
responsible. 
  Ulmanis saw the decision as provocative and a show of force. 
  He hoped it would have no far-reaching repercussions. He 
also saw it as a signal for the Latvian authorities to show more 
caution in what they choose to say or do.

  [Text] At a meeting with Olgerts Pavlovskis, Latvian state 
minister for foreign trade and European Community affairs, and 
Aivars Vovers, deputy secretary of state of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, Valeriy Nesterushkin, counsellor of the Russian 
Embassy in Latvia, reported that Russia considers the 10 January 
incident [detention of two Russian army generals] as closed, 
following the Latvian apology. Nesterushkin termed the action 
by Latvian officials as sufficient. During the talks 
Nesterushkin expressed hope that Latvian authorities will not 
allow a recurrence of such situations. 
  Answering a previous request by the Latvian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs to explain the Russian presidential press 
secretary's statement on this incident, Nesterushkin said that 
the statement's aim was to stress the danger of the situation. 
The sharp tone of the statement was related to the fact that 
all the circumstances of the matter and the stance of the 
official Latvian authorities on this issue were not yet known at 
the time it was made.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 18, BNS -- The Latvian Saeima (parliament) 
should judge the Cabinet's record in taking over the Russian 
military property and amending municipal laws, the Riga Vidzeme 
District Council of People's Deputies said Monday [17 January]. 
  The statement advises the Saeima to abstain from interstate 
agreements with Russia if they grant Russia rights to keep any 
military bases or other property in Latvia. 
  Lawmakers should check whether the Cabinet and lower 
administrative structures take into account the viewpoint of 
local governments when carrying out municipal reforms. 
  The local deputies reproached the government for its 
reluctance to help them take over Russian military property. The 
government also does not reprimand the local governments that do 
not perform their duty of property takeover. 
  The government has not adopted any normative acts to 
regulate 
the actions by takeover commissions in situations when Russian 
military persons exert non-violent or armed resistance, or 
threaten with armed resistance, the local council said. 
  The government has not done anything to prevent plunder and 
unlawful sale of former military property, the group added. 
  The local deputies are also displeased with the government's 
reform policies. The reforms primarily target the expansion of 
Cabinet's powers, thus, nearing Latvia to an authoritarian model 
of state administration, they said. 
  As reported, the Vidzeme District Council endorsed the Jan. 
10 actions by its former Chairman Andrejs Rucs. Rucs acted 
"correctly and reasonably," when detaining the two Russian 
generals, it said.

  [Text] Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis told a news 
conference that at a session today, the Latvian State Security 
Council valued proposals expressed in the framework of the NATO 
program Partnership for Peace. Ulmanis added that an official 
letter to NATO would also be prepared, in which the wish of the 
Latvian side to participate in the program will be expressed. 
The issue of Latvia joining NATO is, however, to be considered 
only in a more distant future. 
  Ulmanis believes initial cooperation with NATO can be in the 
way of training and consultations. The first step toward this 
cooperation from the Latvian side would be working out a unified 
concept for material and technical supplies for the state armed 
structures. 
  The cooperation program also includes the request to be very 
objective and loyal in the issues of human rights, which Latvia 
perceives with great responsibility. Ulmanis added that in the 
framework of the proposed partnership, it would be very 
important to form balanced relations with Russia.

again stressed at the news conference that this NATO program is 
open for all East European states, irrespective of whether they 
have expressed the wish to be involved in NATO. 
  Representatives of the Latvian Government have agreed to 
that 
program. Latvia would also feel more secure if it participates 
in it. 
  Asked why the United States has not reacted to Russia's 
increased military readiness [reference to 10 January 
deportation of two Russian generals], Ambassador Silins noted 
that not all tensions in interstate relations warrant a special 
U.S. statement. 
  At the end, it was once again indicated that the United 
States favors a speedier withdrawal of the Russian Army from 
Latvia.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 18, BNS -- Latvia may face problems with 
radioactive waste because of shortfall of store containers, said 
Andrejs Salmins, a nuclear safety specialist at the 
Environmental Protection and Regional Development Ministry. 
  Financial and managing hardships hamper repairs in Latvia's 
sole nuclear waste depot in the Radons enterprise while its 
exisiting storing capacities are exhausted, Salmins said. 
  To solve the problem, the ministry will consult the Finance 
Ministry's experts to calculate the sum needed to finish the 
reconstruction and find a building organization to complete the 
works. 
  The approximate sum is 150,000 lats, but the state budget 
earmarked only 50,000 lats for the enterprise's reconstruction. 
  In addition, the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Inspectorate 
has until Jan. 24 to draft a program for ecological research in 
Radons and its vicinity. 
  The Riga Radioisotopic Research Institute also nears the 
brink of bankruptcy. This institute, like Radons, stores 
radioactive waste. The institutes' scientists are commissioned 
to forward proposals on the use and storage of radioactive 
substances. They should also determine which substances to keep 
and which to sell. 
  The National Environmental and Social Health Center will 
compile a resolution on work with radioactive waste and prepare 
a program for monitoring the residents' health in Radons' 
vicinity.

"Zaporizhzhya: An Accident at the Atomic Electric Power 
Station"] 
  [Text] As reported by the Information Center of the 
Zaporizhzhya Atomic Electric Power Station [AES], on 12 January 
at 1000 [local time], [radioactive] contamination was revealed 
in a compressed-air pipeline in one of the auxiliary 
technological buildings. No contamination of the plant's 
territory, irradiation of the personnel, or discharges into the 
environment took place. There is no danger either for the 
population or for people working at the plant. 
  It has been tentatively found that radioactive water entered 
the compressed-air pipeline from the fourth power unit due to 
the lack of tightness in one of the locking valves in the 
compressed-air line, which is used for processing the 
ion-exchange resins in filters of the special water-purification 
installation. 
  Work on decontaminating the compressed-air pipeline has 
already been completed. Therefore, the incident was local in 
character and had no effect upon the plant's operation. 
  A commission is investigating the causes of the accident.

<F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Mikhail Melnik -- TASS] </F>
  [Text] Kiev January 18 TASS -- The Ukrainian parliament 
plans to consider an amendment to the constitution at one of its 
upcoming sessions to clarify the status of the Crimea. 
  A proposal to this effect was made by President Leonid 
Kravchuk at a meeting with representatives of local councils in 
Kiev on Tuesday. The proposal was supported by parliament 
Chairman Ivan Plyushch. 
  The amendment would state that bodies of state power in the 
Crimea are to be formed and act on the basis of the Ukrainian 
Constitution and laws and the constitution of the Republic of 
Crimea. The latter should not run counter to the Constitution 
of Ukraine. 
  Kravchuk stressed that no one wants to infringe upon the 
rights of the Crimean people because the Crimea is part of 
Ukraine. 
  Meanwhile, the Crimea held presidential elections over the 
weekend to elect its first ever president. Officials in the 
Ukrainian capital Kiev pinned hopes on Nikolay Bahrov, speaker 
of the Crimean parliament and the sole candidate calling for 
Crimea to remain in a federal Ukraine. 
  However, 38.5 per cent of those who took part in the 
elections voted for Yuriy Meshkov of the Nationalist Russia 
bloc, and 17.5 per cent -- for Bahrov. These two candidates 
will be put up for the runoff elections to be held on January 30.

  [Text] Simferopol -- Yuriy Meshkov, leader of the "Russia" 
bloc and candidate for president of the Republic of Crimea, gave 
a news conference yesterday. He received 38.5 percent of the 
vote on 16 January in the first round of elections. Yuriy 
Meshkov told journalists that the persuasive results of the 
voting in Crimea testify to the possibility of improving 
relations between Crimea and Ukraine and put relations with 
Russia on a qualitatively new level. 
  Responding to a question about a possible reaction from 
official Kiev toward new Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov expressed 
confidence in the ability of Leonid Kravchuk, as one of the 
outstanding politicians of the present time, to regulate the 
political situation in Ukraine and beyond. In the words of 
Yuriy Meshkov, the Ukrainian president stated earlier that the 
dislocation of forces in Crimea ruled out a forcible 
intervention from outside, since it would lead to unforeseen 
consequences. "I have no grounds for not trusting Kravchuk," 
Meshkov stressed. 
  In spite of the fact that the central point of Yuriy 
Meshkov's electoral program is the holding of an all-Crimean 
referendum on the status of the peninsula, the presidential 
candidate refrained at the news conference from stating the act 
of will by the Crimeans, but noted that this will, which was 
expressed during the elections on 16 January, should be given 
legal form. [Words indistinct] that the referendum will be held 
on 27 March. 
  Yuriy Meshkov confirmed his position regarding the 
nonacceptance of quotas in the Supreme Council of the Republic 
of Crimea for deported peoples, noting that quotas for Crimean 
Tatars in the future parliament would be a violation of the 
norms of international law. The candidate for president of the 
Crimean Republic described the Assembly of the Crimean Tatars as 
a real civil and political force. He also said that Crimea has 
enough state attributes but not enough state content: "What we 
need are not the outward signs of statehood but the possibility 
of resolving all economic, political, and sociocultural issues 
by taking into maximum account the Crimean Republic's interests."

  [Text] A terrible tragedy happened last night near the home 
of Crimean People's Deputy Iskander Mamedov, adviser to the 
Crimean Supreme Soviet chairman. When Mamedov and some 
colleagues were entering his house and being met by members of 
Mamedov's family, the sounds of assault rifles and grenades were 
heard. The firing came from two sides. As a result, 11 people 
-- including Mamedov's son and daughter -- were wounded and two 
people were killed. Iskander Mamedov was brought to the 
hospital in critical condition. In the opinion of Lilya 
Budzhurova, a well-known activist of the Tatar movement in the 
Crimea, whose report on the case was broadcast today on Crimean 
radio, the attempted murder of Mamedov, one of organizers of 
Mykola Bahrov's election campaign, was politically motivated. 
  If anyone has any information on this case, please contact 
the police in Simferopol.

  [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas has 
declared his administration is assigning priority to cooperation 
with other Baltic republics, integration into the political, 
economic and defense structures of Europe, and the promotion of 
neighborly relations, primarily with Russia, Ukraine, and 
Belarus. 
  The President announced this Monday [17 January] to the 
Vilnius-based chiefs of diplomatic missions. 
  He said he was planning to visit Belarus and invite his 
Ukrainian counterpart Leonid Kravchuk to visit Lithuania. 
Treaties on cooperation and neighborly relations were likely to 
be signed as a result of those visits. 
  Algirdas Brazauskas felt relations had improved between his 
republic and Russia. The discussion, he said, would soon resume 
of an agreement on military transits from Russia to the 
Kaliningrad region via Lithuanian territory. 
  The Lithuanian President told diplomats that calls for the 
revision of the Pottsdam conference's decision on the 
Kaliningrad region had nothing to do with his administration's 
official foreign policy line. The calls were coming from 
certain members of the Lithuanian parliament.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas declared 
that his republic decided to seek membership in NATO least of 
all because it wants to separate itself from Russia by "an iron 
curtain." 
  "We have not set such a task and are ready to live in 
friendship and mutual understanding with Russia, Belarus, and 
other CIS states," Brazauskas stressed in an exclusive interview 
with Interfax. 
  Commenting on a recent statement by the Russian President's 
Spokesman, Vyacheslav Kostikov (who was puzzled by such a hasty 
step of the Lithuanian leadership and warned that "the expansion 
of NATO to include the countries situated close to Russia's 
borders can in the long run lead to military and political 
instability in the region so important for the fates of peace"), 
Brazauskas said that Vilnius would stay away from polemics with 
Moscow on the issue. Noting that Kostikov's statement was taken 
into account, the president called for careful analysis of 
Lithuania's decision to understand it properly. 
  "In our step, there is no element of confrontation with 
Russia or an attempt to organize confrontation along with other 
Baltic states," Brazauskas stressed. 
  He reported that he had addressed to NATO's Secretary 
General 
Manfred Woerner an application for membership after consulting 
all Seimas (parliament) factions, which backed up the move. "I 
must respect the parliament's view," he said. 
  Brazauskas warned against making a big stir of Lithuania's 
decision to send an official letter to Woerner. "We realize 
that such an application cannot be approved in Brussels soon or 
as an exception. Writing a letter to NATO today and expecting 
it to grant membership tomorrow would be naive," he noted. 
  The president welcomed the "Partnership for Peace" concept, 
endorsed at NATO's summit in Brussels earlier this month and 
stressed that through it Vilnius was going to promote 
cooperation with the alliance. 
  He disagreed with those who fear that the success of 
nationalists at the elections in Russia on December 12 was the 
decisive factor that prompted Lithuania's application to NATO. 
He recalled that Vilnius had taken the first steps in this 
direction as early as the beginning of last year. 
  "I do not see in our step any demonstration and desire to 
isolate ourselves. We are neighbors with Russia and we'll live 
side by side, all the more so since there is a unique situation 
with the Kaliningrad region of Russia," Brazauskas said. 
Although the region borders with Lithuania and Poland, it has 
no common border with the main territory of Russia. 
  "It is conceivable that a collective security system should 
cover the whole of Europe, and it seems to me that all states, 
Russia included, should come to realize that. All of us want 
peace rather than confrontation on the European continent," the 
Lithuanian president noted. 
  In his words, Lithuania's attitude towards Russia remains 
unchanged, "and we hope that Moscow will not change towards 
Vilnius either," Brazauskas said. 
  At the same time, he warned that if the Russian leadership 
fundamentally changed and so did its policy in the Baltic 
states, Vilnius would have to correct its actions.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 18, BNS -- The Polish Foreign Ministry 
released a statement in response to a letter signed by 72 Polish 
lawmakers, who expressed concern about the status of Poles in 
Lithuania and the course of talks between the two countries. 
  The letter, addressed to the Polish president, the prime 
minister, the foreign minister and the Polish parliament's 
speaker, appeared in the Lithuanian press last week. The 72 
demand that Poland observe 5 principles when signing an 
agreement on friendship and cooperation with Lithuania. The 
agreement has been under negotiation since last summer. 
  In its statement, the Polish ministry assures lawmakers that 
it is no less concerned about the interests of Poles in 
Lithuania than the Polish parliament. According to the 
statement, the Polish Foreign Ministry holds that Lithuanian 
Poles must be guaranteed equal rights in Lithuania. 
  As previously reported, 72 Polish lawmakers, mainly members 
of the parliamentary majority, demanded to create a cultural 
autonomy of the predominantly Polish-populated Vilnius and 
Salcininkai regions, to return nationalized property to Polish 
social organizations, to exclude history from the main agreement 
with Lithuania, etc.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 18, BNS -- Possibilities have appeared 
for Lithuania and Poland to reach an agreement, said Vytautas 
Landsbergis, leader of the Lithuanian parliament's rightist 
opposition. 
  At a press conference Monday [17 January], Landsbergis 
commented on a meeting of Polish and Lithuanian politicians, 
scholars and representatives of social organizations, held in 
Warsaw Saturday. The meeting's participants focused on common 
political interests of both countries and also discussed the 
problem of Russian military force in the Kaliningrad region. 
Lithuanian and Polish politicians must seek the region's 
demilitarization, Landsbergis said. In his opinion, the struggle 
against the emerging Russian imperialism could also be a common 
interest, as well as Lithuania's rapproachement with the 
Visegrad Treaty (Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech 
Republic). 
  The opposition leader specified some reports that Poland 
regrets the absence of an agreement on friendship and 
cooperation with Lithuania. Landsbergis said the Lithuanian side 
emphasizes the need to sign a separate declaration on the 1920 
occupation of the Vilnius region by Poland together with the 
main agreement. 
  Landsbergis said Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
expressed hope that the problem will soon be solved. 
  The opposition leader said the Polish side apologized 
several 
times for a letter to President Lech Walesa, signed by 72 
members of the Polish parliamentary majority. As previously 
reported, the letter suggests very categorical terms of signing 
the agreement. Landsbergis said an apology was also made by the 
chairman of the Polish party in power. 
  "Possibilities to agree do exist, but there are opponents 
who 
seek to prevent this."

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 18, BNS -- Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas bowed to pressure of the people who surround 
him and returned the law on income declaration by officials and 
civil servants to the parliament for reconsideration, MP [member 
of parliament] Rimantas Dagys said at a press conference Tuesday 
[18 January]. 
  Social democrat Dagys said the motives for rejecting income 
declaration were the same as in the case when a law on illegally 
acquired money during the introduction of the litas was vetoed. 
The lawmaker said the president's step may be regarded as 
concessions to financial groups that evade taxes and fear that 
the true, "as if social democratic," nature of state authorities 
would be revealed. 
  In Dagys' words, the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor 
Party 
"no longer follows social democratic principles." He said the 
fact is exposed by attempts to push through an amendment to the 
law on collective conflicts that would ban strikes in the 
systems of interior affairs, state defense, public transport, 
energy and health care. 
  Dagys said he participated as a guest in a conference of 
Nordic social democratic parties and the governing committee of 
labor unions. The conference discussed preparations for a long 
instability period in Russia, he said. The lawmaker told 
reporters that Nordic social democrats seek to implement the 
idea of cooperation in the Baltic sea region. "This would be a 
possibility to protect our interests if a threat from the East 
appears."

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 18, BNS -- Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas wished "many good relations" to foreign 
diplomats accredited to Lithuania and thanked Western countries 
for their support in the process of the Russian troop withdrawal 
from Lithuania. 
  The president's annual meeting with foreign diplomats in 
Vilnius Monday [17 January] was attended by 29 ambassadors and 
charges d'affaires residing both in Lithuania and other 
countries. 
  Commenting on Lithuania's steps toward European political, 
economic and cultural systems, Brazauskas said his country does 
not want a borderline to be drawn between blocs either "to the 
east or to the west of Lithuania." He said Lithuania's official 
request to be admitted to NATO does not mean that the present 
state of relations with Russia and other Eastern countries would 
be altered. 
  The president said "some things were done to improve 
relations with Russia" last year, but a number of problems still 
await solutions. 
  Brazauskas said he categorically opposes suggestions to 
review the decisions made at the Potsdam conference, especially 
those concerning the Kaliningrad region. As regards the region, 
Lithuanian-Russian relations are good, he said, but added that 
Kaliningrad must be demilitarized by "that country" (Russia). 
  Discussing Lithuania's domestic policy, Brazauskas expressed 
hope that a stable government will be preserved because there 
have been no serious arguments for holding early parliamentary 
elections. In his opinion, the country's economy has stabilized 
and some success has been achieved in the struggle against crime. 
  During his discussion with Reinhard Kraus, German ambassador 
to Lithuania, the president mentioned his intention to visit 
Germany this year. 
  Brazauskas also announced his intention to invite the 
Ukrainian president to Lithuania and to visit Minsk himself. 
  A letter from the Italian president was presented to 
Brazauskas by Franco Tempesta, Italian ambassador to Lithuania, 
but the Lithuanian president's press service was unable to say 
anything about its contents.

  [Excerpt] Vilnius, Jan 17, BNS -- MP Vytautas Petkevicius, 
member of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP], 
was approved as the new chairman of the parliament's National 
Security Committee Monday. 
  Petkevicius was supported by all seven committee members 
present at the meeting. Five other committee members, all 
representatives of the rightist opposition, were not present. 
  The new chairman said he will resign immediately if work 
does 
not go smooth in the new post. Petkevicius said his primary aim 
is to deal with the critical situation in the armed forces. 82 
deaths were reported in the Voluntary State Defense Service over 
the past two years. Legal action in the state defense system was 
taken 162 times for the loss of weapons, assaults and other 
criminal offenses. 
  Petkevicius was elected in accordance with the parliament's 
resolution saying that the post would belong to the ruling LDDP 
faction. But neither Petkevicius, not three other members of the 
committee, have registered themselves on the LDDP faction after 
the new faction registration rules came into effect. 
  Petkevicius was the acting chairman of the committee for 
several months after the resignation of MP Gediminas Kirkilas.

Brazauskas expressed gratitude to the Belarussian Government and 
special services for extraditing the alleged state criminals who 
are accused of high treason and complicity in aggravated murder. 
As a result of a military aggression in Vilnius Jan. 13, 1991, 
13 civilians were killed and around 700 injured. 
  The Lithuanian president expressed hope that the 
investigation of the January 13th case will be fast and smooth 
and that "justice will finally be restored."

  [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas and 
Ceslovas Jursenas, chairman of the Lithuanian Seimas, received 
Antonin Baudys, Czech Republic minister of defense, who is on a 
three-day official visit to Lithuania. 
  During the meeting with the president, the Czech defense 
minister reported that the Czech Government adopted a decision a 
week ago to sell all types of weapons to Lithuania without any 
restrictions. 
  At the moment Lithuania is buying only pistols from the 
Czech 
Republic. However, Linas Linkevicius, minister of national 
defense, said that a commission of specialists had already been 
set up to investigate other types of arms Lithuania could buy in 
the Czech Republic. 
  The Czech Government also gave Lithuania 2 million kronas, 
which is about $60,000, to pay the fees for five Lithuanian 
military groups that will come to study the peace-keeping 
operation at a specially designed training center in [words 
indistinct]. 
  The Czech Republic pays much attention to this kind of 
operation and the NATO initiative [words indistinct] and this, 
according to the Czech politicians, is the most direct and 
concrete way to NATO. 
  Antonin Baudys also told Algirdas Brazauskas that 
Lithuania's 
wish to join NATO had influenced the position of the Czech 
Government on this issue. 
  Speaking to Ceslovas Jursenas, the Czech minister of defence 
said that his country expected to become a member of NATO in 
five years. 
  Talking to the journalists Antonin Baudys was more careful 
and did not mention any specific date. He only said that this 
would depend on when NATO will see that the Czech Republic was a 
reliable partner, which he said would not take too long. 
Besides, according to Antonin Baudys, not only countries of the 
Visegrad triangle should be simultaneously accepted into NATO, 
but also the Baltic countries and Bulgaria, Slovenia, and 
Romania. 
  The Czech minister of defense also said that the Visegrad 
triangle was not a closed structure, but should embrace all of 
Central and Eastern Europe. At the moment, the Czech Republic, 
without declaring publicly its intentions to proceed toward 
NATO, is making concrete steps in this direction. 
  This year joint military exercises are to be held with (?the 
Netherlands) and France within the framework of Partnership for 
Peace. The military structures are being reorganized according 
to the NATO model. 
(Andrius Vasiliauskas), representative from the Ministry of 
National Defense, who was accompanying the delegation, told the 
journalists that the Lithuanian military structures were 
established according to the NATO model from the start.

  [Text] The Lithuanian Seimas has rejected the president's 
veto on a law devoted to improvements in agriculture. Today, 
the Seimas endorsed the law passed in December. This document 
was returned by President Brazauskas to the Seimas to 
reconsider. It was stated in his decree that some norms of the 
law did not correspond with the principle of establishing market 
economy. The government diktat, legalized by this law, to all 
agricultural producers, irrespective of the form of their 
ownership, was the most unsuitable to the president. The law, 
among other things, provides for quotas of the purchase of 
agricultural products, fixed by the government, to all 
enterprises processing agricultural products. 
  According to the constitution, the law repeatedly passed by 
the Seimas, must be signed by the president within three days 
and announced without delay.

<F P=106> [Sixth article in a series by Virginijus Gaivenis: "Who </F>
Armed National Defense? (6)"] 
  [Excerpts] Former National Defense Ministry [KAM] leaders 
set up a commission to determine prices, headed by Deputy 
Minister S. Vasiliauskas. [passage omitted] I had a chance to 
speak with the latter the day before yesterday. He said that 
seven firms had offered helicopters for sale. Four of them were 
professional commercial companies directly associated with 
aircraft making plants with a strong record of providing 
repairs, spare parts, and specialists. As the commission 
chairman noted, the prices proposed by all of these companies 
had matched their helicopters. According to S. Vasiliauskas, 
the choice of the firms "Akvel" and "Mingrin" was not 
accidental, because the latter proposed the latest technologies. 
In addition, these firms guaranteed one year of free 
maintenance, and the commodity offered by the firm "Akvel" was 
in Lithuania. These facts decided their choice as the partners. 
The experts' commission assessed the "Akvel" helicopter at 
$900,000, while the price set by the firm was $1.2 million. The 
KAM commission announced that the terms proposed by the partners 
were acceptable. Thus, it suggested that agreements with the 
companies "Akvel" and "Mingrin" be concluded. In reply to the 
question of whether there had been any public bid, Mr. S. 
Vasiliauskas said that there had not been any public 
announcement. The ministry was preparing to buy helicopters 
from a foreign country, and Lithuanian law does not require any 
publicity in such cases. The commission received proposals from 
Air Force Commander Z. Vegelevicius. It had only to vote on 
whether one or another proposal was good or bad. "The role of 
our commission was silly," acknowledged the deputy defense 
minister. "I think that prices should be set differently." S. 
Vasiliauskas claimed that the helicopter deal with the companies 
"Akvel" and "Mingrin" had been very successful. However, when I 
asked him why the ministry paid $3.5 million for three 
helicopters, when it was possible to buy similar aircraft much 
cheaper from Russia last year, the deputy minister replied that 
he had commanded his subordinates to "knock down" the prices as 
much as possible. The deputy minister could not explain why the 
helicopters had arrived without certain parts, why they had not 
been removed from Russia's air register, and why they had 
differed from the type indicated in the agreement. Under the 
agreement, Lithuania had to receive transport helicopters, while 
the National Defense Ministry got helicopters for tourists. 
[passage omitted] 
  Who will answer for all of this? As far back as 21 July 
1993, Minister A. Butkevicius issued an order approving the 
conclusions submitted by the KAM price commission and 
authorizing Air Force Commander Z. Vegelevicius to sign 
contracts with the stock companies "Akvel" and "Mingrin." The 
agreements on the purchase of three helicopters were signed on 
time, and even more quickly than usual. However, as we have 
already reported, in the early summer of 1993, the KGB unit in 
Smolensk prevented an operation whereby 10 military MI-8MTV 
helicopters had to be transferred to Lithuania through the 
Russian air transport company "Vitiaz" and the Kaunas 
association "Selma." [passage omitted] 
  Ex-Minister A. Butkevicius claimed to RESPUBLIKA that the 
firm "Selma," headed by a three-time convicted president, had 
been proposed as a partner is supplying arms and ships by the 
Russian Baltic Fleet leadership itself. "Selma" had been 
entrusted with the construction of military housing in 
Kaliningrad Oblast. Knowing that the firms "Selma" and "Vitiaz" 
were authorized to conduct the helicopter operation, one could 
assume that the companies "Vitiaz" and "Mingrin" were also 
imposed on Lithuania's national defense leaders by the Russian 
Baltic Fleet command. A. Butkevicius is trying to construe the 
opinion that the refusal of the Russians' proposal would have 
meant the burying of hopes for the Russian Army's timely 
withdrawal. The KAM and its leaders were allegedly pursuing 
noble goals. However, the deplorable and unsuited explanations 
of the former KAM leaders can hardly justify their inability to 
work honestly and properly, or the abuse of their 
responsibilities. 
  Last spring, Chief State Inspector V. Kundrotas documented 
dozens of financial violations at the Defense Ministry. Under 
the 23 December 1991 instruction, 57.86 million rubles [R] were 
transferred to one of the ministry's structural subunits -- the 
Information Service -- for the alleged acquisition of 
facilities. S. Vasiliauskas, its former manager who later became 
deputy minister, concluded three delivery agreements: With the 
joint Lithuanian-U.S. venture "Litvit" -- on the acquisition of 
a military outfit for R38.5 million; with the same stock company 
"Akvel," which had supplied the ministry with helicopters -- on 
the purchase of special facilities for R16 million; and with a 
commercial enterprise of technical supplies -- on the 
acquisition of material assets for R2,226,000. Unfortunately, 
the millions were transferred the very next day to private 
companies which did not fulfill their commitments. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Mikhail Shimanskiy report on interview with Valeriy </F>
Tsepkalo, adviser to the chairman of the Belarusian Supreme 
Soviet on foreign economic issues; date not given: "After 
Ukraine, Belarus Claims Its Share of Uranium"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- The Belarusian leadership is concerned 
about the agreement signed in Moscow by Clinton, Yeltsin, and 
Kravchuk. And during the U.S. President's visit to Minsk the 
extremely delicate question of Belarus's share of the materials 
from the elimination of warheads was raised. IZVESTIYA's 
correspondent asked Valeriy Tsepkalo, the chairman of the 
republic Supreme Soviet's adviser on foreign economic questions, 
to comment on this situation. 
  "The question of the share of the uranium in the tactical 
and 
strategic nuclear weapons being withdrawn from Belarusian 
territory has been discussed in talks between ourselves and 
Russia," Valeriy Tsepkalo explained. 
  "Moscow and Washington formerly prepared an agreement on the 
sale to the United States of the uranium released as a result of 
the elimination of the nuclear warheads on strategic offensive 
weapons. At that time the United States reassured Kazakhstan, 
Belarus, and Ukraine that the agreement would not be signed 
before the question of the distribution of revenue from the sale 
of the uranium was settled. Nevertheless, the United States and 
Russia did sign the agreement. But the United States has 
assured us that the agreement will not come into force until 
agreement is reached on the distribution of the revenue. The 
United States is buying 500 tonnes of uranium over 20 years at a 
cost of $5.5 billion. 
  "The agreement between the United States, Russia, and 
Ukraine 
contains provisions which establish Ukraine's share of uranium 
sales, either in money or in kind -- that is to say, through the 
delivery of industrial uranium for Ukrainian nuclear power 
stations. And most important of all, Ukraine has succeeded in 
resolving the problem of tactical nuclear weapons; in other 
words Russia has agreed to recognize Ukraine's right to the 
fissionable materials in the tactical weapons and count their 
number when determining the profit from the sale of uranium. 
  "For us this is very important. Russia has not recognized 
our right to that quantity of fissionable materials in the 
nuclear weapons withdrawn from Belarus through 27 April 1992. 
But after all, almost half of all the tactical nuclear weapons 
of the former USSR were situated on the republic's territory. 
  "Russia has claimed that the lion's share of the revenue 
from 
the sale of uranium will go toward covering the expense of 
destroying the weapons. However, this does not correspond to 
reality, since Russia has received considerable sums for these 
very purposes from the United States. 
  "We consider it possible to begin talks with Russia about 
our 
share of the profits with the mediation of the United States -- 
that is to say, to prepare an agreement similar to the one 
signed in Moscow."

  [Text] By 238 votes for and 7 against, the 345-member 
[figures as received] parliament in Minsk ratified the CIS 
Charter on Tuesday [18 January]. 
  However, the opposition People's Front abstained, its 
leader, 
Zenon Pozniak, said. 
  State Secretary for Commonwealth Affairs Vladimir Zalomay 
said the ratification "will be of huge importance for shaping 
the country's foreign policy and become a new step by Minsk on 
the way to consolidating the CIS and raising its efficiency." 
  For his part, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, who also 
supports the ratification of the CIS basic agreement, dwelt upon 
the prospects of relations with Russia and a monetary union with 
Moscow. He said that "despite all difficulties, Belarus has an 
economic potential enabling it to negotiate with Russia on equal 
terms." 
  The Prime Minister said that some of the Russian politicians 
who see the union as a handout to Belarus were wrong. He said 
Belarus had never lived at the cost of others and that the 
monetary union would not resolve its problems but create an 
economic environment for removing artificial barriers to 
bilateral cooperation. 
  Kebich strongly attacked Zenon Pozniak's accusations of 
Russian imperialism carried by the parliament-sponsored NARODNYA 
GAZETA newspaper. The Prime Minister said that an overwhelming 
majority of Belarusians opposed to the country's self-isolation 
wanted a union with Russia.

  [Text] The head of the Belarusian parliament, Stanislav 
Shushkevich, thinks that the joining of Belarusian and Russian 
monetary systems should not be viewed as the solution to all 
difficulties. "Our economy should be reformed by ourselves, not 
by Russia," he declared in a televised statement Monday evening. 
  Nevertheless, Shushkevich conceded that a monetary union 
with 
Russia is capable of considerably improving the economic 
situation in Belarus. 
  According to him, to ensure normal working of the proposed 
monetary union it is necessary to fix equal prices for fuel and 
basic raw materials and establish a customs union between 
Belarus and Russia. 
  With reference to the possibility of his resignation during 
the current parliamentary session, Shushkevich said he is aware 
that a group of deputies intended to "raise this issue." He 
would resign on his own, if he believed that the next speaker 
will induce legislators to fix a date for early parliamentary 
elections, Shushkevich said.

  [Text] Minsk, 18 Jan (TASS) -- "I hope that Yegor Gaydar's 
resignation will not affect relations with Russia," Belarus 
Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushevich stated in the 
evening of 17 January in a live broadcast of Belarusian 
television, replying to viewers' questions. 
  He described the situation in Belarus as complicated and 
contradictory, having noted that it should be fundamentally 
changed and that this can be done only through a new composition 
of parliament by early elections, which he is advocating. 
  Having touched on a possible monetary merger with Russia, 
the 
Supreme Soviet chairman stated that if the merger of monetary 
systems produces merely a parity of prices for fuel, one could 
hope for an improvement of the economic situation. "However, no 
one will establish order in our house for us. It is for us to 
decide how we are going to go on living," he stressed.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] Parliamentary Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich, 
speaking on national television late on Monday, said he knew 
that a group of deputies was planning to try to force his 
resignation during a parliamentary session opening in Minsk on 
Tuesday. 
  Shushkevich said he would have stepped down of his own 
accord 
if given assurances that the new Speaker would be able to get 
the parliament to set the date for an early election. 
  For his part, coordinator of the large Belarus faction 
uniting more than 120 deputies, Gennadiy Kozlov, told INTERFAX 
that on a motion from regional groups, more than 100 signatures 
were collected in support of demands for a no-confidence vote 
against Shushkevich. 
  Kozlov says his faction is opposed to the Speaker's 
"gambling 
around the CIS collective security agreement or his 
interpretation of a monetary union with Russia." 
  He said that despite his verbal declarations of support for 
a 
full scale economic union with Russia, Shushkevich "starts 
raising concern about a possible loss of the country's 
independence when it comes down to business." 
  In his words, the key issues facing the second round of the 
parliamentary session include the ratification of the CIS 
founding agreement until January 23, the adoption of a new 
constitution and election law and a concept of the country's 
foreign policy. If the session fails to adopt the new basic 
law, says Kozlov, the Belarus faction will insist its main 
provisions such as presidency and the status of the Russian 
language be put for a nationwide referendum. The faction also 
wants a national verdict on the legitimacy of the Belovezh 
accords overhauling the former Soviet Union, which is a highly 
sensitive issue on the ground, he said. 
  In the meantime, the morning session was focused on the 
ratification of the CIS Charter. State Secretary for CIS 
Affairs Vladimir Zalomay, presenting the paper, said its 
ratification "will be of huge importance for shaping the 
country's foreign policy and become one more step by Minsk on 
the way towards beefing up the Commonwealth and raising its 
efficiency." 
  For his part, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, also 
supporting the ratification of the document, spoke of the 
prospects of relations with Russia and a monetary union with 
Moscow. He said that despite all difficulties, Belarus had an 
economic potential enabling it to negotiate with Russia on equal 
terms. 
  He said "some of the Russian politicians who consider such a 
union as a handout to Belarus are mistaken." Kebich said 
Belarus had never lived at the cost of others. Although the 
union will not solve all of the country's problems, it will help 
create an economic environment clearing many of the stumbling 
blocks on the way towards bilateral cooperation, he said. 
  The Prime Minister mounted strong criticism of opposition 
leader Zenon Pozniak, who accused Russia of imperialism in an 
article carried by the parliament-sponsored newspaper, NARODNAYA 
GAZETA. Pozniak called Russia "a country of God's fools building 
its relations with other states on the traditions of Mongol 
hordes." For his part, Kebich said that an overwhelming majority 
of Belarusians were opposed to the country's self-isolation 
preferring a union with Russia instead. 
  Shushkevich himself in a televised interview on Monday said 
that a monetary union with Moscow could help towards a dramatic 
improvement in the country's economic plight. At the same time, 
he warned that such a union should not be seen as a panacea 
against all troubles. 
  "It is up to us, not Russia, to reform the country's 
economy," Shushkevich said. In his view, to make the union 
work, the two countries must establish equal prices for fuel and 
raw materials and sign a custom union. 
  On the possibility of forming his own party, Shushkevich 
made 
it clear he had pondered over the problem but there was no need 
for one at the moment. "Some politicians in Russia formed their 
own parties, but they did so in the run up to general 
elections," he said. 
  Shushkevich stressed that he would be "physically unable" to 
lead a party because of the huge amount of work he was having to 
cope with as Parliamentary Chairman. 
  It is now known that the Belarusian parliament has ratified 
the CIS charter by a vote of 238 votes for and 7 against. 
Opposition leader Zenon Pozniak said his faction had abstained.

<F P=106> [Svetlana Gamova report: "General Lebed Has Urged the </F>
Dniester Region to Civil Disobedience"] 
  [Text] Chisinau -- "There is daylight robbery taking place 
in the Dniester Region," General Lebed, commander of the 14th 
Army, stated at a meeting with public education workers in 
Tiraspol. "That is why there have been no positive changes in 
the negotiation process." In Lebed's words, he sees a "peaceful 
solution to the question" through "civil disobedience and a 
polite request to the authorities to clear off." 
  Accusations of corruption addressed to top officials of the 
region's administration are heard virtually every week on 
television, as well as at the commander's meetings in labor 
collectives. The purpose of Gen. Lebed's tour of the people, in 
his words again, is "to get rid of all the odious figures, hold 
repeat elections, and bring to power people who command respect." 
  A scandal was caused by recently published documents on 
intrigues involving fuel delivered to the Dniester Region from 
Russia. The main figure in this story is A. Bolshakov, chairman 
of a commission of the Dniester Supreme Soviet and a leader of a 
small enterprise who, according to the documents in question, is 
"KGB agent Berzin." These documents, which had been handed over 
to the security organs of the Dniester Region, soon went missing 
and the region's prosecutor informed the 14th Army's commander 
that "criminal proceedings have been instituted regarding the 
loss of personal and official documents relating to agent Berzin 
of the former KGB." In connection with all these events Lebed 
has stated: "The uncontrolled crime wave in the city forces me 
to take the path chosen by the Black Sea Fleet's men and adopt 
resolute measures to establish public order." 
  Lebed's comments have provoked a response, in particular 
from 
the workers' committee in Bendery which dubbed the commander 
"the black general." Leaflets have appeared in Tiraspol 
informing citizens that the republic is in danger and that a 
military coup is being prepared under the leadership of Lebed 
and Economic Freedom Party leader Borovoy. 
  In the opinion of certain officials of the Dniester Region,

<F P=106> ["Text" of Azerbaijani Defense Ministry communique issued on </F>
17 January; read by announcer] 
  [Text] The Armenian military units launched an attack 
against the Fizuli sector of the front line at 0100 today. 
Azerbaijan's military forces counterattacked and forced the 
enemy units to retreat to their positions, after suffering 
several casualties. 
  According to the information received from the occupied 
areas, the Armenian military command has involved the militia 
units in the fighting to achieve its occupationist objectives in 
Khankendi [formerly Stepanakert] and the other occupied areas in 
Azerbaijan. 
  Meanwhile, helicopters continue to urgently transfer 
reinforcements and military equipment from Armenia to Daghlyk 
Karabakh. They transfer the wounded Armenians back to Armenia 
after unloading their cargo. The dead bodies of Armenian 
conscripts from Armenia are transferred in trucks from Daghlyk 
Karabakh to that Republic through the Lachin corridor every day. 
  More than 1,000 enemy troops have been killed in the recent 
clashes. That has been concealed from the Armenian people. It 
seems that the dissemination of such reports will not be in the 
interest of Armenia's leading circles and those who wage the 
bloody war.

  [Text] Despite great losses in personnel and military 
equipment, the Azerbaijani army still makes attempts to break 
positions of the Karabakh forces along the whole line of 
confrontation, the press service of the Karabakh army told 
INTERFAX. 
  According to the press center, in the morning of January 14 
the Azerbaijani army resumed its offensive after intensive 
artillery preparations. It was on the border of Karabakh's 
Martuni and Azerbaijan's Fizuli regions that the Karabakh 
formations managed to seize several strategic heights on 
Thursday [13 January]. As of 15:00 on Thursday hostilities were 
continuing in this region. There have been no substantial 
changes on other sections of the front over the previous 24 
hours. 
  The day before, supported by three tanks and five armored 
vehicles, 250 Azerbaijani infantrymen attacked positions of the 
Karabakh army on the section Madagiz-Akop-Kamari in Nagorny 
Karabakh's Mardakert region, reports the press center. The 
Karabakh forces were a success while inflicting a flank strike 
against a concentration of Azerbaijani forces. As a result of a 
three hour fight the Azerbaijani detachments appeared encircled, 
and 76 Azerbaijani soldiers were killed. According to 
preliminary information, the Karabakh party has only 11 soldiers 
wounded. 
  Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry asserts that the 
Armenian but not Azerbaijani formations are waging the 
offensive, particularly in Karabakh's north and southeast. All 
attempts by the Armenians to counter-attack were fruitless. 
  The ministry rejected Armenian reports about the seizure of 
several villages in the north of Karabakh's Mardakert region by 
the Karabakh formations. It pointed out that the village of 
Akop-Kamari (its Azerbaijani name - Lyulyasaz) and Madagiz were 
under control of Azerbaijan's armed forces. 
  The ministry also reports that the air defense forces had 
been ordered not to bring down Armenian helicopters heading from 
the Karabakh village of Gadrut to Armenia despite the fact that 
they violate Azerbaijan's air space. Baku believes that wounded 
soldiers are being evacuated on these helicopters. The 
Azerbaijani Defense Ministry indicated that the number of these 
flights had greatly increased over the last time.

artillery preparation, the Azerbaijani troops assumed an 
offensive in two directions -- the Matagis-Akop and Kamari 
section in the Mardakert Region, and the Askeran-Agdam 
direction, informed sources in Stepanakert told Interfax. 
  By 10:00, the Azerbaijani attacks were rebuffed by Karabakh 
forces in the Northern direction. One Azerbaijani tank was 
destroyed and 30 Azerbaijani soldiers were killed. The 
Azerbaijani army had to retreat to the earlier assumed positions. 
  By midday, heavy fighting continued at the eastern limits of 
Nagorno-Karabakh. Both sides are sustaining losses. Local 
fighting continues in the other sections of the front. 
  The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry announced, meanwhile, that 
on Sunday morning, well-equipped Armenian units assumed an 
offensive in the Fizuli Region, moving towards the Iranian 
border. Attacks are being made on the villages of Goradiz and 
Derdchinar. 
  During fierce combat operations the Azerbaijani army 
rebuffed 
the Armenian attack, throwing Armenian units back to the initial 
positions. A source in the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry 
announced that two Armenian tanks, one armored vehicle and 1 
artillery piece had been destroyed. Armenians suffered great 
losses. 
  The same source reports, that in December and January, more 
than a thousand Armenian soldiers were killed or wounded.

  [Text] After the night's lull, Azeri troops launched an 
offensive at 10 a.m. on January 18, in the north of the Martuni 
region of Nagorno-Karabakh, INTERFAX was told by a spokesman for 
the Karabakh Defense Ministry. Reports say fierce fighting 
continues at that section of the front. 
  On Tuesday morning there was a relative lull at other 
sections of the front. 
  In the morning of January 18 an Azeri war plane attempted to 
drop bombs on Stepanakert, the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh. The 
Karabakh air defenses forced the plane away from the city. 
  Meanwhile, a source in the Azeri Defense Ministry spoke 
about 
attempts by the Armenian forces to attack the strategic railway 
station at Goradiz, but were recently beaten off by the Azeri 
army. The station is situated near the Azeri-Iranian border. 
Two attacks to re-capture the station were thwarted. A 
Karabakh tank was put out of action. 
  The source also spoke about fighting on Monday evening to 
the 
east of the Azeri regional center of Agdam, which is under 
Armenian control, as well as at the approaches to the village of 
Novruzlu, where, the source says, a Karabakh armored personnel 
vehicle was put out of action. 
  In the early hours of Tuesday, the fighting at this section 
of the front, as well as in the north part of the conflict zone, 
was restricted by sporadic artillery shelling. 
  The source says four local inhabitants were wounded as a 
result of the shelling of Azeri settlements bordering on Armenia.

  [Text] Azerbaijani President Gaydar Aliyev declared that 
introduction of Soviet forces on January 20, 1990, would have 
been impossible if Baku's former leadership had not permitted 
forces to be introduced. 
  As many as 132 people were killed during those January days 
and more than 700 were wounded. 
  The president voiced his remark during the report of 
Azerbaijan's attorney general Ali Omarov. Omarov, in 
particular, pointed out that the purpose for forces being 
introduced into Baku at that time was primarily to rescue the 
leadership of Azerbaijan's communist party. 
  As the attorney general believes, Azerbaijan's former 
leaders 
Abdurakhman Vezirov, Ayaz Mutalibov, Viktor Polyanichko, Elmira 
Gafarova, and former leader of the republic's KGB Vagif Gusaynov 
should be made answerable for the January 1990 events along with 
the former Soviet leadership at that time and its power 
ministers (Gorbachev, Yazov, Kryuchkov, Bakatin, Primakov). 
  Omarov reported that he had ordered the National Security 
Ministry to institute proceedings against Vagif Gusaynov due to 
the January 20, 1990, events in Baku. 
  Observers do not rule out that criminal charges against 
Vezirov and Mutalibov can be brought as well. 
  The discussion is being continued.

  [Text] Baku, January 15 (Turan)--As a reliable source at 
Azerbaijani President's staff told TURAN news agency, a supposed 
meeting of Azerbaijani and Armenian presidents is being worked 
out. Russian capital Moscow is the most prominent place for this 
meeting. Azerbaijan's ambassador to Russia Ramiz Rizayev also 
did not excluded the possibility of the meeting. 
  Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov told 
the press in Baku recently, that "Armenian party's approach to 
this meeting is of a non-constructive character". 
  To his mind, serious documents have to be prepared to be 
signed by the end of the meeting. Gasanov said that the 
Armenian side neither proposes such documents, nor accepts 
Azerbaijan's proposals. 
  Touching upon the recent interview of Robert Kocharyan, the 
leader of Armenian community of Nagorno-Karabakh to the Russian 
TV, Gasanov said, that "this interview again proved that the 
Republic of Armenia arms Nagorno-Karabakh separatist fighters. 
It has become clear, that Armenian side tries to solve the 
conflict by all means forcibly". 
  Such position, Mr. Gasanov considers, cannot be the basis 
for 
the negotiation process on regulation of the conflict.

  [Text] Moscow, January 17 [date as received] (TURAN)--The 
meeting between Azerbaijani and Armenian presidents has been 
planned for January 25 in Moscow with the Russian side serving 
as mediator, a reliable source at the Russian Foreign Ministry 
told TURAN's reporter. 
  According to information available, Moscow has organized the 
talks at the request of the Armenian side. Another attempt to 
bring about a change in the political regulation of the 
Armenian-Azeri conflict will be made at the meeting with the 
participation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  A pre-meeting dialogue by the heads of foreign offices of 
Azerbaijan and Armenia will take place in Moscow as well. 
  The questions discussed by the foreign ministers will be the 
same for the presidents. 
  Diplomatic experts believe that Moscow and Yerevan will try 
to force Baku to agree to a plan that has been worked out by the 
adviser of the Russian president, Andranik Migranian [name as 
received]. According to this plan, Azerbaijan will have to 
guarantee the granting of status of broad self-government and 
the according political status to Nagorno-Karabakh. The plan's 
terms also include the creation of the so-called "humanitarian 
corridors" from Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh through Lachin and 
Kelbadzhar in exchange for peace. 
  Moreover, this plan envisions the creation of a 
"demilitarized zone" along all the perimeter of 
Nagorno-Karabakh." 
  The proposal also envisages measures providing regular 
transport of energy and free flow of communications in the 
Transcaucasian region. In particular, the plan also sees the 
creation of a railroad command post that would provide strict 
management of the railways.

<F P=106> [Report by Aydyn Mekhtiyev: "Baku Not Yet Ready To Accept </F>
Russia's Plan for Karabakh Problem Settlement, but the 
Document's Main Provisions Have Already Been Determined"] 
  [Text] The talks of Azerbaijani authorities with Vladimir 
Kazimirov, special representative of the Russian Federation 
president, that ended 12 January in Baku, were held in a 
constructive atmosphere and enabled the sides to agree on the 
main principles of a peaceful solution to the Karabakh problem. 
This is what Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov said in 
an interview for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. He emphasized that the 
draft agreement on the peaceful settlement proposed by the 
Russian diplomat drew a mixed reaction from the Baku 
authorities. According to the Azerbaijani minister, the draft 
does not include provisions on the immediate and unconditional 
withdrawal of Armenian troops from all occupied territories, on 
which Baku has been insisting. Instead, the two sides were 
invited to sit down at a negotiating table to discuss all 
contentious matters. Gasan Gasanov asked the Russian diplomat 
to make substantial adjustments to the peaceful settlement 
draft. "Azerbaijan insists on a phased solution to the 
question," he told your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent. "We 
will give security guarantees to the Armenian population of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, but in exchange the Armenian side must create 
all requisite conditions for a return of more than a million 
Azerbaijani refugees to the areas of their permanent residence." 
When asked by the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent about 
Baku's attitude to Moscow's proposal for the Iranian-Azerbaijani 
border to be protected jointly, the Azerbaijani minister said: 
"This proposal may be a matter of discussion after Azerbaijan 
and Iran sign a treaty "On the Regime of the Azerbaijani-Iranian 
Border." During my visit to Tehran we reached agreement on 
setting up a working group for drawing up this document."

  [Text] Baku (January 13) TURAN--TURAN's Moscow 
correspondent reports that the Russian Foreign Ministry sent a 
message to Baku concerning its initiative for regulating border 
control between Russia and Azerbaijan. 
  Azim Yarahmedov, the adviser Baku's Russian Embassy to 
confirmed this report. He said that first Vice-Minister of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry Valeriy Churkin sent to Baku's Russian 
Embassy with a letter requesting the start of consultations with 
the Azeri Foreign Ministry concerning the creation of the free 
economic zone between Dagestan and Azerbaijan. 
  Yarahmedov said that in this case the issue is the creation 
of the joint-ventures, joint-stock societies and trade across 
the border. 
  During the meeting of the Russian embassy officials and the 
first vice-minister of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan, Mahmud 
Mamedkuliyev, an agreement on informing the Azeri vice-premier, 
Abbas Abbasov, about the request by the Russain Foreign Ministry 
was reached. 
  The Russian side proposes to create commissions which will 
flesh out and implement the proposals. Russian ministers and 
the prime- minister of Dagestan will be members of the 
commission. 
  Yarahmedov said that solving of Russian initiative 
positively 
will be advantageous for Azerbaijan and Dagestan as well since 
about 75,000 Azerbaijanis live in the Derbentskiy region of 
Dagestan and scores of thousands of Lezghins, Avars, and Laks 
live in the northern regions of Azerbaijan. "The creation of 
the free economic zone serves to maintain historical and 
cultural relations between the two people, as well as the 
respective relations between the people living along both sides 
of the frontier", Yarahmedov said.--

  [Text] President Geydar Aliyev received Mahmud al-Sa'id, UN 
representative in Azerbaijan, on 17 January. Aliyev briefed his 
guest on the serious situation in the Republic and Azerbaijan's 
recent gains on the front lines. Stressing that Azerbaijan's 
troops control Fizulinskiy, Agdamskiy, Agderinskiy, and 
Kelbadzharskiy Rayons, Aliyev noted that the world has to be 
accurately informed on the situation in Azerbaijan. He also 
recalled his meeting with President Levon Ter-Petrosyan in 
Ashgabat and stressed that he wishes to find a peaceful solution 
to the dispute. 
  President Aliyev said: We want to find a peaceful way to 
retrieve our territory. However, we shall not allow Armenia's 
occupationist forces to continue to tread on even an inch of 
Azerbaijan's territory. 
  Later, Aliyev thanked al-Sa'id for the UN aid to 
Azerbaijan's 
refugees and said that he appreciated his visit to the front 
lines to meet with the refugees. 
  Mahmud al-Sa'id said that the UN organization plans to 
maintain its humanitarian aid to Azerbaijan in 1994. He also 
said that UN aid will be maintained until the dispute is 
resolved. 
  State Adviser Vefa Gulizade attended the meeting.

  [Text] Baku January 15 TASS -- A meeting of Azeri President 
Geydar Aliyev and a personal representative of the Iranian 
foreign minister and director of the Iranian Foreign Ministry's 
Caucasian department was held here today to discuss settlement 
of the Armenian-Azeri conflict. 
  The Iranian diplomat came to Baku after visiting Yerevan and 
Nakhichevan on a peace-making mission in accordance with wishes 
of the two Transcaucasian leaders. 
  Geydar Aliyev confirmed the Azeri stand favoring peaceful 
settlement of the Armenian-Azeri conflict. At the same time, he 
said "the Armenian side continues to stake on force and does not 
hurry to free occupied Arab lands despite resolutions of the 
United Nations Security Council." 
  "Bearing this in mind, the Azeri side had to take measures 
to 
free and protect its lands," stressed the president. He said 
part of the occupied lands, including 40-kilometer section of 
the Azeri-Iranian border, are under control of the Azeri Armed 
Forces. 
  The interlocutors also discussed the protection of the 
Azeri- 
Iranian border and development of bilateral relations in joint

<F P=106> [Report by Mekhman Gafarly: "Establishment of </F>
Trade-Economic, and Diplomatic Relations with Latvia. Changes 
in Republic's Government Imminent"] 
  [Text] The measure of stability that has come to Azerbaijan 
after a prolonged period of power changes has begun to attract 
new economic partners to the republic. One piece of evidence of 
this is the signing in Baku the other day by Latvian Vice 
Premier Ojars Kehris and Azerbaijan Vice Premier Samed Sadykhov 
of an agreement on trade and economic relations between the two 
countries. In addition, Mr. Kehris signed with Azerbaijan 
Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov a protocol on the establishment 
of diplomatic links. 
  The Latvian vice premier announced after the ceremony that 
under the agreement on economic and trade cooperation, 
Azerbaijan would deliver to Latvia mainly fuel and petroleum 
products, and would receive vehicles, in particular locomotives, 
rail cars, and instruments. 
  In the meantime, Azerbaijan's leadership has begun 
behind-the-scenes discussions about a coming reshuffle. It is 
not ruled out that Lala Gadzhiyeva, Azerbaijan's secretary of 
state, will be appointed the republic's ambassador to the United 
Nations in the near future. 
  Lala Gadzhiyeva, doctor of medicine, took the office of 
secretary of state last summer after Geydar Aliyev came to 
power. Before that she lived and worked in Moscow, engaged in 
political activities, and was one of the authors of the scenario 
of Geydar Aliyev's return to power. She is still regarded as 
the current Azerbaijan president's right-hand person. The 
reason for such an influential figure quitting the political 
center stage were Lala Gadzhiyeva's bad relations with Prime 
Minister Surat Guseynov. Using all his influence, the latter 
demanded that Aliyev remove Gadzhiyeva from the office of 
secretary of state. Mrs. Gadzhiyeva tendered her resignation on 
16 December but the president would not endorse it before he 
could find her a suitable position. 
  The vacated position is contested by Foreign Minister Gasan 
Gasanov and Arifa Ragimzade, state counselor for 
administrative-territorial administration. Your SEGODNYA 
correspondent has learned from a completely trustworthy source 
that this position will most probably be filled by Gasan 
Gasanov, who was prime minister under Ayaz Mutalibov and who 
even at that time did not hide his sympathy for Geydar Aliyev.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Sokolov under the "Azerbaijan" rubric: </F>
"Mass Arrests of People's Front Activists Begin. Opposition 
Newspapers Suspended"] 
  [Text] According to the People's Front of Azerbaijan 
(PFA)'s press service, local Internal Affairs Ministry officers 
in the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic have been carrying out 
mass arrests of PFA activists since 12 January. Yadygar 
Mamedli, chief of the PFA press service, said that "at 0500 on 
12 January officers of the Nakhichevan Internal Affairs Ministry 
were put on alert and were ordered to search the apartments of 
the local PFA branch's activists." Within an hour, PFA members 
D.Gasanov, I.Salakhov, V.Asadov, I.Mamedov, A.Mamedov, and 
N.Agayev were arrested. A few days later, another two PFA 
activists were detained in Babek rayon. All the detainees are 
currently held in custody at the Nakhichevan Internal Affairs 
Ministry's investigatory confinement block. 
  During Abulfaz Elchibey's stay in power they fought at the 
Saderak front (in the western sector of the Armenian-Azerbaijani 
border -- A.S.) as members of a volunteer battalion of the 
Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic's Internal Affairs Ministry. 
Following Abulfaz Elchibey's overthrow they all left the 
battalion and expressed their loyalty to the former president. 
Your SEGODNYA correspondent was told at the PFA press service 
that no charges have yet been brought against the detainees. 
  The chief of the PFA press service said in a telephone 
conversation with a SEGODNYA correspondent that "PFA leaders 
assess the arrests as political reprisals and see them as 
preparations for Abulfaz Elchibey's arrest." According to 
Mamedli, "It cannot be ruled out that following the suit of 
their Georgian counterparts the Azerbaijani authorities are 
planning to destroy the former president physically," because 
the other day Azerbaijani General Prosecutor Ali Omarov said on 
republican television: "As long as two former presidents -- 
Ayaz Mutalibov and Abulfaz Elchibey -- exist, the threat of 
political destabilization in the republic remains." 
  Aside from the arrests, the opposition is threatened with a 
newspaper ban. In the new year a number of opposition 
publications, such as MUKHALIFET, DZHUMKHURIET, YENI MUSAVAT, 
KHURRIYET, ISTIGLYAL, and others, have already been suspended. 
At present only 20 out of 600 registered newspapers are being 
published in the republic. While previously officials at the 
"Azerbaijan" printing house, which was resubordinated to the 
presidential staff upon Geydar Aliyev's arrival to power, 
attributed this to a lack of printing equipment, after the 
newspapermen themselves found everything they needed, the 
printing house's chiefs refused to sign a contract with 
opposition newspapers. Opposition leaders say that this runs 
counter to the republic's Law on Anti-Monopoly Activity, which 
was passed last year by the Azerbaijani National Assembly.

"Zaporizhzhya: An Accident at the Atomic Electric Power 
Station"] 
  [Text] As reported by the Information Center of the 
Zaporizhzhya Atomic Electric Power Station [AES], on 12 January 
at 1000 [local time], [radioactive] contamination was revealed 
in a compressed-air pipeline in one of the auxiliary 
technological buildings. No contamination of the plant's 
territory, irradiation of the personnel, or discharges into the 
environment took place. There is no danger either for the 
population or for people working at the plant. 
  It has been tentatively found that radioactive water entered 
the compressed-air pipeline from the fourth power unit due to 
the lack of tightness in one of the locking valves in the 
compressed-air line, which is used for processing the 
ion-exchange resins in filters of the special water-purification 
installation. 
  Work on decontaminating the compressed-air pipeline has 
already been completed. Therefore, the incident was local in 
character and had no effect upon the plant's operation. 
  A commission is investigating the causes of the accident.

<F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Mikhail Melnik -- TASS] </F>
  [Text] Kiev January 18 TASS -- The Ukrainian parliament 
plans to consider an amendment to the constitution at one of its 
upcoming sessions to clarify the status of the Crimea. 
  A proposal to this effect was made by President Leonid 
Kravchuk at a meeting with representatives of local councils in 
Kiev on Tuesday. The proposal was supported by parliament 
Chairman Ivan Plyushch. 
  The amendment would state that bodies of state power in the 
Crimea are to be formed and act on the basis of the Ukrainian 
Constitution and laws and the constitution of the Republic of 
Crimea. The latter should not run counter to the Constitution 
of Ukraine. 
  Kravchuk stressed that no one wants to infringe upon the 
rights of the Crimean people because the Crimea is part of 
Ukraine. 
  Meanwhile, the Crimea held presidential elections over the 
weekend to elect its first ever president. Officials in the 
Ukrainian capital Kiev pinned hopes on Nikolay Bahrov, speaker 
of the Crimean parliament and the sole candidate calling for 
Crimea to remain in a federal Ukraine. 
  However, 38.5 per cent of those who took part in the 
elections voted for Yuriy Meshkov of the Nationalist Russia 
bloc, and 17.5 per cent -- for Bahrov. These two candidates 
will be put up for the runoff elections to be held on January 30.

  [Text] Simferopol -- Yuriy Meshkov, leader of the "Russia" 
bloc and candidate for president of the Republic of Crimea, gave 
a news conference yesterday. He received 38.5 percent of the 
vote on 16 January in the first round of elections. Yuriy 
Meshkov told journalists that the persuasive results of the 
voting in Crimea testify to the possibility of improving 
relations between Crimea and Ukraine and put relations with 
Russia on a qualitatively new level. 
  Responding to a question about a possible reaction from 
official Kiev toward new Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov expressed 
confidence in the ability of Leonid Kravchuk, as one of the 
outstanding politicians of the present time, to regulate the 
political situation in Ukraine and beyond. In the words of 
Yuriy Meshkov, the Ukrainian president stated earlier that the 
dislocation of forces in Crimea ruled out a forcible 
intervention from outside, since it would lead to unforeseen 
consequences. "I have no grounds for not trusting Kravchuk," 
Meshkov stressed. 
  In spite of the fact that the central point of Yuriy 
Meshkov's electoral program is the holding of an all-Crimean 
referendum on the status of the peninsula, the presidential 
candidate refrained at the news conference from stating the act 
of will by the Crimeans, but noted that this will, which was 
expressed during the elections on 16 January, should be given 
legal form. [Words indistinct] that the referendum will be held 
on 27 March. 
  Yuriy Meshkov confirmed his position regarding the 
nonacceptance of quotas in the Supreme Council of the Republic 
of Crimea for deported peoples, noting that quotas for Crimean 
Tatars in the future parliament would be a violation of the 
norms of international law. The candidate for president of the 
Crimean Republic described the Assembly of the Crimean Tatars as 
a real civil and political force. He also said that Crimea has 
enough state attributes but not enough state content: "What we 
need are not the outward signs of statehood but the possibility 
of resolving all economic, political, and sociocultural issues 
by taking into maximum account the Crimean Republic's interests."

  [Text] A terrible tragedy happened last night near the home 
of Crimean People's Deputy Iskander Mamedov, adviser to the 
Crimean Supreme Soviet chairman. When Mamedov and some 
colleagues were entering his house and being met by members of 
Mamedov's family, the sounds of assault rifles and grenades were 
heard. The firing came from two sides. As a result, 11 people 
-- including Mamedov's son and daughter -- were wounded and two 
people were killed. Iskander Mamedov was brought to the 
hospital in critical condition. In the opinion of Lilya 
Budzhurova, a well-known activist of the Tatar movement in the 
Crimea, whose report on the case was broadcast today on Crimean 
radio, the attempted murder of Mamedov, one of organizers of 
Mykola Bahrov's election campaign, was politically motivated. 
  If anyone has any information on this case, please contact 
the police in Simferopol.

  [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze has assessed the performance of 
Georgia's government led by Otar Patsatsia extremely negatively. 
As INTERFAX learned from well-informed sources in Tbilisi, he 
criticized the Cabinet on Monday at a session held by the 
parliamentary majority behind closed doors. The parliamentary 
majority had been formed by Shevardnadze's supporters to ensure 
more coordinated backing for his reforms. 
  Addressing the session, Shevardnadze expressed 
dissatisfaction with the work of some ministers, and even raised 
the issue of forming a new government.

  [Text] Late at night on 17 January, Georgian Security 
Minister Igor Giorgadze gave a news conference in Tbilisi in 
connection with questions of the death of ex-President Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia. Nikolay Mamulashvili reports: 
  [Mamulashvili] At the meeting with journalists most 
attention 
was focussed on the awaited exhumation and identification of 
Gamsakhurdia's corpse, which according to some information is 
buried in a village in West Georgia. Let me remind you that a 
group of experts from Russia, Germany, and Great Britain is 
completely ready to go into these questions. 
  The security minister reported that on 17 January a telegram 
was sent from Chechnya to the head of the Georgian state. It 
was couched somewhat in the form of an ultimatum, in which 
members of Gamsakhurdia's family and his closest associates 
demanded guarantees of the unobstructed removal of the body of 
the former president from Georgia and immunity for those 
accompanying it. On 18 January, in reply to the telegram from 
Chechnya, a telegram was sent to Groznyy in which the Georgian 
leadership confirmed guarantees of unobstructed removal of the 
body and also proposed to Gamsakhurdia's family that it should 
include its own representatives in the group of international 
experts. 
  It is worth drawing attention to a report by the Georgian 
Security Ministry, also based on indirect information, or more 
precisely on the testimony of a certain doctor who examined 
Gamsakhurdia on 2 December, that the former president was 
seriously ill, having being diagnosed as suffering from a tumor 
in the region of the bladder. Igor Giorgadze also said that one 
of the residual groups of the former president's armed 
formations was still in operation in the area where Gamsakhurdia 
was allegedly buried. We do not want bloodshed and casualties, 
the minister emphasized, and therefore we shall not enter the 
area by force of arms but will hold talks. 
  Finally, a delegation from Chechnya is expected to arrive in 
Tbilisi on 18 January.

  [Text] The Georgian parliament extended by one month the 
state of emergency imposed in the country on September 20, 1993. 
  It was Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze who proposed 
extending the emergency at the parliament session on January 18. 
He said it was needed to enforce law and order in the country. 
  Opposition deputies who agreed with the head of state on 
most 
points demanded that he give up the "services" of the Defense 
Ministry in enforcing the emergency and lift censorship of mass 
media. 
  Shevardnadze responded by saying that there was not 
censorship in the country while the emergency was being enforced 
by the police and interior troops. 
  The emergency was extended in a 112 to 23 vote with 15 
abstentions. There are 220 deputies in the Georgian parliament.

  [Excerpts] As you know, a session of the Georgian 
Parliament was held today. The first report in our program 
tells you about the work of this session. 
  [Correspondent] Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the 
Georgian 
Parliament and head of state, delivered a report on the 
extension of the operation of the state of emergency on the 
territory of the Republic of Georgia. 
  Our main task is to restore order in the country. Therefore, 
the address by the chairman of parliament started with a call 
for an improvement of the work of the supreme legislative body. 
He said that it is necessary to introduce a principle of 
coordination in the work of the parliament and to exclude 
spontaneity. Among other central problems Mr. Eduard 
Shevardnadze listed an improvement of the rules of procedure and 
the necessity to step up work in commissions and to listen to 
their reports. 
  Our public, said the head of state, has a great desire that 
fruitless confrontation in the work of the parliament be 
overcome. 
  The main result of the introduction of the state of 
emergency 
is that Georgia has averted a major civil war which was about to 
engulf western Georgia. But for the emergency rules, the 
country might have been in a more serious condition. Unless 
order is established in the country, nothing will save either 
the economy or culture and science, and the country will not be 
able to emerge from the crisis, the head of state stressed. He 
also said that unless order is restored, all achievements and 
agreements reached during talks with other countries will remain 
on paper. We should be guided by this principle in our work. 
  As for an extension of the emergency rules, it was said that 
they should be extended for a month -- of course, provided that 
the parliament agrees. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Jaba Ioseliani presented to the parliamentarians a 
comprehensive report on the results of the Geneva talks. He 
began by criticizing the press, or, rather, the official press. 
Mr. Jaba Ioseliani said that the talks in Geneva finished five 
days ago and almost all international newspapers comprehensively 
covered and assessed this important event. Meanwhile, the 
Georgian population has not been offered even a single report. 
  We will not repeat today the assessment of the talks by the 
head of the Georgian delegation, since Georgian television has 
broadcast several times a long interview covering these issues. 
We will point out that there was a difference of opinion 
regarding the assessment of the results, which is customary for 
some deputies. 
  The significance of the results of the talks will become 
clear to all of us only after their implementation, which is 
expected to start in the immediate future. 
  And that was the end of the Parliament's work today. 
  [Announcer] We would like to add that the republic's 
parliament decided today to extend for another month the state 
of emergency on the entire territory of the republic.

  [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze on Tuesday [18 
January] ordered the republic's Military Prosecutor's Office to 
take measures to return to Russian Armed Forces officers in 
Tbilisi and other cities apartments from which they have been 
forcibly evicted. 
  According to Shevardnadze's press service, there are 104 
such 
apartments, most of which have been seized by Georgian military 
officers, who threaten to use arms if any attempt is made to 
evict them. 
  A source in the press center of Russia's Armed Forces Group 
in the Transcaucasus told Interfax this was the first time the 
Georgian authorities had taken up the matter. If Shevardnadze's 
orders to give back the apartments were ignored, relations 
between Russian and Georgian troops could deteriorate, the 
source said.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Correspondent Vladimir 
Perfilyev] The press is starting to say that this chamber [the 
Federation Council] may become tame and end up in the 
president's pocket. Are you not apprehensive about that 
possibility? 
  [Valeryan Viktorov, Federation Council deputy chairman] Oh 
no, I am not apprehensive. You must have noticed that we have 
very independently-minded people sitting in this hall, and I 
believe it would be difficult to put them in someone's pocket. 
For instance, the head of our chamber is Vladimir Filippovich 
Shumeyko, who is also a very independent person. He will not 
blindly follow instructions, be it from the president or from 
the head of our government, but on the other hand I am 
absolutely convinced that he will not enter into unnecessary 
confrontation between the president and the government.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS observer Lyudmila Aleksandrova under </F>
the general heading "Speakers Elected": "In the Federation 
Council"] 
  [Text] The upper chamber of the new Russian parliament -- 
the Federation Council -- has finally acquired a chairman. As 
expected, he is First Vice Premier Vladimir Shumeyko. 
  True, the intended plan somewhat "misfired": Vladimir 
Shumeyko was one vote short in the first ballot, and a whole 
five votes short in the second (the minimum necessary being 86 
votes). In the second round he was only two votes ahead of his 
main rival Petr Romanov. According to observers, this stance by 
some Federation Council members who refused to support Vladimir 
Shumeyko was largely due to the fact that he is viewed by many, 
if not exactly as "the president's man," at least as a 
representative of the president's team who is called upon to 
fulfill the will of the head of state, imposing it on parliament. 
  Nevertheless, in the course of last night the attitude of 
some Federation Council members changed sufficiently to allow 
the first vice premier to muster even more votes than necessary 
-- 98. 
  From the very beginning the newly elected chairman drew an 
implied distinction between the Federation Council and the State 
Duma, hinting that the upper chamber should positively differ 
from the lower when it comes to constructive approach and the 
absence of political confrontation. In particular he 
highlighted the fact that he would not permit any "lobby 
intrigues" or split in the upper chamber. For this purpose 
Vladimir Shumeyko asked for a time-out until the following 
morning in order to carry out consultations before the election 
of deputy speakers. In his words, preliminary discussion of the 
candidates is needed so that the vote should not lead to a split 
in the chamber and political polarization. He refused to tell 
journalists the names of possible candidates for the posts of 
his deputies, but obliquely intimated that one of them should be 
a representative of the Communists or their sympathizers. 
  Of special interest is the concept of possible relations 
with 
the State Duma as voiced by the chairman of the upper chamber. 
All the signs suggest that the president's team has already 
"rehearsed" the scenario of actions in the event of 
nonconstructive forces ultimately gaining the upper hand in the 
Duma. At any rate Vladimir Shumeyko stated literally the 
following: Under the Constitution, the Federation Council as an 
organ and its individual members possess legislative initiative. 
The same goes for members of the State Duma. And "in an 
extreme case," he went on, it will be possible "in cooperation 
with Duma deputies, who really desire to do something, to 
elaborate legislative acts in joint committees and commissions 
and adopt them straightaway right here."

Excluded"] 
  [Text] Vladimir Shumeyko has given his first press 
conference as chairman of the Russian Federation Federal 
Assembly Federation Council. 
  Replying to journalists' questions, the speaker of the upper 
house called the situation which had arisen during the ballot 
"routine teething troubles." In his opinion, they were due to 
the fact that, on the one hand, members of the Federation 
Council did not want to bring matters to the point of 
confrontation, but, on the other hand, there are people among 
them with different, at times diametrically opposed, political 
views. The speaker stated that he would seek to exclude various 
lobby intrigues from the Federation Council. 
  Vladimir Shumeyko also dwelt on the question of relations 
between the upper house and the State Duma, in particular, in 
the event that the lower house adopts, for whatever reasons, an 
unconstructive stance. He recalled that, under the 
Constitution, in addition to the president, the government, and 
State Duma deputies, the Federation Council as a whole and 
individual members of the Federation Council also possess 
legislative initiative. In that case, he stressed, it is 
possible, in cooperation with Duma deputies who really desire to 
do something, to elaborate legislative acts in joint committees 
and commissions and adopt them straightaway right here. 
Vladimir Shumeyko clarified that he was talking of "an extreme 
case" and "bitter necessity."

  [Text] Moscow January 15 TASS -- The first meeting of the 
Russian Federation Council, the upper parliament chamber, ended 
here today after a five-day work. 
  The deputies have elected the council chairman and his two 
deputies, decided to form ten parliament committees, approved 
their structure and elected chairmen of six committees. 
Regulations on maintenance of Federation Council deputies and 
other documents were adopted. 
  The next meeting of the Federation Council will be held on 
January 31. 
  Kalmyk President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov told ITAR-TASS the first 
meeting of the Federation Council was calm and businesslike. 
"There is no hysteria, confrontation or sharp division between 
the center and region, administration heads and other deputies 
as some had predicted," he stressed. 
  The president denounced attempts to oppose the State Duma to 
the Federation Council. The more they try to separate the 
Federation Council from the State Duma and present it as 
pro-presidential, the more negative reaction of the Federal 
Council members they will provoke, he noted. 
  Federation Council member Boris Nemtsov told ITAR-TASS the 
newly- elected leaders of the upper chamber "quite correspond to 
the level of authority given to the Federation Council by the 
Constitution". The Nizhni Novgorod administration head shared 
fears the Federation Council may become a pocket 
pro-presidential body. 
  "If the Federation Council chairman is a wise man he will 
try 
to get rid of this image in the near future," he added. In the 
opinion of Nemtsov, the upper chamber should form the 1994 
budget, monitor the implementation of the federal treaty and 
complete the formation of constitutional, arbitration and 
supreme courts in the immediate future. 
  Opposition-minded member of the upper chamber Aman Tuleyev 
told ITAR-TASS "approximately 60 per cent of Federation Council 
members vote to a command and some 40 per cent have their own 
opinion". But "there will be less differences when the 
Federation Council starts to discuss specific economic and 
legislative issues, the common sense will win," he added.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valentina Ivanova] </F>
  [Text] Cheboksary, January 18 (TASS) -- The newly elected 
deputy speaker of the Federation Council of the Russian 
Parliament, Velerian Viktorov, former head of the government of 
Chuvashia, said in an interview with ITAR-TASS that he intends 
to defend the interests of Russian regions. 
  He pointed out that it is necessary to pay attention to 
equal 
development of all regions of the Russian Federation, and 
primarily, to the creation of a legal basis adequate to economic 
reform to enable it to go ahead. Viktorov is against radical 
changes and welcomes an evolutional development of society. 
  According to preliminary reports, Viktorov will be in 
charge of economic issues in the upper chamber of the Russian 
Parliament. He came out in support of principally new relations 
expected to be established between the centre and the subjects 
of the federation in the second quarter of 1994 when regions 
begin to contribute a definite amount to the federal budget, 
spending the remaining funds on their own needs.

  [Text] Moscow, 14 Jan -- "The chairman of the State Duma 
absorbs the opinions of all the deputies and no proposal made by 
a deputy should be left unnoticed," Ivan Rybkin, the chairman of 
the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly, stated today at a 
news conference. "The speaker should rise above his party 
allegiance, otherwise he is simply not ready to occupy this 
post," he added. 
  In Rybkin's opinion, the chairman of the Duma should 
organize 
the work of the lower chamber in such a way as ensure that the 
most topical problems receive sufficient legislative support. 
He believes that our legislation does not keep pace with life. 
  The speaker of the Duma said that putting our economic 
legislation in line with realities of life should become its 
priority task. He also stressed that it is necessary to study 
proposals prepared by the Commission for Legislative Proposals 
attached to the Russian President. "It made many valuable 
proposals," believes Ivan Rybkin. Apart from that, the chairman 
of the Duma sees its task in solving the question of the state 
financing of the parties via their factions in the lower chamber 
of the Federal Assembly, as well as maintaining interaction with 
those parties whose representatives were not elected to the 
parliament. 
  "The main committees of the Duma should be formed in 
proportion to factions' numbers," believes Rybkin. At the same 
time, he noted that "leaders of the deputies' associations today 
are unlikely to agree to act as heads of the committees because 
they already have enough organizational work to do in the 
factions and deputies' associations." 
  Speaking about the economic reform in the country, Ivan 
Rybkin stressed that they need some corrections. "We should be 
searching for more intelligent solutions that suit the Russian 
realities," he believes.

  [Text] Using his constitutional authorities, the State Duma 
speaker must "accumulate the opinions of all deputies" and 
"should distance himself from all political parties and 
movements." Ivan Rybkin, Speaker of the Federal Assembly's 
lower chamber, expressed this position at his first press 
conference on Friday. He said he "opposes any coercive methods 
to solve problems." 
  When asked about his party activity in Volgograd, he 
recalled 
that 4 out of the 30 years of his service was spent engaged in 
party work and before that he headed a chair at the institute. 
  In his opinion, the State Duma must focus its attention on a 
package of economic decrees because legislative activity in this 
sphere "is far behind the real life." 
  He believes that "there is much of value" in the plan of 
legislative activity prepared by the presidential commission on 
legislative proposals. 
  The State Duma speaker must, to quote Rybkin, cooperate with 
all public organizations and parties, including those which have 
appeared outside the parliament. At the same time he stressed 
the necessity to cooperate with the president and government. 
  Rybkin expressed hope that along with extreme factions "a 
center will inevitably appear" in the parliament on the basis of 
the greater part of the Agrarian party faction, deputies of the 
Civic Union who were elected in one-mandate districts, and 
representatives of industrial regions and districts. 
  At the same time analysis of pre-election programs 
demonstrates that representatives of all blocs understand "the 
price of reforms" which the citizens have to pay, that "this 
should be lowered and we must look for cleverer decisions." 
  Responding to a question regarding his bad habits, the 47- 
year old speaker reported that he gave up smoking in 1975, 
although "he started to smoke earlier than he began to walk." 
In his words, he is almost a tee-totaller, enjoying just a 
glass of champagne at New Year. He likes to be busy with his 
car as he knows it very well as an engineer-mechanic. He has 
driven for 30 years and prefers a "fast ride with a tail wind."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- "The major threat to the 
State Duma is the State Duma itself," Vice-Premier Aleksandr 
Shokhin told correspondents here today. 
  He said the Russian Constitution requires two thirds of 
votes 
to adopt a law. According to the Fundamental Law, regular laws 
should be adopted by the majority of State Duma deputies, which 
is 223 Duma members in its current composition. 
  A law can be returned for improvement if the upper 
parliament 
chamber does not approve it or the law is vetoed by the 
president. The veto can be annulled by only two thirds of votes. 
Thus, the deputies should learn to overcome faction differences. 
  "The State Duma may be turned by the opponents into a 
useless 
body, and the constitution carries a mechanism of its 
dissolution," said the vice-premier. 
  He is sure the lower parliament chamber should turn into a 
"normal efficient body and abandon extremism". Cold War 
elements evident in the very second day of Duma functioning 
should be stopped. "If the Duma manages to overcome faction 
ambitions and learns to predict behavior of the upper chamber, 
it will be able to influence the legislative power," he stressed. 
  Shokhin stated with regret some factions did not manage to 
protect interests of the Duma minority. A proposal to organize 
20- deputy factions was voted down. The vice-premier expressed 
the assurance the more independent territorial deputy groups are 
formed they would be considered potentially conciliatory 
mechanisms. 
  In the opinion of the vice-premier, some small factions have 
agreed with large ones on certain distribution of posts in the 
lower chamber. "This cannot be viewed as a mere expression of 
will, it is rather a normal parliamentary agreement between 
factions. It is a good lesson to other parties in the ability 
to reach an agreement," said Shokhin.

  [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- The potential for 
self-organisation of the State Duma is much higher than that of 
the previous parliament. The Duma has already shown 
effectiveness by electing speaker, Nikolay Travkin, leader of 
the Democratic Party of Russia, said at a news conference on 
Friday. 
  Travkin believes the Duma can have a stabilising effect on 
society. 
  He said his party has not entered and is not going to enter 
any blocs, but members of the Democratic Party would be 
gratified if their interests coincide with those of other 
factions. 
  Travkin said the Democratic Party objects to possible 
construction of a new parliament building, believing that this 
would only discredit the new legistative body. 
  He added that a regular congress of the Democratic Party of 
Russia will be held on February 18-19. He said the purpose of 
the congress is to make the party less amorphous and impart to 
it a more rigid structure.

  [Text] The LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] will battle for 
the post of head of the Foreign Relations Committee to be given 
to its leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Deputy party Chairman 
Stanislav Zhebrovskiy told Interfax. 
  In the meantime, Speaker-Elect of the State Duma Ivan Rybkin 
speaking late on Friday [14 January] described Vice Premier 
Aleksandr Shokhin as the only candidate professionally fit to 
take the post. Shokhin belongs to the Party of Russian Unity 
and Concord. 
  At the same time, the Speaker called for committees to be 
formed on a proportional basis so that none of the factions 
remained unrepresented. 
  The Russia's Choice Party [RC] will not allow extremists 
from 
the Zhirinovskiy-led faction to take control of the key 
committees, and above all, the foreign relations committee, RC 
spokesman Kirill Ignatyev told Interfax. He said Zhirinovskiy's 
chairmanship of the committee would mean instability and 
probably war to Russia. 
  The faction will stick to its position in talks with other 
groups, Ignatyev said. Leaders of the parliamentary factions 
and Rybkin-led New Regional Policy group are due to meet at 
14:00 on Saturday to discuss the sharing of committees among 
them.

  [Text] Moscow, 14 Jan -- Deputies in the State Duma have 
adopted a decision to hold a recess in the sessions of the lower 
chamber of the Federal Assembly until 17 January. 
  Opening the evening session, Ivan Rybkin, the elected 
chairman of the State Duma, said that he believed the Duma's 
main task was "to finish structuring itself and begin lawmaking 
work." 
  Boris Zolotukhin, who spoke next, informed the people's 
deputies of a coordinated decision by leaders of deputies' 
associations to hold a recess in the plenary sessions of the 
Duma to allow for the work of factions and deputies' groups. 
During the recess "the nominations for and the number of Duma 
deputy chairmen are to be agreed upon, as well as the 
nominations for the posts of heads of State Duma committees." 
  The composition of the Duma Credentials Commission was also 
approved before the recess. The commission must now elect its 
own head.

  [Text] Speaker of the State Duma Ivan Rybkin and leaders of 
the parliamentary factions ended five hours of intensive talks 
on Saturday [15 January] by reaching agreement on the shape of 
the lower house of Russia's new parliament. 
  Speaking afterwards, Rybkin said all factions had agreed to 
his proposal for a Russia's Choice candidate to become his First 
Deputy and the RC is expected to inform him about its choice by 
11:00 on Sunday. 
  Four other Deputies to be elected from the LDP, Women of 
Russia, Communists and the New Regional Policy alliance are yet 
to be named. 
  It was also agreed that the Duma council would compromise 
all 
faction leaders, each of them having one vote, as well the 
Speaker and his Deputies, Rybkin said. Heads of the 
parliamentary committees may also attend council meetings. 
  There will be as many as 21 committees but the dispute is 
over the four main committees: international affairs, defence, 
security and economics, Rybkin said. He hopes that some sort of 
compromise can be struck as the factions meet on Sunday. 
  The Speaker believes that the two chambers of the Federal 
Assembly must work in the same building but "once this did not 
happen", they will have to stay put at their present locations 
rather than spend time and energy to reverse things. 
  Rybkin has also called for a single staff to the Federal 
Assembly. But once the Federation Council has created its own 
staff, the Duma will have to follow suit, he said. 
  For his part, Democratic Party leader Nikolai Travkin said 
there was no objection to the candidacy of Mikhail Mityukov as 
First Deputy Speaker. 
  In his words, the Communists and Women of Russia may 
nominate 
Valentin Kovalyev and Alevtina Fedulova for the posts of Deputy 
Speaker. The LDP may name either its leading member Viktor 
Kobeleyev or former Soviet Deputy Prime Minister in the Ryzhkov 
government Vladimir Gusyev. 
  However, it is not ruled out that the party may nominate 
Vladimir Zhirinovsky as its choice, Travkin said. 
  The DP leader says that if agreement is reached on electing 
the candidates in a package, this can be done within a day's 
work. Failing this, he said, the Speaker will hold a series of 
consultations with the representatives of each faction over the 
weekend. 
  The council of factions will meet at 12:45 on Monday to try 
to resolve the issue before the Duma goes into session at 14:00, 
Travkin said.

  [Text] The State Duma's Russia's Choice faction is likely 
to split up into two factions, this faction's secretary Sergey 
Yushenkov told journalists. He said that behind his faction's 
decisions was the wish to secure an additional vote in the State 
Duma, not inner rifts. The principle of forming up the State 
Duma's Council were preliminarily discussed by the leaders of 
the parliamentary factions and State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin on 
Saturday. 
  The Council is to consist of the speaker and his deputies, 
and the faction leaders. Each faction will have one vote 
irrespective of its membership. 
  The State Duma's biggest faction Russia's Choice has 76 
members. The minimal number of members required for the 
registration of a faction is 35. Some of the Russia's Choice 
members believe therefore that Russia's Choice centrist and more 
radical members may form up two independent factions, said 
Yushenkov. 
  It is not ruled out that some of this faction's embers will 
join the Union of December 12 faction, led by Moscow's Vice 
Mayor Alexander Braginsky and entrepreneurs Irina Khakamada and 
Viktor Bushmin. This group has only 23 members for the moment 
and needs a replenishment of 12 members to get registered.

  [Text] Moscow January 17 TASS -- The State Duma will 
continue its work today. Its session will begin at 14.00. The 
lower chamber of the Russian parliament is expected to discuss 
issues dealing with the election of deputy chairmen of the Duma 
and heads of parliamentary committees. 
  Last Saturday those issues were tentatively discussed at a 
conference of chairman of the State Duma Ivan Rybkin and heads 
of parliamentary groups, held behind closed doors. 
  The planned number of deputy chairmen and the names of 
candidates to those posts remain a secret. The names of 
candidates to the posts of heads of parliamentary committees 
(there are going to be 18 of them) are not known either. 
  In the opinion of observers, the main struggle will develop 
over the posts of heads of the committees on international 
affairs, defence and security.

including the LDPR, had agreed that Zhirinovsly's people will 
not head the commissions on foreign affairs, on defence and 
security, on federation affairs and the budget. 
  In response Zhirinovskiy proposed to create a special 
commission for him which would deal with geopolitical issues, 
according to Ignatyev. 
  "We could not react to it in any other way than with 
sarcasm", he added.

  [Text] Moscow, Jan 17 (AFP) -- Russian parliamentary 
leaders have blocked ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy from heading the influential foreign affairs 
commission, a position which he had wanted, handing him instead 
the chairmanship of a newly- created "geopolitical" commission. 
It was not immediately clear what the geopolitical commission 
would do. 
  Zhirinovskiy and fellow members of the Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP), who took the second largest number of seats in the 
lower house of parliament, also failed to get the key security 
and defence parliamentary chairmanships. 
  The nominations for four deputy speakers of the State Duma 
-- 
as the lower house is called -- and heads of 21 parliamentary 
commissions, were released early Monday prior to voting on the 
appointments by the lower house of parliament later in the day. 
  The 444 State Duma lawmakers are due to vote on the key 
posts 
Monday evening. The nominations were published after discussion 
between the various parliamentary factions over the weekend. 
  Zhirinovskiy had said he hoped to be nominated to head the 
foreign affairs commission in the parliament. That commission 
chairmanship is expected to go instead to Vladimir Lukin, former 
Russian ambassador to Washington and a member of the reformist 
Yabloko party of Grigoriy Yavlinskiy. 
  Security is expected to go to communist Viktor Iliyukhin, 
formerly an official in the dissolved parliament, while the 
nomination for chairman of the defence commission went to a 
member of the reformist Russia's Choice grouping, who was not 
immediately named. 
  Zhirinovskiy's party did win some nominations. Viktor 
Kobeliyev, the party's number two, was proposed as one of the 
four deputy speakers in the Duma, whose speaker was earlier 
named as former communist and anti-reformer Ivan Rybkin. 
  LDP member Mikhail Lemeshev was nominated to head the 
parliamentary ecology commission. The ultra-nationalist party 
is the second largest in the Duma, with 70 deputies. Russia's 
Choice, which backs the government, has 96 and the communists 
have 65. 
  The post of first deputy speaker was expected to go to 
reformist Mikhail Mityukov, former head of the legislative 
committee of the dissolved parliament. 
  Alevtina Fedulova, head of the Women of Russia faction in 
parliament, was proposed for another deputy speaker's post. The 
nomination for the fourth deputy speaker's position was not 
immediately known. 
  Reformist candidates Mikhail Zadornov of Yabloko and Mikhail 
Poltoranin of Russia's Choice were respectively nominated to 
chair the budget and press freedom commissions. 
  Two members of deputy premier Sergey Shakray's centrist 
Party 
of Unity and Accord party were nominated -- Constantin Zatulin 
to head the commission on relations with the Commonwealth of 
Independent States and Shakrai himself to head the regional 
policy commission. The legislative commission nomination went to 
communist Vladimir Issakov. 
  Monday evening's vote by the State Duma deputies will be on 
the nominations as a whole rather than individually. 
  The nomination announcements came after the resignation 
Sunday of Yegor Gaydar, first deputy premier and the architect 
of Russia's reforms. The resignation was accepted by President 
Boris Yeltsin earlier Monday.

  [Text] Moscow, Jan 17 (AFP) -- Communists and reformers of 
the Yabloko coalition will dominate key Russian parliamentary 
committees after a vote in the Duma on Monday [17 January] 
sidelined ultra-nationalists into less important technical 
groups. 
  Right-wing firebrand Vladimir Zhirinovsky was kept off the 
list of chairmen while one of his supporters was elected to head 
a specially established commission on geopolitical affairs. 
  The deputies approved by 290 to 63 votes with eight 
abstentions a package of positions that gave the key 
legislative, security, social and religious commissions to 
communists. 
  Reformists were elected to the vital budget and foreign 
affairs commissions while Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party 
took the commission for industry, transport energy and public 
works and a group that will look into natural resources.

  [Text] Moscow January 17 TASS -- Heads of factions of the 
Russian State Duma decided at their session today that each vote 
cast in the Duma will be assessed in points. A vote cast by the 
speaker will be estimated at five points, first deputy speaker - 
four points, a committee chairman - one point, a deputy 
committee chairman - 0.5 points. During vote-counting, every 
point will be considered equal to 7 deputies' votes. 
  The "Russia's Choice" bloc which received 11 points in the 
Duma council will have the best advantages. It is followed by 
the "New Regional Policy" faction which collected 9.5 points, 
the faction of the Liberal Democratic Party (9 points), the 
Agrarian Party (8 points) and other factions in hierarchy 
depending on the number of points they collected. 
  The council of the State Duma will consist of 15 members, 
including the speaker and deputy speakers, heads of factions and 
deputy groups, committees, chairmen of vote-counting and 
mandatory commissions and a human rights commissioner. 
  The "weightlifting categories" of factions and parliamentary 
groups are expected to play a decisive role when adopting draft 
bills.

  [Text] The list of vice-speakers and Duma committee 
leaders, agreed with the Duma Council, which comprised the House 
Chairman and faction leaders, was endorsed on Monday in a single 
"package". 290 Duma members voted for the list 63 voted against 
and 8 members abstained from voting. 
  Most posts of committee chairmen (5) were secured by the 
Liberal Democratic faction (led by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy). 
However, these committees -- on work and social support, on 
environment, on industry, on natural resources, on agriculture, 
and on geopolitics -- are not the key committees. As Arkady 
Murashev, a leader of "Russia's Choice" has explained to 
INTERFAX, the Committee on Geopolitics was set up specially for 
the liberal democrats so that Zhirinovskiy would not claim the 
post of Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
  "Russia's Choice" takes over 4 committees, including that on 
defence to be led by the faction's Executive Secretary Sergey 
Yushenkkov, earlier the First Assistant to the Federal 
Information Center's President. The former information center's 
chief Mikhail Poltoranin is in charge of the Information Policy 
and Communication Committee. Besides, the "Russia's Choice" 
controls the Committee on Health and the Committee on Duma 
Management. 
  The "New Regional Policy" faction is responsible for 3 
committees -- on education, on property, privatization, and 
economic activity, and on ethnic affairs. 
  The Agrarian party gets two parliamentary committees -- on 
agriculture and legislation and on a judicial reform. The 
latter structure is led by Vladimir Isakov, an opposition leader 
in the dissolved Supreme Soviet. 
  Communists control the Committee on Security and on Public 
and Religious Organizations. This body is led by Victor 
Ilyukhin, sacked from the Procurator General's Office in 1991 
after starting a legal case against Mikhail Gorbachev (the then 
USSR President) on treason charges. During the rebellion in 
Moscow in October, Ilyukhin was in the White House through 
October 4. 
  The Unity and Concord Party takes three committees -- on CIS 
affairs and contacts with compatriots (led by Kostantin 
Zatulin), on Federation affairs, and on local self-government. 
The Committee on Local Self-Government is headed by Anatoliy 
Sliva, a deputy chief of the president's legal department. 
  The "Apple" faction controls committees on budgets, taxes, 
banks, finances (led by Mikhail Zadornov) and on international 
affairs. The Chairman of the International Affairs Committee is 
Vladimir Lukin, Russia's former Ambassador to U.S., who before 
his departure for Washington led a similar committee in the 
previous Russian parliament. 
  A legislator from Russia's Democratic Party Sergey Glazyev, 
the former Minister on Foreign Economic Ties chairs the Economic 
Policy Committee. 
  A representative of the faction of "Russia's Women" leads 
the 
Committee on the Affairs of Women, Family, and Youth. 
  The posts of vice-chairmen of committees were distributed 
this way: six went to "New Regional Policy", five to "Russia's 
Choice", four to the Democratic Party, and the Unity and Concord 
Party, "Apple", the Communist and Agrarian Parties got two posts 
each.

  [Text] Moscow, 17 Jan -- Communist Party representative 
Viktor Ilyukhin, who at one time tried to get Mikhail Gorbachev 
prosecuted for "betrayal of the motherland," was elected 
chairman of the State Duma Security Committee today. 
  Another key parliamentary post, that of chairman of the 
Defense Committee, went to Sergey Yushenkov of Russia's Choice. 
  There will be 23 committees in the Duma in all. Vladimir 
Isakov from the Agrarian Party has been elected chairman of the 
Committee on Legislative and Judicial Reform. In the last 
parliament he was one of the main opponents of presidential 
policy. 
  The Committee on the Budget, Taxation, Banking and Finance 
is 
headed by Mikhail Zadornov from the Yabloko bloc. Sergey 
Glazyev, who was recently forced to quit the post of minister 
for foreign economic relations, is chairman of the Committee for 
Economic Policy. He now represents the Democratic Party. 
  Vladimir Lukin, former Russian ambassador to the United 
States, from the Yabloko bloc, has become chairman of the 
Committee for International Affairs.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1900 GMT on 16 January, as part of 
the "Voskresenye" program, carries a video compilation of 
statements made by Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy. The recorded excerpts come from a Zhirinovskiy 
address to the State Duma on 13 January. 
  Zhirinovskiy is shown standing at the State Duma podium 
saying: "One of our party's representatives has said that a 
psychiatric examination is required here. I agree. On one side 
of this parliament there are quite a lot of candidates for it, 
and I'll certainly see to it that it's done in the next two 
years, through our intelligence services. And in two years 
we'll have papers indicating which ones of you have had which 
diseases, and for how long." 
  The video cuts to a later portion of Zhirinovskiy's address: 
"Don't interrupt while.... [shouts] Shut up! [Bangs fist on the 
podium] I am speaking here now. Do you expect me to let you 
make all this noise while I'm speaking? So get out of the hall, 
get out! All of you, get out!" An unidentified voice calls out 
to Zhirinovskiy. He continues, "All the candidates for lunatic 
asylum." A different unidentified voice says, "Turn the 
microphones off, enough of that." 
  Zhirinovskiy continues: "Go on, stay in your seats. You 
haven't spent long enough in prisons under communists! Just 
look at you, how many of you there are!" 
  The video cuts to another portion of Zhirinovskiy's address: 
"In the autumn of 1995, most of the people who will be sitting 
here will be representatives of real democratic parties, who 
will never interrupt a speaker. Yes, that's exactly what I 
mean, people repeating `time is up' all the time, and you, Mr. 
Chubays, you'll be making this sign when you're in the cell, in 
Lefortovo prison. You'll be making this sign [Zhirinovskiy taps 
himself on the wrist] in the cell, asking for your lunch." 
  The video cuts again. Zhirinovskiy says, "I have a different 
role, and the party believes we are destined for something 
different. We are waiting for other elections." 
  The video cuts and Zhirinovskiy continues: "I would gladly 
have agreed to carry out the functions of leader of the Russian 
parliament as it would have been an example, not just for this 
country, not just for Europe, but for the whole world. After 
all, just two days that I spent in Europe sent the entire planet 
reeling, all the diplomats, all the ministers." 
  The video cuts to Zhirinovskiy saying, "The entire Russian 
nation -- not those with guttural speech or dual citizenship -- 
need me to be in good health." 
  In the final excerpt of the speech Zhirinovskiy says, "I am 
waiting for presidential elections in Russia. And rest assured 
that I'll have enough to speak to you about after that."

<F P=106> [Report by Robert Minasov, Yevgeniy Skukin, and ITAR-TASS </F>
under the general heading "Speakers Elected": "In the State 
Duma"] 
  [Text] By way of an introduction to the report on the 14 
January morning session of the State Duma, we would like to 
return to the events of the previous day. 
  At his press conference Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the 
Communists, stated that the "Russia's Choice" faction has in 
effect already disintegrated, and hence no longer represents any 
serious counterweight to the recently formed bloc of the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the Agrarian Party, 
and the Democratic Party of Russia, which numbers 115 deputies. 
  Deputy Mikhail Poltaranin did not agree with Communist 
leader 
Gennadiy Zyuganov's assertion of a split in "Russia's Choice": 
  "All that happened is that two candidates for the post of 
Duma chairman were discussed inside the faction. As a result 
Sergey Kovalev was nominated." 
  "But in that case, Mikhail Nikiforovich, what in your 
opinion 
is the reason for the democratic blocs' failure in the 
preliminary ballot?" 
  The correlation of forces in parliament is very complex. And 
it is not constituted in our favor. But it is the cross section 
of society which we have and which we received in our 
parliament. In addition, just like before the elections, the 
democrats are uncoordinated. We reach agreements with other 
groups, but when we look at the breakdown of the vote, in 
general one-half of the votes go astray, as the saying goes. 
When there is no overall majority, we cannot afford to blow hot 
and cold in this way: Every man counts. Especially since there 
are less of us than the "Zhirinovskiyites," Communists, and 
agrarians. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's "coronation" speech 13 January 
roused 
the indignation of the majority of deputies. Let us cite 
excerpts from this offensive speech by the leader of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia, which reached hysterical 
proportions. Addressing deputies he uttered the following: 
"You are not yet mature enough for a normal parliament.... I 
agree to undergo psychiatric examination.... My two-day visit 
to Europe made everyone sit up.... I am not suitable for the 
role of parliament's traffic controller (in other words chairman 
of the State Duma). My health will be spoilt by Chubays, 
Kozyrev, Fedorov.... But my health is necessary for the entire 
Russian people. Mr. Chubays (addressing Chubays), don't look at 
the clock, you will have time to look at it in your cell in 
Lefortovo.... Quiet! (taps with his heel on the rostrum). Get 
out of the hall, out, all of you! I am waiting for the 
presidential elections. Then I will show you!" 
  The mood of the majority of those present was expressed by 
Sergey Shakhray, who spoke directly after Zhirinovskiy: "Our 
parliament could be economically self-sufficient if we start 
selling tickets for Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's performances." 
  Everyone was pretty much bored stiff by the wait for the 
results of the election of the State Duma chairman. But it 
became known in the lobbies before it was announced officially 
that 47-year-old engineer Ivan Rybkin had been elected State 
Duma chairman. 
  From our files: Ivan Petrovich Rybkin was born in 1946; he 
is Russian, has higher education, and is a member of the Russian 
Agrarian Party and deputy chief of the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Agriculture Main Administration of Water Supplies.

<F P=106> [Leonid Nikitinskiy article: "The Communists Won the </F>
Struggle for the Post of Speaker of the State Duma"] 
  [Text] By the time this issue was being signed to press 
the final, official results of the secret ballot for the 
election of State Duma chairman had still not been announced. 
However, news agencies have already reported that the election 
has been won by Ivan Rybkin, the candidate from the agrarian and 
communist bloc and former leader of the "Communists of Russia" 
faction in the former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet. 
  The elections for the chairman of the chamber began with the 
nomination of 10 candidates and it is highly unlikely that this 
was a surprise to any of them. Nevertheless, four of them 
refused to stand. 
  Top of the list was Zhirinovskiy, who used his allotted few 
minutes on the platform to issue insults and threats against his 
rivals. Zhirinovskiy's reason for his withdrawal was, he said, 
his unwillingness to work as a "traffic controler." This 
argument does not stand up to criticism. The chairman of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] himself could not 
stand for the post of parliament's "traffic controller" but any 
other member of that faction could. 
  However, the awesome LDPR is clearly not overendowed with 
potential speakers. The experience with Georgiy Lukava, whom 
Zhirinovskiy had already tried to direct from the provinces, 
demonstrated that the chairman's place must be occupied by 
someone who is at least more competent. Is there one in the 
LDPR? If there is, will he not use the protection of the 
independence guaranteed by the post of speaker to move away from 
the fuehrer's influence, thus splitting the falange and creating 
a second center of gravity in it? 
  Zhirinovskiy undoubtedly asked himself these questions 
before 
taking the platform. But they were meaningless in view of the 
main fact that today an LDPR candidate has no real chance of 
putting together either a relative or -- even less -- an 
absolute majority in the Duma. That is why the faction's 
general secretary gave the order to support a different 
candidate -- Yuriy Vlasov, it soon emerged. This is also 
interesting because Zhirinovskiy decided to back not a weak and 
ultimately manageable candidate but a strong and probably 
unmanageable candidate. 
  Anatoliy Lukyanov, apparently, was the only candidate who 
withdrew honorably because he was tired and we forgive him this 
little ruse, which is that he did not ask Nevzorov to simply not 
nominate him. The same cannot be said about Valentin Kovalev -- 
a nonparty candidate from [ot] the communist party, who withdrew 
his candidacy before the vote in favor of Ivan Rybkin, the 
nominee from the agrarian party, which was clearly agreed in 
advance. 
  The reasons for the withdrawal of Sergey Shakhray, a 
politician skilled in affairs of this kind, are not so simple: 
He clearly realized that neither he nor any other members of 
his faction had a chance of making a breakthrough in the first 
round but he has hardly abandoned the idea of occupying the 
speaker's chair once and for all. Most probably, Shakhray (like 
the Women of Russia faction) weighed the situation up and came 
to the conclusion that the first round of voting would not bring 
anyone success and that therefore it was better not to enter the 
fray until round two. 
  The election speeches of the remaining candidates were 
similar in that everyone (with the exception of Yuriy Vlasov who 
had bluntly stated to the Russia's Choice representatives in the 
hall: "I have opposed you and will continue to do so") tried to 
emphasize their commitment to parliamentarism and respect for 
the rights of minorities and to a greater or lesser extent 
declared that they would be apolitical if elected to the post of 
chairman of the chamber. For all the craftiness (greater or 
lesser, depending on the candidate) of these assurances they can 
all serve as testimony to the fact that the guiding principles 
of the deputies' corps, when compared with the Supreme Soviet, 
have indeed switched to some extent from political confrontation 
toward the ideas of cooperation and a desire for compromise in 
the spirit of true parliamentarism. 
  The finest and most tragic performance as a candidate 
speaker was undoubtedly the rearguard action fought by Sergey 
Kovalev. Soberly assessing the potential of its faction, 
Russia's Choice decided not to nominate from its existing 
reserves a candidate whose chance of success looked more 
realistic. Sergey Kovalev, a man who is by no means as naive as 
some of his opponents would arrogantly like to think, ascended 
the platform like Golgotha and as expected was insulted by the 
mob (using the term here in the sense that even the most 
respectable and highly organized meeting can turn into a mob at 
times) and fully demonstrated the meaning of the commandment to 
turn the other cheek. 
  Understandably in the table of the overall weighted voting 
[reytingovoye golosovaniye], Kovalev was second from last (138 
votes). But third from bottom was Vladimir Medvedev, leader of 
the "New Regional Policy" faction formed the day before and 
consisting of independent deputies, and this rating demonstrates 
more the inability of the democratic factions to carry out 
organizational work in the parliament: The 15-minute recess 
before the voting, I felt, could have substantially altered that 
result and possibly have taken Medvedev into the semifinal as an 
alternative to the communist Ivan Rybkin. 
  As these notes are being made up for print, the finalists on 
the platform at the former CEMA [building] will be Ivan Rybkin 
(233 votes) and Yuriy Vlasov (200 votes) who, in the political 
sense, are certainly not alternatives to one another. It is 
possible to forecast with a good deal of confidence (although by 
the time this newspaper is signed to print this result will be 
known accurately) that neither of the contenders will secure 223 
simple [zavetnyy] votes in a conventional (rather than a 
weighted) ballot. 
  Under the rating vote it is possible to support several 
candidates and thus, if you consider the overall disposition of 
the three major blocs, the votes of the democrats the day before 
became "black balls" for the two finalists while the votes of 
the Communists and Zhirinovskiy's supporters were "white balls" 
again for both candidates. In the final, however, complicated 
by the secret procedure of voting via booths when you can only 
vote for one or the other [alternativno], Rybkin must lose the 
votes of the LDPR faction and Vlasov the votes of the Communists. 
  We can take the length of time that the Duma needs to 
collect 
223 votes for a candidate speaker as a measure to some extent of 
the standard of its "parliamentarism," taking this term to mean 
first and foremost the ability to move toward a mutual, 
constructive compromise which takes into account the right of 
minorities. At the moment the Duma is split into three parts in 
which each of the three sectors with less than 50 percent is in 
the minority no matter what the disposition of forces is. 
  In the near future, under the catalyzing influence of the 
process of elections of the speaker in the Duma, a fourth quite 
powerful sector will be structured and it seems that this 
faction will be the "New Regional Policy." It is seeking to 
occupy the political center where it can absorb Shakhray's Party 
of Russian Unity and Accord because of a coincidence of main 
program aims, and become a center of attraction for other small 
associations of deputies and independent deputies. Clearly 
Russia's political destiny will depend to a considerable extent 
on whether this new political force operates as a center-right 
or center-left organization.

<F P=106> [Nadezhda Garifullina report: "There Are Two Speakers"] </F>
  [Excerpts] A report on the registration of deputies' 
factions and groups was delivered at the [State Duma's] Thursday 
morning session by Sergey Stankevich, leader of the interim Duma 
Secretariat. But, of course, the main matter of the day was the 
election for the lower house speaker. After the adoption at the 
evening session of three articles of the State Duma Interim 
Standing Orders pertaining to the chairman of the chamber and 
his powers, candidates were nominated for the post. There were 
10 of them. [passage omitted] 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy appeared first. It has to be said that 
his presence in the Russian parliament continues to attract 
frenzied interest from the press. If during a recess a 
hurricane of journalists tears down a corridor sweeping all 
before it and chasing after someone, you will soon find it was 
Vladimir Volfovich. The only person so sought-after by the 
press at the first Congress of RSFSR People's Deputies was Boris 
Nikolayevich [Yeltsin], who was then running for chairman of the 
Russian Supreme Soviet. Times change, and journalists now have 
a new and odious "idol." 
  Speaking as a candidate for speaker, Vladimir Volfovich put 
the chairman in his place: "Under the new Constitution and the 
statute on our Duma your task is to let people speak -- that is 
all. We have had enough lectures! The left wing, the right 
wing, who said what.... You yourself carry the burden of the 
old parliament. And you have the tanks and the Special Purpose 
Militia Detachment behind you. You are leading things in that 
direction, whereas the speaker's role is like a dispatcher -- he 
presses a button for the next item on the agenda, we discuss it, 
and that's it." He was supported by Deputy Mironov, who 
proposed psychiatric checks for deputies. "I agree. On the one 
hand, there are very many contenders for this role" and he 
promised to do this within two years "through our special 
services." But at the same time he voiced a grievance of his 
own: "Under all the laws of international practice nobody ever 
discusses the question of whom to appoint as head of government 
or parliament. The position throughout the world is the same -- 
the [leader of the] party that wins the most votes in the 
election is automatically invited by the head of state to form a 
government or automatically becomes the head of the parliament." 
  Basically, recounting a speech by Vladimir Volfovich is a 
thankless task. It has to be seen -- it is a theatrical 
performance by a single actor. Admittedly, sometimes he pushes 
so hard that he generates furious hostility and indignation. 
And you again wonder -- just who are you, Mr. Zhirinovskiy? 
You get shameless bragging ("in just two days my visit to 
Europe stunned [postavilo na ushi] the planet, all diplomats, 
and all ministers"), self-confidence ("I have a different role, 
a different calling"), downright rudeness that does not become a 
member of parliament ("Don't interrupt! Shut up! Get out of 
the hall! All the candidates should be sent to mental 
hospitals!"), and peremptoriness ("Our time has come. Your time 
has passed. On 12 December Russia's voters said you, 'Russia's 
Choice,' are my main rival. You are 30 percent down on me. By 
this spring you will be 60 percent down, and by the fall 90 
percent down, and your voice will finally be silenced in the 
entire Russian political firmament.") In short, Vladimir 
Volfovich has "temporarily withdrawn his candidacy" and is 
waiting for the Russian presidential elections. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Andrey Kolesnikov article: "`Party of the Street' Can Only </F>
Lead to a Dead End"] 
  [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] is 
the party of the street. The arrogance of urban teenage louts 
and losers has taken parliament by storm. The seats in the hall 
are occupied by standard-issue street riff-raff who have 
somewhat outgrown the romantic age of hooliganism for its own 
sake. There are some doubts whether the street "barons" should 
be represented in the lower chamber of the new parliament. 
However, the voters, having sent the "delegates of the lower 
depths" to parliament, have perhaps thereby expressed their 
attitude to the Russian parliamentary system. 
  Zhirinovskiy's lieutenants, who will act as catalysts in the 
State Duma, will, as is clear from the behavior of deputies of 
the extreme left and extreme right "wings" of various 
parliamentary factions, be augmented by representatives of a 
moribund caste of the Soviet people. They may be dubbed social 
constructivists. These deputies, who as a rule are of the age of 
vague anti-liberal convictions (I stipulate for the last time 
not anti-liberal as regards the LDPR), inscribe nightly -- until 
cockcrow -- in grubby, thick exercise books, in their uneven, 
old woman's hand, global plans for the revamping of Russia. 
  In the blessed times of perestroyka, efforts were made to 
prevent their getting within firing distance of the USSR. They 
laid siege to the theoretical and political journals in 
accordance with all the rules governing the art of war, bent on 
seeing the fruits of their lucubrations published. They 
ransacked the classical tomes of Marxism and found there words 
and expressions unused at party congresses and sought to impart 
their discoveries to the world. This author, who worked during 
those years on a sociopolitical journal, would take cowardly 
refuge in the mazy corridors of the editorial office from the 
abundant drivel spouted by the transformers of society on the 
pretext of a "summons from the leadership." The names of 
certain of my clients now adorn the pages of PRAVDA, to which in 
better times they were denied access by the militia. 
  Now the social constructivists will try to test out their 
crazy, hare-brained schemes on the country. Of course, their 
action won't go beyond empty parliamentary rhetoric, but they 
will be able to stymie some fruitful work. It is no wonder that 
the instinct of self-preservation is quite unerringly forcing 
the representatives of Russia's Choice to fight for leading 
positions on the financial and economic committees. 
  From the emotional standpoint, the refusal of Russia's 
Choice 
representatives to negotiate with the Communists, the agrarians, 
and the LDPR is understandable. One can understand Russia's 
Choice's action in human terms, but not politically. The alarm 
bell tolled too loudly during the elections, and too little time 
is allocated the liberals to implement their economic program. 
If the program is to be implemented they have to be real 
politicians for a while and play the most diverse, sometimes 
unpleasant, political games with their ideological opponents. 
Political fastidiousness could cost dear. 
  Is it necessary to beat one's breast and shout in advance 
that it is impossible to cooperate with the "Communists"? It is 
not difficult to see (and if the democrats have not noticed this 
they will always remain a minority in the State Duma) 
that at the present political stage the extreme left-wingers and 
extreme right-wingers are still, as it were, getting accustomed 
to one another again, they are having to work out a new code of 
relations -- they can no longer play according to the rules of 
the National Salvation Front of blessed memory. The LDPR plays 
without rules -- that's why it is a party of the street. The 
Communists and agrarians by their very nature need rules of the 
game. And one can and must cooperate with them on particular 
questions of legislation where there should in principle be no 
antagonism. Nationalities policy and the protection of the 
rights of the Russian-speaking population could be such an area 
of contact -- otherwise the democrats will be unable to seize 
the initiative here and it will be impossible for anyone to 
prove that it was Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev rather than 
Komsomol member Dima Rogozin who really helped the Russians 
living in the former Soviet Union. 
  Is there any point in frightening oneself yet again? Fear 
can become chronic if you don't get rid of it promptly and start 
engaging in normal work and normal politics.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kamin report: "Secret Power Center Begins To Form </F>
in State Duma"] 
  [Text] Differences between the State Duma factions 
hampered the process of approval of the heads of the 
parliament's lower chamber committees yesterday. This, however, 
had no impact on the intention of deputies of various political 
orientations to play together the leading role as the primary 
legislative organ. Notably, a statement made by Vladimir 
Shumeyko, recently elected chairman of the Federation Council, 
about a possible shift in the lawmaking center of gravity to the 
upper chamber of the Russian parliament met with a negative 
assessment from Duma members of the most diverse party 
affiliations. 
  Vladimir Shumeyko's aggressive position toward the Duma is 
caused by rather well-founded fears: the economic consequences 
of an active influence in the lower chamber by the left-wing 
populist forces may prove more appreciable than were the 
opposition moods of the Supreme Soviet that the president 
disbanded. On the other hand, Shumeyko's point of view was 
apparently corroborated by the expectation of serious opposition 
to the Duma's left wing by Russia's Choice supporters, something 
that could have dragged out work and given cause to accuse the 
chamber of inefficiency during the organizational stage (the 
elections for speaker, the formation of the committees 
leadership). 
  Much as could have been expected, Shumeyko's statement was 
adamantly opposed by members of the Duma. Independent grouping 
leaders Irina Khakamada (the 12 December group) and Vladimir 
Medvedev (the "Independent Regional Policy" faction) noted that 
it held no water from the constitutional point of view. 
Yabloko's head Grigoriy Yavlinskiy called it "nonsense." 
Aleksandr Pochinok, a Russia's Choice supporter and more 
experienced in parliamentary ways, stressed that "Shumeyko is a 
strong guy, but bypassing the Duma at the time of forming the 
budget would not succeed at all." 
  At the same time, the outcome of the elections for the heads 
of Duma committees showed that the positions of the democratic 
blocs are not all that weak -- the committee for budget, taxes, 
banks, and finances is lead by Mikhail Zadornov ("Yabloko") with 
Aleksandr Pochinok ("Russia's Choice") as his deputy, and 
Gennadiy Kulik, former vice premier of Russia, having been 
elected as his other deputy. Besides, representatives of the 
democratic wing have filled the deputy positions in the economic 
policy committee, the privatization committee, and the 
industrial committee, of which, however, Vladimir Gusev of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia has become chairman. The 
opposition has also taken over the offices of the heads of 
committees for agrarian questions and for economic policy. 
  As a result, the alignment of forces does not indicate a 
preponderance of supporters of one economic view or the other. 
The apparat experience of Duma members such as Anatoliy 
Lukyanov, however, around whom an informal center of opposition 
leadership is already taking shape, affords a supposition that 
the left-wing populists in the Duma may score a success in 
voting on fundamental economic questions. Attesting to this is 
also a higher level of organization of the opposition supporters 
that was already demonstrated during the struggle between 
factions last week.

<F P=106> [Leonid Nikitinskiy article: "Will the `Spirit of </F>
Parliamentarianism' Take Root in the New Russian Parliament?"] 
  [Text] Ushering in a new epoch in the development of 
parliamentarianism in Russia, Georgiy Lukava, elder of the Duma 
and of civil aviation, very soon saw for himself that it is 
harder to control parliament than an airliner. Without having 
had time to gain height, the State Duma seems to have already 
gone into free-fall.... 
  Behind the outwardly chaotic nature of the events during the 
first days of the State Duma's work two trends can, nonetheless, 
already be divined and merit our attention. These are the 
Duma's desire to structure itself internally in a somewhat 
different and more complex manner than the preprogrammed 
presence of the eight victorious election blocs seemed to 
suggest, and the fact that its possibilities are limited by the 
framework of the Constitution adopted in the referendum. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin reminded the Duma deputies of this in 
his 
brief speech and defined the Duma's tasks with a characteristic 
verb: to "finish building," referring to the edifice whose 
foundations have already been laid and whose parameters were set 
in advance by the Constitution. Boris Yeltsin was still more 
terse: He simply did not come to the Duma. 
<H5>  1. Purport of the Structuring of Factions </H5>
  The question of the size of the factions and deputies' 
associations was the first stumbling block and attested that a 
compromise in this hall will be difficult. 
  The line of the three largest factions on this question 
depends on their assessment of their own strength and of that of 
their rivals: whether they hope to "drag asunder" competitors 
(which is easier with a minimal threshold for the creation of 
alternative associations), or fear an internal split of their 
own and seek to prevent it with the help of a high threshold. 
The unequivocal support by the followers of Zyuganov and 
Zhirinovskiy for a maximal numerical qualification for the 
creation of new factions (50) attests, rather, to their leaders' 
lack of confidence in their own strength and to their 
orientation not so much toward parliamentary persuasion as 
toward rigid party-factional discipline. 
  Before the break the Liberal Democratic Party and the 
Communist Party, which had united on this question, succeeded in 
securing 220 votes in favor of their version of a solution 
against 189, and some people were already on the point of 
celebrating victory. But then Sergey Kovalev delicately 
reminded them that in the Duma it would no longer be possible, 
as previously in the Supreme Soviet, to experiment in the matter 
of a quorum, which is rigidly defined by the Constitution 
itself. His quiet retort sounded like a warning shot to the 
parliamentarians, who have developed a taste for debate. 
  After the break Zhirinovskiy attempted in a highly despotic 
manner to "squeeze out" the few missing votes, but here the 
obverse side of tough party tactics became clear: Almost 200 
deputies refused to register, and wrecked the quorum. Since the 
number of obstructionists is twice the size of "Russia's 
Choice," this attests, rather, to a protest by independent 
deputies. 
  Attempts should soon be expected in the Duma to implement 
the 
principle of the so-called imperative mandate, which consists in 
the right of a faction to recall its deputies and replace them 
with others in the event of a vote in defiance of the faction's 
fundamental decisions. But the Constitution could once again 
rise up in the way of the "imperative mandate." 
  Intermediate versions of a "semirigid" mandate are 
possible, but any decision which prevents or hinders the 
possibility of voting in defiance of the line of one's own 
faction will also mean little prospect of a further struggle for 
the votes of individual deputies. 
  There remains far less room for a power struggle in the 
State 
Duma than was the case in the Supreme Soviet. In particular, 
with the best will in the world, it will be difficult to blow up 
the speaker of the Duma into a figure like Khasbulatov: The 
Constitution will not permit this. The president has also 
ensured in advance that in financial and technical respects the 
apparatus of the Federal Assembly is dependent on the 
president's administration, and this also makes a struggle for 
apparatus posts in parliamentary structures less attractive. 
<H5>  2. Legislating for Purposes of Self-Publicity </H5>
  The creation of new factions in the Duma or the rejigging of 
existing ones and also the struggle for the posts of speaker, 
vice speakers, and chairmen of parliamentary committees -- posts 
which in themselves do not have very good prospects -- are not 
an end in itself but a means of occupying positions a little 
closer to the microphones. They will be the cause of a decisive 
game, in which the prize will be better chances in the 1996 
presidential election and also in the new parliamentary 
elections due in the foreseeable future. 
  For these purposes there is absolutely no need of real 
power, 
within whose framework it is necessary to resolve specific 
everyday problems, leaving little chance of pleasing the voters; 
nor is there any need for real control over the government, 
which is tantamount toassuming responsibility for its unpopular 
decisions. 
  But the Duma's legislative powers, like the initiatives of 
its individual factions, might be used not so much for positive 
legislative work as in the hope of preelection propaganda. The 
submission of draft laws which are deliberately populist and 
beautifully packaged but devoid of any inner meaning and real 
substance could serve as the most convenient and safe form of 
struggle for the votes of the electorate -- a form approved 
repeatedly in the former Supreme Soviet. 
  But the rigid framework of the Constitution will constantly 
inhibit the State Duma not only in resolving its own internal 
problems but also in legislative improvisations. There will be 
two methods of struggle against the Constitution, which promise 
undoubted publicity success regardless of whether real 
amendments to it are made or rejected. These are, 
conventionally, the "frontal attack" and "sabotage in the rear." 
  Zyuganov's bloc will evidently make it a rule to remind 
people that the Constitution was adopted illegally and is 
invalid ("Carthage must be destroyed"). Zhirinovskiy's bloc, 
which, out of tactical considerations, rather, tied itself to 
preelection approval of the constitutional draft, retains the 
possibility of torpedoing the Constitution by means of extending 
borders or, conversely, sabotaging current legislation. The 
field for such activity, in which all the blocs opposed to the 
government -- from extreme right-wing ones to extreme left-wing 
ones -- can graze widely and freely and put on weight, is marked 
by the totality of draft laws which the government intends to 
propose to the Duma: the Civil Code, the Fundamentals of Land, 
Labor, and Housing Legislation -- approximately 100 draft laws 
in all. 
  Finally, the defense of the provisions of the Constitution 
and of the draft laws in the "package" which conform with it -- 
this is the bridgehead marked out by fate itself for the 
legislative publicity campaign of the pro-government "Russia's 
Choice," from which it cannot retreat without running the risk 
of losing face with that part of the electorate which supports 
it. But it is so disadvantageous tactically that the process of 
desertion could start from here. We are afraid that the 
government itself will go over "in opposition" to "Russia's 
Choice." 
<H5>  3. Digression on the "Spirit of Parliamentarianism" </H5>
  The first days of the State Duma's work, like the 
preparatory 
period, have been quite symptomatic but do not enable us to make 
more precise operational forecasts. Therefore we will yield to 
the temptation to discourse a little on broader topics -- 
parliamentarianism in general, for example. 
  No one, in actual fact, can explain exactly what 
"parliamentarianism" or the "spirit of parliamentarianism," 
which is in general use, is. Therefore it is harder to point to 
an example of its presence than its absence. There is no need 
to prove that this very "spirit of parliamentarianism" did not 
even exist fleetingly in Khasbulatov's Supreme Soviet, at least 
in its last phase of development. Comparing, in hindsight, the 
congresses of Russian and Union deputies, we conclude in 
amazement that the latter were more in keeping with this very 
"spirit of parliamentarianism," although they were sincerely 
reviled by as yet unfledged parliamentary journalists. 
Therefore, on meeting Anatoliy Lukyanov, for example, in the 
lobby of the State Duma, these same journalists, but now with 
experience (for politicians come and go, but journalists 
remain), have nostalgic feelings, as if the "spirit of 
parliamentarianism" had suddenly materialized before them -- not 
in its entirety but in one of its guises. 
  Parliamentarianism, in actual fact, is not form but 
content, a system of concepts and relations which entails, above 
all, cooperation, partnership, compromise, and deference to 
another's opinion. The outward "architectural" devices of the 
constituting of power, such as the system of "checks and 
balances" or the very sophisticated electronic voting system, 
are designed merely to make the physical house of parliament 
more comfortable in the hope that the "spirit of 
parliamentarianism" will finally settle here as a welcome guest. 
But parliamentarianism has evidently had a parting of the ways, 
for a little while, from those institutions which we call 
"parliamentary" primarily on the basis of their outward form. 
  In the former Supreme Soviet it was frightened off by the 
clear predominance of politics over law. Expressed as a 
fraction, this correlation, which actually characterizes the 
level of parliamentarianism in each specific parliament, was 
approaching zero. If the laws which were produced there 
sometimes took into account the vector of the public good, it 
was only by virtue of a chance coincidence with the factional 
interests of individual groups captivated by the struggle for 
power. 
  Will the "spirit of parliamentarianism" get on with the new 
deputies in the State Duma? At present there is very little 
hope of this, and the reasons, in general, are the same. The 
factions' preparatory maneuvers already attest that the new 
generation of parliamentarians is at once starting where the 
previous generation left off: with a struggle for power and 
influence waged by apparatus methods, instead of at least 
outlining a list of priority law-drafting and legislative work. 
  And yet, however great the temptation to turn the new 
parliament, following the former one, into a showground of 
political struggle, the rigid constitutional limitation of the 
possibilities of waging that struggle "under the carpet" will 
suddenly cool the interest in it and make the most sober members 
of the State Duma turn their attention to positive legislative 
activity. Of course, this routine work will not suit everyone: 
It requires skill and patience and outwardly is by no means as 
effective as appeals from the parliamentary microphone to wage 
war in the interests of great Russia on, let us say, Kuala 
Lumpur. 
  In my view the deputies of the State Duma, as of the 
Federation Council and also of all other conceivable and 
inconceivable parliamentary institutions, should be responsibly 
aware of their role in Russia today, neither belittling it nor, 
on any account, exaggerating it. Russia is certainly not a 
democratic country, at any rate not in the sense of the form of 
rule, at any rate not at the present phase of its historical 
development. 
  Russia today has become presidential in form or, rather, 
authoritarian in terms of the inner content of power not thanks 
to nor despite the rather illogical actions of Yeltsin and his 
team but by virtue of the circumstances which have taken shape 
and which obey different, not subjective, natural laws of 
historical development. 
  The State Duma will also have to obey them. The Duma has a 
worthy occupation which conforms with both the demands and the 
opportunities of the present day: to improve legislation from 
the viewpoint of its form, not its political content, without 
trying to confront the presidential structures in this area. 
Attempts to go against the tide (apparently against Yeltsin, 
but essentially against the vector of history) could end, most 
likely, only in the Duma's sharing the fate of the Supreme 
Soviet. 
  But even if Boris Yeltsin suffers defeat in another clash 
with pseudoparliamentarianism and with "factions" which actually 
aspire to still more monopoly power, this certainly will not be 
a victory for true parliamentarianism. Any leader who replaces 
him (at what price?) in this or another post designated somehow 
differently, except in a presidential election, will be doomed 
to become a dictator -- what kind of dictator and how cruel a 
dictator will depend, inter alia, on his personal qualities and 
the promises with which he has managed to bind himself.

Chaos Management"] 
  [Text] The State Duma devoted the whole of 12 January to 
intra- and interfactional consultations. It was a kind of 
time-out taken by the sides in view of the first break in their 
work. And there is some consulting to be done. All the 
contradictions were on display at the general sitting -- not 
only the established ones, but those that were vigorously 
developing in the course of the negotiating period prior to the 
opening of the session. 
  As is known, at the very start of the process the moderate 
conservative deputies' majority had the chance to organize its 
faction properly. It was to comprise Zyuganovist Communists, 
supporters of Travkin, Agrarians, and, perhaps, the Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord, women, and the part of the body of 
deputies that chooses to be nonfactional. This kind of majority 
would have been able not only to block any initiatives by 
"Russia's Choice," but also to implement its own. But the 
alliance did not come about. Instead the four biggest factions 
-- the Russian Federation Communist Party, the Agrarian Party of 
Russia, Russia's Choice, and the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia -- sat down to negotiate the allotment of spheres of 
influence in the Duma. At first glance this is inexplicable. 
The position of Zyuganov and Lapshin enabled them to manage 
without any negotiations, while Gaydar and Zhirinovskiy had 
always appeared to them to be the least desirable partners 
(simply odious to them). Actually, it was the quadripartite 
negotiations that made the Communists' and Agrarians' potential 
allies ill-disposed toward them. 
  What made the conservatives commit such a fatal error? 
  We have learned from reliable sources that information has 
filtered down to the Duma from circles close to the president 
that the four major factions will be authorized to participate 
not only in the formation of the presidium and the committees 
but also in the reorganization of the Cabinet of Ministers. If 
this is to be believed, then it is clear what kind of bait the 
Communists and Agrarians have taken. Actually, their 
ideological inspiration -- V.I. Lenin -- taught that opportunism 
would bring no dividends and that no one would voluntarily share 
power. So they have themselves to blame. 
  The quadripartite negotiations broke down, of course. 
"Choice" never really made any secret of the fact that its true 
aim was not to join Zyuganov and Zhirinovskiy in allotting 
spheres of influence but to prevent them from exercising 
influence on the Duma. The sole result of the roundtable was 
that all four big factions were cut off from their potential 
allies -- the small factions and independent deputies. Now the 
former are obviously gravitating toward an alliance with 
Shakhray, whose hopes of getting the speaker's chair have 
therefore now undergone a revival. Now, that is the problem: 
even if something turns up for themm, this alliance will not 
have even a relative majority without the Communists and 
Agrarians, but will merely be the fifth large faction. The 
former will try, of course, in the very near future to return to 
the original idea of creating a moderate conservative majority 
faction. Except that the old confidence they used to command 
will no longer be there. Things have moved on, so to speak. 
  It is true that Russia's Choice, as a member of the "big 
four," is also isolated from its potential allies in the 
reformist camp -- the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, 
Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin, and the Russian Movement for 
Democratic Reforms. But its leaders hardly had any illusions on 
this score before. Their complaints about a lack of unity among 
the democrats are clearly a pretense, except perhaps in the case 
of S. Kovalev, who is far removed from the larger political 
arena. Even during the election campaign they knew that this 
unity would not exist, and they are merely seeking to shift 
their share of the responsibility for this onto the remaining 
democrats. Their real objective, at least at the present state, 
is not to create a united democratic front but to prevent any of 
their opponents (be they left-wing or right-wing) from forming a 
Duma majority. This was the aim behind their demand for the 
minimum size of deputies' group necessary for registration to be 
as small as possible. This would have made it possible to break 
up the body of deputies into a multitude of small groupings and 
"drown the Duma's work in verbal diarrhea," as N. Travkin put it 
in his own inimitable manner. These tactics have already been 
dubbed "chaos management" by our political scientists. One of 
the Russia's Choice leaders, Sergey Yushenkov, was blatantly 
demonstrating them at his recent press conference.

  [Text] The Russia's Choice deputy faction is speaking 
against the construction of a new parliament building that would 
cost $588 million from state coffers. According to Russia's 
Choice, this sum is quite sufficient to take care of military 
conversion on a Russia- wide scale for one year.

  [Text] Russia and the U.S., which signed a contract for 
deconcentrating highly enriched uranium last week, will fulfill 
it without Ukraine's participation, a senior official from 
Russia's Nuclear Energy Ministry told INTERFAX. 
  The contract for deconcentrating 500 tons of highly enriched 
uranium was concluded to develop the agreement signed by the two 
sides last February, the source said. Its implementation will 
take 20 years. 
  The contract provides for deconcentrating annually at least 
10 tons of Russian uranium, which will subsequently be sold on 
the American market. Its cost will be 12 Bn dollars. 
  According to the official, the delay in signing the document 
was connected with Washington's condition that Ukraine, Belarus 
and Kazakhstan should be involved in implementing the agreement. 
  However, later it was agreed that the uranium from Ukrainian 
nuclear warheads will be returned to Ukraine as fuel for nuclear 
power plants, and will not be despatched to the American market.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Vladislav Kozyakov] </F>
  [Excerpts] At the Russian-American summit in Moscow last 
week, almost the most important issue was the question of 
economic cooperation, aimed at supporting the economic reform in 
Russia. Vladislav Kozyakov comments. [passage omitted] 
  One of the most significant results of the latest summit, in 
terms of economic cooperation, was undoubtedly the agreement on 
the sale of Russian uranium to America. In the next 20 years, 
Russia will process some 500 tonnes of weapons uranium. The 
processed uranium will be shipped to America as fuel for nuclear 
power stations there, at a cost of 12 billion dollars. This 
deal is mutually advantageous -- Russia will receive the 
much-needed hard currency, while America perhaps will produce 
cheaper electric energy by its nuclear power stations -- but 
what seems to be the most significant in this agreement is the 
overcoming of one of the barriers in the way of Russian goods to 
America. 
  The point is that Russia has many more such goods that could 
compete on an equal footing with others on the American market 
and on other Western markets, but such trade in those goods is 
being hampered by different kinds of barriers, or high tariffs, 
or prohibition law enacted in the past, or antidumping 
procedures. [passage omitted] 
  Russia has goods to sell. This is not only space technology 
or energy supplies, and not only aluminum or uranium. There are 
other technologies -- ferro-alloy and mineral fertilizers, some 
types of electronics and products of machine-building 
industries. These are competitive goods, but to break into the 
markets has been very difficult. This may sound paradoxical, 
but it is precisely because of their high competitiveness. 
About 20 types of Russian goods fall within the antidumping 
procedure by American and Western countries, the aim of which, 
of course, is to take them out of the markets. 
  Undoubtedly, to agree on the issue of trade can sometimes be 
very difficult, but the Russian-American contract on uranium and 
other accords at the Moscow summit give one the hope that the 
American market will at long last be open to Russian goods. 
This would be one more practical confirmation of the successful 
development of partnership between Russia and the United States 
of America.

<F P=106> [Report by A. Portanskiy under the general heading: "Russia </F>
and United States Try To Avoid `Aluminum War'"] 
  [Text] The general calls for assistance for the reforms in 
Russia, often repeated in the West, are one thing, but talk on 
the entirely specific question of trade with Russia are 
something else entirely. 
  The Americans are suggesting to us that we make a commitment 
to almost the whole world voluntarily to restrict exports of our 
aluminum to a certain level. This agreement will allegedly be 
temporary -- until the situation on the world market is put 
right. Here a program of investment in our aluminum industry is 
offered. 
  With this option Russian experts believe that the question 
will soon arise of what we are to do without production -- we 
will have to reduce it. That will not be long in causing a 
whole range of adverse consequences for us. Export deliveries 
will be reduced and social tension will be intensified in whole 
regions where aluminum production is concentrated (let us recall 
the recent success of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
during the election campaign in Siberia -- A.P.). 
  The likelihood that our profit level will be preserved as a 
result of the increase in world prices for aluminum after the 
reduction in the dumping of Russian metal on the external market 
is in reality not great. Because various countries have 
accumulated a considerable amount of aluminum, which will 
immediately be put on the market. 
  From the political viewpoint in our foreign trade we will 
acquire a most unpleasant precedent which will subsequently 
probably be repeated with our other export goods. 
  But refusing a voluntary limit on aluminum exports will 
probably mean for us the start of the antidumping procedure 
mentioned by [U.S lawyer] Larry Friedman. Although it is quite 
hard to prove dumping in practice, the results of a possible 
investigation are virtually predetermined -- they will not be in 
our favor. 
  We are now caught in a sandwich, as the Americans say, or 
between the hammer and the anvil, as the Russians say. 
Nonetheless, the Russian side intends to advance at the 
forthcoming talks in the direction of its main idea -- putting 
the blame for the state of the market on all producing countries 
and seeking a formula for an overall stabilization of the 
aluminum market. Within the framework of this formula there can 
be a number of options for resolving the problem. One of them 
is investments in our aluminum industry on condition that 
payments are subsequently made to investors in this metal. The 
main merit of this option is that it opens up a prospect for the 
increase in the consumption of aluminum for civilian purposes 
inside the country -- something for which Russia has such a 
great need -- and that will at the same time favorably affect 
the state of the world aluminum market.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 18 TASS -- "We are able to remove all 
nuclear warheads stationed on the Ukrainian territory to Russia 
within a year for subsequent dismantling them at enterprises at 
which they were produced," Colonel-General Yevgeniy Maslin, a 
military expert for nuclear safety and a department chief of the 
Russian Defence Ministry, told a briefing here today. 
  He highly assessed an agreement on the removal of nuclear 
weapons from the Ukrainian territory, signed by the three 
presidents. Maslin reminded of the fact that talks on this 
problem had been going on since 1992 and it was only now that 
the talks came to a logical end. 
  Maslin informed journalists that currently, there are 176 
launching installations of intercontinental ballistic missiles 
(IBM) in Ukraine, including 130 installations of SS-19 type and 
46 of SS-24 type. There are also around 40 heavy bombers Tu-160 
and Tu-95 capable of launching air-based long-range cruise 
missiles. The overall number of warheads stationed in Ukraine 
includes 1,300 warheads for IBM and over 600 warheads for 
air-based cruise missiles. 
  In the opinion of the military expert, nuclear safety in 
Ukraine causes permanent concern of experts. According to 
Maslin, ammunition depots are overloaded with warheads and 
nuclear ammunition removed from combat alert, which resulted in 
a considerable increase of the radiation level. This was 
confirmed by experts of the Russian nuclear centre "Arzamas-15" 
who visited Ukraine in September, 1993. 
  The designed life of the majority of warheads has expired, 
while maintenance preventive checks had not been carried out and 
some missiles are currently in a critical condition. As an 
example, Maslin mentioned three nuclear warheads which had to be 
hastily removed from the Ukrainian territory as they were in a 
critical condition. It is difficult to say how many hazardous 
warheads are in Ukraine yet because there is a lack of experts 
exercising control over the safety of nuclear weapons, Maslin 
said. 
  The expert pointed out that any delay in removing and 
dismantling nuclear weapons is inadmissible since it is fraught 
with unpredictable consequences. However, there are still 
people in the republic who either do not realise this or are 
deliberately playing out "the nuclear card," he said. 
  Maslin pointed out that Russian experts can give Ukraine 
guarantees of safety of all operations in the process of removal 
and utilization of strategic weapons.

  [Text] A news conference was held at the Russian Ministry 
of Defense today. The military and political aspects of the 
Moscow summit meeting were discussed at the news conference. 
Viktor Levin, our observer, reports. 
  [Levin] Colonel-General Maslin, chief of a main directorate 
of the Russian Defense Ministry, introduced by the minister's 
Press Secretary Yelena Agapova as the chief specialist in the 
area of nuclear safety, dwelt in detail on the issue of the 
state of nuclear arms in Ukraine. 
  [Begin Maslin recording] In their statement, the presidents 
emphasized the importance of ensuring the safety and reliability 
of nuclear weapons until they are dismantled. However, nuclear 
safety in Ukraine is continuing to get worse. Storage 
facilities are more than full with warheads and nuclear 
ammunition which have been stood down. This is impermissible. 
Apart from everything else, it has resulted in a considerable 
increase in background radiation. This is confirmed by the 
chief design specialists from Arzamas-16 who visited the 
territory of Ukraine, Pervomaysk, last September. 
  Guarantees on most spare parts have run out. Regular 
technical servicing is not being done everywhere. The findings 
of the chief designers who investigated those three munitions, 
you remember, the ones which were sent from Ukraine because they 
were in a very dangerous state, landed on my desk yesterday. 
  Specialists are neither trained nor retrained in educational 
centers. Due to a lack of effective control, the personnel's 
theoretical knowledge and practical skills have been 
substantially lost and this engenders a great deal of doubt with 
regard to their capability for getting the work carried out with 
any degree of quality. 
  Due to lack of equipment and absence of field training, the 
special emergency repair crews are not in practical terms ready 
to carry out tasks dealing with the elimination of the 
consequences of possible accidents involving nuclear ammunition. 
Besides, there is a great deal more affecting the servicing and 
maintenance. 
  Well, and it is in a situation such as this that proposals 
emerge within the military circles of the Ukrainian Defense 
Ministry to have the munitions moved to a former engineer depot, 
to have them stored there for a so-called interim period. Apart 
from everything else, this is very dangerous. [end recording] 
  [Levin] I asked a question whether it is really the case 
that 
Ukraine fails to understand that keeping nuclear weapons in such 
a poor technical state poses a threat to Ukraine itself. Here 
is General Maslin's reply. 
  [Begin Maslin recording] There exists...[pauses] Well, I 
have been in touch with my Ukrainian colleagues practically from 
the very inception of the negotiating process. There are 
sensible people there who do understand this. However, there 
are also people -- and I am not afraid to say so -- who fail to 
understand this danger. 
  For some 50 minutes I had to address some committee -- I 
don't remember what they call it -- the Defense and Security 
Committee of the Ukrainian parliament. For 50 minutes I told 
them, in great detail, what nuclear ammunition is, what danger 
it poses, in the first place for Ukraine, but the questions that 
came afterwards dealt mainly with the costs -- how much if we 
sell it to you. That is to say -- I would not like to offend 
anyone by this -- but nonetheless, the statements, you have 
after all noticed that statements have appeared in the press 
alleging treachery, well, these are the people who do not 
understand and they fall into one category. 
  There is a second category of people who do understand, but 
who wish to retain their positions in the new structures that 
emerged there to supervise the nuclear weapons. My former 
subordinates are there, too, working and unwilling, to some 
extent, to part with these weapons and probably this can serve 
as an explanation. [end recording] 
  [Levin] The trilateral agreement between Russia, Ukraine, 
and 
the United States removes financial problems. It is now up to 
the Ukrainian parliament and its political will.

<F P=106> [Report by military observer Vladimir Klimov: "Guarantee -- </F>
Until February"] 
  [Text] The guarantee period of certain nuclear munitions 
located in Ukraine runs out in February. There is no need to 
explain what a delay in transporting them to Russia for 
dismantling and processing into nuclear fuel would lead to. 
This was the subject discussed at a news conference in the 
Russian Federation Defense Ministry. Colonel-General Yevgeniy 
Maslin, Major Generals Anatoliy Lukyanov and Anatoliy Svetikov, 
and also Boris Gorobets, spokesman for the Ministry of Atomic 
Energy, spoke about the prospects of the agreement with Ukraine 
on questions of dismantling nuclear weapons reached during the 
meeting between Presidents Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin, and 
Leonid Kravchuk. 
  There are 176 missile-launchers currently deployed in 
Ukraine 
and around 40 heavy bombers, accounting for around 2,000 nuclear 
weapons. Some of them are in a potentially dangerous 
[predavariynom] state. It is vital to transport them to Russia 
in the immediate future for dismantling. 
  Russia is prepared to do this. Although the relocation of 
certain nuclear weapons is dangerous, it will carry out all the 
commitments it assumed at the summit. By way of compensation 
Russia will supply uranium for nuclear electric power stations 
to Ukraine for 10 months. 
  What if the Ukrainian Supreme Council suddenly refuses to 
ratify the Moscow agreements? This question was raised at the 
news conference. The answer that was given maintained that the 
agreement between the three presidents theoretically does not 
need ratification. 
  Furthermore, the people in Ukraine who are involved in 
handling [obsluzhuvaniye] nuclear munitions understand the full 
danger of the prevailing situation and will take the necessary 
measures to implement the agreement. However, there are 
politicians in Ukraine who will oppose the implementation of the 
agreement for the sake of achieving their own ends or to keep 
their long-occupied posts. What may the non-implementation of 
the agreements lead to? If Ukraine wants to become a nuclear 
power, the UN Security Council must ratify this decision. It 
will scarcely come out in favor of the expansion of the world 
nuclear club. Clearly its expansion would have a domino effect. 
It cannot be ruled out that the DPRK and other states prepared 
to make nuclear weapons would want to join Ukraine. 
  So we will trust in the sensible attitude of the people who 
decide the state's future.

<F P=106> [Report by Maksim Yusin: "Election Results Confront Moscow </F>
With Difficult Choice"] 
  [Text] The first round of the presidential elections held 
in Crimea last Sunday confirmed that the majority of the 
peninsula's inhabitants do not want to remain in Ukraine and are 
seeking affiliation to Russia. 
  Although the name of the Crimean president will not be known 
until 30 January, when round two is due to be held, there is 
hardly any doubt that Yuriy Meshkov, who supports the 
peninsula's separation from Ukraine, will win. His rival in 
round two will be Nikolay Bagrov, the present chairman of the 
Crimean Supreme Council, and the only one of the six candidates 
who has consistently advocated that the peninsula remain in 
Ukraine. The popularity of this idea among the population there 
can be judged from the number of votes cast for Bagrov -- 17.5 
percent. 
  What will happen next? The future president's first step has 
already been decided -- Meshkov plans to organize a referendum 
on the peninsula's future on 27 March, the same day as the 
parliamentary elections in Ukraine. The outcome of that 
referendum is virtually predetermined. After 27 March Meshkov, 
backed with the people's support, will in all likelihood launch 
the campaign to change the status of Crimea. 
  Russian diplomacy is going to have some serious problems to 
tackle. On the one hand, public opinion cannot be ignored: The 
majority of Russians cannot accept the loss of Crimea, which was 
won for Russia by Catherine the Great's military commanders. 
The State Duma, under the influence of the Communists and 
liberal democrats, will surely follow the example of 
Khasbulatov's Supreme Soviet and adopt a resolution taking under 
Russian jurisdiction not just Sevastopol but the whole 
peninsula. In Crimea, of course, this will cause an explosion 
of exultation and will trigger a wave of demonstrations under 
red flags and tricolors. 
  At the same time, by casting doubt on the territorial 
integrity of its neighboring state, Russia will set a most 
dangerous precedent, canceling out the Helsinki accords and its 
own commitments within the CSCE framework. In addition, the 
affiliation of Crimea can at best bring moral satisfaction but 
will not improve either the economic situation in Russia or 
relations with the CIS countries, which will interpret this as 
visible confirmation of Moscow's "imperial ambitions." 
  Nor should it be forgotten that the agreement on scrapping 
Ukraine's nuclear weapons has still not been ratified by 
parliament, and a sharp deterioration of relations between 
Moscow and Kiev could make President Kravchuk change his 
position too. 
  Judging by the initial statements of Russian diplomats, the 
Foreign Ministry prefers not to draw far-reaching conclusions 
from the Crimean election results. 
  Unless it clearly and unambiguously states that it renounces 
its territorial claims on Ukraine, Moscow could repeat the sorry 
experience of Belgrade. By giving unconditional support to 
fellow countrymen in Crimea, Yeltsin runs the risk of becoming a 
hostage to separatist leaders, as happened with Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic. 
  Moscow's open interference in the emerging conflict between 
Kiev and Simferopol will do irreparable damage to the reputation 
of Russian democracy. The question is whether the Kremlin's 
leaders will manage to resist the temptation of trying to boost 
their own popularity at their weakened neighbor's expense.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Oleg Medvedev: "Outcome of Presidential </F>
Elections in Crimea. Kravchuk Gambled on Bagrov and Lost"] 
  [Text] The elections for president in Crimea are illegal, 
and Leonid Kravchuk will in the near future detail his position 
on this question. This was announced on the evening of 17 
January by Mykola Mikhalchenko, adviser to Ukraine's head of 
state. As is known, having come through to the second round of 
elections are Crimean Supreme Soviet Chairman Nikolay Bagrov and 
Yuriy Meshkov, leader of the pro-Russia Republican Party, who 
has a considerable edge on his rival and high chances to win in 
the second round. KOMMERSANT-DAILY observer Oleg Medvedev 
comments on the new political situation taking shape in Crimea 
and around it. 
  Many politicians in Moscow do not hide their satisfaction at 
Mr. Meshkov's success. "An excellent variant!" exclaimed Sergey 
Baburin, learning the results of the first round. Presidential 
Council member Andranik Migranyan thinks that the residents of 
Crimea have made the right choice, and hopes that Ukrainian 
leaders would be "wise enough not to make any rash and 
provocative moves." Yevgeniy Ambartsumov pledged that the Duma 
will not keep aloof from the Crimea question, adding without any 
irony that if Meshkov wins, "one may be able to say that now it 
is Ukraine's internal affair." 
  Indeed, if the leader of Crimean Republicans takes the 
presidential seat in Simferopol, Moscow, without visibly 
interfering in Crimean affairs, would have the possibility of 
realizing its geopolitical objectives in Crimea with his hands. 
Meshkov's chances of final victory are high: In line with an 
understanding reached earlier, four candidates who dropped out 
of the race after the first round are supposed to transfer their 
electorate to him. 
  The men in Kiev fear an escalation of tensions in Crimea, 
and 
expect stepped-up territorial claims on the part of Russia. 
Leonid Kravchuk finds himself in a difficult situation. He had 
ignored pressing demands by a number of political parties to ban 
the elections for Crimean president. Kravchuk had hoped for the 
victory of Bagrov, who is loyal to Kiev, but miscalculated. Now 
that the success for Russophiles in Crimea is obvious, banning 
the elections is rather dangerous. But if Bagrov withdraws his 
candidacy, the second round may not take place: It takes two 
candidates to hold it. 
  A new situation is taking shape in Crimea regardless of how 
the presidential election story in Crimea ends. Nearly 65 
percent of the more than 70 percent of all who went to the polls 
voted for candidates who in one or other form support secession 
from Ukraine. This voting in fact cancels the results of the 
1991 referendum in which a majority of people in Crimea 
advocated Crimea's being part of Ukraine. The demonstration of 
pro-Russia sentiments by citizens of Crimea considerably 
strengthens the hand of Russia in the talks with Ukraine on the 
whole range of problems related to Crimea.

<F P=106> ["Russian Federation Foreign Ministry Statement" -- </F>
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA headline] 
  [Text] Issues regarding relations between the Russian 
Federation and the Republic of Belarus have become a topic of 
discussion in the mass media of both countries in connection 
with the future of the economic reforms in Russia. 
  Because of this, the Russian Foreign Ministry would like to 
state the following. As far as interstate relations between 
Russia and Belarus are concerned, they are still a priority for 
us with the objective of strengthening friendship and developing 
in-depth mutually advantageous cooperation in the military, 
political, trade, economic, humanitarian, and other spheres. 
  A good foundation has already been laid for moving toward 
the 
strategic objective of bringing our two countries closer 
together in accordance with decisions made by the 
highest-ranking leaders of Russia and Belarus. 
  There is no doubt that rapprochement of this kind would 
encourage a carefully prepared amalgamation of the monetary 
systems of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus on 
the basis of the intergovernmental agreement of 8 September 
1993. The statement by the Russian and Belarusian heads of 
government dated 5 January 1994 states that the work that has 
been done to implement this agreement includes tasking the two 
countries' ministries and departments with preparing additional 
documents which will define the mechanism whereby the monetary 
system will operate once it has been amalgamated, the single 
mechanism for administering the budget systems of both states, 
and also questions connected with foreign economic, trade, and 
customs policy. 
  The fastest possible coordination of these documents would 
suit the interests of the people of both countries. 
  Commenting on this statement for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, 
Grigoriy 
Karasin, director of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry 
Information and Press Department, said: "The process of 
establishing bilateral relations is multidimensional and 
multilayered, and Russian ministries and departments have been 
directly instructed by the president and the government to work 
intensively and dynamically in this area."

<F P=106> [Report by Grigoriy Selyaninov under the "CIS Integration" </F>
rubric: "Russia May Find Itself Once Again Confined to Ruble 
Zone"] 
  [Text] Explaining his refusal to join the government 
currently under reorganization, Yegor Gaydar cited among other 
things the threat of returning to the situation of 1992, when 
there was an inflation competition among 12 centers of money 
creation in the ruble zone. The fears are not without reason. 
The issue is in the first place the unprecedented preparations 
for the merger of the money systems of Russia and Belarus, which 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY reported 12 January. Meanwhile, Andrey Kozyrev 
has also joined in the Russian Government fray over economic 
integration. In his message to the president the Russian 
Foreign Ministry chief argues against both Russia's 
"isolationism" in economic relations with the former USSR 
republics, and the stepped-up resuscitation of the ruble zone. 
The general balance of forces within the government, however, is 
unfavorable for the ruble so far. 
  Uncertainty and political infighting in the top echelons of 
the Russian executive branch have prompted candidates for the 
leading roles in the cabinet to issue statements that go beyond 
the scope of their current powers. In his address to the 
president, Andrey Kozyrev supports integration within the CIS in 
principle. He believes that Russia can overcome the economic 
crisis only jointly with the other former USSR republics. On 
the other hand, Andrey Kozyrev's statement contains a provision 
saying that the formation of the CIS economic union is running 
too far ahead. The union is being hastily equipped with 
documents describing the final stage of economic integration. 
In other words, the Foreign Ministry chief is diplomatically 
objecting to the stepped-up creation of a currency union, 
especially in the form of a ruble zone. 
  The foreign minister's statement can also be interpreted as 
follows: While wishing to stay on in the government, Andrey 
Kozyrev is distancing himself in advance from its fairly likely 
decisions in favor of the ruble zone's comeback, which may 
undermine the prospects for Russia's financial convalescence. 
  On the whole, the balance of forces in the government with 
regard to resuscitating the ruble zone does not appear to be 
favoring the ruble. If Boris Fedorov follows Yegor Gaydar's 
suit in compliance with decisions by "Russia's Choice" ruling 
bodies, there will be no radical market advocates opposing the 
ruble zone's revival left in the government. Given that 
regarding this subject the Central Bank sticks to a view that 
priority should be given to restoring interrepublican economic 
ties, not to propping up the ruble, then 1994 may mark a return 
to a situation of two years ago in terms of Russia's subsidizing 
former Union republics. Meanwhile, according to available 
estimates, a total of 8 percent of Russian GDP was siphoned off 
into the republics in 1992, and 25 percent of Russia's price 
growth was caused by the inflationary dumping of rubles into 
Russia from the CIS countries. The year 1993 saw only the 
beginning in switching economic and especially credit and 
financial relations to market principles (by using the 
indexation of Russian Government credits through the current 
exchange rate of the dollar, setting interest rates on the basis 
of LIBOR [London Interbank Offered Rate], and making insurance 
currency deposits). Nonetheless, Russia gave its CIS partners 
credits to the tune of 5.2 trillion rubles in settling trade 
accounts.

<H3>  Members of the Russian government on merging the money 
systems of Russia and Belarus </H3>
  Andrey Kozyrev favors fostering integration within the CIS, 
but warns against overstepping certain stages in the formation 
of the Economic Union. 
  Aleksandr Shokhin signed the 28 December Russian-Belarusian 
protocol on the readiness to merge the two countries' money 
systems. He sees the draft agreement prepared by the Central 
Banks of Russia and Belarus "On the Mechanism of Operation of 
Belarus' Money System Upon Merging it With That of Russia" as 
acceptable. 
  Vladimir Mashits holds a wait-and-see stance. He favors a 
stepped-up creation of a multi-currency payment union of CIS 
countries, but he does not object to the ruble zone, either.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor Viktor Belkin: "Russians Will Pay </F>
Dear for Their Rulers' Political Philanthropy"] 
  [Text] On the path of the CIS countries' economic 
integration, the start of the new year of 1994 was marked by a 
truly notable event. The intergovernment agreement "on the 
procedure for the unification of the Belarus system with the 
Russian Federation monetary system and the mechanism for the 
functioning of a common monetary system" was signed. 
  Its successful implementation could serve as the start of 
the 
ruble zone and raise integration processes in the CIS to a 
qualitatively new level. Unfortunately, the reverse is also 
true: Failure could seriously delay these processes. That fear 
is by no means unfounded. The experience of many of the CIS' 
good initiatives which have disappeared into the sand requires 
heightened circumspection and responsibility here. 
  In assessing the objective chances of success we must 
highlight the main point -- the optimum selection of partners on 
the basis "of love and calculation," as the saying goes: The 
mutual sympathy of the two countries' peoples, the contiguity of 
their territories, their close economic ties. Suffice it to say 
that Belarus sells nearly one third of its GNP in Russia, 
acquiring in exchange rolled metal, cement, petroleum products, 
gas, and other things. But the successful combination of 
partners and their desire to unite their monetary systems still 
do not guarantee success. After all, it is a case of a unique 
step unprecedented in world practice. Consequently, the most 
serious preparatory work is needed. 
  The foundation of this work was laid by the agreement of a 
program nature between Russia and Belarus concluded in September 
last year. Something has already been done, particularly in the 
field of coordinating foreign economic, trade, and customs 
policy. But radical questions of the interaction of the two 
countries' budgets and in particular questions of the normal 
functioning of two emission banks with a single currency have 
not been sufficiently worked out in such a short time. 
  In addition to unresolved problems new problems have arisen 
in recent months, complicating the unification of the monetary 
systems. The first act here is the replacement of Belarusian 
rubles with Russian ones. In September 1993 the exchange rate 
was 1.5 Belarusian rubles for 1 ruble. The one for one 
principle stipulated by the program agreement for the exchange 
of money did not give rise to any special objections at the 
time. But since then the market exchange rate of the Belarusian 
ruble -- the "hare" -- has declined to 5 for 1 Russian ruble. 
But in the January agreement the "hare's" exchange rate against 
the ruble remains the same. Of course the currency exchange 
rate is determined not only by their purchasing power but also 
by supply and demand, the saturation of the market, and other 
factors. Nonetheless the correlation of one to one for the 
exchange of Belarusian rubles for Russian rubles now seems 
absolutely unacceptable. The September agreement on the 
unification of the monetary systems has been approved by a 
parliamentary majority in Belarus. It must be supposed that the 
January agreements will also be ratified there. But the Russian 
Duma will hardly agree to such a disadvantageous exchange of 
money. 
  We know the relatively recent experience of the exchange of 
GDR marks for FRG marks after Germany's reunification. The 
nonequivalence of the exchange produced many additional 
difficulties even for that country's prosperous economy. To 
avoid inflation additional taxes had to be introduced in its 
western lands. Russia, where tax rates are already excessive, 
is barred from such a route. Consequently, nonequivalent 
exchange could intensify inflation. 
  To determine a rational rate for the exchange of "hares" 
for Russian rubles regular exchange sales of Belarusian currency 
are needed -- to refine its quotation price; we must also 
calculate the cost of similar selections of consumer items in 
Belarusian and Russian rubles -- to compare their purchasing 
power. 
  The drastic decline of the Belarusian ruble exchange rate in 
recent months makes concern for the stability of the future 
joint monetary system -- not only statically, at the moment of 
unification, but also dynamically -- particularly topical. And 
the main thing for this stability is to ensure that market 
reforms are conducted in synchrony. Hence Belarus' task of 
accelerating the liberalization of prices and privatization, 
bringing them up to Russia's level. 
  In conclusion, it must be admitted that less than four 
months 
have not been enough for such a complex and crucial matter. 
Time out essential for the more thorough working through of the 
problem is in my view preferable to hasty decisions. But there 
are grounds for fearing that political motives will yet again 
prevail over economic expediency and the fundamentally necessary 
agreement will in practice become a heavy burden to the Russian 
economy.

Georgiy Shmelev: "CIS and Baltic Countries Are Focus of 
Russia's Immediate Vital Interests"] 
  [Text] The CIS and Baltic countries are the focus of 
Russia's immediate vital interests, Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev has told a Russian Foreign Ministry conference on 
Russian foreign policy issues in this region. 
  Andrey Kozyrev said that defense of Russians' rights in the 
former Union republics is one of the main strategic issues in 
Russian foreign policy. In his opinion, the question of dual 
citizenship has now become a key element here. The minister 
stressed that it has of late proved possible to secure greater 
understanding on this score. 
  Among other most pressing problems the minister pointed to 
the need to boost the effectiveness of existing cooperation 
mechanisms and to create new ones, as well as to develop a 
short-, medium-, and long-term strategy for forming an economic 
union. 
  The minister spoke about military and military-technical 
cooperation and underlined the need to retain a Russian military 
presence in this region. "We should not leave regions that for 
centuries have been spheres of Russian interests. We should not 
be frightened of these words." The "security vacuum" created as 
a result of the Russian troops' withdrawal will "inevitably be 
filled by other forces, by no means always friendly forces, 
moreover, and in many cases directly hostile to Russian 
interests," the minister stressed.

  [Text] A representative of Russia's Foreign Ministry, 
Galina Sidrova, has stated that Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
didn't speak out for the continuing presence of Russian troops 
in the Baltic countries when addressing a meeting on foreign 
policy in Moscow on Monday [17 January]. Galina Sidrova 
stressed that the ITAR-TASS news agency has distorted the 
meaning of what the minister said. According to the ITAR-TASS 
news agency, Andrey Kozyrev objected to the withdrawal of 
Russia's troops from those regions. 
  America's Department of State has pointed out that what 
minister said, as was quoted by the news media, runs counter to 
the statements made at the Russian-American summit. A spokesman 
of the State Department, Michael McKerry, noted that the joint 
declaration of the Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin 
speaks about the speedy withdrawal of Russian troops from the 
Baltic countries.

<F P=106> [Report by Georgiy Bovt under the "Russia Revises Its </F>
Foreign Policy" rubric: "The Foreign Affairs Ministry Is 
Ridding Itself of the `Belovezhskaya Forest Syndrome'"] 
  [Text] Yesterday a two-day conference on aspects of 
Russia's policy with respect to the CIS and the Baltic countries 
opened in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. For the 
first time all the ambassadors of the former Soviet republics 
have gathered in Moscow. Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev made a 
speech whose keynote was the protection of Russia's interests in 
the CIS and Baltic countries. The process of the conference 
itself confirms KOMMERSANT-DAILY's predictions that the more 
often Russian leaders assure that there will be no revision of 
the country's foreign policy after the 12 December elections, 
the more obvious it becomes that this revision has grown urgent. 
The conference is analyzed by KOMMERSANT-DAILY's commentator 
Georgiy Bovt. 
  Andrey Kozyrev stated that as of now protection of the 
interests of Russians in the former Soviet republics is one of 
the strategic priorities for Moscow. Meanwhile the Concept on 
Foreign Policy, adopted by the Security Council in March 1993, 
in its section dealing with relations with the CIS, makes no 
mention of this problem whatsoever (Georgia, Azerbaijan, and 
Moldova were simply passed over in silence); the section on 
relations with the Baltic states does not elaborate on this 
problem sufficiently. The year 1993, however, can be called 
"the year of Russian refugees." They have been emigrating in 
masses even from such seemingly "agreeable" countries as 
Kyrgyzstan. Their exodus has intensified from Turkmenistan, 
Uzbekistan, the war-torn Tajikistan, and -- as a result of the 
"policy of soft eviction" -- from the Baltic countries. The 
number of Russian-speaking refugees (defined according to UN 
criteria) has already reached 2 million people. 
  The 12 December elections showed that the artful rhetoric of 
the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and the Russian 
Federation Communist Party has found a response among the 
greater part of the electorate. The thesis that votes for the 
Liberal Democratic Party and the Communist Party are votes 
"against the methods of reforms" is partly a delusion. In fact 
the disintegration of the USSR is still being painfully 
perceived by many in Russia -- even if at the emotional, 
everyday level. It seems that the Russian Foreign Affairs 
Ministry also understands this. Although in a recent article in 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Andrey Kozyrev still maintained that the 
president is the guarantee of Russia's course and its protection 
against national extremism, and that this course itself will 
remain just as predictable, open, and oriented toward 
partner-like relations with the outside world, the minister's 
speech yesterday showed that adjustments are already being made. 
  For the first time he openly articulated the thought that 
has 
long been aired in corridors on Smolenskaya Ploshchad [Foreign 
Ministry] that the former Soviet republics are the sources of 
"main threats" to Russia's interests. This was followed up with 
another fundamentally new conclusion: Moscow's strategic task 
consists in "preserving a military presence" in this region. 
Because, as Kozyrev now believes, to pull out of the CIS 
completely is just as absurd as to send tanks there. The 
minister fears a strategic vacuum that could be filled by 
unfriendly forces; he did not specify who he has in mind -- the 
mujahedin in Tajikistan, the fundamentalists in the 
Transcaucasus, the Romanian nationalists in Moldova, or even 
NATO in the Baltics. 
  The head of the Foreign Affairs Ministry also touched on the 
problems of an economic union in the CIS. Noting the risk 
involved in hasty actions, he nonetheless gave a possible 
appraisal of Russia's and Belarus' plans to merge their monetary 
systems. It seems that the wish to get rid of the guilt complex 
for the Belovezhskaya Forest agreements -- even at the price of 
the ruble's destabilization -- is increasingly affecting the 
politicians who remain in the government. Meanwhile the idea of 
"Western liberalism" may be replaced, for instance, by the idea 
of "putting together a quasi-USSR." It is too soon to say yet 
which motives will prevail: The neighbors' overwhelming 
attraction to NATO, the wish to win the electorate back from the 
Liberal Democratic Party, or the intention to divert the 
Russians' attention from the collapsed reforms.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Nikolayev article under "Security" rubric: </F>
"Vilnius Politicians Demand Missile Umbrella for Lithuania From 
NATO"] 
  [Text] As you know, the extraordinary NATO Council session 
in Brussels 10-11 January decided in favor of creating new 
Euro-Atlantic security structures to include Russia. This 
notwithstanding, the debate is continuing in Central and East 
Europe over the question of the unilateral eastward expansion of 
the North Atlantic alliance and the granting to these countries 
of bloc security guarantees without heed for Russia's vital 
interests. 
  Observing Vilnius officialdom's vigorous political rhetoric 
at this time over the republic's request to be admitted to NATO 
and, in particular, the statements on this score by J. 
Paletskis, adviser to the Lithuanian head of state, you 
involuntarily imagine yourself at a performance in a provincial 
theater given by amateur actors who faultlessly mouth the lines 
they have learned on stage but have a poor understanding, 
however, of the big picture and the roles of the main 
protagonists. 
  Lithuania's desire to come under the NATO defense umbrella, 
adviser Paletskis explains, is not directed against neighboring 
states and will not complicate its "good relations" with Russia. 
The political naivete of these statements, which are evidently 
designed as a formal apology to Russia, is obvious. Along with 
the illusory nature -- obvious even to a nonspecialist -- of the 
hopes of its request being met at this crucial stage in European 
history, this does make one wonder about the true motives behind 
this Lithuanian move. 
  Let us leave aside the domestic factors that brought about 
this decision. Even a fleeting glance at Vilnius's foreign 
activity indicates that the eternal desire to publicly combat a 
small state's inferiority complex, a desire which has repeatedly 
played a negative role over the last few years in the most 
recent history of Russian-Lithuanian relations, causing the 
republic considerable economic damage, has once again prevailed 
over the tendency to organize relations with its neighbors in a 
well-considered manner, without excessive emotion. 
  Amid the intensive dialogue under way in Europe over 
partnership strategy in the postbloc era and the vigorous 
formulation of fundamentally new security structures, 
Lithuania's desire to act at the expense of third countries 
evokes feelings of profound surprise and hostility. How can it 
speak of "good relations" with Russia and at the same time 
openly disregard the latter's pressing legitimate concerns which 
it has set out on various occasions -- to Lithuania among others. 
  These concerns are quite clear and understandable: Russia 
will not put up with any steps by its neighbors that hint at the 
possibility of its isolation and the resurrection of its former 
image as the potential adversary of "civilized Europeans." 
  In today's conditions Lithuania's declaration on joining 
NATO 
cannot be interpreted otherwise. Vilnius clearly realizes this, 
which evidently accounts for the desire on the part of top 
Lithuanian officials to hide the obvious and call black white. 
However, people here seem to be disregarding the fact that 
another division of Europe into blocs which would result from 
attempts to bar Russia from taking part in European security 
structures and NATO's expansion in direct proximity to Russia's 
borders may, given the Kaliningrad factor, create in the future 
unacceptable risks for Lithuania itself. 
  It only remains to hope that an honest, realistic approach 
to 
relations with Russia will prevail in Vilnius, along with a 
correct understanding of the interests of Vilnius's own security 
and prosperity, factors which, as it transpires, Lithuania must 
and can develop by acting with Russia rather than against it. 
Only then will the historical mutual mistrust between the two 
countries give way to a desire for partnership, only then will 
Russian-Lithuanian cooperation become natural and mutually 
beneficial and our relations be described as good without any 
diplomatic latitude.

  [Text] Russia stands for achieving "a cease-fire in the 
area of the Armenian-Azeri conflict at any price," the political 
adviser to the head of Russian diplomacy, Galina Sidorova, told 
Interfax on Tuesday after a meeting between Andrey Kozyrev and 
his Azeri counterpart, Gasan Gasanov, in Moscow. 
  Kozyrev and Gasanov, she said, discussed the possibility of 
a 
cease-fire and signing an agreement between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan as soon as possible. 
  As Sidorova said, negotiations between the two sides are 
progressing with difficulty, since many grievances and 
suspicions have built up between them during the conflict. 
  According to Sidorova, "a further escalation of hostilities 
is dangerous not only for the two nations which are actually 
engaged in annihilating each other: It poses a threat to 
stability in the region as a whole. That is why foremost 
importance is attached to the need to stop military actions," 
she said. 
  The head of Russian diplomacy may also confer with Armenia's 
Foreign Minister, Vagan Papazian, in Moscow in the near future, 
Sidorova said. 
  It is possible that the Presidents of Russia, Armenia and 
Azerbaijan - Boris Yeltsin, Levon Ter-Petrosyan and Geydar 
Aliyev, will meet in Moscow before the end of this month.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Stupishin, Russian ambassador </F>
extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Armenia, by Karen Topchyan 
in Yerevan; date not given: "Our Countries Are Allies, the 
Russian Ambassador to Armenia Believes"] 
  [Text] The topic of conversation between ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA's own correspondent in Yerevan and Vladimir Stupishin, 
Russian Federation ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary 
to Armenia, was the relationship between the two countries in 
the context of Moscow's geopolitical interests in the 
Transcaucasus. 
  [Topchyan] Is it possible to speak of relations of alliance 
between Armenia and Russia? 
  [Stupishin] Of course, and this is why. The Treaty of 
Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Security between Russia and 
Armenia was signed back in December 1991. Although it has not 
for various reasons been ratified, our two states are 
nonetheless implementing many articles of this treaty in other 
agreements. In addition, state delegations are functioning 
highly actively in order to conduct talks between the two 
countries and to prepare bilateral agreements on specific 
questions. 
  Further, Russia and Armenia are parties to the Collective 
Security Treaty concluded among certain CIS member countries. 
It is a treaty of alliance and provides precisely for alliance 
commitments. In addition, a treaty has been signed on the 
status of the Russian troops in Armenia -- Russian troops are 
stationed in this country, serve here, hold exercises.... This 
treaty also governs certain parameters of our military 
cooperation. Finally, in accordance with the Treaty on the 
Status of the Border Troops, Russian border guards guard the 
common borders of the CIS in this area along with their Armenian 
colleagues. 
  [Topchyan] Mr. Ambassador, there is a quite widespread 
opinion that Russia, which has perfectly explicable geopolitical 
and strategic interests in the Transcaucasus, relies in its 
policy in this region on Armenia as its traditional ally. Does 
Moscow really have priorities in the Transcaucasus? 
  [Stupishin] As a region which for long years was 
incorporated in the Russian Empire and then in the Soviet Union 
and as a region inhabited by peoples who have built a joint life 
over centuries, the Transcaucasus is undoubtedly a sphere of 
Russia's state interests. I believe that it is not quite 
accurate simply to say that Russia relies on one republic. 
Rather, we are relying on new treaty relations. It so happens 
that Russia was one of the first to start building such 
relations with Armenia. Owing to the different nature of the 
regimes which have been established in the Transcaucasus and the 
different approaches in their attitudes to Russia and the CIS, 
new relations have been established juridically with other 
Transcaucasian republics either later or somewhat differently. 
  Quite honestly, your question contains a somewhat 
frightening 
expression which can be understood as...: Russia relies on just 
one country in the Transcaucasus. Does this mean with it 
against the others? Russia's policy is not quite like that; it 
is different, in fact. It means with this country, but not 
against the others. We also seek to organize good-neighborly 
relations with the others. For Russia has an interest in 
ensuring that its closest neighbors are able to build their 
lives under peaceful conditions. The normal development of 
Russia itself depends on this. The bloody conflicts in various 
parts of the former USSR damage our economic interests as well 
as those of others. Russia therefore seeks to help everywhere 
and to be of service in settling conflicts. 
  [Topchyan] Incidentally, please tell us about Russia's 
role in settling the Karabakh conflict. 
  [Stupishin] Obviously, in seeking to help find political 
means to resolve that conflict Russia acts in the role of a 
go-between. As the experience of the past few months shows, it 
is precisely these peacemaking efforts and the readiness shown 
last summer by both Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan to come to 
the negotiating table that have, in fact, brought the first 
positive results in the form of a cease-fire. 
  [Topchyan] Many people believe that Russia is interested 
only in "freezing" the Karabakh conflict -- and not just the 
Karabakh conflict.... 
  [Stupishin] Russia sets itself no such goal. What does 
"freezing" mean? A cease-fire -- and everything is postponed 
indefinitely? Our aim is to bring all conflicts, at least those 
on the territory of the former Union, to a peaceful political 
settlement. A genuine settlement implies using a cease-fire as 
a means of creating favorable conditions for a process of 
negotiation. 
  [Topchyan] What is the state of Russian-Armenian relations, 
and what are the prospects? 
  [Stupishin] They can be described very positively. They are 
developing normally. The existing difficulties are primarily of 
a technical nature. They are also connected with the fact that 
we are living through a period of the breakup of the Soviet 
structure and the building of new relations both within the CIS 
framework and on a bilateral basis.

Churkin, the Russian president's special representative, met in 
Geneva today with Serb President Slobodan Milosevic and Croatian 
President Franjo Tudjman; Thorvald Stoltenberg and David Owen, 
co-chairmen of the coordinating committee of the conference on 
the former Yugoslavia; and Charles Redman, representing the U.S. 
Administration. The consultations enabled a wide range of 
problems relating to the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina to 
be discussed. 
  Vitaliy Churkin told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that the 
current round of talks on the Bosnian settlement, which started 
in Geneva on Tuesday [18 January], "is progressing with 
difficulty." "The aggravation of the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina provides unfavorable conditions for the 
negotiating process," said the Russian representative. 
"Nevertheless, there are some bright spots. It seems that we 
have managed to resolve the problem of replacing Canadian blue 
helmets with the Dutch in Srebrenica, the UN security zone. We 
are satisfied with this development and expect no further 
problems."

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Sychev: "Pacific Fleet Sells </F>
Written-Off Submarines and Is Happy"] 
  [Text] The Asia-Pacific Region is panicking slightly. 
Following the four written-off "Foxtrot" class Russian 
submarines (IZVESTIYA No. 9), the Pacific Fleet has apparently 
sold another 10 "Golf-2" submarines, capable of carrying three 
SS-5 sea-based ballistic missiles, to North Korea. 
  The unease in the countries in the region neighboring North 
Korea is entirely explicable. Pyongyang does not allow the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to monitor Korean 
nuclear reactors, thereby reinforcing the world community's 
suspicions that secret plans exist in North Korea to acquire 
nuclear weapons. "Nodong" missiles, copied from the famous 
"Scuds," have been flying out of the country's military test 
sites. 
  Reports obtained by IZVESTIYA at the Navy Press Center 
provide no grounds for suspecting the Russian military of having 
an frivolous attitude. A contract has been signed by the 
Russian Ministry of Defense, which, by an edict of the 
president, has been authorized to sell written-off warships for 
scrap. 
  An agreement has been signed with the Japanese firm "Toen 
[name as transliterated] Trade Inc." for the sale of 12 diesel 
submarines manufactured in the period between 1961 and 1968. 
They have outlived their service life and, so we were told, it 
is no longer safe to go to sea in them -- indeed, it is now 
quite impossible to do so. Under the contract, all the 
submarines have been brought to a condition which rules out the 
possibility of restoring them for naval use. All weapons, basic 
equipment, and precious metals have been removed from them. The 
"Toen Trade Inc." firm will receive only the hulls, which it 
will supply itself to a ship-cutting enterprise. 
  Under the terms of the contact the company does not have the 
right to re-sell the submarines for purposes other than in the 
form of scrap, and it is obliged to supply documents confirming 
that the hull has been cut into pieces. Defense Ministry 
experts will be on site to monitor the fulfillment of the 
contract. 
  The Japanese company has so far collected only one 
submarine. 
The contract does not stipulate where the submarines will be cut 
up or who will finally get the scrap. The Navy Press Center 
refused to name the sum involved in the contract, saying merely 
that the fleet did not get a bad bargain.

  [Text] Moscow still nurtures the vision of developing 
Vietnam's Cam Ranh Bay, strategic deep-sea port in Southeast 
Asla during the Cold War, into an international commercial port, 
a Russian diplomat said yesterday. 
  Mr Andrey Tatarinon of the Russian Embassy in Bangkok told a 
seminar at Chulalongkorn University that Russia still maintains 
a limited presence at Cam Ranh Bay, after withdrawing most of 
its forces in 1992. 
  "Some limited presence still remains as a factor of 
stability 
in the region," he said in response to a question from guest 
speaker Dr Michael Share of Hong Kong University. 
  Dr Share has been giving a series of lectures on the 
collapse 
of the Soviet Union, its implications to World Commumsm, and 
Russian foreign policy in Southeast Asia which have been 
organised by the university's Institute of Asian Studies. 
  "ASEAN does not talk about it (the limited Russian 
presence), 
and Vietnam doesn't insist on our total withdrawal," Mr Tatarmon 
said. 
  He said the Russian military and Vietnam continued to 
negotiate a lease of Cam Ranh Bay, which America had developed 
during the Vietnam War. 
  However, the issue is not a priority in bilateral relations. 
  "There are bigger problems--Vietnam's debts (estimated US$8 
billion) joint exploitation of petrochemicals and other things," 
he said. 
  The development of Cam Ranh Bay into an international 
commercial port was first proposed by then Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev at the annual meeting of the foreign 
ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) 
in Manila, in July. Russia was then invited as a guest of ASEAN. 
"We are not necessarily rushing to leave Cam Ranh," he told 
reporters. 
  Mr Kozyrev proposed the transformation of the facilities at 
both Cam Ranh Bay and Subic--the naval base in the Phihppines 
controlled by Cold War enemy, the U.S.--into logistics support 
centres for naval activities. 
  "What is important is to transform this arrangement into one 
that exudes the new strategy of stability and cooperation in 
this region," Mr Kozyrev told reporters. 
  Mr Tatarinon added that the proposal may be taken up by 
ASEAN 
itself in the next few years. 
  Cam Ranh Bay is said to be one of the region's best natural 
deep- sea ports.

<F P=106> [Report by diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, </F>
Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others; from the 
"Diplomatic Panorama" feature] 
  [Text] Russia continues to actively cooperate with India's 
National Space Agency and is prepared to supply it with seven 
contracts, the Director General of Russia's Space Agency, Yuri 
Koptev, told Interfax. 
  According to him, the $220 Mn contract signed with the 
former 
USSR remains virtually the same amount, even though Moscow had 
to give up the supplies of booster technologies stipulated in 
the contract. 
  According to Koptev, Russia agreed to shoulder some of the 
commitments connected with India's space program. For instance, 
it is prepared to supply cryogen boosters (i.e. the last stage 
of the booster rocket) for India's Geostationary Satellite 
Launch Vehicles. 
  In addition, Russia has signed a contract worth $28 Mn for 
the production and supply of equipment to service cryogen 
booster systems.

<F P=106> [KReport by Radik Batyrshin in the "Federation Council" </F>
column: "Shumeyko Now Has Deputies. Viktor Chernomyrdin Has Had 
a Lunch With Senators] 
  [Text] Ramazan Abdulatipov, first deputy chairman of the 
State Committee on Federal Affairs and former speaker of the 
House of Nationalities in the former Russian Federation Supreme 
Soviet, has become deputy head of the Russian senate. He 
received 117 votes out of 156 in the Federation Council. 
Informed sources say that there was covert agreement between 
Ramazan Abdulatipov and Vladimir Shumeyko whereby the former 
speaker of the House of Nationalities must not obstruct the 
first deputy premier's taking the chairman's spot. It is no 
wonder that after his victory Vladimir Shumeyko offered Ramazan 
Abdulatipov the post of his deputy on nationalities affairs. 
The second deputy chairman of the Russian senate (in charge of 
industry and agriculture) is Valeryan Viktorov, chairman of the 
Chuvashia Council of Ministers. For him the new post is an 
opportunity to avoid a highly likely resignation which could 
follow the inauguration of Chuvashia's first president, Nikolay 
Fedorov. 
  The post of the third deputy chairman of the Federation 
Council was contested by Vladimir Shumeyko's main rival for the 
chair of speaker in the upper parliament chamber, Petr Romanov, 
director of the Krasnoyarsk-based Yenisey chemical plant; and 
Aleksandr Kovalev, head of the Voronezh Oblast administration. 
Neither of them polled the requisite number of votes. 
Therefore Vladimir Shumeyko proposed that the election of his 
third deputy be moved to the next session of the upper 
parliament chamber. In between the election of the deputy the 
Russian senators discussed a list of committees in the upper 
house. At 1340 the session was interrupted. Government 
chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin invited the heads of the Russian 
regions to lunch. It will be recalled that on 13 January Viktor 
Chernomyrdin had lunch with the heads of the krays, oblasts, and 
republics, persuading them to vote for Vladimir Shumeyko as 
speaker of the Russian senate. 
  The meeting between the regional leaders and the chairman of 
the Russian Government lasted for two hours. According to one 
of the participants in the meeting, Victor Chernomyrdin stated 
that all the requisite powers must be transferred to the 
regions. He told the heads of the republics that especially to 
this end, a government commission is being set up headed by Vice 
Premier Yuriy Yarov which is to discuss and map out ways to 
address the problems involved in relations between the center 
and regions, primarily those concerned with the budget and 
finances. According to another participant in the meeting, the 
Yarov commission will include two representatives from eight 
interregional economic associations. In a goodwill gesture 
Viktor Chernomyrdin said that as of now the institution of the 
Russian Federation president's representatives in the krays, 
oblasts, and republics is abolished. A corresponding edict will 
be promulgated shortly. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin told the regional leaders that the 
composition of the new government will be announced on 18 
January. Apart from the ministries five committees will remain 
in the government, including the State Property Management 
Committee. Responding to complaints by the regional leaders 
about the state's debts and problems of mutual financial 
settlements and payments, Victor Chernomyrdin said that a draft 
decree on the agriculture sector is pending whereby the state 
will settle its debts with agricultural producers (400 billion 
rubles) and make available credits for spring field work. 
Furthermore Viktor Chernomyrdin promised to set up a special 
commission to speed up settlements within Russian's banking 
system and thereby resolve the problem of mutual clearance. It 
is noteworthy that Viktor Chernomyrdin did not say a single word 
about the election of Vladimir Shumeyko as chairman of the upper 
chamber.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz January 15 TASS -- Northern Ossetia is 
getting ready for the elections of its first president on 
January 16. 
  Sources at the Central Electoral Commission told ITAR-TASS 
everything has been prepared. The ballot sheet includes names 
of two candidates -- that of North Ossetian Parliament Speaker 
Akhsarbek Galazov and Prime Minister Sergey Khetagurov; the rest 
four candidates quit the election campaign. 
  According to information of the North Ossetian Humanitarian 
Research Institute's sociology service, Galazov has the highest 
rating. 
  North Ossetian mass media circulated today a decree of the 
Russian president "on suspension of the state of emergency 
regime on part of territories of Northern Ossetia and 
Ingushetia." 
  The decree says the Russian president has decided to suspend 
from midnight of January 16 through midnight of January 17, 
1994, the validity of the state of emergency regime on part of 
Northern Ossetia and Ingushetia that has been prolonged by the 
Russian president's decree of November 30, 1993. A reason for 
this is the need to ensure citizens' right to vote during the 
elections of the North Ossetian president. 
  Allied forces attached to the temporary administration on 
territories of the Mozdok, Prigorodnyy regions and adjoining 
areas of Northern Ossetia and the Malgobek and Nazran regions of 
Ingushetia shall take measures to protect citizens and ensure 
order in public places. 
  The North Ossetian situation is relatively calm. Not a 
single inter-ethnic armed clash has been reported over the past 
24 hours. The Russian peace-makers together with the local 
law-enforcement bodies fully control the situation in the 
security zone.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz January 16 TASS -- North Ossetia is 
holding its first ever presidential elections on Sunday. At 
7:00 A.M., 300 polling stations located in cities, regional 
centres and remote mountainous villages opened to receive first 
electors. The voting will continue until 20:00 P.M. 
  Two candidates have been put on ballot papers, including 
chairman of the North Ossetian parliament Akhsarbek Galazov and 
head of the North Ossetian government, Sergey Khetagurov. 
  For the time being, Galazov has the highest rating,

the Central Electoral Commission. The turn-out as reported by 
10:00 A.M. was average. The people are casting their ballots in 
a calm atmosphere and no violations of the franchise have been 
reported. 
  Galazov has already voted at polling station No. 189 in 
Vladikavkaz. Asked by a journalist which candidate he had 
crossed out from his ballot paper, Galazov said "one of the two". 
  Talking to representatives of the mass media, Galazov said 
that "the elections of the first North Ossetian president should 
consolidate the multinational population of the republic and 
give a positive impetus to reforms in economy and a political 
life."

elections 
of the North Ossetian president a state of emergency in North 
Ossetia and Ingushetia had been suspended for twenty four hours

  [Text] Vladikavkaz January 17 TASS -- "I am grateful to 
the multinational people of North Ossetia for supporting my 
candidature during the election campaign and for voting for me 
at the January 16 elections," North Ossetian President-Elect

"The winners are above all, the sound forces who cherish the 
interests of peace and concord", he said. 
  "The elections of the president of the republic must 
consolidate the republic's multinational society, they must 
provide a positive impulse for the active implementation of 
reforms in the economy, social sphere and political life. Much 
work lies ahead, primarily associated with reforming state 
structures and local government bodies, the adoption of a new 
constitution of the Republic of North Ossetia. Everything must 
be done for the benefit of the people". 
  The Central Electoral Commission is now summarising the 
final

160,000 voters, or 66.3 per cent cast their ballots in favour of 
Galazov, while than 81,000 people (33.7 per cent) voted for his 
rival, government leader Sergey Khetagurov.

supported by the masses of working people, veterans, teachers, 
scientists and cultural personalities. Sergey Khetagurov was 
mainly backed by industrialists, entrepreneurs and commercial 
structures. 
  Akhsarbek Galazov was born in 1929 in an old Ossetian 
village 
of Khumalag in the Pravoberezhniy district of North Ossetia. 
After graduating from a teacher-training institute, he taught 
Russian to schoolchildren. He then worked as an education 
ministry inspector, head of the teacher-retraining institute, 
the minister of education of North Ossetia and the chairman of 
the council of ministers. 
  From 1976 Akhsarbek Galazov worked as the rector of the 
North 
Ossetian State University. He is a professor who has written 
scientific works, manuals and monographs devoted to teaching and 
linguistics. From 1990 to 1991 Akhsarbek Galazov was the first 
secretary of the North Ossetian regional committee of the 
Communist Party of the Soviet Union. From 1990 he was chairman 
of the Supreme Soviet of the North Ossetian Soviet Socialist 
Republic (now the Republic of North Ossetia).

consolidation of all branches of power and a peaceful settlement 
of relations between North Ossetia and Ingushetia.

  [Text] Groznyy January 16 TASS -- Yaragiy Mamodayev, head 
of the Chechen Government of popular confidence, called upon the 
republic's President Dzhokhar Dudayev to admit that his rule had 
no prospects, to immediately report back to his people and step 
down. Mamodayev's open letter with this appeal was published on 
Sunday by Chechnya's only independent newspaper "SPRAVEDLIVOST." 
  The opposition leader claimed that Dudayev's two-year rule 
had led the republic to a deadlock. But now, he said, "the 
people has begun to see clearly, it seeks to build a free state 
not to only shut itself off by borders and customs from the rest 
of the world. It does not want to quarell with its neighbours, 
both close and distant. It does not want to be treated with 
suspicion or estrangement." And if the present leaders cannot 
understand this, it is better for them to resign, Mamodayev 
stressed. 
  The more so, that neither Dzhokhar Dudayev nor the Chechen 
people brought to the verge of national disaster have much time 
left, the head of the government of popular confidence.

"Tatarstan May Leave Volga Region and Join the Urals"] 
  [Text] Tatarstan President Mentimer Shaymiyev said at the 
inauguration of Bashkortostan President Murtaza Rakhimov that 
Tatarstan may join the Ural Association in the future. 
  The reason is the ineffectiveness of the activity of the 
analagous structure of the Volga region to which Tatarstan 
currently belongs.

  [Text] Kazan -- The People's Assembly held in Kazan under 
the aegis of the All-Russia Tatar Center (VTOTS) and the 
National Assembly has made a decision to hold a referendum on 
three questions: "Do you agree that Tatarstan be proclaimed a 
neutral state?," "Do you agree that Russian Federation 
citizenship should be given priority in Tatarstan with Russian 
Federation passports being issued?," and "Do you agree that the 
population of the republic of Tatarstan do its military service 
on the territory of the Republic of Tatarstan?" Not less than 
180,000 signatures must be raised for the referendum to go ahead. 
  A session of the Kazan branch of the ITTIFAK Tatar party of 
national independence has expelled from its membership Flera 
Zaynullina, party secretary, who recently was awarded the title 
of "Valorous Daughter of the Tatar People." Observers believe 
that one of the reasons for this was her statement at the World 
Assembly of Turkic People (Washington, 2 through 5 December 
1993) which abounded in attacks on Russians and representatives 
of other ethnic groups living in the republic. 
  Meanwhile the first Russia-wide Tatar newspaper, BERDEMLEK 
(Unity), founded by the Tatarstan Government and ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA, has been launched; this is the first ethnic publication 
in the Russian Federation with nationwide status (circulation 
over 1 million copies). BERDEMLEK will come out in Russian once 
a week as a supplement to ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and will be 
distributed in all regions of the Russian Federation with the 
view to give objective coverage of events in Tatarstan.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Lukashev report in the "Tataria" column: "Repeat </F>
Elections Will Be Held in March If a Treaty Between Tataria and 
Russia Is Signed"] 
  [Text] The Russian Central Election Commission has ruled 
that repeat elections in Tataria will be held on 13 March. 
  The republic's citizens are to elect deputies to the State 
Duma in five single-seat constituencies and to the Federation 
Council in a two-seat constituency. Under the current election 
statute, the candidates are to raise the requisite number of 
signatures for registration again. 
  Local observers believe that this time the republic's 
leadership has no reason to block the elections: After 12 
December, when 12.9 percent of the electorate turned out at the 
polling stations, the local authorities had grounds to say that 
"the people are with us, not with Moscow." It is even accepted 
that someone from among the supreme leadership in the republic 
may want to run for the Federation Council, possibly President 
Shaymiyev himself. 
  Furthermore, it is not ruled that the ongoing reformation of 
the representative and executive bodies in Tataria will end with 
the calling of elections to the local National Assembly, also on 
13 March. This option is being discussed in the lobbies of the 
republic's Supreme Soviet and it will possibly be submitted to 
the deputies at the Supreme Soviet session scheduled for the 
second half of January. 
  As for Mintimer Shaymiyev himself, he attended the 
Federation 
Council session on its first day as an observer. In an 
interview with SEGODNYA the Tatarstan president said that the 
repeat elections will be held in the republic provided the 
treaty between Russia and Tataria is signed before 13 March. 
"Otherwise the people of Tatarstan will simply have no reason 
to go to the polls," Mr. Shaymiyev said.

under him, has resigned in full strength. It was pointed out at 
a press conference that the decision was not related to the 
executive branch representatives' unwillingness to cooperate 
with the new chief of administration, nor was it a protest 
against his appointment. The government did so proceeding from 
generally applied standards: Once a chief is gone, his cabinet 
goes, too. The new governor has asked all members of the oblast 
administration to stay on until February, when a new Sverdlovsk 
Oblast government will be formed.

<F P=106> [Arkadiy Zheludkov report: "Businessmen Blown Up. </F>
Passersby Die"] 
  [Text] Explosions in the center of Moscow are a lamentable 
tradition. This time the latest explosion boomed out on 
Ostuzhev Street -- a homemade explosive device was planted 
beneath the apartment window of Dmitriy Tsyn, director of the 
"`Alternativa' Trading House" Joint-Stock Company. One man died 
and three were injured as a result of the explosion. 
  A chance passerby died -- Sergey Plamenevskiy, a fitter from 
the local Rayon Housing Administration, who was doing the rounds 
of Nos. 16 and 17, Ostuzhev Street. He died from his injuries 
an hour after the explosion -- at 1000 hours in the 
Sklifosovskiy Emergency Hospital. The three other victims -- 
Dmitriy Tsyn, the presumed target of the explosion, outside 
whose window the bomb went off; his bodyguard Yuriy Dukayev; and 
driver Mikhail Strukov -- suffered shrapnel wounds. Only the 
businessman is now fit for work. 
  The explosion also blew out the windows in Nos. 16 and 17. 
  An explosion outside the apartment of a trading house 
director can hardly be regarded as commonplace -- the 
investigation has not yet ascertained the motive for the crime. 
Dmitriy Borisovich claims that in 34 years he has not made any 
enemies, no one has threatened him, but what is most offensive 
and incomprehensible is that no one had warned him, even 
anonymously, about any of his actions, as criminals and 
terrorists are wont to do. What is more, Tsyn admits that even 
if the bandits had demanded money from him, he would not have 
been able to pay up -- in 1993 the "`Alternativa' Trading House" 
invested all its money in developing and setting up enterprises: 
It set up two insurance companies and several branches from 
Estonia to Magnitogorsk, and expects to receive the profit in a 
year at the earliest. At the moment all it has is debts. 
  The investigation into the explosion will take two 
directions 
at once: A headquarters has been set up, where highly competent 
specialists from the City Internal Affairs Administration will 
work on several scenarios. They are not ruling out the idea 
that the explosion outside the businessman's apartment was a 
warning to one of his partners or apartment block neighbors, nor 
are they ruling out the idea that the bandits' demands might be 
made after the event, which Dmitriy Borisovich himself does not 
deny. As well as the official investigation, the case of the 
explosion will be tackled by the "`Alternativa' Trading House" 
security service, which comprises two retired top-class 
specialists -- Colonel Kotov, former head of Moscow Criminal 
Investigations Department, and KGB General Ryabov -- as well as 
a staff of over 50 people armed with regulation weapons issued 
under City Internal Affairs Administration license. Who will be 
the first to clear up the crime?

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Pozdnyakov report under the "Public" rubric: </F>
"Elections to Petersburg City Assembly Will Be Watched. Mayor 
Decides To Introduce `Presidential Qualification' for Deputies"] 
  [Text] Eight St. Petersburg political parties and the city 
branches of all-Russia parties (among them are the Regional 
Party of the Center, the Russian Federation Communist Party, the 
"Civic Union" association, and the regional branch of the 
Democratic Party of Russia) have formed a Public Committee to 
monitor the elections for City Assembly. The founders of the 
committee have sent an appeal to the electoral commission 
suggesting that regulations for the elections for the City 
Assembly confirmed by the city mayor should be amended to match 
the Constitution of Russia and the presidential laws defining 
general rules for elections for local bodies of representative 
power. 
  According to the leader of the Regional Party of St. 
Petersburg, former city soviet deputy Aleksandr Belkin, who 
drafted the appeal to the electoral commission, the regulations 
for the elections for the City Assembly contain "a mass of 
violations" of the Constitution and presidential laws. In 
particular, the rights of electoral associations are infringed 
upon by the demand to secure at least 35,000 voters' signatures 
in electoral districts for the nomination of their candidates. 
  The leaders of a number of political parties are going to 
protest in court against the most apparent violation of the 
Constitution -- the introduction of a five-year "residential 
qualification" for candidates. In their opinion, this 
restriction curtails the equality of citizens of Russia, which 
does not depend on their place of residence -- this is 
established by the Constitution. 
  The founders of the Public Committee for monitoring the 
course of elections for the City Assembly have declared their 
organization open to political organizations that agree with its 
objectives and tasks. So far there has been no one wishing to 
join it, however, despite the fact that many politicians share 
the founders' point of view. They are probably deterred by the 
membership in the committee of the Russian Federation Communist 
Party and the rather notorious near-trade union association "For 
Justice." The city organization of the "Greens" party, for 
example, having seen the founders lists, abandoned the idea of 
joining. "Greens" leader Yevgeniy Usov thus explained the 
reason: "We are not going to do any business with Communists."

  [Text] The subject of the main disagreement during the 
meeting in the Kremlin between the president of the Russian 
Federation and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, at which they 
discussed the composition of the government, was Boris Fedorov. 
An ITAR-TASS correspondent learned this from a high-ranking 
source in the president's apparatus. 
  The prime minister offered Boris Fedorov the post of finance 
minister in the reshuffled government. In response, Fedorov 
stipulated his conditions: the resignation of Deputy Prime 
Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha and Central Bank Chairman Viktor 
Gerashchenko. According to the same source, Viktor Chernomyrdin 
and First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets did not accept Boris 
Fedorov's demands. As a result, Boris Fedorov announced his 
resignation. Thus, the composition of the government remains 
unknown.

  [Text] Consultations between the Russian president and the 
prime minister on the composition of the reshuffled government 
may continue until the end of this week, INTERFAX was told today 
by a source within the administration of the head of state which 
wishes to remain anonymous. 
  The source maintains that differences between Boris Yeltsin 
and Viktor Chernomyrdin on a number of candidacies for key 
Cabinet posts presented to the prime minister have somewhat 
delayed a decision on the Cabinet's personal composition. 
  The source offered the following rough forecast: 
Chernomyrdin 
as the prime minister, Oleg Soskovets as the first deputy prime 
minister, Chubays, Fedorov, Yarov, Zaveryukha as deputy prime 
ministers, Grachev, Yerin, and Kozyrev as ministers in charge of 
decision-making ministries, and Gerashchenko, as chairman of the 
Central Bank.

  [Text] Moscow January 18 TASS -- Russia's new government 
composition is still unclear after six hours of non-stop talks 
between President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. 
  According to a reliable source, no documents shaping out a 
new cabinet have been signed yet. 
  Conflicting media reports on Boris Fedorov's stance were 
clarified to some extent by Valentin Sergeyev, chief of the 
governmental press service. He quoted Fedorov as telling him by 
telephone at 15:30 today that he has "not formally asked to 
resign as a vice-premier". But he has "not accepted the 
prime-minister's offer to hold the post of finance minister in 
the reformed cabinet", Fedorov was quoted as saying.

  [Text] Vice Premier Boris Fedorov has still not received an 
official answer to his rejection to occupy the post of Finance 
Minister in Russia's new government. 
  In his interview with INTERFAX, Fedorov reaffirmed that the 
day before, on Tuesday, he forwarded a letter to President Boris 
Yeltsin in which he called the proposal to head the Finance 
Ministry as "unacceptable." 
  He also reported that he disagrees with the turn in economic 
policy which has become quite obvious. Fedorov is against 
Aleksandr Zaveryukha occupying the post of vice premier and 
Viktor Gerashchenko the post of the Central Bank of Russia's 
chairman. 
  The letter also contains several other explanations 
regarding 
his refusal about which Fedorov decided not to inform "for the 
time being." 
  On Tuesday neither the prime minister nor the president gave 
their answers to this letter. At the same time, Fedorov 
underlined that he had not presented any letter regarding his 
resignation. 
  Sources close to Fedorov believe that the final issue on his 
participation or non-participation in the government has not 
been solved yet. 
  Nevertheless, a well-informed source in the Russian 
Government reported to INTERFAX on Tuesday that Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin made a decision not to include Fedorov in 
the composition of Russia's re-organized government as Finance 
Minister "according to Fedorov's provisions." 
  This source asserts that President Yeltsin shares this 
opinion. 
  On Tuesday during their working meeting in the Kremlin, 
Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin did not sign any decree on the 
composition of the reorganized government.

discussed in particular. The meeting lasted six and a half 
hours, but no decision on the personnel composition of the 
government was taken. 
  From the Kremlin, Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin went 
off to their dachas. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, INTERFAX reports, 
told journalists today that Viktor Chernomyrdin had offered him 
a choice of two posts in the new government -- minister for CIS 
affairs or economics minister. Shokhin is going to announce his 
decision tomorrow. 
  Today too, Sergey Shakhray, another deputy prime minister, 
stated, according to the POSTFAKTUM agency, that he had been 
offered the post of minister of nationality affairs and regional 
policy. It is not yet known whether he has accepted the offer. 
  Meanwhile Boris Fedorov's press secretary denied a report 
that he has resigned. In a RIA interview, the press secretary 
said, literally, the following: Boris Grigoryevich has not 
accepted the prime minister's proposal that he should retain 
just the post of finance minister, but neither has he resigned.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" No. 11 feature] </F>
  [Text] According to Interfax's sources, President Boris 
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin are now 
discussing the set up of a new Russian government. 
  The president had accepted the resignation of Yegor Gaydar 
who told Interfax that he more or less knew who would be serve 
in the government. In his view, Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays, 
a member of Russia's Choice, should not resign while Vice 
Premier and Finance Minister Boris Fedorov should. 
  Officials in Fedorov's secretariat told Interfax Tuesday 
that 
he had rejected the prime minister's offer to stay as finance 
minister in the reorganized government but had not resigned 
either of his positions. 
  When he met Chernomyrdin Monday, Fedorov demanded special 
powers in pursuing his financial and economic policy "in line 
with what he was promised when he was appointed vice premier in 
1992." 
  Fedorov told Interfax that he could stay "as just the 
finance 
minister" if there was just one first premier, Oleg Soskovets, 
but not if there are four or five vice premiers. 
  He confirmed that he had also demanded that Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha should not be a vice premier and Viktor Gerashchenko, 
governor of the Central Bank of Russia. 
  Fedorov's aides told Interfax that he sent a letter to 
Yeltsin Tuesday morning outlining his view of the situation and 
conditions on which he would agree to stay in the government. 
  Meanwhile, an informed source in the government told 
Interfax 
that Chernomyrdin had decided not to have Fedorov in the 
government "on his conditions." 
  The same source says that this opinion is shared by the 
president.

  [Text] "Boris Fedorov's possible resignation as finance 
minister does not mean a sharp softening of Russia's credit and 
monetary policies," the head of the experts' council under the 
Russian government, Yevgeniy Yasin, told Interfax today. 
  In his opinion, "the premier does not seem to be very fond 
of 
uncontrolled budget spending," while the government on the whole 
will sooner or later face the need to choose between stricter 
budget and monetary policies for the sake of preserving the 
budget and an additional emission in order to prevent the 
industries from falling to pieces. 
  Yasin admitted that intentionally maintaining the ruble's 
stable rate and regular stepping back on promises "on the whole 
could not but exhaust themselves." "It is even more 
understandable that Fedorov fall victim to his own persistence 
and his well-known relations with the country's chief banker, 
Viktor Gerashchenko," he added. The head of the experts' 
council "fails to see anything terrible in the fact that the 
dollar will trade at 200-300 rubles more if it corresponds to 
the pace of inflation." According to his prognosis, the 
inflation rate in January will amount to 22-24%, "which is 
comparable with recent months." 
  Speaking on Fedorov's possible successors, Yasin pointed to 
the current Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin as having the 
highest chances to replace Fedorov. 
  "Sergey Konstantinovich has great professional experience 
with budget issues, and what is important as well is that he is 
not inclined to give away money right and left either," Yasin 
said. 
  As Interfax learned from Dubinin's staff, no talks of his 
possible appointment had been held.

  [Text] Sergey Yushenkov, secretary of the faction Russia's 
Choice, has disapproved of the decision of Finance Minister 
Boris Fedorov to leave this faction of the State Duma and to 
join the deputies group "Union of December 12" (leaders -- 
Aleksandr Braginskiy, Irina Khakamada, and Viktor Bushmin). 
  During his conversation with journalists Yushenkov 
underlined 
that "there is an ethical aspect in Fedorov's decision because 
he has been elected on Russia's Choice federal list and has not 
informed members of the faction about his decision." 
  Commenting on rumors stating that Gennadiy Burbulis also 
intends to leave the Russia's Choice faction, Yushenkov 
indicated that Burbulis faces the same ethical problem because 
Burbulis was also elected to the State Duma from the list of the 
Russia's Choice bloc. There will be quite another situation if 
the Russia's Choice faction itself adopts a decision to be 
divided into two factions in order to receive an additional vote 
in the State Duma Council and in order to help the deputies 
group Union of December 12 receive the necessary number of 
members (not less than 35) so this association can be registered. 
  Yushenkov reported that a session of the bureau of Russia's 
Choice faction had discussed this issue but Sergey Kovalyov, 
Boris Zolotukhin, and several other prominent members of this 
faction opposed its division into two factions. As a result of 
this discussion, Yushenkov reported, the faction has increased 
the number of its members from 76 to 78. However, now its 
number is 77, as Fedorov has left the faction. 
  Yushenkov underlined that there exists such a point of view 
which was expressed yesterday that after Yegor Gaydar leaves the 
government, many members of the faction would deem themselves 
free of any obligations to Russia's Choice and can adopt a 
decision to leave this faction. 
  The same day prominent lawyer Andrey Makarov, a member of 
Russia's Choice, reported to INTERFAX that he had left the 
faction and joined Union of December 12. Makarov refused to 
explain his move, stressing that an official message would be 
made public on Tuesday evening.
