<F P=106> [Valeriy Vyzhutovich article: "Viktor Chernomyrdin Seeks </F>
Allies in Parliament. But No Party or Faction Regards the 
Government as 100-Percent `Its Own'"] 
  [Text] At a session of the presidium of the new Cabinet of 
Ministers held Friday [21 January], Viktor Chernomyrdin appealed 
to his colleagues "to learn to work with the Federation Council 
and the Duma, because the government has recently gotten out of 
the habit of working with a parliament and needs to establish 
businesslike ties." All the indications are that this appeal is 
not just a ritual incantation (both Gaydar and, in December 
1992, Chernomyrdin himself started off by promising to cooperate 
with parliament) but an indirect statement of the obvious: The 
new government does not enjoy widespread political support. 
  Contrary to the canons of world democratic practice whereby 
either the parliamentary majority or a parliamentary party 
coalition forms the government, the new Russian cabinet has been 
formed by the premier himself. Viktor Chernomyrdin has, as it 
were, satisfied the program demands of the "agrarians," "Women 
of Russia," the "Travkinites," and the Communists.... This is 
precisely the reason why no one Duma faction can regard the 
Cabinet of Ministers as 100-percent "its own." Taking the 
broader view, the same holds true for all political forces. 
  At the present time the government's most reliable 
parliamentary ally may be the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, 
which, incidentally, has not stopped Sergey Shakhray from 
hedging around his participation in the Cabinet of Ministers 
with a list of basic conditions. 
  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy would grace the government with his political 
patronage "on condition that Kozyrev, Chubays, and Shokhin 
quit." However, the removal of these three figures would also 
satisfy the Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, who believed 
that the struggle between Gaydar's men and the pragmatists would 
end up as "a hybrid resolution with a preponderance of 
pragmatists." 
  Support for the government from "Russia's Choice" looks more 
than doubtful. Its intention not to oppose the Cabinet of 
Ministers, "to support all positive undertakings and proposals 
which accord with the reforms course," which was enshrined in a 
statement by this parliamentary faction only a week ago, did not 
look entirely sincere even then. Now, however, with Fedorov's 
resignation and the accession to key posts of sector lobbyists, 
it is becoming far more urgent for "Russia's Choice" to exercise 
the right it has reserved for itself "to criticize, and if 
necessary to mobilize parliamentary, social, political, and 
scientific potential in order to oppose antireformist and 
economically irresponsible steps." Without acting against their 
conscience, the leaders of the "Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin" 
faction will almost certainly subscribe to this declaration, as 
might, with some reservations, members of the "Alliance of 12 
December." 
  Finally, it is doubtful whether the president will tie 
himself to the present government with strong and long-term 
obligations. The head of state's autograph, which sanctifies the 
composition of the new government, has cost Chernomyrdin 
extraordinary effort, whereas for Yeltsin it has meant making 
concessions and compromising his shaky reputation as a reformer. 
And this haggling, which has been most unpleasant and 
exhausting, as well as Yeltsin's inability to resist pressure 
from his premier who has become a strong and independent 
political figure, involuntarily brings us back to a phrase which 
Yeltsin once let slip regarding another matter no less sensitive 
to his self-esteem: "The president will not forget this." 
  If Viktor Chernomyrdin is relying primarily on the 
Federation Council, which has displayed unparalleled 
tractability in electing the premier's favored candidate 
Vladimir Shumeyko to the post of speaker, we do not yet know 
what price the senators will demand for their loyalty, and the 
issue of who will ultimately depend more on whom is still up in 
the air. 
  But the most basic reason that prevents any one of the 
parties or factions from unconditionally approving the 
composition of the government is the duplication of the 
executive branch which a number of observers have noted. With 
what government exactly, following Chernomyrdin's wishes, is the 
parliament supposed to "establish businesslike ties"? There is 
the "president's government" comprising the power structures, 
the Foreign Ministry, and the Federal Television and Radio 
Broadcasting Administration, all of which are directly 
subordinate to Yeltsin.... And there is the "premier's 
government" which is concentrating exclusively on managing the 
"national economy." These "shoots" on the executive branch will 
each bear fruit for both the president and the premier, but 
Yeltsin's "harvest" is guaranteed "come rain or shine," so to 
speak. In the worst-case and, unfortunately, most likely 
scenario (hyperinflation), the political alibi of the head of 
state, who has farmed out management of the economy to the head 
of the government, will be guaranteed. 
  Given this forking of the executive branch, the 
parliamentary 
factions will only want to look after "their own" bit of the 
government, the bit that is geared toward the figures closest to 
them. The Party of Russian Unity and Accord will shelter Viktor 
Chernomyrdin under its party wing, the "agrarians" will protect 
Aleksandr Zaveryukha, "New Regional Policy" will look after the 
sector ministers, and "Women of Russia" will back the whole 
cabinet since it supports the social orientation of the actions 
they are planning. For its part, "Russia's Choice" will rescue 
the "Yeltsin Government" from the firing line of criticism, 
namely Andrey Kozyrev, Anatoliy Chubays, Pavel Grachev, and 
Viktor Yerin.... 
  In light of this prospect, Viktor Chernomyrdin's claim that 
"there is no opposition in the government to parliament, there 
are only common interests" looks highly amusing. And if the 
Duma implements its initiative to compel the government to give 
a weekly account of itself, we will witness a kind of 
parliamentary "bullfight" which we have never seen before. 
  Unity in the Federal Assembly will probably only occur at 
that desperate moment when (forecasters are saying May or June) 
inflation reaches yet another high and deputies of various 
political stripes, so as not to lose face, will jointly raise 
the issue of confidence in the government without bothering to 
divide it into "ours" and "theirs."

<F P=106> [Livia Klingl report: "The Headquarters of the Leader"] </F>
  [Text] Central Moscow, 1 Ribnykov Road. Behind the 
crumbling facade, there is the headquarters of the man who 
scares the world with his fascist statements: Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy. 
  The elevator does not work, and the garbage is piling up on 
the staircase. Only a small store on the first floor is clean 
where the "Liberal Democratic Party" (LDP) offers black leather 
jackets and flashy T-shirts. 
  The party office beneath the roof is a meeting place for 
strange figures. A man on a shabby sofa stared fixedly at 
nothing and moved the upper part his body steadily forward and 
backward. He is a former member of the Soviet Army who presents 
his "plan for the free construction of millions of apartments" 
to visitors. Because of this and other inventions he is worth 
"$1 billion per day" -- but nobody wants to pay. 
  According to the press spokesman and director of the party 
newspaper, "ZHIRINOVSKIY'S TRUTH," Viktor Novosyeltsev, Vladimir 
Volfovich -- his code name is "locomotive" -- is "nice, 
friendly, and a good husband." Moreover, he is a "vigorous 
politician and not a shouting man as he likes to present 
himself. And he is by no means the man depicted by the hostile 
media. 
  Asked about the number of members, the shy party spokesman 
mentions "about 100,000." They have to pay 1 percent of their 
monthly salaries and send their applications to the LDP address, 
marked for Mr. Zhirinovskiy's attention. These are the rules 
according to the party program. 
  Some extra money can be earned through interviews. For 
$1,000, a date can be fixed, and if the party leader is in a 
good mood, the journalists even get a receipt. "This is common 
practice all over the world," Novosyeltsev explained. He does 
not know anything about funds from the KGB and the Socialist 
Unity Party of Germany. 
  The party's structure as a one-man show "corresponds to the 
Russian mentality." To solve Russia's problems, "surgery and 
not therapy is required," a strong man "who spreads our ideas." 
Novosyeltsev did not know how to answer the question about what 
the LDP would do if it assumed power. "That is difficult to 
say." After a longer pause, he added: "The first thing would be 
an amnesty for political prisoners and prisoners who committed 
economic crimes." He continued: "Radical democrats and radical 
communists should be allowed to exist -- but not within the 
government."

<F P=106> [Economist Yuriy Abramov review under "New Books" rubric: </F>
"From the Agrarians' Viewpoint"] 
  [Text] Two basic problems are examined in the work "The 
Agrarian Party of Russia. Fundamentals of Its Economic Program" 
[Agrarnaya Partiya Rossii. Osnovy Ekonomicheskoy Programmy"], 
(authors M.I. Lapshin, L.P. Orlenko, and I.P. Rybkin, published 
in 1993 by the N.E. Bauman Moscow State Technical School): Who 
is to blame for Russia's present-day troubles; and what must be 
done to get out of the state of crisis. 
  The answer to the first, traditional Russian question is not 
one-dimensional. Those primarily to blame are those who broke 
up the USSR. The political struggle between the different 
branches of power which ended in the bloody October events made 
a considerable contribution to the present-day crisis. Yet the 
main agents of the crisis are those whose actions generated the 
"shock therapy" program, which is based on the "Houston Report." 
This document, compiled by order of the leaders of seven 
Western countries, is a program (around 1,200 pages long) for 
integrating the USSR (Russia and the other CIS countries) into 
the world economy in two to three years. Through a transition 
to world prices, privatization, liberalization of prices and 
foreign trade, financial stabilization.... 
  Essentially it is the "Houston Report" that has determined 
the Russian Government's activity in the last two years. This 
program's implementation is leading to the destruction of 
Russia's scientific and technical potential, the bankrupting of 
the processing industry, the collapse of agriculture, and the 
utter decline of education, medicine, and culture. The Western 
program is creating conditions for mass unemployment, a 
reduction in the population of Russia and the CIS countries, and 
a drop in the people's living standards. "Shock therapy" is 
advantageous to the domestic comprador bourgeoisie and the 
developed countries, which are expanding a raw-material base for 
themselves, obtaining a market for selling unsold goods, and 
eliminating a future economic competitor. What is being created 
in Russia instead of a market and democracy is a criminal mafia 
society intent on plundering Russia's national wealth in the 
interests of Western civilization. 
  The work in question sets out a concept for extricating 
Russia from the crisis. It is based on the implementation in 
1994 of a range of measures to halt the decline in production 
and prevent the population's further impoverishment. These are 
primarily to stop the illegal export of currency abroad (around 
$20 billion a year), the unbalanced exchange with CIS countries 
(losses of $17 billion a year), and the robbery of the 
overwhelming mass of the population by a small section (around 4 
percent) of it; to resume weapons exports (losses of over $15 
billion a year); to stimulate (by taxes, credits, subsidies, 
etc) the production of goods and services; to utilize the 
banking system to invest in production; to temporarily introduce 
tight control over the export of raw and other materials, 
energy, and consumer goods; to end the import of colonial goods 
into Russia; and to restrain inflation by regulating the entire 
mechanism of economic instruments (prices, taxes, subsidies, 
credits, etc). 
  Creating the conditions for economic growth and for building 
a civilized market requires a corresponding structural 
reorganization of production, privatization, and the 
destatization of public property. In order to preserve 
scientific and technical potential and use it practically it is 
necessary to form several hundred major corporations like Sony, 
Boeing, General Motors, and suchlike. A structural 
reorganization, that is a substantial expansion of the 
production of goods and services for the population, requires 
the utilization of the currency which is now "escaping" to 
foreign countries far and near and into the pockets of swindlers 
and speculators. These objectives require the corporatization 
of production and the leasing of enterprises (corporations) to 
labor collectives or the transfer of enterprises to their 
economic control, with payment being made for capital and with 
the possibility of enterprises' being bought out for shared 
collective ownership. This will enable millions of workers to 
be made the owners of the fruits of their labor and 
simultaneously the co-owners of an enterprise. This trend is 
now gathering momentum in developed countries. 
  Given our criminalized economy, only labor collectives will 
be able to cope with economic banditry and create the conditions 
for a civilized, socially oriented market. The law-enforcement 
organs cannot resolve this task on their own. 
  Supporting agriculture requires a balanced exchange with 
other sectors, aid to the economic units providing goods for the 
population, and the termination of aid to foreign private 
farmers (in the form of imported agricultural products). The 
buying and selling of agricultural and urban land is not 
permissible. Otherwise land will be bought up through front men 
by foreigners and the nouveau riche, who have become wealthy 
through the impoverishment of pensioners, children, doctors, 
engineers, military personnel, workers, and peasants. A land 
free-for-all will lead to the collapse of the agricultural 
economy and to famine in the cities. Public land must be leased 
long-term to producers in the countryside (collective and state 
farms and private farmers). The buying and selling of land must 
not go beyond the framework of dacha and garden plots and land 
attached to individual homes. 
  A system of draft laws on privatization, the agricultural 
economy, social policy, prices and price formation, taxes, 
finances, and banks, and other topics needs to be drawn up for 
the State Duma on the basis of the concept of economic reform in 
question. The adoption of these documents will create the 
legislative basis for a program of reforms providing an 
alternative to "shock therapy."

<F P=106> [Valeriy Rudnev report: "State Committee for the State of </F>
Emergency [SCSE] Case: Defendants' Latest Ploys"] 
  [Text] The questioning of defendants continues at the court 
session hearing the State Committee for the State of Emergency 
[SCSE] case, which has resumed after a long recess. 
  Marshal Yazov is clearly sticking to the line previously 
agreed with the other defendants -- the line previously followed 
by KGB General Vladimir Kryuchkov -- of talking more about 
Mikhail Gorbachev and less about himself. He notably stated 
that, in his opinion, the former USSR president agreed in 
principle with the SCSE members' actions in August 1991. 
According to the marshal, Gorbachev's parting words to the SCSE 
group on 18 August were: "Act, and we shall see." True, Yazov 
acknowledged that Gorbachev did not agree with the introduction 
of a state of emergency in the country. However, knowing 
Gorbachev's character, the marshal stressed in his testimony 
that his words could have been interpreted as a wish to avoid 
responsibility. "There can be no question of the USSR 
president's having been isolated in any way," Yazov stated. 
"Gorbachev isolated himself for three days." 
  Evaluating the nature of the emergency measures introduced 
by 
the SCSE group, the USSR marshal drew the court's attention to 
the fact that troops had not dispersed constitutional bodies or 
interfered with their activity. And the Defense Ministry had 
started withdrawing armored vehicles from the capital as early 
as 19 August in order to avoid potential provocation. The 
decision to withdraw all troops from Moscow was made on 20 
August. Moreover, Yazov stated, the USSR Defense Ministry, 
after consultations between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and 
Pavel Grachev, commander of the country's airborne troops at the 
time, even sent a battalion of airborne assault troops to defend 
the White House. Now, however, according to Yazov, it is thought 
that those assault troops deserted from the Defense Ministry and 
went over to Boris Yeltsin. 
  Yazov, like Kryuchkov, does not acknowledge his guilt. On 
the other hand, he does regard as criminal the actions of 
Gorbachev and the former president's kindred spirits who 
destroyed the USSR. 
  However, it is most likely not the defendants' testimony 
that 
is proving really intriguing in the historic trial under way in 
the Russian Supreme Court. That testimony is already known to 
everyone (it only remains for a movie to be made of it all). 
Perhaps the only interest is in the dwindling number of 
defendants in the dock: How many of them will be there to hear 
the verdict? 
  Of the 14 SCSE members arraigned by the investigators in 
1991 
only nine remained by the end of 1993. Two of them -- Anatoliy 
Lukyanov and Vasiliy Starodubtsev -- were intending to leave the 
courtroom at the start of 1994: They were both elected deputies 
in the new parliament and were fully counting on receiving 
immunity. However, the court deemed otherwise: Citing the law, 
it ruled that a deputy's immunity from criminal prosecution does 
not apply in this case to Lukyanov and Starodubtsev, 
  The defendants immediately came up with new ruses. Notably, 
Valentin Pavlov did not appear for trial on the day appointed by 
the court, claiming illness. After checking out Pavlov's 
"sickness certificate," the panel of military judges ruled that 
the defendant's nonappearance had no legal basis and warned him 
that there could be a change in the measures employed to secure 
his appearance in court, in other words, he could be held in 
custody. 
  Anatoliy Lukyanov made an attempt to impose his own rules on 
the court. He initially covered his absence from court with a 
medical certificate. But the "sick" Lukyanov's regular 
appearances in parliament exposed this lame ploy. Then Lukyanov 
told the court that he could sit in the dock only during that 
time free from the discharge of affairs of state in parliament. 
That trick did not work. In its judgment the panel of military 
judges ruled that no business, even affairs of state, can exempt 
a defendant from the duty to be in the place determined by 
criminal proceedings, namely the dock. 
  The SCSE trial continues. What will the defendants dream up 
next?

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 24 Jan -- Despite the work that has been 
done by the Russian Ministry of Defense on building the Russian 
armed forces, certain errors have been made in organizing the 
management of the forces, and in personnel and training work. 
Military communications are giving rise to serious complaints, 
and cooperation with local administrations in resolving matters 
concerning the draft has not been properly established in all 
places. 
  This was stated at a working conference of administrative 
bodies of the General Staff and the Defense Ministry held today 
by Russian Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev. 
  An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told at the Defense 
Ministry's 
information and press directorate that the main aim of the 
conference was to reveal the ministry's shortcomings and errors 
in time, and to assess them. 
  Among the positive results of the ministry's work since it 
was set up, note was made of the elaboration of plans for the 
development of the armed forces, for their strategic deployment 
and the organization of rear supplies, and the creation of a 
blueprint for a military training system. 
  On conclusion of the conference, Defense Minister Grachev 
stressed that the correct conclusions would be drawn in the 
armed forces and every measure would be taken effectively to 
ensure the security of the state.

<F P=106> [Statement by the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense </F>
Information and Press Directorate: "Work Analyzed, New Tasks 
Scheduled"] 
  [Text] On 24 January Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian 
Federation minister of defense, held a working conference during 
which the effectiveness of the work of command and control 
organs of the General Staff and Ministry of Defense was analyzed 
in detail. 
  A great deal has been done in the period since the creation 
of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense. Plans for the 
organizational development of the Armed Forces and their 
strategic deployment have been elaborated, and the relevant 
directives have been sent to the troops and their implementation 
has been organized. A certain amount of experience has been 
built up in recruiting citizens to military service on contract. 
The Armed Forces rear services support has by and large been 
planned and organized quite well amid the complex economic 
conditions in the state. A concept for the military training 
system has been elaborated. 
  At the same time, not everything has gone smoothly in the 
organizational development of the Russian Armed Forces. Certain 
errors have been made in the organization of the command and 
control of the troops and cadre and training work. Military 
communications, which are markedly lagging behind world 
standards in their development, are generating serious 
criticism. Cooperation with local administrations in settling 
questions of the draft to the Armed Forces has not been 
established everywhere in a clear-cut way. There are also other 
shortcomings which primarily require the responsibility and 
professionalism of the military leaders in order to be overcome. 
  The main aim of the conference which has been held, Pavel 
Grachev noted, is to expose our shortcomings and blunders in 
time. To assess them. And find ways of solving problems. The 
correct conclusions will be drawn in the Armed Forces, the 
minister stressed, and all the necessary measures will be 
adopted to ensure the state's security effectively.

the Russian Federation Navy, by Vladimir Maryukha, under the

"There Is No No-Man's-Land Between Sea and Shore"] 
  [Text] Calling Card 
  Admiral Feliks Nikolayevich Gromov is commander in chief of 
the Russian Federation Navy. On graduating from the Pacific 
Higher Naval School he progressed via his first postings to the 
command of a destroyer, a cruiser, and a squadron of ships. He 
has served in the Pacific and Northern Fleets and at the 
Leningrad Naval Base. He has been commander of the Northern 
Fleet and first deputy commander in chief of the Navy. 
  [Maryukha] Feliks Nikolayevich, Russia's Navy has another 
year behind it, not the best of years, moreover, in its almost 
300-year history. How did seamen cope with the tasks they were 
set at the beginning of 1993? 
  [Gromov] The tasks that the Navy was set a year ago have 
been 
performed. This means that the Navy has succeeded in preserving 
the specified level of combat readiness of the fleets' main 
large strategic formations and combined units, as well as their 
ability to shift in a timely and organized manner from a 
peacetime to a wartime footing and perform their main 
operational tasks within the prescribed timeframes. 
  I think that everyone realizes that the year has not been 
one 
of the best in the fleet's history: There is no no-man's-land 
between the sea and shore and all the economic, political, and 
other difficulties that the country is experiencing were bound 
to affect the state of the Navy. 
  Nevertheless it was 1993 that once again saw an increase in 
the intensity and effectiveness of strategic submarines' combat 
service and alert duty. Foreign naval forces' activity was 
reliably monitored by the general-purpose forces. At the same 
time Russian ships collaborated intensively with multinational 
forces in the Persian Gulf and established contacts between 
Russians and the population of other countries during official 
visits, the number of which also increased. 
  [Maryukha] Against the overall backdrop of the difficulties 
experienced by the country the increase in the intensity of 
naval service cannot help but evoke pleasure and...surprise: 
How did it prove possible to achieve positive change? 
  [Gromov] First, I must say that the Navy's combat training 
was carried out in a systematic manner. Intensively, but 
without straining them to breaking point. Of course there were 
and still are difficulties -- in repairing ships and providing 
the Navy with all kinds of supplies. However, the Navy's role 
goes far beyond the as yet unresolved problems. And in this 
main area Russian seamen have shown themselves at their best. 
  The "Typhoon-93" command staff training exercise under the 
leadership of the defense minister, involving the Northern and 
Pacific Fleets, confirmed the naval strategic nuclear forces' 
readiness to perform their set tasks and the staffs' 
preparedness for field command and control of the main attack 
forces. The Navy's combat readiness was also confirmed by the 
competitive tactical exercises for the Navy championship which 
resumed after a year's gap. This was the first time that the 
Kuznetsov aircraft-carrying heavy cruiser took part in these 
exercises. And the participation of ships of the Northern, 
Baltic, and Pacific Fleets in joint exercises with other 
countries' navies confirmed our seamen's supreme naval combat, 
weapons, and tactical proficiency. Russian seamen worthily 
represented our country in Canada, the United States, Britain, 
France, and Greece, and, after a 90-year gap, in China and South 
Korea. 
  This past year combat training plans did indeed have to be 
adjusted and the number of course tasks reduced. Factors beyond 
the fleet's control were responsible for this -- lack of fuel, 
lubricants, ship repair services, a dramatic reduction in 
funding, and undermanning of ships. But despite all this the 
organizational, moral, and psychological groundwork was laid in 
1993 for a qualitatively new approach to the system of training 
command and control organs and naval forces. 
  [Maryukha] But, Feliks Nikolayevich, last year it did not 
nonetheless prove possible to avoid a threat to the future of 
the Navy: Ships "left" Navy ranks early and a difficult 
situation also arose with "the Navy's wings" -- the air force.... 
  [Gromov] In 1993 naval aviation began using the ship-based 
Su-27K fighter. ASW aviation must also be recorded has having 
shown an improvement. However, the economic crisis and the 
resulting lack of new equipment and spare parts, and holdups 
with aviation fuel did indeed reduce flying time, disrupt combat 
training plans, and, naturally, reduce naval aviators' combat 
readiness and flight safety. 
  The worst situation developed in the Black Sea Fleet air 
force: Owing to nondelivery of spare parts and inadequate 
repairs, around half of the aircraft and helicopters are unable 
to take to the air today. 
  I would also describe the upgrading and replacement of the 
Navy's ships as an issue of statewide importance. More 
continuity than ever before is needed here: from one model or 
design of a ship to another more sophisticated model, from the 
slips to the plant moorings. It is extremely essential that we 
preserve this technological chain both from the viewpoint of 
safeguarding the qualitative parameters of the fleet's fighting 
strength and also from the moral and psychological viewpoint. 
  In 1994 the Navy plans to obtain from industry the Petr 
Velikiy nuclear missile cruiser, a large ASW ship, patrol 
escorts, and certain other ships. The "Sever" machine building 
enterprise in Severodvinsk recently began construction of the 
first of class of a promising multirole nuclear submarine. 
Those are the immediate prospects as regards Navy 
replenishment, prospects that are directly dependent on full 
funding. 
  In the longer term it is planned to further develop combat 
surface ships. Priority here will be given to destroyers, 
patrol escorts, and minesweepers. There are plans to develop a 
new multirole shore-based aircraft for naval aviation, intended 
primarily to perform tasks of covering the surface and 
underwater situation. 
  On the other hand, the quantitative reduction of the fleet 
will continue. This is brought about by the tasks of the new 
military doctrine and the state's economic potential. Our main 
aim is to create a relatively small, but qualitatively perfect 
and highly effective Navy, which would be less economically 
burdensome for the country than in the past. This task will be 
performed at the same time as the reform of the fleet and the 
construction of new ships. But I would not call the situation 
that is emerging, as this task is resolved, a simple one. 
  [Maryukha] In your view, can it be rectified somehow? 
  [Gromov] It must be, but is there a real chance of doing so? 
  In any sector of industry, in any branch of the Armed Forces 
there will be plenty of problems that the department in question 
considers paramount. We realize that the country is in a 
difficult economic position and that the budget is not, so to 
speak, elastic. 
  On the other hand, there must also be awareness that the 
accumulated potential with its high technologies for the 
construction of both surface ships and submarines must not 
disappear and that, if they are lost, it will subsequently be 
hard for decades to produce these kinds of technologies and 
forms of production sharing. 
  I think that 1994 should nonetheless be the year that sees 
the country's economic revival. And that inspires hope. At the 
same time one must constantly think about those serving today 
and who will serve the Russian Navy in the future.... 
  [Maryukha] I understand your concern: The naval budget, 
like a shagreen skin, is shrinking drastically with every day 
that passes, and moreover by no means having fulfilled our 
wishes -- owing to inflation, cuts in defense spending... But, 
along with a technically upgraded Navy, it is also necessary to 
resolve the problems of providing seamen with social protection, 
primarily, providing them with housing.... 
  [Gromov] Last year we succeeded, despite all the 
difficulties with funding, in building and obtaining 6,035 
apartments. That is with a total number of 13,220 people 
without apartments and 4,184 people in need of an improvement in 
their housing conditions. 
  On the other hand, this number of people in need of housing 
is spread extremely unevenly across the regions where the Navy 
is based. In the Baltic Fleet it is primarily a question of 
Baltiysk and Kaliningrad, where housing was previously in short 
supply and requirements have now risen in connection with the 
troop withdrawal from the Baltic countries. In the Northern 
Fleet it is mainly the city of Murmansk and, in part, 
Severomorsk. And in the Pacific Fleet it is a question of 
Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy. In the Black Sea 
Fleet Sevastopol bears the brunt of the problems involved in 
resolving the housing problem. This problem is also hard to 
resolve in Moscow and St. Petersburg. 
  That is why since 1992 we have been taking a more rational 
approach to resolving the question of housing construction. Now 
the main emphasis is being laid on housing construction in 
Russia's middle zone in order to move people away from the 
closed garrisons. I have also set the task of not expanding 
certain military camps but improving their structure. 
  Of course, uneven inadequate funding has a considerable 
impact on this process. At the same time feasible housing 
construction plans should be drawn up. If the population of a 
garrison is falling, we should probably take a careful look at 
what option is more advisable here -- building a new 
kindergarten or refurbishing existing sociocultural consumer 
facilities, etc. That is, a rational approach must prevail 
today. In 1994 we are planning to build around 11,500 
apartments with our own funds and via shared participation. 
Time will tell what comes of that. And, of course, what sort 
of money is allocated. 
  [Maryukha] Feliks Nikolayevich, since we have started 
talking about the plans for 1994 I think it appropriate to ask 
you about the tasks that the Navy is to tackle this year. 
  [Gromov] To use the language of command the Navy must 
maintain the strength and status of the naval strategic forces 
at a level which guarantees that tasks are implemented under any 
conditions and maintain the strength and status of the 
general-purpose forces to provide all-around backup for the 
Navy's activity in conflict-prevention from Russia's maritime 
sectors.... 
  Combat service and combat alert duty remain the fundamental 
means of performing these main tasks. In order to perform these 
tasks it is necessary to resolve a set of questions pertaining 
to updating and reducing the amount of specific-task equipment 
amid the ongoing naval downsizing and improve the basing and 
support system for the Navy's remaining ships. This is 
primarily a question of providing amenities for the Baltic Fleet 
and Caspian Flotilla forces that are being withdrawn and 
removing shore-based naval infrastructures from Latvia, Estonia, 
and Belarus. Combat training, like last year, starts with 
training at the base and will be completed during integrated sea 
voyages [kompleksnyye vykhody v more]. This is dictated by the 
fact that one should not count on improvement in the Navy's 
material and technical support and instances of putting to sea 
with no serious intent the Navy too dear. 
  Nevertheless ships should not stay at their moorings for 
long. Coastal waters and the oceans of the world will be their 
zone of operations. 
  The main task facing the command of the Navy remains the 
creation of normal service and living conditions for all 
personnel -- seamen, warrant officers, and officers. It is a 
question of boosting the prestige of Navy service and all the 
concepts that go with this. It is a question of creating 
conditions of service where every man does his job. Naval 
personnel and flight personnel do their job, while shore-based 
structures do theirs. That is hard to achieve, but only then 
will the fleet unconditionally perform its main function.

  [Text] Feliks Gromov, the commander in chief of the Russian 
Navy, has stated that quantitative cuts in the navy will 
continue in 1994. At the same time, the navy will be modernized 
with improved models of combat vessels. The main aim is to 
create a small but highly efficient navy that would be less of a 
burden for the country from the economic point of view. 
<H5>  Navy Commander on Nuclear Warheads in Baltic Fleet </H5>
  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian 2020 GMT on 24 January carries a video report on the 
visit to the Baltic Fleet by Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first 
deputy commander in chief of the Navy. The announcer, G.Sablin, 
says that the combat and tactical training of the crews and 
vessels of the Baltic Fleet deserves the highest evaluation. He 
says that the admiral talked about the timescale for the 
withdrawal of forces of the fleet from Latvia, and he confirmed 
the readiness of the last major unit--a submarine brigade--to 
leave Liepaja by 1 June. 
  Admiral Igor Kasatonov stressed that with the loss of bases 
in the Baltic countries the Russian fleet is not losing its 
might and mobility. Kasatonov says: "If the fleet now has 27 
percent of the nuclear warheads, then it will rise to 42-47 
percent by the year 2000. On 21 December 1993 I had the honor 
of being the senior person from the Ministry of Defense at the 
laying of the keel of a most modern submarine. In addition, the 
keels of some surface vessels were also laid, and some vessels 
were also completed, but, again, the concept of a new fleet, a 
third millenium fleet, which of course has to pass through the 
government, needs to be confirmed."

<F P=106> [VoyenTV "Arsenal" video report; from the "Military Courier" </F>
program] 
  [Text] The new Russian Su-34 frontline bomber has become 
the latest sensation. The aircraft has an almost unlimited 
flight range. The Su-34 can fly 4,000 kilometers without aerial 
refueling or auxiliary fuel tanks. Its fundamentally new 
on-board digital computer, and other radio and electronic 
equipment, unerringly guides the aircraft to a given target with 
accuracy down to a meter. And it does this in any meteorological 
conditions. [video shows the aircraft landing, taking off, and 
in flight, showing its similarity to an Su-35 with a cockpit 
similar to that of the Su-25TK] 
  The homing and guided missiles, and bombs permit the Su-34 
to 
strike well-defended point targets at a distance of from 0 to 
250 kilometers and it carries sufficient weapons to fulfill any 
task. The new aircraft is equipped with a so-called artificial 
intelligence system which allows the bomber to perform intricate 
maneuvers at top speed and at minimal altitudes, and to 
unerringly follow the lay of the land and easily avoid the 
anti-aircraft actions of ground forces. [video shows the Su-34 
on the ground being viewed by a group of people] 
  The Su-34 looks like no other aircraft. It has its own 
features, its own bearing, its own fighting spirit, and its own 
purely Russian unpredictability. This is our own domestic 
aircraft which is not a threat to anybody. It was created for 
us, for our spirit, for the defense of Russia. [video shows A.A. 
Kokoshin, first deputy Russian Minister of Defense, being 
interviewed among a group of officials; a man on his right has 
the air force banner over his shoulders] 
  [Begin recording] [Kokoshin] Those who built this machine 
today and who lifted it into the air are the real heroes, our 
Russian people, and our country has always had many of them. You 
agree, Nikolay Ivanovich? 
  [Man with Banner on his Shoulders] Yes. (Lizovtsy) and 
Chkalovtsy, you can be proud. We have achieved victory. 
Hurrah. [everybody cheers] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel Valentin Rudenko: "Today's Main Priority </F>
Is To Pay Money Owed to the Defense Industry"] 
  [Text] Folk wisdom holds that the way you see in the New 
Year is an omen for the way life is going to treat you in the 
rest of the year. Some people may think my claim not quite 
objective, but most enterprises in Russia's long-suffering 
defense complex this time met the New Year in fairly good 
spirits, and even with a certain degree of optimism and hope. 
  First, despite the gloomy forecasts -- which, it should be 
stated directly, were more than sufficiently well-founded -- our 
defense industry has not collapsed or been fragmented into a 
multitude of design bureaus, scientific research institutes, and 
plants, cast upon the whim of fate. What is more, in some 
areas, above all in spheres defined as priorities by the 
Ministry of Defense -- strategic nuclear forces, automated 
command and control systems, communications in the tactical 
echelon, intelligence systems, high-precision conventional 
weapons, and a number of others -- definite progress was 
achieved. The construction of a new multi-purpose submarine was 
begun, a new frontline combat aircraft was tested, and a number 
of models of new-generation command and control radio stations 
are ready for mass production. There are also other achievements. 
  As for optimism and the glimmer of hope suddenly kindled in 
the breasts of defense industry workers, these are due to the 
Russian president's edict of 6 November 1993 "On Stabilizing the 
Economic Situation of Defense Industry Enterprises and 
Organizations, and on Measures to Ensure the State Defense 
Order" (KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, 20 November 1993). Let me recall that 
this document covered many of the sore spots of enterprises 
fulfilling the State Defense Order. And, most importantly, it 
determined specific measures to implement many of the proposals 
made to the president and the government by the Ministry of 
Defense. 
  It would not be far from the truth to assert that, following 
this edict, many began to believe that this year would be a year 
of revival for Russia's industry. And at the end of December 
the papers brought more joyful tidings -- the president had 
given an instruction to the government on the payment to 
enterprises and organizations of money owed by the state for 
deliveries of arms and military equipment, completed scientific 
research and experimental design work, and for deliveries of 
fuel, food, and clothing and related gear. No one had even 
dreamed of a better New Year's present. Let me remark that this 
is not a question of a couple of million rubles [R] but of a far 
more significant sum -- more than R1 trillion. This is just for 
regular deliveries of weapons systems and combat equipment, and 
also for completed research and development. 
  But then the New Year holidays began; in many enterprises, 
because of an absence of orders and a lack of funds to pay for 
electricity and heating, they lasted until 10 January, and the 
omen that the defense industry was in for a prosperous year 
simply failed to come true. Rather the reverse -- the first 
half of January showed that a still more austere and uncertain 
situation is developing over funding than last year. The 
Russian Federation president's instruction remains unfulfilled, 
as do the corresponding government directive and an instruction 
to Finance Minister Boris Fedorov personally. 
  But meanwhile the economic and financial situation in the 
country is indeed extremely difficult. The Ministry of Defense 
and leaders of industrial enterprises fulfilling the State 
Defense Order are deeply committed to cutting the inflation 
level and in principle support the measures adopted. However, 
it can hardly be correct to implement them at the cost of the 
virtually total shutdown of industries which still retain a 
unique human, scientific, and technological potential, and which 
are capable of ensuring the recovery of Russian industry as a 
whole, and also the production of competitive, 
science-intensive, civilian output. In addition, the 
inflationary properties of the State Defense Order in its 
current form are highly exaggerated. 
  Sad to relate, but we are already on the brink of chronic 
delays in the supply of funds even for the purchase of the spare 
parts and consumables necessary for maintaining in operational 
readiness the equipment which the troops already have, let alone 
for the development of new weapons systems. The majority of 
enterprises fulfilling the State Defense Order are wholly 
deprived of the possibility of accumulating funds and compiling 
circulating capital, and therefore, of functioning normally. 
According to data from Defense Ministry military 
representatives, around 70 percent of enterprises fulfilling the 
State Defense Order are standing completely idle. 
  The implementation of the Long-Term Arms Program -- whose 
basic directions and priorities, according to the report of 
Russian Federation First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey 
Kokoshin, were approved by the Russian Federation president and 
the Security Council 19 January 1994 -- is threatened with 
breakdown. Without the payment of money owed to enterprises, 
scientific research institutes, and design bureaus, the Ministry 
of Defense is unable to begin fulfilling the government-approved 
1994 defense order. Andrey Kokoshin stresses that without a 
solution to this problem a significant number of defense 
production units are threatened with a crisis that is fraught 
with the most serious consequences for Russia's defense 
capabilities. 
  Furthermore. By reducing funding year after year and not 
paying debts we place millions of people employed in defense 
production units in a critical situation and doom them to 
unemployment and an impoverished existence. Especially in 
cities and camps which are in effect satellite cities of the big 
defense plants. There are hundreds of them across Russia. Take 
Severodvinsk, Votkinsk, Kaliningrad, Zhukovskiy, Arzamas-16, and 
many others. 
  The editorial offices receive virtually every day alarming 
reports that many defense enterprises have been placed in a 
critical situation because of poor funding. Here are just a few 
of them which were received through ITAR-TASS channels. 
  "The largest defense industry enterprise in Siberia -- the 
Biysk `Sibpribormash' association -- has been completely shut 
down. This happened after the city's No. 1 TETS [heat and 
electric power station] switched off the enterprise's steam and 
hot water. The reason for this was the association's R5 billion 
debts. `Sibpribormash' owes the same sum to the power generating 
industry. In the very first hours the electroplating and powder 
metallurgy workshops were rendered inoperative and will now cost 
several billion rubles to restore..." 
  "One-third of workers and employees of the `Amurmash' 
association have been sent on indefinite leave on the minimum 
salary of R14,620. The enterprise has no funds -- the Ministry 
of Defense owes the association R2.5 billion for the output 
which it produced over the past three months." 
  The tragedy of the situation lies also in the fact that the 
entire social sphere -- schools, kindergartens, hospitals, 
dwelling houses, and so forth -- is, as a rule, funded by the 
defense enterprises. Formerly these facilities were an asset 
for these plants; today they are a heavy burden. According to 
specialists' assessments, up to two-thirds of the funds 
allocated to the defense order are spent on maintaining the 
social infrastructure and paying wages. But this must be done, 
and Defense Ministry leaders must treat enterprises' problems 
with understanding. Otherwise life in these cities would simply 
be at a standstill -- which would, naturally, provoke a mighty 
social explosion. 
  The year just gone was not an easy one for the defense 
industry. It also began with debts. Then the state owed the 
defense complex R39 billion (somewhere in the order of R300 
billion at today's prices), but by February these debts had 
largely been cleared; moreover, in March 1993, for perhaps the 
first time in recent history a certain proportion of the defense 
order was actually paid for in advance. Many defense enterprise 
directors mark this down as greatly to the credit of the 
Ministry of Defense. The Russian president's edict of 6 
November 1993 again provided for advance payment, but so far not 
a kopek has been received for these purposes. So the Ministry 
of Defense, instead of concentrating all its attention on 
ensuring the implementation of the approved priorities in 
military-technical policy, the State Defense Order, and the 
Long-Term Arms Program, has to spend a great deal of time and 
energy on literally extorting the proper funds from the 
government and the Ministry of Finance. 
  In these conditions, trying to distribute financial 
resources to enterprises fulfilling the State Defense Order 
equally is like patching up a caftan -- you sew it up in one 
place, and it tears in another. Nevertheless, last year the 
Ministry of Defense managed to ensure the funding of a number of 
the most important weapons systems, thereby preserving the 
backbone of the defense industry. Whether it will manage to 
stabilize the situation this year and move forward in a number 
of areas is a big question. Right now the government is again 
examining proposals from the Ministry of Defense geared not only 
toward the swift payment of debts and beginning the advance 
payment of enterprises, but also at the creation of a mechanism 
for the regular and timely supply of financial resources aimed 
at fulfilling the decisions of the president and the Security 
Council.

  [Text] Moscow January 25 TASS -- Russia successfully 
launched the "Meteor-3" meteorological satellite early on 
Tuesday after the blast off was postponed for three times. 
  The satellite carries the German "Tubsat" minisatellite and 
is fitted out with the German "Prare" system and the 
Russian-French "Skarab" equipment. 
  The satellite which blasted off from the Russian Plesetsk 
cosmodrome onboard the "Tsiklon" booster is intended for 
round-the-clock processing and transmission of 
hydrometeorological information, as well as of data on 
radioactivitity in near-earth space and the state of 
magnetosphere and the ozone layer, TASS was told at the press 
service of the Russian aerospace forces.

not be published. INTERFAX has learned that the publication of 
the newspaper was suspended because it has no money to pay for 
paper and printing. 
  The situation is explained by the fact that at the end of 
December the editorial staff took over the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 
from the Russian Government. However, the newspaper has not 
been registered yet and therefore cannot carry out independent 
financial transactions.

  [Text] Moscow January 24 TASS -- The priority task of the 
Ostankino TV and Radio Broadcasting Company is to develop an 
economic mechanism for the company's operation under market 
conditions, Grigoriy Shevelev, who was recently appointed to the 
post of the company's first deputy chairman, said in an 
interview with ITAR-TASS here on Monday. 
  Shevelev noted that state television "cannot adapt itself to 
new economic conditions" up to this time, while budget financing 
covers only less than 50 per cent of the company's requirements. 
  He is convinced that a proposal on cutting the volume of 
broacasting will not yield desired results and is not the only 
way of tackling the problem. 
  Stressing that only economic solvency can guarantee true 
independence to the company, the deputy chairman suggested that 
this problem be settled by introducing rent for tv programmes. 
  But, according to his opinion, this is highly improbable in 
the near future. He supposed that a solution can be found by 
turning Ostankino into a joint stock society. 
  In Shevelev's opinion, many organisational and creative 
problems calling for urgent solutions piled up at the company 
over the past few years when six chairmen changed at the 
Ostankino TV station. 
  He claimed that the plotting of the company's economic, 
organisational and creative course will be among the first moves 
by the new leadership. 
  The leadership, together with the federal service on 
television and radio broadcasting, intends to participate in 
drafting a bill which will define legal guarantees for the 
operation of the state-owned tv and radio company. 
  Much attention will be also given to the quality of 
programmes. "The Ostankino Company is Russia's national asset, 
and it is impossible for us `to lower the plank'," Shevelev 
stressed.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 24 TASS -- The government plans no 
radical changes in the programme of economic reform in Russia, 
Russian First Vice-Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets said on Monday. 
  Soskovets denied mass media reports accusing the government 
of attempts to overhaul the reform plan. He said the programme 
will be corrected to make it more socially oriented. "As for the 
government, having received all levers of economic control from 
the president, it is ready to bear the responsibility for the 
transformations in the country," Soskovets said. 
  He described the current economic situation as extremely 
difficult. To exemplify his point, he said that out of 650 
enterprises in the Yekaterinburg region only 130 pay taxes. To 
make other enterprises do the same would mean to ruin them. 
Additionally, the government has only one trillion roubles in 
tax revenues, while expenditures in the first quarter of the 
year alone are excepted to reach 8.5 trillion roubles. 
  Soskovets denied reports that Academicians Leonid Abalkin 
and 
Nikolay Petrakov are preparing a new economic programme for the 
government. "There is only one programme approved by the 
government last year. It is that programme that the government 
sticks to," the vice-premier said. 
  Soskovets said the number of the members of the government 
Presidium has been reduced by five people. On January 23 Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin signed a document on the new 
composition of the commission for operative questions. It will 
include representatives of tax inspectorates, hard currency 
organisations and bank managers. 
  He pointed out that the government's orientation to 
non-monetaristic methods of economic management means its 
"intention to link the economy with the industrial sphere." He 
ruled out "spasmodic financial injections in separate 
industries" in the future, adding that the government will 
toughen relations with enterprises. 
  Soskovets said he did not believe former Soviet Vice-Premier 
Vladimir Shcherbakov have chances of taking up the post of 
finance minister in the Russian government. 
  Speaking about the government's relations with the 
parliament, Soskovets expressed the hope that "members of the 
cabinet are set to work constructively."

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Aleksandr Khandruyev, the deputy </F>
chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, by announcer Yelena 
Platonova; from the "Time for Business People" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Platonova] The resignation of the principal 
reformers of the Russian economy, Yegor Gaydar and Boris 
Fedorov, may be regarded as the main event of last week. Bowing 
out as deputy prime minister and finance minister, Boris Fedorov 
said that the new government of production fetishists would lead 
the economy to financial collapse in the very near future. We 
have asked today's guest, Aleksandr Khandruyev, to comment on 
this pronouncement. 
  [Khandruyev] It does not really matter whether Boris 
Grigoryevich [Fedorov] has resigned or not. It seems to me 
quite simply unethical for a man who has done his utmost to 
trigger off this financial and budgetary collapse to talk about 
financial collapse. This is because the budget system is 
disintegrating. Nobody wants to accept responsibility for what I 
would call the restoration of a normal tax system, and the 
collection of taxes and revenue. We have already learned the 
preliminary results of 1993. They show that the Central Bank has 
kept all its commitments to the IMF, as expressed in the joint 
statement with the government, except for one. For technical 
reasons we were unable to hold a credit auction, although we 
have already adopted regulations on this auction. Our problem 
now is simply to free up funds that can be sold at a credit 
auction. But we have kept all our pledges. 
  Credit injected into our economy has not exceeded the 
imposed 
ceiling. On the contrary, savings have been made. So where 
have we failed? In only one area -- the budget deficit. 
  [Platonova] Aleksandr Andreyevich, brokers are not confident 
that the Central Bank has sufficient hard currency at its 
disposal. Are they wrong? 
  [Khandruyev] When the Central Bank and the Russian 
Federation 
Government signed a joint declaration on economic policy on 24 
May last year, we undertook not to maintain the ruble exchange 
rate by artificial means. However, at the same time, we said 
that we would use our hard currency reserves to influence the 
range within which it would fluctuate. We have abided by this 
commitment. We saw our main objective as being to prevent 
abrupt collapses or rises in the ruble rate. Generally 
speaking, the situation has never got out of control during the 
last one-and-a-half, two years. 
  However, the situation that came about at the beginning of 
1994 was a result of a coming together of numerous factors -- 
the break between trading sessions [during New Year and 
Christmas holidays], and the fact that the ruble exchange rate 
really was too high for a situation in which domestic prices 
continued to increase. Exports became unprofitable. 
Furthermore, as I have already said, the hard currency market 
is still very fragile, very delicate. It influences all sorts 
of unexpected factors. The possibility that there are certain 
players on the currency exchange who took concerted action to 
bring about a sharp fall in the ruble exchange rate cannot be 
ruled out. In these circumstances the Central Bank has done its 
utmost to make sure that this process does not become a collapse 
and to keep the situation under control. 
  [Platonova] Our next question to Aleksandr Khandruyev is as 
follows: What, in the Central Bank's view, are the reasons for 
the slump in output? 
  [Khandruyev] Well, first and foremost, I would like to agree 
with my eminent colleague, Igor Sergeyevich Korolev [deputy 
director of the Institute of World Economy]. I know him well. 
I agree with his assessment of the factors that are causing, 
provoking the slump. The Central Bank reckons that the slump is 
the result of a macroeconomic sickness throughout the economy. 
The slump is, generally speaking, a natural reaction to the 
excessively rigid conditions, the structure of the Russian 
economy, and the impact of budgetary and credit restrictions. 
It would be simply stupid to think that one could use monetary, 
budgetary regulators to push through industrial and, in general, 
structural policies. 
  When this collapse assumed universal proportions, it became 
clear that you cannot shell out for everything. Therefore, 
somebody must accept responsibility for doing the dirty work. 
If you cannot sustain all areas of production, you must decide 
which are the most promising and efficient enterprises and 
sub-industries. This is precisely where you should invest 
money. The rest must be given time to modernize themselves or 
to diversify, or else face closure. So much has been said in our 
country about bankruptcy, but not a single one of the reformers 
has been willing to take responsibility for initiating the first 
bankruptcy, even as an example of what should be done -- even 
though they have been going on about this ever since the 
beginning of last year. 
  [Platonova] Aleksandr Andreyevich, what does the Central 
Bank 
intend to do about GMM [Global Money Management, Inc.]? 
  [Khandruyev] First and foremost, I would like to agree with 
my GMM colleague and his view of the article by Mikhail Leontyev 
in the newspaper SEGODNYA. A real, self-respecting boxer never 
hits below the belt. But my esteemed GMM colleague is mistaken. 
Certain banking operations can, in fact, be transacted by a 
non-banking institution. But, whatever happens, these 
non-banking institutions must obtain a licence to transact the 
range of operations listed in the Law on Banks and Banking in 
the Russian Federation. 
  A mistake was made right at the start. When the GMM firm 
registered itself, the organization that registered it should 
have read through its rules. These rules mention operations 
that come under the Law on Banking. Before issuing a 
certificate of registration, this organization should have asked 
for a banking licence. However, this question is not worth the 
candle. It would have been enough for the GMM firm to apply to 
the Central Bank and it would have received this licence -- 
provided, of course, all the documents were in order. Then none 
of this fuss, so to speak, would ever have happened.

  [Text] Thursday, January 27 -- The Council of Europe [CE] 
Political Commission did not approve the proposition for the 
extension of the CE and also expressed its clear views 
concerning Russia, head of the Estonian delegation Tunne Kelam 
announced. "Daniel Tarschys, one of the candidates for the post 
of secretary general, stressed in his speech that Russia has 
expressed signs of disrespect towards its neighbours," Kelam 
said. He added that only the Finnish delegation had supported 
Russia's rapid admission to the CE. 
  Kelam was one of the members to participate in the 
discussion. He stressed the Estonian position that Russian will 
have to withdraw its troops from Estonia and Latvia, give up its 
disrespectful attitude towards its neighbours and launch truly 
democratic reforms before being admitted to the CE.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 27, BNS -- Finnish Prime Minister Esko 
Aho, speaking at a Parliamentary Assembly meeting of the Council 
of Europe [CE] in Strasbourg Tuesday [25 January], expressed 
support to an early membership of Russia in the European body, 
the head of the Estonian delegation said in a telephone 
interview with BNS. 
  "It needs to be emphasized that the Russians have chosen 
democracy," Aho said. He said becoming a member in the Council 
of Europe was an important step in the process of 
democratization. Therefore, Russia and the other countries that 
have expressed the wish to join the CE should be accepted as 
quickly as possible, the Finnish leader said. 
  When asked by the head of the Estonian delegation to the 
meeting, Tunne Kelam, if Russia should become a CE member even 
before it has withdrawn its troops from Estonia and Latvia, Aho 
said he favored the pullout of Russian troops, but added that 
Russia had to be accepted into the European body in any case. 
  Finland on Wednesday was the only country in the Strasbourg 
meeting to give its unconditional support to granting Russia a 
full member status. Russian officials have already made a 
number of statements hailing Finland.

specified the type and extent of their support, Olljum said. At 
technical negotiations, experts had specified how Estonia and 
third countries could participate in the dismantling process. 
  It is too early to talk of the timetable as much depends on

  [Text] Kiev, 26 Jan -- The foreign ministries of central 
and eastern European countries are holding multilateral working 
consultations on issues of regional security in Ukraine for the 
first time ever. They are discussing general issues of security 
in central and eastern Europe, in particular, Ukraine's 
initiative on setting up a zone of stable security in the region. 
  During a conversation with a UNIAR correspondent, Ihor 
Kharchenko, chief of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's department 
of political analysis and planning, underscored that 
participants in the consultations support the signing of the 
trilateral declaration in Moscow and expressed hope that such 
consultations will be held in the future. It is worth 
mentioning that representatives of all the countries of eastern 
Europe are taking part in the consultations. The Czech Republic 
is taking part as an observer. 
  Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk and Dmytro 
Pavlychko, chairman of the [Ukrainian parliament] foreign 
affairs commission, addressed participants in the working 
consultations and explained Ukraine's stand on issues of 
consolidating security in central and eastern Europe.

<F P=106> [Valeriy Gromak report: "Baltic-Black Sea Alliance </F>
Outlined. A Place Will Be Found in the Bloc for Many, But Not 
for Russia"] 
  [Text] Vilnius -- "NATO cannot now accept states which are 
not in complete accord," the well-known Ukrainian writer Dmitro 
Pavlychko, chairman of the Ukrainian parliament's Commission for 
Foreign Affairs, has stated. "Hence, in my view, we should 
first undergo schooling in accord all together, not separately. 
We must create complete harmony in East and Central Europe." 
  Dmitro Pavlychko made this statement during his tour of 
Baltic countries, where he held talks with the heads of the 
Lithuanian and Latvian parliaments and leaders of committees and 
commissions, ministers, and opposition leaders in those 
countries. His tour, the mass media reported, had one aim: the 
creation of a Baltic-Black Sea alliance or, to be more precise, 
joint work on the juridical basis for such an alliance. 
Lithuania and the other Baltic countries, Pavlychko believes, 
need to look south and break out of the circle to which they 
have been assigned. 
  So an effort is clearly being made to create a Baltic-Black 
Sea alliance. What role in this is allotted to Russia -- a 
state which has outlets to the Baltic and the Black Sea? 
Ukrainian parliamentarians expressed no opinion on this 
question. But it was answered back in December at the "Baltic 
Cooperation and Security" conference by former Estonian Defense 
Minister Juri Luik (now foreign minister). Expressing his 
support for the creation of a unified security concept for the 
Baltic countries, Luik called for the formation of a 
military-political alliance of the Baltic states without the 
participation of Russia, but involving Ukraine.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 26 TASS -- IZVESTIYA carries a 
commentary, headlined "Boris Fedorov May Return, Viktor 
Gerashchenko May Quit", on a possible reshuffle in the Russian 
Government. 
  The newspaper points out that during the January 24 meeting 
with President Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
"according to some data, agreed to the appointment of Boris 
Fedorov as the minister of finance directly accountable to the 
premier". IZVESTIYA believes that the country's grim economic 
prospect could be the main reason for such a decision. 
  "According to V. Krivov, chief of the group of experts to 
the 
Russian president, a rapid increase in oil production costs, as 
a result of which the export of oil, just as that of coal and 
timber, would become unprofitable, is reckoned to be the main 
factor which may lead to a further sharp drop in industrial 
output, decline in the living standards of people and depletion 
of the import of food. Chernomyrdin could not fail to know about 
such a prospect". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Ella 
Pamfilova, minister of the social protection of the population, 
who tendered her resignation. Pamfilova said in particular that 
she visualised the possibility of her resignation long before 
she took a final decision which was made public on January 16. 
  Pamfilova said the loss of hope that the prime minister and 
the president would heed Yegor Gaydar's proposals about 'the 
need to pursue a coordinated policy between the Central Bank and 
the Finance Ministry, grant an appropriate status to the latter, 
and to shape a social policy dovetailed with decisions that are 
made at the macroeconomic level" became the reasons for her 
final decision to resign. 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA on ella Pamfilova's resignation. 
  The newspaper criticises her activities as the minsiter of 
social protection. "Pamfilova is known to have gone on leave 
with a subsequent resignation from the ministerial post. This 
closely resembles taking to flight. But who will pay the debts 
to the older people?" the newspaper asks. 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA on Yegor Gaydar's resignation. The 
newspaper emphasises that the matter was decided upon by the 
president, not the prime minister. "The president could not 
ignore the sentiments of a vast majority of people in Russia who 
are disgruntled over the results of reforms and who associate 
the sharp decline in the living standards with Gaydar's name". 
  "Notwithstanding all his sympathy for Gaydar, Yeltsin had to 
agree to his resignation." 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on housing for servicemen. 
  "The Housing Problem in the Armed Forces is a Political One" 
is the headline under which the newspaper carries an article 
about the servicemen's welfare problems. "It is at unreasonable, 
to say the least, to allow the army or, at any rate, a large 
proportion of army personnel, to proceed along the road leading 
from hopes to despair". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an interview with former deputy 
speaker Yuriy Voronin. 
  The newspaper reports that voronin intends to stage a 
comeback in politics. In the interview, Voronin again recounted 
the October 3-4 events in Moscow and the role played by 
politicians who retain their positions in high places now as 
well. Voronin is of the opinion that "as a result of the 
September-October crisis, it was democracy, not the legislative 
branch of power, that turned out to be the loser in Russia". 
  IZVESTIYA and KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA run carry a photograph of 
former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy in the Lefortovo prison. 
The picture was taken by a REUTER photographer on January 23. 
  "How and why was a foreign reporter allowed to go and see in 
prison the person whom Russian ones are not allowed even to 
approach?" IZVESTIYA queries.

  [Text] Moscow January 27 (ITAR-TASS) -- Festivities 
dedicated to the 50th anniversary of the complete liberation of 
Leningrad from the Nazi siege during the Second World War, hit 
the headlines of today's Moscow press. 
  The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper front-pages a series of 
articles on this event with the general heading "Feat of the 
Besieged Leningrad is an Immortal Symbol of Courage and 
Staunchness". 
  "True, veterans of the battle of Leningrad and Leningraders 
who lived through the siege, do not look, to our great shame, 
like victors decorated with laurel wreaths. The state and 
society are not very lavish with signs of attention to them," 
the newspaper continues. "Paying great homage to them, let us be 
worthy of their feat." 
  The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper writes about the musical 
comedy theatre which worked in Leningrad almost during all the 
900 days of the city's siege. 
  The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper devotes the entire front 
and 
a considerable part of the second page to reminiscences of 
besieged Leningraders as well as to photographs depicting those 
difficult years. 
  "Reminiscencing the Leningrad siege," writes retired naval 
captain Leopold Sirotkin, "I ask myself: could we withstand a 
similar situation today, following all changes of the recent 
past in our country? I cannot find an unequivocal answer. The 
situation in our country has changed very much." 
  The IZVESTIYA writes about a recent trip to the city of 
Oryol 
(central Russia) by Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
  The newspaper notes that the premier's trip to Oryol "in 
close company with main opponents of ousted Yegor GaYdar (former 
vice-premier) and Boris Fedorov (former finance minister) looked 
like a political demonstration" against the background of the 
still uncomplete drama of forming a new cabinet and resolute 
ousting "antagonists of easy distribution of budget funds". 
  At the same time, IZVESTIYA continues, the concluding speech 
by Chernomyrdin at a conference on the revival of central 
Russia, which took place in Oryol, "threw into confusion the 
uninitiated, since Chernomyrdin praised the policy pursued by 
Gaydar and Fedorov ousted from the cabinet". 
  The same newspaper features Fedorov's interview with 
IZVESTIYA and the INTERFAX news agency. He points to the 
absence of sufficient powers to conduct "his own financial 
policy" as the main reason for his refusal to take the post of 
finance minister in the renewed cabinet. 
  The former minister claimed that "it would be impossible to 
raise production" in the conditions of galloping inflation which 
is already forecast. 
  The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper prints an extract from 
former vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy's book "Collapse of the 
Power", describing political life in Russia in 1993 and the 
tragic October events in Moscow. 
  The newspaper reproduces Rutskoy's photograph at the 
Lefortovo prison printed in IZVESTIYA on Wednesday. 
  The same newspaper carries an interview with Aleksandr 
Gorbovskiy, a high-ranking official from the committee for 
conventional problems of chemical and biological weapons. 
  He writes that Russia has not violated any treaties on 
chemical weapons, adding that it is no less difficult to destroy 
these weapons than to develop them. 
  Replying to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, Vladimir Kazimirov, special 
representative of the Russian president on Nagorno-Karabakh, 
stresses that the main thing now is to prevent 
internationalisation of the Azeri-Armenian conflict in that 
region, which has deteriorated over the past few days.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Nadein: "When the Economy Is </F>
Flourishing, Congress Gives a Standing Ovation"] 
  [Text] Washington -- Bill Clinton arrived at the podium in 
the House of Representatives to deliver his first State of the 
Union message at the height of his popularity, like an 
experienced sportsman who, while making minor slipups on the 
way, skillfully peaks in time for the crucial competition. 
  Figures that have just been published show that at the end 
of 
his first year Clinton has outstripped even such a revered 
President as Ronald Reagan. 
  There is no doubt that the number of those who approve of 
Clinton's activities in the White House will increase following 
his well-judged and passionate speech which met with applause, 
ovations, or whistles of approval on at least 63 occasions. 
Clinton thanked Congress for all the achievements of the first 
year of his presidency, which make a rather impressive picture. 
It was on the legislators -- the people who who almost wrecked 
his budget (it was passed by one vote), all but consigned to 
oblivion the program to change the tax system and reduce the 
state debt, and furiously resisted restrictions on the use of 
weapons (the Brady law) -- that the President bestowed his 
special thanks, his final sentence sounding amazingly 
convincing: "Not once did I use my presidential veto," Clinton 
said, meaning that the combination of firmness and compromises 
that characterizes the administration made extreme measures 
unnecessary. 
  Economic growth, which some perspicacious experts predicted 
back in the final months of Bush's presidency, is now a 
statistical fact. Clinton pointed to production growth, the 
increasing number of jobs, the low interest rate, and increased 
consumer confidence. "For the first time since Harry Truman we 
will have had three consecutive deficit-free years and the 
dollar will have stayed where it is," the President said, 
prompting the one of the longest ovations. 
  Clinton stressed that all this was achieved without raising 
taxes for the vast majority of the population, and, above all, 
without placing an extra burden on the backbone of society -- 
the middle class. "Only the very rich, only 1.2 percent of the 
population, will pay higher taxes; no one else, and that is a 
fact," the President said. 
  Noting that many politicians in Washington had recommended 
him to continue the policy of cutting defense expenditure this 
year, Clinton said that he had rejected that approach: In the 
new budget for fiscal 1994-1995 the U.S. armed forces will not 
receive any less money than in the previous year. 
  Addressing not so much the legislators as the ordinary 
people 
who put him in the White House, Clinton mapped out a tough 
schedule for the next campaign, on which he is certainly pinning 
the future of his presidency -- a statewide health program.

  [Excerpt] Beijing, 26 Jan -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev arrived in China on Wednesday [26 January], 
starting an official visit that will focus on Russian-Chinese 
border trade. Kozyrev, whose visit will last until 29 January, 
is to meet with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Beijing on 
Thursday. 
  Moscow regards mutual relations with the PRC as a 
traditionally high-priority and independent direction of its 
foreign policy and as an important component part of its general 
strategy of ensuring national-state interests through 
partnership with the surrounding world. To a great extent we 
link cooperation with China with the prospects of fulfilling the 
unique Euro-Asiatic potential of Russia, the economic upsurge of 
the rayons of Siberia and the Far East and integration into the 
economic life of the Asia-Pacific region. 
  The Russian side values highly the results achieved in 
recent 
years of cooperation with China that has been carried out on 
many levels and is satisfied with the stable and positive 
development along all paths of bilateral links. The bringing of 
Russian-Chinese relations on to a higher level -- that of 
constructive partners -- accords completely with the national 
interests of our countries and peoples, the head of the Russian 
Federation's foreign policy department told ITAR-TASS 
correspondents at Beijing airport. 
  The coming talks and meetings in Beijing are expected to be 
a 
new step forward on the path of strengthening 
good-neighborliness and deepening mutual understanding and trust 
between Russia and the PRC, while the documents signed during 
the visit will expand the treaty and legal base of bilateral 
relations. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, 27 Jan -- Relations with China are a 
priority trend in Russia's foreign policy, as was stated during 
the visit of Russian President Boris Yeltsin to the PRC in 
December 1992, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stressed. 
He was speaking before the start of the Russian-Chinese talks 
with a large number of people attending the Diaoyutai residence 
for guests of honor in Beijing. 
  "We should like to raise Russian-Chinese relations to a 
qualitatively new level -- one of constructive partnership -- 
both in bilateral ties as well as from a regional and an 
international point of view," Andrey Kozyrev said. 
  Greeting the Russian minister, Qian Qichen, deputy prime 
minister of the State Council, PRC minister of foreign affairs, 
noted "according to the Chinese proverb 'spring is a wise time' 
and starting something in the spring means it will be 
successful." He expressed the conviction that relations between 
China and Russia would continue to develop in the interests of 
the two countries in the new year. 
  Qian Qichen congratulated Andrey Kozyrev on his being 
confirmed head of the Russian foreign political department.

  [Text] Beijing, 27 Jan -- In all probability the visit of 
PRC President Jiang Zemin to Moscow will take place in the third 
quarter of this year. As reported today by Galina Sidorova, 
political aide to the Russian foreign minister at the end of the 
first round of Russian-Chinese talks today, the second 
Russian-Chinese summit will be preceded by a trip by Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian Government, to Beijing, as 
well as by a trip to Moscow by PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin made an official visit to 
Beijing in December 1992. His visit ended the process of 
complete normalization of relations between the two countries, 
having opened up extensive possibilities for the establishment 
of new, good-neighborly and friendly contacts.

Vyacheslav Tomilin, and Georgiy Shmelev] 
  [Text] Beijing January 27 TASS -- Questions of bilateral 
relations were in the focus of the first round of talks between 
the foreign ministers of Russia and China, which has just ended 
here. "Its agenda was so crammed that the foreign ministers of 
the two countries had to prolong the talk for almost one hour," 
said Galina Sidorova, political adviser of the Russian foreign 
minister. 
  The ministers stressed that "a progressive and constant 
exchange of views and visits at summit and high levels would be 
continued between the two countries. A visit of PRC chairman 
Jiang Zemin to Moscow is being planned. It will apparently take 
place in the third quarter of the year. In preparation for a 
new Russo-Chinese summit, Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin 
will visit Beijing and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen will 
pay a visit to Moscow. 
  In the course of the negotiations, Sidorova noted, the sides 
have discussed various aspects of economic and 
military-technical cooperation between the two countries. 
Kozyrev stressed Russia's readiness to go over to large-scale 
ventures while simultaneously continuing the policy of expanding 
traditional forms of economic relations. For instance, Russia 
is expected to take part in the construction of the huge "three 
gorges" hydropower complex in China. 
  The sides also discussed the possibility of Russia helping 
China to reconstruct many enterprises, which were built with 
Soviet aid. 
  The ministers noted the progress made during the talks on 
the 
mutual reduction of armed forces and confidence-building 
measures on the border between the two countries. These talks 
will be continued to try to conclude a corresponding agreement 
already this year, Sidorova said. 
  The sides announced their readiness to continue negotiations 
on border problems. The joint delegation of Russia, Kazakhstan, 
Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to these talks will be led by 
Aleksandr Panov, the new Russian deputy foreign minister. 
  During the discussion of problems linked with the 
demarcation 
of the border between the two countries, the ministers pointed 
to the possibility of joint economic activity in the border 
districts, including the disputed areas. The sides want a 
status quo to be observed on the border after its demarcation. 
  Mutual interest in developing constructive cooperation in 
the 
military-technical sphere was expressed in the course of the 
talks. Kozyrev said that it should be promoted with due account 
of mutual interests and the observance of corresponding 
international commitments. 
  Sidorova noted that the idea of promoting constructive 
partnership with China, expressed by the Russian minister, "Does 
not mean that we are allies with China in the direct sense of 
the term. It implies Moscow's readiness to promote very close 
interaction with Beijing in matters of mutual concern". 
Moreover, Russia and China, as two great powers, proceed from 
the understanding that they have both national and huge common 
interests of regional and global character. 
  In reply to a request of his Chinese counterpart, Kozyrev 
shared his view with him on the current political situation in 
Russia, laying stress on the immutability of its foreign policy 
which "remains presidential".

<F P=106> [Andrey Kabannikov report: "Will Kozyrev Play the China </F>
Card. On the Russian Foreign Minister's Visit to Beijing"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- The Chinese, it seems, are indeed 
genuinely happy at the three-day visit by our foreign minister, 
who arrived here on Wednesday [26 January]. Kozyrev promised to 
visit Beijing three months ago but was delayed. He was not the 
only one. The visit by Aleksandr Shokhin, head of the Russian 
side of the Russian-Chinese Interstate Cooperation Commission, 
has been postponed four times and now no one knows whether it 
will take place at all. 
  Of course, it was our purely internal problems which were to 
blame for all of this. But Chinese diplomacy, which has 
recently been making progress in relations with the United 
States, Europe, and countries in the Asia and Pacific region, 
was painfully aware of a certain stagnation in dealings with 
Russia and saw no Russian interlocutors even as high as deputy 
foreign minister. 
  However, the two states have things to discuss. It is a 
little over a year since Boris Yeltsin's visit to China, during 
which over 20 agreements were signed, the majority of which are 
not in operation. 
  Some agreements have brought unexpected results. The accord 
on visa-free tourist exchange is in itself absolutely normal. 
But in practice it has transpired that sometimes it is only the 
tour guide makes it back to China. 
  Another problem that Kozyrev will probably have to discuss 
in 
Beijing is connected with the agreement, now in abeyance, on the 
construction of a nuclear power station here with Russian 
assistance. The accord on this was reached a year ago and the 
Russian side, which is extremely interested in this major order 
for its now idle "Energomash" plant, promised China a 
substantial credit for this construction project. Since then 
the Chinese, who incidentally have an acute need for electric 
power, have not returned to this topic for a reason which 
perhaps our foreign minister will try to find out. 
  Apart from everything else, during Kozyrev's visit to 
Beijing 
he is going to read a lecture on the fundamentals of Russia's 
Asia policy at the Institute of People's Diplomacy. This is of 
particular interest because there are those who think that 
Russia does not have such a policy.

<F P=106> [Sergey Agafonov report: "In Japan It Is No Longer </F>
Considered Necessary To Assist Russia"] 
  [Text] Tokyo -- Citing confidential Foreign Ministry 
sources, the capital's TOKYO SHIMBUN reports that the Japanese 
Government has decided to make adjustments in its approach to 
Russia. 
  In view of Moscow's clear conservative turn in recent weeks, 
the departure from the cabinet of key figures committed to 
reforms, and Viktor Chernomyrdin's statements leaving no doubt 
of his intention to halt the country's movement toward a market 
economy, Tokyo intends as a matter of the greatest urgency to 
adjust its policy of providing economic assistance for the 
Russian reforms. From a formal viewpoint the economic package 
of $1.82 billion in credits for Russia and insurance for trade 
operations with Russia which Japan had promised remains on the 
agenda, but in actual fact even this lifeline is being put on 
ice, so the same source points out, because the change in the 
political situation in Moscow and the Chernomyrdin government's 
sharp turn to the right require a commensurate response. 
  According to the major Japanese newspapers the recent 
changes 
in Moscow have unambiguously shifted the Japanese perception of 
Russia in a negative direction. Fears that the agreements 
reached during Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October can now be 
confidently written off are becoming firm convictions. 
Bilateral relations themselves are being plunged into a new 
period of uncertainty, the length of which cannot be estimated. 
  Japanese analysts are more and more frequently comparing 
Yeltsin's Russia with Hindenburg's Germany, and are rebuking the 
president for appeasement and other sins. But perhaps the most 
notable feature is that hints are emerging, tentative as yet, 
about the need to review Russia's relations with the G-7, the 
Paris Club, and other common Western structures. So, for 
example, Japanese Foreign Ministry sources are now actively 
arguing that it is logical to help the reformers, to meet them 
halfway on the question of deferring payments on Russian 
liabilities, and to seek other forms of collaboration. But the 
logic clearly collapses if Moscow intends changing course and 
putting the brakes on reforms. Moreover, according to TOKYO 
SHIMBUN, Japan is inclined to put on the agenda of the 
forthcoming G-7 meeting in Naples the question of reviewing the 
whole package of Western economic aid for Russia to take account 
of the changes in Moscow's political reference points. 
  You do not have to be a great prophet to divine that there 
will be a further sharpening of tone if Chernomyrdin really does 
resort to reintroducing the antimarket model.

  [Text] Moscow, 27 Jan--Over the past week, Japanese fishing 
vessels have violated Russian territorial waters about 100 
times, the press service of the border troops of the Russian 
Federation told an ITAR-TASS correspondent today. Border troops 
estimate that infiltrators are using the tactic of entering in 
groups and conducting constant radar and visual observation of 
Russian border vessels, leaving the territorial waters when they 
appear. The smugglers from Japan ignore signals by border 
guards to stop, including warning shots. 
  The press service notes that the ships and aircraft of the 
Russian border troops will take all measures envisaged under the 
law on the state border of the Russian Federation to protect 
Russian interests in its territorial waters and economic zone.

<F P=106> ["Opinion" by correspondent Leonid Timofeyev: "Russia </F>
Convinced That New Diplomacy Is Only Old Diplomacy That Is Well 
and Truly Forgotten"; article is preceded by two quotes 
attributed to Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev: "CIS and 
Baltic Countries Are the Region Where Russia's Paramount Vital 
Interests Are Focused. It Is Also From There That the Main 
Threats to Those Interests Emanate"; "We Must Not Abandon Those 
Regions That Have for Centuries Been Spheres of Russian 
Interests. And We Must Not Be Afraid To Say So"] 
  [Text] Russia's close neighbors were wrong to take offense 
at Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's statement to the 
effect that the CIS and Baltic countries are the focus of our 
vital interests and that the main threats to these interests 
emanate from there. 
  Take Tajikistan at least. The internal conflict and its 
proximity to unstable Afghanistan generate a host of problems 
for the whole CIS and Russia in particular. Drugs, weapons, the 
future of the Russian-speaking population, and the economy cause 
Moscow concern. The Russian leadership has not hidden its 
commitment to settling the Tajik crisis, as it has repeatedly 
stated, by organizing dialogue between the Dushanbe authorities 
and the opposition. Admittedly, according to our information, 
that country's government is reluctant to enter into contact 
with its opponents. And for the moment the Russian Federation's 
201st Motorized Rifle Division and Russian border outposts are 
forced to maintain the defenses. After all, there are no longer 
any guarded borders beyond them. 
  In the past year alone 350 clashes and attempts at 
infiltration have been recorded on the Tajik-Afghan border. 
Some 31 service caps have lain on fresh graves. 
  A similar picture can be painted as far as producing a more 
stable internal situation in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan is 
concerned. The latter's border with the PRC has been guarded by 
everyone. After the latest "demobbing" the Ukrainians and 
Belarusians went home. The latest draft in Russia produced a 
tremendous shortfall, and the Kazakhs do not have the forces or 
the experience to cover many hundreds of kilometers. So the 
border has come unlocked, and hordes of people from adjacent 
states are crossing it to enter the wide expanses of the CIS. 
And not all the "boys" involved have Chinese blouses and 
slippers in their rucksacks. It is not only Russia that is the 
destination of this stream of people, but also the west of 
Europe, including the Baltic countries. 
  There is another aspect to the border problem. The republics 
of the former USSR have become autonomous and sovereign, and no 
one is encroaching on their sovereignty. But Ashgabat, Baku, 
and Tashkent are using a simplified, problem-free procedure to 
issue Iranians and Turks with visas. Are there Islamic 
fundamentalists among them? Virtually nothing prevents them 
then taking a ticket to Moscow. 
  Take another of the "hot spots" -- Nagorno-Karabakh, over 
which a war is blazing between Azerbaijan and Armenia. What 
makes Russia take vigorous action in that region? Economic 
interests on the one hand. And the refugees on the other. 
Every family must be provided with housing and a means of 
existence. We are equally alarmed by the influx of mercenaries 
into the conflict zone from Iran, Afghanistan, Ukraine, and even 
Russia. 
  There are irregularities in Russia's relations with Georgia, 
Ukraine, Moldova, and the Baltic countries. In some places they 
are due to internal conflicts. And in others, like Latvia or 
Estonia, the rights of the Russian-speaking population are being 
flouted, as even international organizations do not deny. 
  The Russian diplomatic service says that militarily no one 
poses a threat to us. Sooner or later the question of our 
troops' withdrawal will also have been resolved. There is no 
intention of providing Russia's new borders with technical 
reinforcement. And not just because the state cannot 
financially stretch to it. The main point is that a security 
strip and barbed wire cast doubt on the idea of a single 
economic area and economic union. And who, apart from 
ourselves, including the Baltic, needs the goods produced at the 
former Union departments' enterprises? 
  It looks as though the interests and threats that Kozyrev 
mentioned to his ambassadors are often shared.

<F P=106> [Military observer Vladimir Klimov "Topical Commentary:" </F>
"Where Are Missiles Targeted?"] 
  [Excerpts] Hamlet's question "To be or not to be?" remains 
the main question of the day. I was surely not the only one to 
think so on learning that the Russian and U.S. presidents had 
announced the detargeting of strategic missiles in the Moscow 
declaration. 
  "For the first time since the beginning of the nuclear era 
our countries have stopped targeting missiles at each other," 
Major General Anatoliy Svetikov, deputy chief of the Strategic 
Rocket Forces Staff Directorate, believes. [passage omitted] 
  Yet the past is still with us. The following questions have 
arisen from there, from the alarming past: Is the retargeting 
of missiles and their return to their former condition possible 
and how long would this take? Let us allow the specialist, Maj. 
Gen. Svetikov, to speak: 
  "The process of introducing and scrapping missions operates 
on many levels and planes. It varies for different categories 
and types of missile. The scrapping of missions will depend on 
the principle chosen by the two countries' presidents. As 
regards resumption, I can say that as long as a missile is on 
alert status there is always a possibility of returning 
everything to its former place. How long will this take? Long 
enough, although the times vary for different categories and 
types of missile. I do not intend to talk about time periods 
but have singled out the most important thing: the 
implementation of the presidents' decision sharply reduces the 
threshold of a nuclear strike." 
  How nice it would be to put a period after such an 
optimistic 
conclusion and to exclaim joyfully "The End!" Alas, there is 
still a long way to go before the end; dreams about a complete 
ban on nuclear weapons still remain dreams. The nuclear danger 
comes not from across the ocean but from Russia's doorstep -- 
Ukraine. Its president pledged to transport nuclear warheads to 
us for dismantling. But some of them are already in a critical 
condition. 
  Yet again we have to talk of the unreasonableness of certain 
vociferous politicians. Specialists, foreseeing the 
complexities with missiles, made an agreement about centralized 
maintenance of them. But some Ukrainian deputies saw Moscow's 
evil hand in this too. The agreements, which did not need 
parliament's ratification, were blocked by it. We, they said, 
will overcome. 
  But how can routine inspection and maintenance work and the 
maintenance of missile complexes be undertaken when there are 
not enough resources or specialists? The result of the 
deputies' veto is the alarming technical condition of missiles 
in Ukraine. Following inspection, warheads were removed from 
some missile launchers which had simply become dangerous. 
  Hamlet's question has now crystallized over these missile 
silos. How will people answer it?

  [Text] Rome January 27 TASS--First Deputy Foreign Minister 
of Russia Anatoliy Adamishin, who arrived here to prepare the 
ground for Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin's official visit 
to Italy, has met Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta 
to discuss key political, financial and economic problems 
included in the agenda of the forthcoming talks. The sides also 
exchanged views on several international problems, including the 
settlement of conflicts in different parts of the world. 
  Adamishin told ITAR-TASS that the Russian prime minister's 
visit to Italy was initiated by the Italian side and constituted 
an important stage in the development of bilateral relations 
between the two countries. "1994 promises to be a rather 
intensive year in Russo-Italian relations. A G-7 meeting is to 
be held at Naples in July. The Italian side, as regular G-7 
chairman, has reaffirmed the invitation extended to President 
Boris Yeltsin to attend the meeting," Adamishin said. 
  "Our countries are closely cooperating within the frameworks 
of multilateral diplomacy. Russia is ready to help Italy in its 
efforts as chairman of the CSCE. There are many points of 
contact in the policies of the two countries," he added. 
  Adamishin said that the policies of the two countries in 
such 
a painful matter as the Yugoslavian conflict had much in common. 
"The Italians, like ourselves, approach very guardedly the ideas 
of resorting to forcible actions in this neighbouring region," 
Adamishin stated. 
  "Political cooperation is being continued in bilateral 
relations, too. Italy is our important partner and a treaty on 
friendship and cooperation is now in the making. It will be 
signed soon. Many agreements, signed between Italy and the 
Soviet Union, have been reconcluded. 
  "The sides have discussed their economic relations. Italy 
has granted Russia second largest credits after the German 
loans. This 'generosity' of our Italian partners, frankly 
speaking, has created definite difficulties in servicing the 
credits. After all, they have to be repaid. But even in this 
delicate sphere we were able to find mutual understanding and 
common language," Adamishin noted. "The level of cooperation in 
the economic sphere is very high. For instance, the recently 
signed agreement between 'Gazprom' and the Eni group is a vivid 
example of the common effort to help improve the trade balance 
between the two countries, to develop industrial and 
technological cooperation. 
  "The Russian side expects Chernomyrdin's official visit to 
Italy to be successful and to serve the interests of the peoples 
of both countries," Adamishin stressed.

  [Text] Moscow January 27 TASS -- Russian Premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin departed for Italy this morning for a two-day 
official visit. 
  According to the visit programme, Chernomyrdin will meet 
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. 
It is expected that the Russian premier will be received by 
Pope John Paul II and will have meetings with members of the 
Italian business community. 
  At the Russian-Italian talks, the sides plan to discuss the 
entire range of bilateral relations, implementation of earlier 
understandings between the two countries, Russia-Italian 
partnership in international relations, the formation of new 
mechanisms for a pan-European system of security and cooperation 
through fuller use of the potential of the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
  It is expected that the intergovernment talks will result in 
signing a statement by the two governments, an intergovernment 
agreement on the status of burial places of Russian servicemen 
and civilians in Italy and Italian servicemen in Russia, who 
died during the Second World War as well as a memorandum of 
intent concerning an agreement on encouragement and protection 
of capital investments.

  [Text] Moscow January 26 TASS -- Belgian Defence Minister 
Leo Delcroix has become the first NATO official to visit a 
once-secret Russian missile base in Bologoye located between 
Moscow and St. Petersburg. 
  Accompanied by his Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev, 
Delcroix toured the base, once off-limits for foreigners, to see 
the most advanced Russian strategic missiles and other military 
hardware. 
  The trip was part of Delcroix's two-day visit to Russia, 
following the signing of a cooperation agreement by president 
Boris Yeltsin and Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene in 
Brussels in December 1993 to boost military contacts between the 
two countries. 
  Delcroix's talks with Grachev centered around international 
security in the wake of the adoption of the Partnership for 
Peace programme proposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton and the 
historic U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian nuclear deal signed in Moscow 
earlier this month. 
  Special attention was paid to European security, nuclear 
non- 
proliferation and the participation of both countries in U.N. 
peace-keeping operations in Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Aleksandr Sisnev and Viktor </F>
Solomin] 
  [Text] London January 27 TASS--Russia must continue its 
policy of economic reforms and go ahead on this path as fast as 
it can, British Secretary of state for Foreign Affairs Douglas 
Hogg said in an interview with ITAR-TASS. A speedy 
reorganization of the Russian industry and further development 
of the privatization process are the most important tasks at the 
moment. This is a question of vital importance. There will be 
no investments without privatization, and without privatization 
it will be impossible to transform the Russian industry, make it 
more competitive and give it an opportunity to win new markets, 
the foreign secretary emphasised. Difficulties, which the 
Russian economy is facing, are not caused by reforms, they are a 
result of the policy pursued in the past years, he said. 
  Assessing the situation in Russia, Douglas Hogg said that he 
would be concerned if the pace of reforms in Russia slows down, 
if signs of "weakening of the political will" to conduct reforms 
appear which will endanger this whole process. 
  Speaking about the specific aid which the West could provide 
to Russia, Hogg emphasised that first of all it is necessary to 
open western markets to Russian exports. This is not an easy 
task, he noted, taking into consideration that a large part of 
the products, which Russian enterprises make for export, is 
already available in plenty on the western market. But trade 
and opening of markets are important conditions for the economic 
development of Russia, he said. 
  Speaking of activities of the "know-how" fund which was set 
up by the British Government to provide technical assistance in 
the sphere of economic reforms to East European countries, 
including Russia, Great Britain was the first country to begin 
providing such aid, Hogg emphasised. We concentrated our 
activities in such key spheres as finance system, employment, 
support of small business, production and distribution of food 
products, power generation and a number of other spheres, he 
said. 
  The secretary of state for foreign affairs said that the 
total financial resources of the fund, meant to provide 
assistance to Russia, were doubled to reach 120 million pound 
sterling in 1993. 
  The experience of the past years has shown and we are glad 
to 
ascertain that the "know-how" fund is an effective body to 
provide aid to Russian reforms. Unlike certain other programmes 
it is not so bureaucratic, and more capable of quickly reacting 
to individual demands, Douglas Hogg said.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Polotskiy, RIA own correspondent in Berlin, </F>
"exclusive" NG report under the "Army" rubric: "Troop Pullout 
Proceeds as Scheduled. General Burlakov's Press Conference"] 
  [Text] "The former political leaders of the ex-USSR -- 
Gorbachev and Shevardnadze -- signed in October 1990 
understandings on pulling out the Western Group of Forces [WGF] 
without giving a thought or consideration to the future of tens 
of thousands of families of officers who had no apartments, and 
who are to return to their country," Colonel General Matvey 
Burlakov, commander in chief of the WGF, stated today in a press 
conference in Berlin. 
  He pointed out that despite the difficulties involved in 
pulling out history's biggest group of forces located on the 
territory of a foreign country to their homeland in a short time 
frame, this "uniquely complex" task is being tackled according 
to an agreed schedule. To date, 90 percent of servicemen, 
military hardware, and supplies have been withdrawn to Russia. 
  The main problem, according to the WGF chief commander, 
remains as before a considerable -- up to 40 percent -- lag in 
the construction of housing for WGF servicemen in Russia behind 
the rate of the Russian troop withdrawal from Germany. 
  The commander in chief did not hide his dissatisfaction with 
and great anxiety at the fact that the total number of 
apartments in Russia for WGF servicemen yet to be completed is 
47,000. That includes, in almost equal shares, the housing that 
was supposed to be constructed with 7.8 billion Deutsche marks 
(25,000 apartments) and with the money provided from the budget 
of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry (22,000 apartments). 
  Another problem is the rising crime around WGF garrisons in 
Germany: Attacks on Russian servicemen by emigrants "of all 
stripes," as the chief commander put it, and from German 
neo-Nazi hooligans, have not stopped.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] The NATO concept "Partnership for Peace" is a 
"camouflage," INTERFAX was told by ex-president of the former 
Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev. 
  He believes that NATO is attempting to somehow broaden its 
activities and bring them closer to Russia's borders. Those who 
think that this may help develop relations and establish calm 
are wrong. On the contrary, the seeds of feud and suspicion 
have already been sown, believes Gorbachev. 
  He said that first the issue on membership in NATO by more 
countries would be raised in the near future. But seeing 
Russia's negative approach to the prospect, the North Atlantic 
Alliance has invented the initiative "Partnership for Peace". 
It was obvious that NATO had not given up the idea of expanding 
the bloc, he said. 
  Gorbachev said that the United States suspected Russia of 
threatening its neighbors. "This is an insult for Russians," 
said the ex-president. 
  He said that if NATO really wanted to tackle European 
problems, the bloc's structure should have representations of 
all countries on the continent. 
  Gorbachev believes that the Russian president's and the 
government's positive response to the adoption of the 
partnership concept at the recent NATO summit in Brussels 
indicates that Moscow's foreign and domestic policies lacked 
consistency. 
  Speaking about the problem of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, 
the 
ex- president disagreed with the idea that Ukrainians lacked a 
grasp of reality. "They understand everything well," he said, 
"and will certainly comply with the provisions of the START-I 
treaty." They are bargaining to make up for the expenditures in 
terms of the nuclear arms scrapping, said Gorbachev. 
  He believes that in the nuclear bargain everyone benefits, 
the Americans most of all. Their president has shown that he 
can add pressure on Ukraine, after which Ukraine signed the 
treaty. The Americans do not miss such chances. 
  Gorbachev said that Russia will never agree to play the role 
of a "younger brother." "Russia," he said, "is a great power and 
will remain such. One must do business with it on equal terms, 
even though today we have temporary difficulties," he said. 
  Gorbachev voiced satisfaction with the fact that during his 
visit to Russia Bill Clinton spoke about the U.S. attitude to 
Russia as an equal partner and that he recognizes its role. 
"Thank God, this is so. Earlier I did not feel such a 
categorical position on the part of our American partners," said 
Gorbachev.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Gladkevich report under the rubric "Housing for the </F>
Army": "House Warming Parties in Torzhok"] 
  [Text] Around 50 military aviators and their families are 
this week giving housewarming parties in Torzhok (Tver Oblast). 
This is the result of a contract concluded in 1992 between the 
Russian "Konversiya-Zhilye" concern and the German firm "Buk 
Inpar" [name as transliterated]. 
  Under this contract, implementation of which began in summer 
1993, residential settlements for servicemen withdrawn from 
Germany and without accommodations are to be erected in Torzhok, 
Siverskaya, and Garbolovo by the end of the first quarter of 
this year. The contract overall is scheduled to continue 
through 1995 and is based on credits totaling 550 million Marks 
[DM] granted by German banks and guaranteed by the Russian 
Government. Ultimately Russian military men without 
accommodations should receive more than 7,000 apartments with a 
total area of more than 400,000 square meters. 
  More than 20 apartment blocks have been assembled in Torzhok 
since August; each block has 18 or 16 apartments. Such rapid 
construction is possible because the blocks are assembled from 
modular constructions produced in Pinnow (Germany), where they 
are furnished with all the materials necessary for house 
building. They are delivered to the aforementioned regions, 
where Russian Federation Defense Ministry construction 
organizations and the concern itself assemble the buildings. 
  "Today we have 320 servicemen without apartments," unit 
commander Major General of Aviation Boris Vorobyev says. "The 
300-apartment camp which is being erected here will enable us to 
provide virtually all of them with housing by the spring. True, 
the process of withdrawing troops from the Western Group of 
Forces is continuing and new servicemen are arriving in need of 
apartments. So we are very much counting on the continuation of 
Russian-German cooperation." 
  Unfortunately these hopes may not be justified. At the 
moment the implementation of the first part of the construction 
program is being completed -- its construction has cost DM117 
million, but that is only a part of the credits needed. The 
German side is currently under strong pressure, according to one 
of the leaders of "Buk Inpar," Hans Wirtz. The idea of changing 
the terms of the credit agreement has gained currency in the 
European Community, and that could effectively jeopardize the 
program. If it happens, Russia will have obtained 6,000 
apartments short of the stipulated number, and the Germans will 
lose around 150,000 jobs created thanks to this program. 
  At the same time, continuing the program in the form 
projected by "Konversiya-zhilye" and "Buk Inpar" on the basis of 
the second tranche of credits would enable the production of 
modules to be launched in Russia itself. Some of the money 
could be assigned to organizing this production process at the 
Izhora plant, which is not experiencing the best of times. The 
use of mainly local raw materials and fabrics would enable the 
factory cost of each square meter of housing to be reduced by 40 
percent without any deterioration in quality, and, consequently, 
allow the construction of an additional 30,000 square meters, to 
fulfill the entire program in good time. 
  The problem of eliminating homelessness in the Army is acute 
nowadays, and the possibilities of funding housing construction 
from the state budget are extremely limited. In these 
conditions we would like any possiblity for nonbudget funding of 
housing construction for the military to be exploited 100 
percent, and for more and more partners to be involved in this 
work.

  [Text] The situation in the areas of confrontation in the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] remains tense. The NKR Military 
Information Service has revealed that Azerbaijan's military 
forces renewed their attacks against the central areas in 
Mardakertskiy Rayon yesterday morning. But the NKR defense 
units obstructed the attacks and inflicted many casualties on 
the enemy. According to reports received by 1030 yesterday, one 
Azerbaijani armored vehicle was hit. 
  Meanwhile, combat operations also took place in the 
northeast 
of the front line. Azerbaijan's military forces tried to 
penetrate the inner areas of Mardakertskiy and Kelbadzharskiy 
Rayons. The NKR forces stopped them. The clashes elsewhere on 
the front line took the form of positional fighting. 
Azerbaijan's aircraft tried to violate NKR airspace yesterday. 
  The NKR freedom fighters hit six enemy armored vehicles in 
the clashes in Mardakertskiy Rayon last night and destroyed two 
of them. The enemy units left the bodies of their dead 
colleagues and fled the battlefield. 
  The NKR Defense Headquarters has revealed that frequent 
clashes have recently been taking place between the Azerbaijani 
military forces and the Azerbaijani People's Front's armed 
groups.

  [Text] Last week Russia has made known again that it is 
ready to be a sole arbitrator in the Karabakh conflict. This 
fact was supported by two sequential meetings of Andrey Kozyrev 
with his Azerbaijan and Armenian colleagues. There are all 
reasons to think that the West has somewhat reduced its peaceful 
efforts in Nagorno-Karabakh after President Clinton's visit to 
Moscow. The details of talks held in the multi-storey building 
on Vosstanie Square remained behind the closed doors. 
Unexpected may be considered the participation in the summit of 
Arkadiy Gukasyan, the Nagorno-Karabakh foreign relations 
minister. He has received the invitation from Kozyrev on his 
way back from the former Yugoslavia to Stepanakert via Yerevan. 
By the available information, the Azerbaijani foreign minister 
Guseynov has remained not completely satisfied with results of 
his talks with Kozyrev. As told by TURAN news agency, he 
insisted on unconditioned withdrawal of the Armenian troops from 
the territory of Azerbaijan, having in mind the Karabakh 
territory as well. Galina Sidorova, his assistant, told that 
Guseynov expressed discontent with position of the CIS 
countries, particularly of Russia, which by his view "does not 
demonstrate adherence to principles in connection with Armenian 
aggression against Azerbaijan". 
  TURAN news agency has circulated a report, with reference to 
the "well-informed source in the Russian Federation Foreign 
Office", in which the tendencies of Yerevan are stated. 
According to these statement [as received], Armenia asks Russia 
to dispose Russian troops along the Azerbaijani-Iranian border, 
which will make Azerbaijan-cut off Iran-be more agreeable. As 
refers to the post-war setup in the area of conflict, the same 
"informed source" has presented the Armenian model according to 
which Azerbaijan must provide a broad political autonomy to 
Nagorno-Karabakh, present him Shusha city, and leave inviolable 
the humanitarian corridor connecting Karabakh with Armenia. The 
author of this project, according to TURAN, is the President 
Yeltsin's adviser, the well-known politologist Andranik 
Mihranyan. However Yerevan did not confirm the truth of this 
news. 
  In difference to Gasanov, the head of Armenian Foreign 
Affairs Department Vahan Papazyan thinks that the Moscow summit 
should be considered as a significant step on a way to prepare 
the cease-fire agreement. In his interview to NEGA news agency 
he has emphasized that it is necessary to resume the talks with 
Azerbaijan. Special concern, by his belief, should create the 
tendency to internationalize the conflict, since Afghan 
mujahedins and mercenaries from the former Soviet republics are 
being involved in the conflict, and arms concentration is 
increased. Papazyan has emphasized that the balanced approach 
of Russia to the conflict settlement is completely acceptable 
for Armenia since it agrees to the documents adopted by the CSCE 
and approved by the UN Security Council. Russian side intended 
to organize the meeting between Gasanov and Papazyan, which 
however failed. Meanwhile, the official Yerevan has revealed 
restrained attitude to Moscow talks. It would be premature to 
bind special hopes with these talks, told SNARK one top official 
of the Armenian Foreign Office. The difficulty is, he 
explained, to make consistent the opposite positions of Armenia 
and Azerbaijan.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] After his meeting with the president today, the 
former Minister of Finance [Boris Fedorov] gave a special 
interview for Ostankino's "Novosti" program: 
  [Begin Fedorov recording] First, I did not submit my 
resignation. I simply did not accept the invitation to join the 
reorganized Cabinet. I did not submit a resignation, but I 
refused to accept the invitation. The president repeated his 
offer to me once again. I cited the same arguments, saying that 
when policies are being changed, policies which were repeatedly 
spelled out in government documents...[pauses] We were aiming 
for 60-80 percent annual inflation at the end of the year. But 
now they are proposing 300 percent. This is a change of policy. 
So, I cannot participate in this. 
  If people who are manifestly opposed to the government, 
opposed to the policy which we pursued in 1993 -- a policy which 
produced substantial results -- are brought into the government, 
this is the premier's and the president's prerogative. But they 
tell me that there is no reason to remove Gerashchenko, for 
instance. This means that he is right and I am wrong. So, my 
choice is a very simple one. 
  I respect the premier's choice in forming the government. He 
is entitled to choose the government he wants. But, as a free 
man, I am also entitled to determine my own place in this 
structure. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Vasiliy Kononenko report incorporating interview with </F>
former Finance Minister Boris Fedorov; place, date not given: 
"Boris Fedorov Still Refuses To Join the Government"] 
  [Text] The meeting between Boris Fedorov and President 
Boris Yeltsin, which has been the subject of so much conjecture 
in recent days, was finally held in the morning of 26 January -- 
the two men discussed whether Fedorov would join the government 
and on what terms. As was expected, the meeting was held behind 
closed doors. 
  Boris Fedorov left the president just 15 minutes later. Some 
30 minutes after that, Boris Fedorov gave an exclusive interview 
to IZVESTIYA and INTERFAX correspondents. But first of all he 
suggested that we study the statement he had formulated as soon 
as he arrived back from the Kremlin. 
  "My position (refusal to join the government) has nothing to 
do with personal reasons," the document says. "It cannot be 
right to include in the cabinet or to retain in their previous 
jobs people who have caused colossal economic and political 
damage to the state, people who are the main and overt opponents 
of the reforms policy. I cannot agree with the policy 
turnaround which was recently formulated by the premier and is 
being implemented in practice. This includes the refusal to 
combat inflation; the intention to increase emission by at least 
60 percent in relation to the plan in the first quarter alone; 
and the predominance in the cabinet of the lifeless and ignorant 
ideology of the State Planning Committee and the red economic 
managers. `Ukrainianization' has crossed the Russian border. 
  "At the same time it is still not too late to halt the 
slide. 
I appeal to the president: Boris Nikolayevich! An economic 
coup is taking place in the country, a backward slide, you are 
our only hope. The issue here is not just Fedorov, who is 
always ready to return and fight for Russian interests to the 
bitter end; the issue is the future of the country which is 
being decided right now, as we speak. At the same time nobody, 
I hope, has any illusions that the economy is separate from 
politics." 
  [Kononenko] Boris Grigoryevich, how did your meeting with 
the president go? 
  [Fedorov] The president confirmed his offer of the post of 
finance minister, saying that he trusts me and has no complaints 
about my performance, and stressing that the formation of a 
government is a lengthy process and nobody in the government 
lasts forever, including Gerashchenko. But since the terms for 
joining the government were the same as before, I refused, 
saying that I could not work with political enemies. 
  [Kononenko] Who do you mean? 
  [Fedorov] Gerashchenko primarily. I am not particularly 
concerned about Zaveryukha. He is just the kolkhoz lobby's 
spokesman. The main reason for my refusing a portfolio in the 
government as it presently stands is that I did not have 
sufficient powers to implement my financial policy. The 
president disagreed with my arguments, saying: "Do not drift 
away." I do not intend to drift away. I will not leave the 
country. I will work in the State Duma. 
  [Kononenko] What is your opinion -- why did the expected 
compromise over your appointment not materialize? 
  [Fedorov] As premier, V. Chernomyrdin is entitled to form 
his team. And all the indications are that the president has 
not foisted his will on him. I have not spoken with the premier 
since last Saturday [22 January]. 
  [Kononenko] So V. Chernomyrdin needs V. Gerashchenko more 
than he needs B. Fedorov? 
  [Fedorov] It would seem so. And this shows that an economic 
coup is taking place in the country. 
  [Kononenko] In your view, where is all this leading? 
  [Fedorov] All government statements forecast inflation. 
This will mean a fall in the population's living standards. At 
a time when such enormous rates of inflation are already being 
forecast, there is no way production will pick up. Without a 
doubt, isolationism will gather strength and attempts to peg the 
ruble exchange rate to other foreign currencies will get 
nowhere. The present government has far fewer administrative 
levers that former Premier Ryzhkov had at his disposal. We will 
see the bitter fruits for real in May or June, and social 
tension will increase sharply by the fall. 
  [Kononenko] Is it possible that V. Shcherbakov will fill the 
finance minister's post? 
  [Fedorov] I believe this will be ruled out since he is not a 
financier. He does not have his own program. I think they will 
opt for the gentler scenario of appointing S. Dubinin, my first 
deputy. 
  If I am elected to any organ in the State Duma, I will work 
there, but generally speaking we need a "shadow cabinet of 
ministers" which will monitor the government's actions and put 
forward its own ideas for resolving state problems. Of course, 
the economy cannot be extricated from crisis by financial policy 
alone, long-term work in other spheres also needs to be done. 
But in order for this to happen, we need a new Cabinet of 
Ministers since the present government is amorphous and has been 
unable to refrain from ruining the budget, B. Fedorov stressed 
in conclusion.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at 
1420 GMT on 26 January in the "Panorama" program carries a 
report on reactions to the resignation of Russian Federation 
Finance Minister Boris Fedorov. 
  Petr Filipov, head of the Russian Federation president's 
social policy analysis center, says that irrespective of various 
reform pledges made by Viktor Chernomyrdin and his deputy 
Soskovets, what counts is their financial policy. He believes 
that they will abandon Fedorov's strict controls over credits 
and reintroduce subsidies to unprofitable industry to appease 
voters. In his words, "the resignation of Finance Minister 
Boris Fedorov from the Russian Government will undoubtedly 
complicate our advancement along the path of economic reforms." 
  Economist Pavel Bunich believes that the government decided 
to change the course of reforms even before Fedorov's 
resignation and thinks that some degree of adjustment is indeed 
necessary. However, he voices concern that the government's 
determination to change the course of reforms may go too far. 
He believes that too many old-timers who were in positions of 
authority during Ryzhkov's and Pavlov's time are surrounding the 
government and there is a danger that they could try to reverse 
the reforms.

  [Text] Vladimir Shumeyko, the Chairman of the Federation 
Council, the upper house of the Russian parliament, said the 
election of the new legislature and the reorganization of the 
government had strengthened the president's positions. 
  He said to reporters on Wednesday that Yegor Gaydar's 
resignation as first deputy premier had not ended his political 
career. "We'll see him working in the Russian government some 
time in the future," Shumeyko said. 
  He rejected the suggestion that Gaydar's resignation meant 
an 
end to the economic reforms. "Only Gaydar, Fedorov and Shumeyko 
have left the government," the rest of its members remaining in 
office, Shumeyko said. 
  He said the recent reorganization had made the government 
more compact and potentially more efficient. "I hope this 
government stays in office until the new presidential election, 
prior to which it has to resign under the Constitution," he 
said. 
  He did not rule out that the Russia's Choice bloc, headed by 
Gaydar, would come to be in opposition to the Chernomyrdin 
government. But this would only be clear after the government 
approved proposed amendments to its economic policy, he said. 
  Shumeyko said the resignation of Gaydar and Fedorov would 
not 
affect Russia's relations with its Western partners. But Russia 
is "a powerful sovereign state, which will not allow anyone to 
lecture it," he said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 26 January -- Vladimir Shumeyko, Chairman of 
the Federation Council of the Russian Federation Federal 
Assembly, sees nothing dramatic in the changes in the 
composition of the government and believes that they will not 
affect the course of radical reforms. He told journalists this 
today. 
  One should not speak about a "new cabinet", Vladimir 
Shumeyko 
believes. "It's the same government, only minus Gaydar, Fedorov, 
and Shumeyko", he said. As a result of the reshuffle, the 
government "has become more compact and has started to address 
more the tasks facing the executive," and "presidential power 
has become more solid," Shumeyko is convinced. 
  He categorically denies that the new composition of the 
cabinet is the outcome of a difficult compromise between the 
government, which favours a continuation of the radical reforms, 
and the premier, who is insisting on a correction of the course. 
"All the radical reforms have been set out in the government's 
plan of action for 1993-1995. It was adopted jointly with the 
president and all the corrections of the course were fully 
agreed with him". 
  An extended session of the government will take place in 
February, which will be attended by the president and the heads 
of administration, of executive power, and the components of the 
Federation, which will sum up the results of 1993 and discuss 
tasks for this year. Some kind of correction of the course is 
inevitable at this session, Shumeyko said. But "no one intends 
to tamper with the reforms based on the removal from or arrival 
of anyone into the government." 
  The speaker of the upper chamber believes the government's 
first task at the present stage to be measures to support the 
country's producers. "The commodity market is 75 percent full, 
and one must talk about developing our industry and our 
agriculture, and it is here where the main corrections of the 
cabinet's moves must be". 
  Regarding the work of parliament, Vladimir Shumeyko noted 
that at the moment there was nothing to indicate that there 
would not be any cooperation between the two chambers or that 
the work of the State Duma would not be constructive. He 
reaffirmed that the Federation Council, according to the 
Constitution, has legislative initiative and may in extreme 
cases adopt laws independently. "Nevertheless, we must avoid 
such extremes", he added. 
  The speaker said that one of the main issues facing the 
parliamentarians was the adoption of the Russian state budget 
for 1994. 
  Next Monday the session of the Federation Council plans to 
discuss the question of the Russian socio-economic situation and 
Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin will present a report. "Such 
preliminary counsel with the members of the Federation Council 
will, I believe, influence the type of budget which the 
government will present to the Duma, and we will be able to 
adopt it much quicker".

  [Text] The Russian Government will continue to pursue a 
course of reforms, says Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha. According to him, the replacement of individual 
members of the Cabinet of Ministers does not in any way signify 
a replacement of government policy, because it is determined 
personally by President Boris Yeltsin. Replying to a question 
from journalists on whether the present composition of the 
government was a coalition one, the deputy prime minister 
confirmed this. At the same time, he pointed out that 
previously, too, there were differing points of view on topical 
problems among members of the government, but nevertheless they 
succeeded in working out a common line. Aleksandr Zaveryukha 
gave it to be understood that the government reshuffle had been 
necessary after the recent Federal Assembly elections at which a 
considerable proportion of the electorate had come out against 
the shock therapy methods and had voted for representatives of 
the opposition.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yegor Timurovich Gaydar by unidentified </F>
correspondent; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] What is your forecast for the 
economic development of the country for, at any rate, the next 
six months? 
  [Gaydar] I do not think that the newly formed government 
will 
be so unwise as to completely destabilize the financial and 
monetary situation over the next few months. Therefore, I do 
not fear an imminent economic catastrophe with hyperinflation 
and collapse of the levers of market control of the economy. I 
know my colleagues to be quite cautious people and I think that 
they are now to a very great extent concerned not to allow 
events to develop in that way. 
  But there is something else which I greatly fear. I fear 
constant fluctuations in economic policy, the adoption of 
contradictory decisions, the government undertaking financial 
obligations, under the influence of various lobbying structures, 
which will prove to be impractical, the constant creation of 
financial crises, and rates of inflation rising and slightly 
falling around a level of 20-25 percent per month. That is, to 
put it briefly, the reappearance of that situation which is 
neither one thing nor the other in which market instruments are 
not totally destroyed but cannot work in a way conducive to 
economic development -- the preservation of that extremely 
unpleasant and unstable situation between a normal planned 
economy and a normal stable market economy which continues to 
exist in Russia and which costs us dear in social and economic 
terms. 
  [Correspondent] Yegor Timurovich, these fluctuations which 
are indeed very tiring and annoying to the population have 
existed for a long time, for many months. They existed when you 
were in the government, also. Why have you decided to depart, 
so definitely to depart, precisely now? 
  [Gaydar] Indeed, the policy which has been conducted in 
Russia was rather integrated and consistent during the first 
half of 1992, the first half-year of the work of our government. 
Afterwards the policy was always a compromise one, it was 
always formed under the influence of various groups, and we 
continued to conduct this policy, among other reasons because we 
wanted to make the changes irreversible, we wanted to move 
market regulation forwards as far as possible into the tissue of 
Russia's real economic life. 
  Over the past year and a half in the work of the government 
and the organs of Russian power there was a fight between two 
different tendencies. On the surface it was manifested as a 
combat between inflationists and supporters of financial 
stabilization, between those who considered that the main thing 
was to halt the rise in prices and those who believed that it is 
possible in some way to raise the volume of production when 
there is galloping inflation. 
  But I think that the main thing was something else, the 
question of the role of the state in Russian society. Our 
policy has always been oriented towards an economical, small, 
modest state where officials are few, where they do not enjoy 
too many rights as far as personal allocation of resources is 
concerned, and where their work is strictly supervised by the 
law. Another line envisaged a large, plentiful state which 
interferes extensively in economic life, where officials have 
broad opportunities to take personal decisions -- for example, 
to grant credits on preferential terms, subsidies, quotas, 
licenses -- in a word, to do things at their discretion. We 
allocate enormous credits on preferential terms to agriculture, 
we spend crazy amounts of money -- even now, after preferential 
crediting has been abolished -- on subsidizing interest payments 
for the credits granted in 1993, and in the meantime this money 
goes to a large extent, not into agriculture but to the currency 
exchange, on hard currency speculation. This is what it is all 
about. 
  Well, it recently became clear to me lately that we cannot 
consistently defend our viewpoint any longer -- for instance, 
decisions such as that on the construction of a parliamentary 
center worth sums of money simply incomparable with the amounts 
allocated to many of the most important branches of the economy 
-- with this money we could solve the problem of the dumping of 
liquid radioactive waste into the Pacific Ocean 20 times over; 
or take the decision on setting up the ruble zone with Belarus 
-- this is a manifestation of the policy chosen, of a certain 
turn in economic policy. The blueprints for a large, plentiful, 
and expensive state have already been clearly laid out. This is 
unacceptable to me on principle, I simply do not think that this 
is for the good of Russia; therefore, I had to leave. 
  [Correspondent] Yegor Timurovich, if we are talking in terms 
of huge amounts of money spent on preferential credits and so 
on, does this not turn out to be one of the main sources of 
inflation, and not at all of developing production etc? 
  [Gaydar] Of course, preferential credits were one of the 
major sources of inflation in 1992-93. 
  The money that we allocated to these needs cannot really be 
compared with much else. There's nothing in Russia with which 
to compare it, apart from defense expenditure. 
  [Correspondent] But Viktor Stepanovich [Chernomyrdin] has 
just said that there will be no more handouts and that easy 
credit will be ended. As far as I know, it was ended precisely 
when you came into the government in September. 
  [Gaydar] That's quite right. 
  [Interviewer] Right, so there will be no more easy handouts, 
and so on. Admittedly, it is necessary to return debts to the 
agro-industrial and military-industrial complex and elsewhere, 
and, at the same time, it is necessary to boost production. Is 
it realistic to combine these aims? 
  [Gaydar] Well, it seems to me that it's extremely hard to 
do. 
The problem of the state's debts is primarily a problem of 
inability to precisely match up one's possibilities and 
requirements. When people talk of economic romanticism or 
financial romanticism, that's a rather strange term to me. 
After all, if romanticism is a clear-cut desire to live 
according to one's means, then apracticism [apraktitsizm] is the 
wish to handle non-existent money. So this somewhat alters my 
traditional approach to the use of these terms. Perhaps you will 
excuse me for making use of a character who is traditional in 
Russian culture. Professor Preobrazhenskiy [a character in 
Bulgakov's play "A Dog's Heart"] used to point out that, if one 
regularly missed the toilet, the toilet would be a shambles. A 
financial shambles is simply the result of the constant adoption 
of decisions that are not backed by real sources of finance. 
Until such decisions are taken by the government and 
legislative bodies, we will still have a shambles in Russian 
finances, our ruble will be weak, and the state will constantly 
seek to justify itself to one group after another for having 
debts. 
  [Correspondent] Yegor Timurovich, your decision to go is 
probably, nevertheless, a political decision first and foremost, 
and I think that it is also linked to the setback suffered in 
the elections by the Russia's Choice bloc that you lead. 
  [Gaydar] Undoubtedly. Of course, I must say honestly that 
the results of the elections on 12 December came as a very 
serious blow to me, because they put a question mark for me over 
the axiom that I have always taken as a starting point in my 
life and work. That is the axiom that we have a reasonable and 
rational people, full of common sense. I found it very hard to 
understand how my fellow citizens, men and women, could vote for 
a party that is preparing to send their children off to fight in 
Turkey and Iran. 
  On the other hand, one must understand the realities. Our 
country has passed through vast and very serious social changes, 
a cataclysm. The whole way of life is changing. It really is 
very hard. Nevertheless, after some thought, I came to the 
conclusion and conviction that this is only a short-term 
black-out of reason. 
  I am absolutely convinced that common sense is very deeply 
rooted in Russia and that it will be triumphant, that people 
really do not want wars or military adventures or new 
revolutions. They want a normal, calm life. They want a 
normal, calm life; they do want everyone to be turned into 
entrepreneurs; they do not need that. In a normal, calm life in 
a market economy, the overwhelming number of people simply work 
normally and calmly and live on their perfectly adequate wages. 
  Russian big business, including the new businesses, is 
essentially divided on questions of economic policy. This big 
business includes structures and people who have a stake in 
being closely linked with the state apparatus, who have a stake 
in decisions being taken by individuals, who have a stake in the 
allocation of advantageous resources in one form or another and 
of course who, categorically, have no interest in financial 
stabilization. 
  [Correspondent] Excuse me, Yegor Timurovich, advantageous 
decisions taken by individuals -- this is, simply speaking, when 
a specific person... 
  [Gaydar, interrupting] Simply speaking, this is when there 
is 
an official sitting at a table with a long line of people in 
front of him. People come to see him, and as a result he can 
sign a paper, a quota, for example. Such a quota is worth $5, 
10, or 15 million, and he decides who among these hundred people 
in the line gets 5 millions, who gets 7 million, who gets 10 
million, and who gets nothing. I think that there can be no 
situation more conducive to corruption. I cannot imagine any 
state apparatus set up without fear or reproach which will not 
take bribes in such a situation. 
  [Correspondent] I see. This is the part of business which 
you tried to wage war on. 
  [Gaydar] I did not try to wage war on it but I tried to wage 
war on behalf of a policy which rules out these forms of 
enrichment. But there is, of course, another side to Russian 
business. That is the side which is oriented toward the 
long-term aim, which well understands that such a form of 
business is a dead end, for the country at least, which in 
effect asks for one thing: Give us stable conditions in which 
to work, give us predictable and comprehensible rates of 
inflation, give us a firm ruble, give us taxes which are not 
probitively high -- and these prohibitively high taxes are a 
direct result of the state's handing out so much on an 
individual basis -- and in general we will cope with our 
problems, ourselves. That is the side of Russian business which 
in my view supports the wise policy which is the only possible 
policy for Russia if we really want to bring our country out 
onto a normal path of development. 
  [Correspondent] It is difficult to imagine a party which 
would go into the elections with a program that declared: We 
are creating a state in which bureaucrats allocate vast 
favorable credits for commercial banks under the pretext of 
supporting production. Usually the program looks different and, 
as far as I know, it is always other words which are used, words 
about national greatness, about the renaissance of the Soviet 
Union and so on. That is, the more, let us say, complicated the 
real policies and the real interests behind it are, the finer 
the slogans sound. As far as I know you had virtually no such 
fine slogans during the election campaign. 
  [Gaydar] You are right. Usually, such a policy proposing the 
strict combination of interests of corrupt officialdom and parts 
of the domestic bourgeoisie uses as a cover slogans of national 
greatness or national imperial slogans. If internal policy is 
impossible to defend, in frank talk, in frank discussion, they 
always try to sway people with the chimera of imperial 
greatness, and as far as the chimera of imperial greatness is 
concerned, it is quite a simple matter; it should be remembered 
that the Soviet Union collapsed when the monetary system 
collapsed, when the Soviet ruble began to be worthless. Ukraine 
ran away from it, everybody ran away from it. And as soon as, 
with all the inconsistency of our policy, the ruble became 
convertible, as soon as signs of stability arose, they reached 
out to Russia, lines formed of those wanting to deal with us, 
wanting to create a common economic space, and attitudes to 
integration with Russia changed immediately and radically. 
Unfortunately, defeat in the elections on 12 December 
objectively stopped us from resolving these tasks. In the end, 
we lost the battle but I am convinced that we will win the war.

  [Text] It has already been reported that Valeriy Zorkin has 
resumed his duties as a Constitutional Court judge. Yelena 
Sandomirskaya reports: 
  [Sandomirskaya] According to Valeriy Dmitriyevich himself, 
he 
did not stop his work in the Constitutional Court, as he regards 
the decision on his forcible removal as unjust and legally 
incorrect, which is, I would like to note, not the same thing. 
But all this is in the past. Today Judge Valeriy Zorkin has 
new problems: to draw up a draft law on the Constitutional 
Court and to elect its chairman. As to the new Russian 
constitution, Valeriy Zorkin said that he has always criticized 
it. But because it is considered to have been adopted, there is 
nothing else to do but to protect the new main law. Valeriy 
Zorkin said that being a judge who always respects the law, he 
will guard any other constitution. I hope that the defense 
process will be held within the court and not far outside its 
framework -- this is what Judge Valeriy Zorkin promised.

<F P=106> [Report on joint news conference by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, </F>
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and Gerhard 
Frey, leader of the German People's Union by correspondent R. 
Safronov; place and date not given; from the "Vesti" newscast -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Safronov] Today, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and his 
German friend, Gerhard Frey, leader of the German People's Union 
[Deutsche Volksunion], held a joint news conference. 
  Both talked of their attachment to German-Russian 
friendship. 
Frey reproved a number of German journalists who write 
disrespectfully about the future Russian president. 
Zhirinovskiy predicted the emergence of a Moscow-Berlin axis 
and added Delhi -- evidently in connection with [his book]: "The 
Last Push South." 
  In his words, the present government would fall in the 
autumn 
without having solved a single problem and then the president 
himself would invite him to Zavidovo and would entrust him with 
the mandate to form a government. At the very worst, he was 
ready to head one of the power ministries or the Foreign 
Ministry. 
  In three months, according to him, the government of the 
single unblemished party -- the Liberal Democratic Party -- 
would root out 5,000 armed gangs, put an end to military 
conversion, and completely cut off neighboring republics. 
Zhirinovskiy denied that criminal proceedings had been 
instigated against him, accusing him of propagating war in 
connection with his book "The Last Push South." He stressed 
that everything would occur without a single shot being fired. 
First, Russia would withdraw its troops from the south and then 
the peoples there, beset by conflict, would ask to be put under 
Russian dominion. 
  As for his coming visit to Europe, Zhirinovskiy said that he 
was interested in the present and that was why he did not plan 
to visit Auschwitz and Dachau. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I am only in the capital for a few hours -- 
Ljubljana, Belgrade, Warsaw -- and millions of people are 
standing there shouting: Russia, Russians, we are behind you. 
They kiss my hand, throw flowers at my feet, and I have 
difficulty escaping back to Moscow. 
  [Safronov] In characteristic form, Zhirinovskiy promised a 
permanent tundra residence permit for journalists who slandered 
him.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by Liberal Democratic Party </F>
leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, by correspondent Anna Prokhorova; 
including recorded excerpts from news conference; From the 
"Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] Today the procurator general's office instituted 
criminal proceedings against Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. 
Zhirinovkisy, State Duma deputy and leader of the LDPR [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia], who was to go to Yugoslavia, held a 
news conference in Moscow today. 
  [Correspondent Anna Prokhorova] Journalists were interested 
most of all in Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's attitude to the fact that 
the procurator general has instituted criminal proceedings 
according to clause 71 of the Russian criminal code, that is, 
war propaganda. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I have been telling you for an hour -- no 
violence, not a single shot, and the same is true for all my 
speeches. I have already said that if there are people with 
sick minds who claim that my speeches or books contain some kind 
of call for war, they should be examined by a psychiatrist. 
  [Prokhorova] Asked whether the LDPR was set up with money 
received from the Communist Party or the KGB, Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy said that greedy communists did not give him money 
and.... 
  [Zhirinovskiy] If the State Security Committee had helped 
me, 
I would not be sitting here now but in the Kremlin. This was 
their downfall precisely -- they did not admit people like 
myself while they themselves withered away, went into decay, and 
the country and the economy collapsed together with them. 
  [Prokhorova] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said that his party 
favors 
stopping aid to any regions outside Russia, immediately stopping 
conversion, and hitting at crime. The LDP is prepared to take 
part in forming the government but.... 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I would like very much if Kozyrev, Chubays, 
Shokhin, and Fedorov would leave the government. They are in 
the process of leaving it. I think, they all will have left by 
May. But those who will replace them will not be able to 
extricate Russia from the crisis, either. We ourselves will 
form the government in autumn and normal positive development in 
the country will start. 
  [Prokhorova] On 28 January Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will fly to 
Belgrade. He is visiting Serbia in order to try and help his 
blood brothers.

<F P=106> [Konstantin Popov report under the "Press Conference" </F>
rubric: "V.V. Zh. Looks Closer at Tundra"] 
  [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is true to himself. As soon 
as journalists switched their attention to Yegor Gaydar 
following his unexpected resignation, Zhirinovskiy immediately 
tried to regain the initiative. He has succeeded in doing so to 
a certain extent -- there was no room to swing a cat, as the 
saying goes, at the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] 
chief's news conference yesterday. 
  Those who expected yet more scandalous statements from the 
LDPR leader, however, were clearly disappointed. Neither 
Zhirinovskiy, nor Gerhard Frey, leader of the German National 
Union [GNU], said anything new; they only spoke over and over 
again about the interparty cooperation between the LDPR and the 
GNU and the prospects for friendly relations between the Russian 
Federation and the FRG. Zhirinovskiy even expressed his hope 
that in the near future a new 
Berlin-Koenigsberg-Moscow-Urals-Khabarovsk-Vladivostok highway 
will make it possible to transport peaceful freight from Japan 
to Germany. Russia will benefit from that and will become a 
great power once again. V.V. Zh. also dreams about Russian 
becoming Germany's second language. 
  With regard to domestic policy, Zhirinovskiy promised that 
as 
soon as next fall he would form his one-party government (the 
current one, he said, will break up soon), which will lead the 
country along a special path and will be able to lift Russia out 
of the crisis. 
  As a matter of fact, Zhirinovskiy dismissed all charges 
regarding the propaganda of war: "The prosecutor's office has 
not brought and will never bring charges against me," he said, 
"Whereas my book, "The Last Dash to the South" will soon become 
a mandatory textbook for all higher educational establishments 
of the country." As for V.V. Zh.'s next masterpiece, it will be 
entitled "Last Train Car to the North; Last Stop, Taymyr; 
Residence Permit, the Tundra." The hint is ambiguous: either 
Zhirinovskiy is going to send all his ill-wishers to Siberia, or 
he plans to obtain a residence permit in the tundra himself. 
Under a court ruling, one may assume. 
  For the time being, however, Zhirinovskiy "has to leave for 
a 
number of Balkan countries for a couple of days and to address a 
2- million-strong rally in Belgrade." On his way back, V.V. Zh. 
plans to spend a few hours in Warsaw.

<F P=106> ["Extracts" of interview with Russian Liberal Democratic </F>
Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy by Rolf Gauffin; date, place 
not given: "Prague? Let Us Give It to Germany"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Gauffin] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, in 
your book, "The Last Drive South," are you describing a security 
system or a new Russian empire? What would you prefer for the 
Baltic states, the Caucasus, and Central Asia -- a Russian 
military presence or annexation? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Events in the Transcaucasus show that, 
without 
Russia, those peoples will always fight each other -- Armenia 
against Azerbaijan, Georgia against Abkhazia, Ossetia, and so 
forth. This will happen everywhere along Russia's southern 
borders -- Uzbeks, Kazakhs, and Tajiks will fight each other. 
But I say that there will not be a Russian military presence in 
these areas. All we can do is sell weapons. If they want to 
buy them, they can do so only in Russia. 
  [Gauffin] Are you not afraid that Russia risks a 
multiplication of situations such as that in Afghanistan? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Have you ever wondered what Afghanistan is 
like now? It is a country without a government, where one gang 
fights another, where one city fights another. This is the 
future of Central Asia. After 30-40 years the roads in those 
lands will be in ruins, there will be no energy, transport will 
have ground to a halt, and hospitals will not function. The 
entire region will plunge into the abyss. Then Iran and Turkey 
will intervene. It will be hell. Then, after a further 20-30 
years, they will plead with Russia to return to guarantee 
stability. This, especially with regard to the psychological 
factor. 
  [Gauffin] So what do you intend to do? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] From Moscow we can force those small nations 
to stop fighting. Since they are aware of the strength of 
Russia's industry and Armed Forces, they must stop the 
destruction. Together with the international community, they 
will ask us for help. We will examine the possibility of 
halting the disaster, but only if they pay us. Otherwise, we 
will leave those regions to slide downhill, as is now happening 
in the Transcaucasus and Tajikistan. 
  [Gauffin] How far would you go in defending the Russian 
minorities living in the former Soviet states -- Estonia, for 
instance? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] First, all Russians living outside their 
homeland must be granted dual nationality. Then we will defend 
them, mainly by means of economic instruments. For instance, if 
the Russians were forced to leave the Baltic states and were 
thus to lose their property, then the value of their lost assets 
will be included in the price of the goods that we sell to those 
states. 
  [Gauffin] Do you really believe that you can implement such 
a 
policy to defend Russians living outside their homeland? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes. Let us take Estonia as an example. If 
the Russians do not obtain the right to vote in that country, we 
will implement an economic blockade. And without Russia's 
sources of energy and infrastructures, Estonia will be 
completely annihilated as a state. This is why we will never 
use military force, but will use the force of law and the 
economy, instead, to protect Russians' interests. 
  [Gauffin] In an interview published by NAZIONALZEITUNG -- 
one 
of the German neo-Nazi organs -- you said that the Oder-Neisse 
line, the present border between Poland and Germany, is not 
history's final word. Could you describe what you consider the 
legitimate borders in the center of our continent? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Let us start with Estonia. There are Russians 
living there. This territory must therefore be included within 
Russia's borders. Estonia must be assigned to the Leningrad 
District. But Tallinn, the country's present capital, should 
remain a kind of city republic, like Luxembourg, Monaco, or 
Liechtenstein. The rest of Estonian territory belongs to Russia. 
  [Gauffin] Carry on, Mr. Zhirinovskiy... 
  [Zhirinovskiy] In Latvia over half the population is 
Russian. 
In Riga only 35 percent of the population are Latvians. So the 
whole of Latvia must go to Russia. 
  [Gauffin] What else? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Lithuania, with its capital, Kaunas 
(Lithuania's present capital is Vilnius; Kaunas was the 
country's capital until World War II -- L'ESPRESSO editor's 
note), and with the cities of Panevezys and Siauliai, will form 
a small Lithuanian State. All the rest is Russia's. 
  [Gauffin] What should be done with Koeningsberg 
[Kaliningrad], [philosopher] Immanuel Kant's home town? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Koeningsberg is part of Russia. Some day we 
may return it to Germany. We would like to give back to the 
West whatever the West wants. 
  [Gauffin] Where should Poland be situated? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Gdansk, Wroclaw, and Sczeczin, which used to 
be part of Prussia, belong to Germany. And if Poland wants Lvov 
(now in Ukraine, but in Poland until 1939 -- L'ESPRESSO editor's 
note), we may even accept its request. This, to compensate the 
Poles for its losses. It will be Russia's gift to the West. 
But eastern Ukraine is entirely Russia's. The same applies to 
Moldova and Belarus. 
  [Gauffin] Let us consider Slovakia... 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Some day, perhaps, Slovakia will want to 
become part of Russia. The Czech Republic, however, will go to 
Germany. Austria and little Slovenia should unite. The future 
Germany-Austria-Slovenia will have to have access to the 
Adriatic. This is the German people's will. Thus the Germans 
will have well-founded historical borders to the east and south. 
  [Gauffin] Let us return for a moment to the countries that 
are currently part of the CIS. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Our problem lies to the south. Throughout its 
history Kazakhstan has never had a role as an independent state. 
The whole of Kazakhstan is nothing but southern Siberia. 
Alma-Ata used to be called Vernyy (which means "loyal" in 
Russian), never Almaty (which means "father of the apple" in 
Kazakh), its present official name. 
  [Gauffin] What would you do with other neighboring Asian 
countries? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Kyrgyzstan, which used to belong to China, 
must go to Russia. There has never existed a state called 
"Kyrgyzstan." As for the rest, there are no problems of any kind 
with Mongolia, China, Japan, and India. 
  [Gauffin] In conclusion, Mr. Zhirinovskiy, are you aiming to 
create a Russian-German axis, a continental axis to set against 
NATO's influence? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Let me explain to you how I see the future. 
Some day there will be a greater Germany and a new Russia, 
which will reach an agreement with India. India has 1 billion 
inhabitants. We have 300 million. So, together with Germany 
and India, we would total more or less 2 billion people. Then 
the world will take whatever form we want. India and Russia 
together will neutralize China in Asia. With Germany, Russia 
can neutralize Europe.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Pelts report: "The Case of the State Committee </F>
for the State of Emergency: It Was Planned To `Instill Order'"] 
  [Text] Let us recall what feelings were aroused in us all 
by the tanks and armored personnel carriers which appeared in 
the capital 19 August 1991. This was the first time, and it 
shook us and aroused bewilderment and anger. 
  Yes, everything was different then. People, ordinary 
residents of the capital, seemed prepared to lie down under the 
caterpillar tracks. No less bewildered, officers and soldiers 
looked at them and heard the words "Shame!" and "Fascists!" 
addressed to themselves for the first time. 
  It was a dirty business -- to make the Army clash with the 
people, whom it is called upon to protect. But the court, which 
is continuing the interrogation of Marshal Dmitriy Yazov, former 
USSR minister of defense, is not in the business of emotions, as 
the saying goes. 
  The second consecutive session was devoted to ascertaining 
the actions of undoubtedly one of the key figures in the State 
Committee for the State of Emergency -- the former USSR defense 
minister. The nature of the state prosecution's questions 
attests that the prosecutors are seeking to determine the 
precise degree of guilt of each of the accused. Therefore, 
literally all actions, including those before the start of the 
dramatic events of 19 August, are being worked out in detail. 
  As is known, before the start of the interrogation Dmitriy 
Yazov himself gave a brief account of the history of the sending 
of troops into the capital and even put a figure on their 
numerical strength. But many specific questions are arising in 
the course of the interrogation concerning the nature of the 
servicemen's actions and also the tasks which the troops were to 
have been set subsequently. 
  One thing is clear: At that time the chief gamble was made 
on the Army. It was planned to "instill order" precisely with 
its help. But the rapidly changing situation, the Muscovites' 
determination, and the obvious dissension among the members of 
the State Committee for the State of Emergency themselves 
prevented those plans from being realized. 
  The interrogation of the former defense minister will most 
likely continue at the next session of the Russian Federation 
Supreme Court's Military Collegium.

  [Text] Former Soviet Defense Minister Dmitriy Yazov has 
denied accusations of his involvement in the death of three 
persons during the August 1991 putsch. At the court hearings in 
Moscow Wednesday he said that soldiers had to shoot only under 
extreme conditions. He said that in line with the military 
regulations servicemen have the right to use fire arms in case 
of an attack on a patrol. 
  Yazov said that the eight armored personnel carriers that 
moved along the Garden Ring were patrol vehicles and soldiers 
inside them were forced to open fire when they faced danger to 
their lives. 
  The ex-minister said that as a result of the investigation 
into the murder of three persons, experts found no corpus 
delicti in the actions of servicemen of the Taman Division who 
were involved in the incident. 
  The court hearings will continue January 27 at 10 a.m.

  [Text] Moscow January 25 TASS -- Boris Yeltsin puts 
finishing touches to a book which is to be published in France 
in April this year, Viktor Ilyushin, top aide of the Russian 
president, told ITAR-TASS on Wednesday. 
  "The main section of the book deals with the president's 
comprehension of the 1991 events when Yeltsin assumed office. 
The author sets out his point of view on the political 
processes evolving in Russia since then, and shares with future 
readers his keen feeling for the country's future", Ilyushin 
said. 
  The book which has about 500 pages has no working title yet. 
"No one has read the book so far," Ilyushin said, adding that he 
does not know who helped the president prepare the manuscript 
for publication. 
  Asked whether people in Russia will be able to read the 
president's reminiscences, the aide answered in the affirmative.

  [Text] Moscow January 26 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin appointed Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov, former CIS Armed Forces 
commander, his representative in the state company for arms 
exports-imports, Rosvooruzheniye. 
  The company was set up on November 25 1993 to handle arms 
exports-imports, including weapons, military hardware, 
equipment, double-purpose technologies and strategic raw 
materials. Additionally, it uses its own funds and borrowed 
means to invest in the defence industry. The company has been 
established to protect Russia's state interests while 
determining contract prices for arms exports and control hard 
currency revenues from such deals. 
  Rosvooruzheniye plans to set up maintenance bases and 
training centers for specialists to transfer relations with 
partners purchasing Russian arms and military hardware on a 
long-term basis. The company has been allowed to set up branches 
and offices inside and outside of Russia, including with the 
participation of foreign capital. At present it has branches in 
38 countries and cooperates with 60 countries.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Ryabov article: "Show Flops. A.V. Rutskoy's </F>
Name Defended in `Trust Case'"] 
  [Excerpts] A brief report that Moscow City Prosecutor's 
Office passed a decree dropping the criminal case, brought on 
the basis of Russian Federation Security Council material, 
concerning former Vice President A.V. Rutskoy's involvement in 
financial transactions of the foreign firm Trade Links Ltd. and 
in its account at Zurich's Indosuez Bank was glimpsed fleetingly 
on the air and seemingly vanished forever in the zone of silence. 
  The reason is understandable. On the one hand it was awkward 
for journalist colleagues to refute their own recent pages-long 
"exposes" of Aleksandr Vladimirovich's involvement in certain 
alleged dealings with the firm's Swiss accounts. After weak and 
unconvincing attempts to "catch" Rutskoy constructing his own 
dacha, hints at his links with foreign currency accounts abroad 
seemed a much bigger scoop. The propaganda machine worked 
without respite during the August days. 
  From the very first salvoes of this attack it became clear 
that the battle against the vice president was being waged by a 
force much more powerful and influential than simple reporter's 
curiosity. Rutskoy "came under fire" from not only the 
president's apparatus but also the very highest echelons of 
behind-the-scenes world power. [passage omitted] 
  On the basis of all the material obtained the prosecutor's 
office deemed it necessary to drop the case against Rutskoy. 
  Rutskoy is now a prisoner at Lefortovo. Everything 
associated with his name in the month to six weeks before the 
tragic events is now apparently no longer of any great 
importance. But this seems so only to people like Makarov 
[former chief of the administration for supporting the 
commission for combating crime and corruption]. The Moscow City 
Prosecutor's Office decree says reassuringly: The name of 
Aleksandr Vladimirovich Rutskoy has been defended, albeit with a 
tragic delay. 
  While the criminal case brought on the basis of Russian 
Federation Security Council material has, quite naturally and 
normally from both the moral and legal points of view, provided 
grounds for bringing another criminal case -- for libeling the 
former vice president under Section 3, Article 130 of the RSFSR 
Criminal Code.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Natalya Chernyshova on interview </F>
with former Finance Minister Boris Fedorov and news conference 
given by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in Moscow on 26 
January, including recordings of Fedorov and Chernomyrdin 
remarks -- from the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Chernyshova] From being a headache of the national 
economy, Russia's agro-industrial complex turned into a 
political headache late in January. In any case, one of the 
reasons Boris Fedorov cited in explaining his reluctance to stay 
as finance minister was linked with subsidies for agriculture 
and Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha keeping his post. 
  [Fedorov] Why is our grain more expensive than in the world 
market? Who has run up grain-related debts? It is Mr. 
Zaveryukha, the government, and so on by fixing too high a 
price. They knew perfectly well that the budget did not have 
this money. But for me, what is not in the budget does not 
exist. 
  [Chernyshova] In addition, Boris Fedorov believes that he 
cannot stay in his post if, instead of the 80 percent inflation 
at the end of the year which he promised, 300 [percent] is 
offered today, while the issuing of 10 trillion rubles planned 
by the Finance Ministry for the first quarter is being replaced 
with 15 trillion by the prime minister. 
  [Fedorov] In any state, the finance minister is someone 
responsible for economic policy. When a situation takes shape 
that turns him into a cashier paying out money, I do not accept 
such a situation. 
  [Chernyshova] The former deputy prime minister cited all 
these arguments at the morning meeting with the president in the 
Kremlin, but found no understanding. 
  [Fedorov] He tried to persuade me, nevertheless, that there 
was no tragedy today, generally speaking, and that it was 
possible to go on working. I for one did not agree with this 
point. 
  [Chernyshova, addressing Fedorov] Why has not your 
resignation been accepted for such a long time? 
  [Fedorov] Neither the prime minister nor the president have 
ever complained to me about my performance. Many people are 
saying that there is a tendency to use individual reformers as a 
screen, a cover for changing the policy. 
  [Chernyshova] So Fedorov has been removed from work at his 
own request, removed or departied at a time difficult for the 
country. Some observers view the former minister's step as a 
position of principle, others as an escape from real 
difficulties. Many people, however, see this as a political 
[chess] castling and predict that both he and Gaydar will return 
but to an already new government. 
  The prime minister has invested our agriculture with 
political importance, too. He has just made a trip to Orel 
Oblast where he met with representatives of 18 central Russian 
oblasts which produce almost one-third of all agrarian output. 
They agreed on drafting a federal program for central Russia's 
revival which would require about 30 billion rubles. Also while 
there Viktor Chernomyrdin made a statement on an intent to 
return 4 trillion in the first quarter to pay back debts to the 
defense industry and the agrarian complex, something which, on 
the whole, showed the government's new tendencies. The prime 
minister stressed that this money should not be used for the 
needs of consumption, but who will be able to control this? At 
today's news conference which, in fact, was devoted to Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's visit to Italy, something transpired about 
domestic matters, too. 
  [Chernomyrdin] I am rather stingy and do not like to give 
out 
or pay back, therefore, if we are to go ahead with that, we will 
do this the way you mentioned. And the debts -- this relates 
especially to debts -- and the credits which should be given 
because credits should be used and enterprises will use credits 
-- today we demanded that a mechanism be developed. This 
relates to the military-industrial complex, defense enterprises, 
and the agrarian complex. We want clarifications to be tabled 
on how this money is going to be used and where it will go. 
  [Chernyshova] The prime minister laughed, or only pretended 
to laugh when asked about the agrarian deputy prime minister's 
request for 40 trillion rubles to support the efficiency of 
agriculture. 
  [Chernomyrdin] As regards Zaveryukha's statement, he said 
that it was meant by the year 2050, that was how he explained it 
yesterday. As regards claims that he asks for these 40 trillion 
immediately now, it is simply someone's wish to turn Zaveryukha 
into a scapegoat, someone would just love this. They heard one 
figure but do not care about what followed. 
  [Chernyshova] In the main the conversation with journalists 
followed the usual pattern. Viktor Chernomyrdin promised that 
this month inflation would be 22 percent; he categorically 
rejected conjectures about alterations to the reform policy and, 
for Italian journalists, spoke about Italian plans. We will 
have enough time to describe them to you when it starts.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Leontyev report in the "Resignation" column: "The </F>
Economic Coup Has Occurred," incorporating statement by former 
Finance Minister Boris Fedorov] 
  [Excerpts] After a talk with the president yesterday 
morning, Boris Fedorov made a final decision to decline the post 
of finance minister in Mr. Chernomyrdin's new government. The 
president either did not want to or could not accept Fedorov's 
tough terms. [passage omitted] 
  As a result, what has been expected actually happened: 
Fedorov resigned. The bitter struggle between the finance 
minister and the chairman of the Russian Central Bank ended with 
the latter's victory. Today Mr. Gerashchenko, enjoying bucolic 
delights in the company of the prime minister who has given him 
shelter, can settle his scores with Fedorov, who has really 
annoyed him, with relish. The paradox is that now Gerashchenko 
will have to bear the entire responsibility for the state of the 
monetary system. Meanwhile the current chairman of the Central 
Bank does not want to assume such responsibility. Selective 
support for the basic production sectors and the "nonmonetarist 
methods" of economic policy espoused by Mr. Gerashchenko are so 
popular in the new Cabinet today that there will be no place 
under the nonmonetarist sun left for the Central Bank chief. 
Gerashchenko is not so stupid or unprofessional not to 
understand the danger of this sweeping craze for similar ideas: 
Therefore there is no way that he can satiate the appetites of 
all the agro-industrial zaveryukhas [apparent pun: Zaveryukha, 
the last name of the non-reformist minister, sounding close to 
"zveryukha," meaning "(large) animal"]. Therefore the financial 
situation will be progressively, although perhaps not 
catastrophically, deteriorating while relations with his 
colleagues in the economic leadership will be cooling. [passage 
omitted] 
  Prime Minister Chernomyrdin is more than a pragmatist; 
generally, he is little interested in the long-term economic 
consequences of his current decisions. While being much more 
qualified, from the apparatus point of view, than most of the 
"reformers," the prime minister is at the same time profoundly 
and hopelessly illiterate economically. This does not allow him 
to make unpopular decisions without outside pressure because he 
is incapable of understanding or believing in the inevitability 
of a positive outcome. 
  Today a most serious danger is looming over the premier -- 
what has now become the traditional Russian "vice presidency 
syndrome." By virtue of his makeup and former experience, the 
incumbent prime minister is less than any others inclined to 
yield to emotions. Even so, the temptation of power has broken 
tougher men. Especially since Viktor Chernomyrdin has 
demonstrated his ability publicly to accentuate his independence 
from the president. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Statement by Boris Fedorov </H5>
  Boris Fedorov, who has resigned the post of finance 
minister, 
has announced the impermissibility of joining the Cabinet of 
Ministers or keeping in their posts "people who have caused 
colossal economic and political damage to the state and who are 
intransigent and open opponents of the reform policy." This is 
said in Mr. Fedorov's statement Wednesday after his meeting with 
Boris Yeltsin. 
  "I cannot agree with the turn of policy that has recently 
been formulated by the premier and is now being implemented in 
practice," Boris Fedorov stressed. "The triumph of the 
nonviable and illiterate ideology of Gosplan [State Planning 
Agency] and the red economic managers in the cabinet, in the 
context of the market economy, inevitably dooms the country to 
collapse and the people to falling living standards," he stated. 
  "There is no alternative to our policy, and we will soon be 
able to see this in practice. The turn away from the 
stabilization course means soaring inflation, the people's 
declining real incomes, the dollar rate surging to 10,000 rubles 
by the end of the year, the deprecation of savings, the 
beginning of a commodity shortage, increasing capital flight, 
and Russia's isolation from the world markets," Boris Fedorov 
stressed. "Moreover, there will be neither production growth, 
nor fresh capital inputs, nor ways to deal with the employment 
problem. The threat of a social explosion from theory becomes 
reality." 
  Boris Fedorov appealed to the president: "An economic coup 
is under way in the country -- a retreat. The only hope is you! 
What matters is not Fedorov, who is always ready to come back 
and defend Russia's interests to the end. What matters is the 
fate of the country, which is being decided in these days and 
these hours. I hope that no one has any illusions that 
economics can be separated from politics." 
  After his meeting with the president Boris Fedorov said in 
an 
interview with INTERFAX that "a team of red economic managers 
has come to power who know how to run large enterprises but do 
not know the meaning of macroeconomics." He thinks that the 
present government will be able to stay in office until fall 
1994 when strong manifestations of social discontent are 
possible.

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Popov article: "Puppeteers Required?..."] </F>
  [Text] So, Yegor Gaydar's departure from the government 
and Boris Fedorov's conjectured departure have been followed by 
the equally farcical "self-resignations" of the puppeteers. 
  Western radio stations have reported that the expert 
economists -- Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University and 
his Swedish colleague Anders Aslund -- have ostentatiously given 
up the posts of advisers to the Russian Government. 
  Several BBC programs have carried the farewell interview of 
probably the most famous of the monetarist puppeteers, with 
whose name the economic schemes of our own Russian "Chicago 
boys" were linked in the past. Jeffrey Sachs reported that he 
now deems it impossible to teach reason to the Russian 
authorities, which are ossified in antimarket dogmas, since with 
the departure of Gaydar and Fedorov it is no longer a government 
of reforms. 
  World news agencies have simultaneously disseminated a 
report 
that the Russian Government has decided to enlist as experts two 
economists from the entourage of USSR ex-President Gorbachev -- 
Nikolay Petrakov and Leonid Abalkin, who have already embarked 
on elaborating a "more moderate economic policy." 
  The change of scenery and prompters on the Russian political 
stage probably gives second wind to a popular anecdote from the 
times of perestroyka, which in its time was even heard from the 
rostrum of the Congress of People's Deputies. This amusing 
parable maintained that the U.S. president's 100 bodyguards 
included one who, to put it mildly, was insufficiently reliable, 
but the U.S. president did not, alas, know precisely which one. 
If the anecdote is to be believed, the French president, to 
whom, as to all other Frenchmen, rumor ascribes particularly 
ardent feelings for beautiful women, has somewhat similar 
problems: How is he to divine which of the 100 most charming 
ladies is infected with AIDS? But, according to the anecdote, 
the great reformer Gorbachev had the gravest thoughts: There 
are 100 expert economists in his entourage, and just one of them 
knows the path to market prosperity, but Gorbachev cannot guess 
precisely which one. 
  The events of recent years, however, even make us seriously 
doubt that the ex-president really did have even one expert 
seer! At any rate, the majority of his advisers gambled on the 
salutary and miracle-working self-regulating role of the market, 
which Gorbachev, although not an economist, had perfectly 
reasonable grounds to doubt -- back in 1989, with righteous 
irritation, he made the following comment on the prescription of 
Vasiliy Selyunin, also an economist, who has now become one of 
the leaders of "Russia's Choice": "He says that the market 
itself will put everything in place within a month.... I know 
just one thing: Within two weeks such a 'market' will bring the 
entire people out onto the streets and sweep aside any 
government, however much they swear loyalty to the people!" 
  The ex-president somewhat underestimated our people's 
legendary long-suffering, but the recent elections show 
perfectly well that the people's angry reaction will, in the 
final analysis, be precisely like that, sweeping aside the 
government. 
  As is known, the experts surrounding Gorbachev included 
exemplary, assiduous apprentices of Jeffrey Sachs. Grigoriy 
Yavlinskiy and Stanislav Shatalin did not promise the country 
market prosperity as quickly as Selyunin did, but nor did they 
defer it for too long -- just 500 days. That spirited program 
elicited caustic comments from world-renowned specialists. 
Hisao Kanamori, chairman of the Japanese Economic Research 
Center, called the scheme "an impossible dream, totally 
incompatible with the real state of affairs in the Soviet 
Union." In his conviction, "the very fact that this kind of 
program has been advanced proves that Soviet people do not know 
what a market economy is." 
  Four years ago, in the same interview with the KYODO News 
Agency, the leading Japanese economist also did not spare 
Petrakov and Abalkin, whose "moderate plan" for market 
transformations was ultimately approved by Gorbachev: Hisao 
Kanamori concluded that this program also did not contain "even 
short-term economic goals." Most of all the Japanese economist 
warned against the very "shock therapy" that was imposed on us 
in recent years. In response to the radical reformers' 
complaints that their plans had been "completely emasculated" he 
gave a truly prophetic warning: "...If the reforms had been 
implemented at such a fast pace, the muddle (in the Soviet 
economy) would have been still further exacerbated. The Soviets 
have no choice other than to advance gradually, implementing 
phased economic reforms." 
  In connection with the demarche of Yegor Gaydar and Boris 
Fedorov and then that of their foreign guides-advisers, the 
debate in the mass media over whether there was "shock therapy" 
in Russia has once again become lively. Jeffrey Sachs himself 
maintains that there was not. 
  Of course, everything is relative. Russians, who have been 
subjected to total impoverishment as a result of the "Gaydar 
reforms," must bear in mind that a yet harder fate would have 
awaited them if our Russian monetarists had paid still more 
attention to Jeffrey Sachs' promptings. The Russian economy, to 
use the figurative expression of WASHINGTON POST commentator Jim 
Hoagland, would have "floated belly up" much sooner. 
  The true aim of Jeffrey Sachs' prescriptions is precisely to 
turn Russia's economy "belly up." 
  An interesting analytical document has been disseminated by 
researchers at the well-known Schiller Institute. They neatly 
set out, as it were, the whole package of "obligatory 
recommendations" from the IMF and the Harvard school of 
monetarists. The scheme provides theoretically for a reduction 
in inflation and in the budget deficit to 5-10 percent a month, 
but the chief aim of the "reforms" is to open the borders to 
Western goods and to devalue the national currency in order to 
increase profitable (for the West!) exports of raw materials. 
The opening of the borders to Western capital investments and 
the closure of the majority of loss-making Russian enterprises 
are aimed at the same thing. "At the same time," the 
researchers state, "the nature of the reforms is not so 
important in itself (the only stipulation is for a reduction in 
the share of ownership). The chief thing is self-restriction 
and openness. But such a policy will lead in practice to the 
closure of almost all Russian enterprises and, accordingly, to a 
production slump, unemployment, and then also inflation." 
  So it makes sense to give the matter some serious thought: 
Will Russia gain a great deal if it approaches these "yawning 
market heights" not in one month or even 500 days but much later 
-- on the basis of "mild reforms" according to the latest 
recommendations of Petrakov and Abalkin?

commanders. The sorest point in the Russian Army -- discipline 
-- will be the concern of chiefs of organs for troops'

  [Text] The Moscow declaration on denuclearizing Ukraine 
signed by the presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and the United 
States does not meet the republic's interests in full, deputy 
head of the international affairs commission Bogdan Goryn told 
INTERFAX-Ukraine. 
  In his words, the Supreme Soviet is now discussing the 
points 
that are out of line with the country's national interests. 
  In the meantime, Goryn says it is up to a new parliament, to 
be elected on March 27, to consider the ratification of the 
Moscow declaration because of inability by the Supreme Soviet to 
take a measured resolution on the issue. He said the parliament 
would adopt a resolution, but with some strings attached. 
  Last November, the parliament ratified the Start-I agreement 
and the Lisbon protocol, but conditioned that to economic aid 
and security guarantees to Ukraine. The Lisbon protocol was 
ratified without its article 5 which provided for Kiev's 
adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as a nuclear 
free state. 
  President Kravchuk on Tuesday called on parliament to 
approve 
the protocol in full, arguing that the tripartite Moscow 
agreement met all of the parliament's stipulations for ratifying 
the paper. 
  However, Goryn said the President's statement "goes beyond 
the framework of the parliamentary resolution."

  [Text] Kiev, 26 Jan -- During a conversation with 
journalists, Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk said that he 
does not rule out an economic union with Russia in the near 
future. Mr. Landyk also gave a negative assessment of the role 
of the former government of Russia, blaming Gaydar and Fedorov 
for attempts to crush Ukraine economically. "Possibly, the new 
appointments will benefit Ukraine," he said. He also said that 
the government will continue to provide credit for agriculture, 
"because one can live if there is something to eat." In the 
opinion of Valentyn Landyk, the crediting of agriculture will 
not lead to a new emission of currency; the government will not 
allow that to happen. The money owed by commercial banks to the 
National Bank of Ukraine could become a source of credit. The 
problems of credit do not only depend on the government. We are 
holding talks toward that end with the National Bank of Ukraine, 
Landyk stated. For example, in the first quarter alone the Bank 
"Ukrayina" has to return 2.5 trillion coupons. The overall debt 
for the credits granted by the National Bank is [words 
indistinct]. The debtors are mostly banks and enterprises and, 
of course, the debts of the countryside which, in the opinion of 
Landyk, could be paid off with grain. The deputy prime minister 
said: "We are in favor of reform and liberalization; however, 
not everything should be `let go'. Regulation is still 
necessary."

  [Text] Kiev, 26 Jan -- At the ninth session of Ukraine's 
Supreme Council, deputies continued debating the issue of 
holding an all-Ukrainian referendum on the basic constitutional 
provisions: on the organizing of state power and self-government 
in Ukraine. People's deputy Leopold Taburyanskyy proposed to do 
everything possible to prevent the parliamentary and 
presidential elections from being held. 
  The issue of verifying the activities of the "Blasko" 
concern 
was put on the agenda. A draft resolution on this issue 
consisting of 10 points was distributed to deputies. According 
to Point 5 of the resolution, the Ministry of Finance and the 
Ministry of Justice have been instructed to draw up an inventory 
of all accounts, stocks of materials and capital equipment, and 
"Blasko's" credit and commercial agreements by 1 May. Point 7 
recommends that the Ukrainian president examine the issue of 
removing Transport Minister Klympush and "Blasko" chairman 
Kudyukin from their posts. 
  Eighty-one deputies voted in favor of holding an 
all-Ukrainian referendum. The Supreme Council resolved to 
instruct the standing commission for issues of legislation and 
legality and the commission for issues of the activity of local 
councils and local self-government, along with the participation 
of members of the constitutional commission, to prepare a draft 
document on the constitutional principles of organizing power in 
Ukraine and to submit it for the Supreme Council's consideration 
within two days. 
  Deputies examined a draft resolution on the state 
privatization program submitted by the commission for issues of 
economic reform and management of the national economy. No 
decision was taken on this draft. Deputies passed a Ukrainian 
law on introducing changes and additions to some legislative 
acts on questions of leasing relations: 
  1. to recognize that Articles 2 and 4 of the Cabinet of 
Ministers decree dated 15 January 1992 No. 9-92 "on the 
additional regulation of leasing relations" and Subclause "D" of 
Article 9 of the Cabinet of Ministers decree dated 20 May 1993 
"on privatizing whole property complexes of state enterprises 
and their structural subsections that are being leased, are not 
longer valid. 
  2. to supplement Article 21, Point 6, of the Ukrainian law 
on privatizing the property of state enterprises with the 
following: "part of the property that is being privatized at the 
expense of citizens' privatized funds cannot be less than 70 
percent of the value for any facility, regardless of the method 
of privatization, apart from facilities that are being 
privatized according to the established procedure for freely 
convertible currency. 3. The law comes into force from the 
date of publication. 
  Commenting on the adopted law, Viktor Pynzenyk said that 
this 
law in actual fact entails introduction of the collective farm 
system into Ukraine's economy and deputy Volodymyr Pylypchuk 
mentioned that the law creates both the financial and economic 
preconditions for the development of separatism in Ukraine.

  [Text] By a majority of 245 votes out of 440, the Ukrainian 
Supreme Soviet today approved the draft resolution "On the state 
program for privatization in 1994." Only 34 votes were cast 
against the program. 
  According to the program, a total of 20,000 small 
businesses, 
1,400 unfinished construction projects and 8,000 medium and 
major industries will be privatized in 1994. 
  As a result, Ukraine's private sector will amount to 
28% of 
the country's economy. The state will receive over 21 Tn 
[Trillion] karbovantsy and over $230 Mn. 
  The properties of state bodies, National Space Agency, TV 
and 
radio broadcasting centers, publishers' and port facilities are 
not subject to privatization. 
  The chairman of the state privatization fund, Vladimir 
Pryadko, did not rule out that the adoption of the privatization 
program on the eve of the future parliamentary elections 
scheduled for March 27 was a measure of political character. In 
his opinion, "the Supreme Soviet's conservative nature hampered 
the process of privatization in the republic."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ihor Nedyukha, candidate of technological </F>
sciences: "Once Again About the "Shield" and "Sword"] 
  [Text] According to the press, the Ukrainian Nationalist 
Assembly [UNA] has sent the chairman of Ukraine's Security 
Service, Ye. Marchuk, a statement (the text was supplied), 
containing a request to evaluate President L. Kravchuk's 
activity during the negotiations with the presidents of the 
United States and Russia on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament. This 
statement, in fact, accuses the Ukrainian president of 
violations of the law to the extent of high treason. 
  However, the impression arises that the UNA leadership had 
not read Marchuk in HOLOS UKRAYINY 12 December 1992 where he 
insisted on the expediency of Ukraine's staying under the 
"nuclear shield of Russia," in other words, on the current 
policy of the total nuclear disarmament of Ukraine. 
  For that reason, I find it inappropriate to demand that 
Marchuk does the evaluation. This conclusion not only applies 
to the UNA appeal, but also to the analogous statement by the 
Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party [UKRP]. 
  The validity of the above interpretation is confirmed, at 
least, by the fact that the transfer to Russia of the "Sword" -- 
the tactical nuclear weapons -- is known to have been completed 
on the night of 5 and 6 May 1992. 
  It remains to be hoped that opponents of the Ukrainian 
president in the ranks of the UNA and UKRP will also agree that 
the same people must be among those who have planned and those 
who are implementing the measures for withdrawing the entire 
"Sword" and "Shield" (strategic nuclear weapons) complex from 
Ukraine.

  [Text] As reported by the Press Service of Ukraine's 
Ministry of Defense, in accordance with the agreement on 
conventional armed forces in Europe, Ukraine is further reducing 
its own weapons arsenals. During the first stage, which ended 
on 17 November 1993, 603 tanks, 630 armored combat vehicles, and 
175 aircraft and helicopters were destroyed. The second stage 
will end in November 1994. Over this period of time, it is 
planned to destroy more than 600 tanks and more than 300 armored 
combat vehicles. 
  The reduction of the numerical strength of Ukraine's Armed 
Forces is continuing. In accordance with the Supreme Council 
decision, by the end of 1995, we will have 450,000 servicemen.

<F P=106> [Olga Musafirova report: "Political Terror: Crimean Carnage"] </F>
  [Text] Kiev -- As the newspapers have previously said, 
every day brings us closer to the elections. We have as a rule 
lived to see elections and witness the triumph of true people's 
power. Music plays, beer flows from buffets at polling stations, 
women hastily line up for candy, and the candidates' families 
say nothing apart from that the time has come for these people 
to defend the interests of the masses. 
  Today a deputy's career is becoming more and more dangerous. 
  In this respect the Crimea and the events occurring on the 
peninsula depict, as it were, in miniature the picture of 
"Ukraine. Parliamentary Elections. March 1994." For two years 
there have been promises to turn the Crimea into a hot spot, a 
new Karabakh. It was predicted that the division of the Black 
Sea Fleet would be a destabilizing factor. Or that Crimean 
Tatar expansion would disturb the peace. But it was an event 
sanctified by the republic's legislation that proved the last 
straw. The Crimea decided to declare its own president. To be 
more accurate, prominent political forces began dividing up 
spheres of influence in what is indeed a prime piece of land, 
strategically important by no means because of some rusty old 
tubs known as a fleet. 
  Official Kiev tumultuously applauded the start of the 
campaign. However, this could have been done with the idea of 
warning "president number one" -- Nikolay Bagrov, chairman of 
the Crimean Supreme Soviet, who had dared too often to take a 
special, Crimean view on a number of state issues. When it 
became clear that the Crimea under the tricolor of the Republic 
Movement or the Russian Party was indeed running the risk of 
steaming toward Russia, Bagrov's victory should have been 
ensured at any price. Or there should at least been a return to 
the starting positions and the elections ruled invalid. But a 
new phenomenon put in an appearance: The Crimea was suddenly 
swamped by hitherto unheard-of waves of banditry verging on 
political terrorism. The militia generally either lost the 
criminals' trail or arrived too late. In a short period the 
chief medics at the "Sea Surf" and "Russia" sanatoriums died, 
along with the head of a council of ministers directorate, the 
director of the Kerch iron ore combine, the leader of the 
National Movement of Crimean Tatars, and the head of the Black 
Sea Fleet Press Center. Strangers attacked the parliament's 
headquarters, fired shots at the office window of Leonid Grach, 
leader of the Crimean Communists, and, to cap it all, carried 
out the carnage with no quarter for women or children (I am 
talking about the murder of Nikolay Bagrov's economic adviser, 
Crimean Supreme Soviet People's Deputy Iskander Mamedov, two of 
his guards, and the wounding of 10 people). The tragedies were 
not consistently linked, but it all finally led a dead-scared 
Joe Public to yell: "Enough! Enough!" 
  However, the situation has been blocked by another means 
also. Immediately after it opened, the ninth session of the 
Ukrainian parliament promptly amended Article 114 of the 
Constitution. The Ukrainian president now has a basis for 
rescinding acts adopted by the cabinet of ministers and central 
organs of power, and similar decisions by Crimea's leadership 
structures, if he finds them at variance with Ukraine's 
fundamental or other laws or with his own edicts. 
  Rukh's central leadership was one of the first to issue a 
statement regarding the inadmissibility of presidential 
elections in the Crimea. Moreover, the document indicated that 
the actual course of the campaign is dangerously hotting up the 
sociopolitical atmosphere on the peninsula. Events soon showed 
that active participation in the quite legitimate Ukrainian 
Supreme Council election campaign that has just begun may also 
lead to symptoms of "Crimean fever" (at least for the 
opposition). During the night of 15-16 January two strange men 
tried to break into the Rukh Secretariat after hitting the 
janitor on the head with a pistol. A little later it emerged 
that Secretariat leader Mikhail Boychishin had disappeared.... 
  The day before the parliamentary session the president's 
representatives in the localities and representatives of soviets 
at all levels met in the Supreme Council conference room. 
Nomenklatura factions squabbled among themselves, but they were 
unable to determine which was the more senior in the face of the 
coming, unpredictable elections, so they tried to reach a 
compromise by supraconstitutional but peaceful means. They 
adopted a unique draft law on power and self-government in 
Ukraine. 
  In the future Ukraine will operate solely as a presidential 
republic.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Pilat report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric: </F>
"Crimea"] 
  [Text] An extraordinary session of the Crimean Tatar 
People's Assembly is at an end. Assembly Chairman Mustafa 
Dzhemilev, his deputy Rifat Chubarov, and other Assembly members 
said in their addresses that in the series of acts of violence 
that is gaining momentum in Crimea, the assassination of 
Iskandar Mamedov is not the first act directed against the 
Crimean Tatars. All these events, says the Assembly statement 
made in connection with the escalation of violence in Crimea, 
attest to the efforts by certain political forces to destabilize 
the situation by inveigling Crimean Tatars into a wide-scale 
conflict. The Assembly of the Crimean Tatar people, which 
rejects violence in solving any questions, believes: "In the 
situation that has taken shape, measures should be immediately 
taken to resolutely cut short actions that threaten peace and 
the fragile calm in Crimea." It is necessary, in the Assembly's 
opinion, to stop crime in Crimea, which has appreciably grown 
owing to the worsened political situation in the course of the 
elections for Crimea's president and the preparations for the 
elections for a new Supreme Soviet. 
  The Assembly finds it necessary to take measures to preserve 
peace and accord on the peninsula. The statement says that a 
special investigation group should be created on a 
first-priority basis in Ukraine's prosecutor's office to carry 
out a thorough and objective investigation into all acts of 
violence and terror in Crimea. The Assembly demands that the 
Supreme Soviets of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea should 
"examine and bring into line the provisions of the Republic of 
Crimea's constitution with the existing legislation of Ukraine 
and with the requirements of the trilateral agreement between 
the United States, Russia, and Ukraine on nuclear disarmament 
and mutual security guarantees."

  [Text] Kiev--As a UNIAN correspondent learned from circles 
close to the Ukrainian president, on 24 January Leonid Kravchuk 
received four people's deputies of Ukraine from the Crimea 
Republic: Anatoliy Matiyko, Vitaliy Reva, Volodymyr 
Sevastyanov, and Volodymyr Terekhov. The meeting, which lasted 
more than an hour, took place at the initiative of People's 
Deputies of Ukraine Volodymyr Terekhov and Serhiy Tsekov, ardent 
supporters of Yuriy Myeshkov, the winner in the first round of 
the presidential election in the Crimea. In the opinion of one 
of the meeting's participants, who wished to remain anonymous, 
the talk with President Kravchuk was not open in all respects, 
because the plans of the Myeshkov supporters did not envisage 
the presence at the meeting of other Crimean politicians, the 
political opponents to the Republican Movement of the Crimea 
(RRK). 
  Volodymyr Terekhov wanted to know whether Kiev was planning 
to use force against the RRK and when Ukraine would begin to 
combat terrorism in the Crimea. To the first question, Leonid 
Kravchuk said no. As far as the second question was concerned, 
he said the Ukrainian procuracy was already taking necessary 
measures but that was a problem of power not only in Kiev, but 
in Simferopol as well. The Ukrainian president said he had 
nothing against Yuriy Myeshkov personally or against the 
movement he heads. The president, however, stressed that all 
the citizens and political forces in Ukraine, the Crimea 
included, should abide by the laws of Ukraine. Leonid Kravchuk 
spoke out against granting dual citizenship to the residents of 
the peninsula. 
  In the opinion of a meeting participant who was interviewed 
by the UNIAN correspondent, Kravchuk is well informed about 
everything happening in the Crimea and in the entourage of 
Myeshkov in particular. The people's deputy also believes that 
the holding of the meeting was due, first and foremost, to the 
uncertainty of Myeshkov and his team in their own strength. 
"They did not want to win at the presidential election, because 
they were not ready for this and now they do not know what to do 
with this." He admitted that if Crimean residents learn about 
the latest maneuvers of Myeshkov and his supporters, about their 
refusal from the election promises (a referendum on the status 
of the Crimea, secession from Ukraine, etc.) the second round of 
the election scheduled for 30 January may fail to take place.

  [Text] Ivan Yermakov, dismissed from his post of Ukrainian 
presidential representative in Sevastopol, stated at the news 
conference that he was not going to leave the political arena 
and that, in his opinion, "Leonid Kravchuk did not do the right 
thing" when he signed the edict on his dismissal. "This should 
not have been done with such a difficult situation prevailing in 
the Crimea," said Yermakov. He pointed out that he will not run 
for the Ukrainian Supreme Council, but will be a candidate for 
deputy of the Crimean Supreme Council. He also promised that he 
would return to his post, no matter what it is called (his dream 
is to become mayor of Sevastopol). Yermakov stated that he was 
going to create a Slavic Christian Party that will also be open 
to Muslims, Judaists, and all other people irrespective of their 
nationality. He focused on the fact that, over the period of 
his work as Ukrainian presidential representative in Sevastopol, 
he had to go through quite a number of unpleasant moments and 
even hours. In particular, it was when he had to hoist the 
Ukrainian state flag at the building of the city state 
administration, since "the colors of that flag do not appeal to 
me."

  [Text] The Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus has 
supported, by a majority of votes, the recalling of Stanislav 
Shushkevich from the post of chairman of the Supreme Soviet of 
the Republic of Belarus. The formal reason for this recall was 
the parliamentary debate which intended to reveal the violations 
of law in the activities of commercial structures at state and 
local government bodies. According to the adopted resolution, 
Shushkevich is blamed for failing to take measures against 
corruption, a lack of control over the work of law enforcement 
bodies, and manifested personal immodesty. 
  The same charges with regard to Belarusian Prime Minister 
Vyacheslav Kebich were treated by the majority of the people's 
deputies as insignificant; in secret balloting, they voted 
against his dismissal. Half an hour ago, the Supreme Soviet 
began its regular plenary session. People's deputies are 
discussing the miscellaneous matters on the agenda.

The people's deputies addressed the problems of the Belarusian 
Peasant Party and the Minsk Tractor Factory, and honored the 
memory of writer Ales Adamovich by a minute of silence. Then it 
was resolved to hold necessary consultations to select 
candidates for the post of the Supreme Soviet chairman. 
However, even after a two-hour break in the proceedings, during 
which the sessions of the Supreme Soviet Presidium and 
parliamentary factions took place, the people's deputies deemed 
this issue to be unprepared for broad discussion. They decided 
to fully devote today's proceedings in commissions and deputy 
factions to the nomination of candidates for the post of the 
Supreme Soviet chairman. This issue is expected to be discussed 
at the plenary session tomorrow.

speaker of the upper chamber of the Russian parliament, offered 
Stanislav Shushkevich, who was removed from the post of the 
chairman of the Belarusian parliament on Wednesday, to head the 
CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, it was learned here from an 
anonymous sourse close to Shushkevich. 
  The offer was made on Thursday morning by telephone. This 
post was previous held by Ruslan Khasbulatov, who was jailed 
after the October opposition rebellion in Moscow. 
  Shumeyko informed Shushkevich that the offer was agreed with 
the heads of CIS parliaments. It is worth recalling in this 
connection that Shushkevich was a co-founder of the Commonwealth 
of Independent States (CIS) alongside with Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian leader Leonid Kravchuk. 
  BELINFORM reported also with reference to the press service 
of the Belarus Supreme Soviet that Shushkevich would not attend 
a meeting of the Belarus parliament today. He is expected to 
hold a press conference here on Monday.

Popular Front Opposition] 
  [Text] On 26 January, the Belarusian Popular Front 
opposition in the Supreme Soviet held a news conference to 
address yesterday's events in the Supreme Soviet -- the 
dismissal of Interior Minister Vladimir Yegorov and KGB Chairman 
Eduard Shirkovskiy. The leader of the Belarusian Popular 
Movement parliamentary opposition, Zyanon Paznyak, stated that 
the main reason for dismissing them were the facts that they 
knew about corruption and the involvement of government 
officials and leaders in that corruption; moreover, they were 
uncompromising on this issue. Second, there are political 
forces at work which have close connections with imperial 
Russian circles, including special services and the Russian 
counterintelligence service, according to KGB Chairman Eduard 
Shirkovskiy's statement during the behind-closed-door 
proceedings. Zyanon Paznyak also touched upon the personal 
qualities of the dismissed officials. Thus, according to the 
oppositional leader, thanks to Vladimir Yegorov, there was no 
bloodshed in Belarus over the last four years. Both Vladimir 
Yegorov and Eduard Shirkovskiy have been trying, while adhering 
to the law, to act in line with Belarusian interests, which was 
much to the dismay of the Council of Ministers.

rubric: "Will Russia Choose Belarus?"] 
  [Text] All of us -- both those supporting unification 
and those objected to it -- are in a state of tense suspense: 
What results will January 1994 bring? We are truly facing a 
critical moment right now. 
  The Belarusian leadership sees a stable economic union with 
Russia and the unification of currency systems as the only means 
for protecting our sovereignty and overcoming the protracted 
crisis. However, as known, this approach is not shared by all 
political circles. A feeling of relief will supposedly be 
experienced by producers and entrepreneurs, if by anybody. 
  Frankly speaking, economists and financiers think that the 
joining of the common ruble zone by Belarus is inevitable. Of 
course, it would have been much better to make such a move two 
years ago -- the cost would have been far lower. Or, perhaps, 
to adopt the direction of Baltic states. Unfortunately, the 
opportunity was missed. Excepting the economic union with 
Russia, we are rapidly and firmly following the path which 
Ukraine is desperately trying to abandon. A persistent general 
economic crisis without hope or prospects brings death to any 
country. We will be able to keep ourselves in the swim at the 
expense of high-tech production -- so-called "brain" work -- for 
about a year or two. However, if highly skilled specialists, 
depressed by petty salaries, leave their labs and workshops in 
search of better-paying places under the sun, the world will 
embrace yet another "banana republic." Then it will be 
impossible for Belarus to avoid the penetration and expansion of 
Russian capital. 
  Nobody needs to be reminded that Belarus' interests are, 
first of all and above all, in the East, in Russia, in other CIS 
countries. The experience of our independence demonstrates that 
we are not welcome guests in the West. "Rotting" continental 
and transatlantic businessmen rate Belarus as last in their 
investments priorities because of our allegedly pro-communist 
regime and the absolute lack of reform. We must face the truth: 
Our Republic is not rated high by Russia, either. This is 
testified to by the visit of the U.S. President; Bill Clinton's 
behind-closed-doors meeting with [opposition leader] Zyanon 
Paznyak also has its significance. 
  Economic union with Russia is a necessary step for us, but 
it 
is also a forced step. The Belarusian economy is on the brink 
of catastrophe. Taking into account world prices for Russian 
raw materials, customs duties, and our horrible tax policy, the 
Belarusian leadership -- to rid itself of Russian pressure -- 
has rushed toward integration with our "eastern brother," 
notwithstanding the fact that the economic union implies a 
limitation of political sovereignty. Nonetheless, it is assumed 
that this will help Belarus overcome crises and move beyond its 
current standstill. The creation of a single ruble zone with a 
single legal tender -- the Russian ruble -- and, as a result, 
the implementation of rules and methods of the more liberal 
Russian tax system, as well as the widening of markets are the 
main roads to civilization. 
  Still, these are advancements on our behalf. What can we 
propose to Russia in return? An economy in crisis and ourselves 
-- lock, stock, and barrel?! For Russia, the unification of 
currency systems is more of a political step than an economic 
one. Former Russian Prime Minister Gaydar has spoken out 
against this unification. We, just like that small boy with a 
dog on the well-known "Russia's Choice" poster, are not welcome.

<F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM correspondent Alyaksandr Lyushkevich </F>
under the "Facts and Comments" rubric: "Our Customs Will 
Cooperate"] 
  [Text] During Bill Clinton's visit to Minsk, the Government 
of the United States and the Republic of Belarus signed an 
agreement on cooperation and mutual assistance between their 
respective customs services. A BELINFORM correspondent has 
asked Hyenadz Shkurdz, chairman of the State Committee for 
Customs, to comment on this agreement. 
  "This is the first governmental agreement on cooperation of 
our customs service with one of its foreign counterparts. It 
will become effective 90 days after the date of signing. 
  "This document provides that the two sides will assist one 
another in preventing and investigating any violations of the 
law, which are within the competence of their customs services. 
According to the agreement, the sides will provide each other 
with all information concerning the imposition of custom duties 
and other taxes. It is also very important that the sides 
assist each other in providing customs services with modern 
equipment. This also includes personnel training and the 
exchange of information on the latest developments in 'customs' 
equipment. That is of the greatest importance for us right now. 
The agreement also provides for the exchange of experts."

  [Text] Belarus is continuing conscientiously to fulfill 
its obligations under the Treaty on the Reduction of 
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. 
  The next stage -- the first in the new year -- in the 
elimination of armored hardware has begun at the tank-repair 
plant in Borisov. It will last through 24 February. It is 
planned to cut up 92 tanks and approximately 50 infantry 
fighting vehicles for scrap metal and to re-equip them for use 
in the national economy. The work is being monitored by a group 
of NATO military inspectors.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vafa Gulizade, state adviser on </F>
international affairs, by Beshir Sherifov; place and date not 
given--live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Sherifov] Moscow and Yerevan are reportedly 
continuing discussion of regional political problems. The 
Armenian side has asked Russia to reconsider the deployment of 
Russian troops on the Azerbaijani-Iranian border. What is your 
view on this issue? 
  [Gulizade] Moscow is not discussing regional problems only 
with Yerevan. It discussed them with Baku first. Before 
[Armenian Foreign Minister] Papazyan and [Karabakh Foreign 
Minister] Gukasyan met Kozyrev in Moscow, Azerbaijani Foreign 
Minister Gasan Gasanov had already met and given an in-depth 
explanation of Azerbaijan's position to Kozyrev. During my 
meeting with Gasan Gasanov he told me that Kozyrev heard and 
understood all our positions. 
  We are here to discuss a conflict between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan. I don't set great store by such press reports. 
Armenia has reportedly asked Russia to consider deploying 
Russian troops on the Azerbaijan-Iran border. Armenia can have 
no role in this issue. Azerbaijani troops are watching over and 
defending--they will defend--Azerbaijani borders. 
  [Sherifov] It is also being said that at these talks the 
view 
was expressed that Azerbaijan should accept giving broader 
political status to Nagorno-Karabakh and should even concede 
Shusha. 
  [Gulizade] On the issue of status, I can only say the 
following, which I have said before: Similar views were also 
published in the U.S. press to the effect that Armenia has 
suffered a political defeat in its struggle over 
Nagorno-Karabakh. Why? Because even if we consider the status 
of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast [NKAO], they 
can't achieve a broader political status than that. In other 
words, the NKAO had a very broad political status. There can be 
no discussion about status. It is still very early. Therefore, 
first, Azerbaijani land must be liberated. No autonomy will 
ever be better than the autonomy that was. Shusha won't be 
conceded to them. Indeed, no Azerbaijani city will be conceded 
to them. I want to assure our television viewers and 
compatriots of this.

  [Text] Following a night lull, Azeri forces resumed 
offensive in the south and southeastern areas of the 
Armenian-Azeri war zone, a spokesman for the Karabakh defense 
told Interfax. As of 10:30 Moscow time, Karabakh units were 
engaged in heavy fighting, repelling the enemy attack. 
  Stepanakert reports that a pitched battle is raging in the 
north of the Kelbajar District of Azerbaijan. In a successful 
counter attack the Karabakh forces have reportedly advanced 
several kilometers on the Omar mountain pass. 
  Meanwhile, an official of the Azeri Defense Ministry told 
Interfax that fighting was underway in the Mardakert District of 
Nagorno Karabakh, where the Armenian units were still trying to 
mount a large scale offensive on the town of Ter-Ter. The town 
was shelled during the night. 
  Baku reports that the Azeri units repelled all enemy attacks 
and knocked out one enemy tank and two armored personnel 
carriers.

  [Text] Controversial reports are coming from Baku and 
Stepanakert about the fighting in the zone of the Armenian-Azeri 
conflict. 
  A spokesman for the Azeri Defence Ministry has said that 
units of the Azeri army yesterday held successful operations in 
the Kelbadzhar area of the republic. As a result, the spokesman 
said, the Kelbadzhar group of the Armenian army was forced to 
retreat to the Armenian-Azeri border, while Armenian units 
fighting in the Mardakert area of Karabakh weer being cut off 
from supply bases in Armenia. 
  Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Karabakh defense army claims 
that there are no position changes in the Kelbadzhar area. The 
spokesman said that up to 70 Azeri servicemen were killed during 
hostilities in the area. Among the Karabakh casualties are four 
persons killed and 11 wounded.

  [Text] Tbilisi January 26 TASS -- The political council of 
the Georgian Social Democratic Party has called for 
rapprochement with Russia, "Georgia's natural great ally." 
  "This approach is the only chance for Georgia to preserve 
its 
integrity and independence," the council said in an appeal to 
Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze on Wednesday. 
  The Georgian leadership should admit that for various 
subjective reasons the social, economic, financial and credit 
policy of the government has failed. The severance of 
traditional ties caused by the sweeping disintegration of the 
Soviet Union has resulted in the collapse of whole industries in 
the republic, the appeal said. 
  Georgian Social Democrats disagree with the position of 
political organisations which oppose the rapprochement with 
Russia, "the only potential country whose powerful industry 
makes it a desired partner not only for us, but for more 
developed countries as well," the appeal said.

  [Text] A comprehensive Russo-Georgian treaty to be signed 
in Tbilisi in early February will make the situation in the 
Caucasus, as well as in South Ossetia, worse still, South 
Ossetian Prime Minister Rezo Khugayev told Interfax. 
  He recalled that Moscow had not agreed to sign such a treaty 
before Georgia resolved its differences with South Ossetia and 
Abkhazia by political means. Georgia, however, has not even 
started an equal political dialog with those republics, Khugayev 
thinks. 
  He believes that Russian support for an indivisible Georgia 
"will give a free hand to chauvinist forces in Tbilisi." He did 
not rule out the possibility that, once the treaty was signed, 
Georgia would resume military pressure on South Ossetia and 
Abkhazia. 
  Lyudvig Chibirov, head of the South Ossetian parliament who 
also attended the interview, made it clear that the people of 
the republic would hardly agree even to a confederation within 
Georgia.

  [Text] In Georgia the visit of Eduard Shevardnadze to 
France is estimated to be positive in the whole. Commenting the 
results of the Paris negotiations, Giso Gilieshvli, the chairman 
of the Committee for External Economic Relations, told the 
agreement on the investments protection is ready for signing. 
French capital will be invested in the extension of the Poti 
port. Besides, French specialists will take part in the 
Tbilisi-Baku railway reconstruction to create a safe 
Europe-Caucasus-Asia way. It is also supposed to create a joint 
French-Georgian Bank. Irakli Shenghelia, the leader of the 
Georgian Christian-Democratic Union, said France is the 
initiator of the European integration idea, and Georgia has to 
join this process. Besides, there was a necessity to examine 
the reaction on the Georgia's entrance in CIS. In all 
probability, E. Shevardnadze tried to clear up in Paris the 
attitude of France to the coming discussion of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict in the UN Security Council. On his 
return to Tbilisi the Georgian leader declared on a 
press-conference there was understanding of the necessity of the 
Georgia's entrance to CIS. "It was a right decision which should 
be acceptable for Georgia as well as for Europe and CIS", - said 
Shevardnadze. The agreement for Friendship, Cooperation and 
Mutual Aid was signed during the visit.

<F P=106> [Interview with Eduard Shevardnadze by Italian Radio Two in </F>
Tbilisi; date not given: "Europe and the Whole World Is 
Indebted to Shevardnadze"] 
  [Excerpts] A few days before the [Orthodox] New Year, a 
special edition of the Italian Radio Two information program 
"People and Facts -- So We Can Know More" organized a live radio 
relay from Georgia, in which Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of 
the Republic of Georgia Parliament-head of state, participated. 
[passage omitted] 
  The program is introduced by Luca Livoni: 
  Today, we have a very important program. We will be linking 
up soon with Tbilisi, where we have our special correspondent 
Alessandro Cassieri. [passage omitted] 
  So, this morning Batoni [Georgian polite form of address] E. 
Shevardnadze will be asked many questions by the guests in the 
studio or by people with whom we have linked up on the 
telephone. These are Giorgio Napolitano, president of the 
Italian Parliament Chamber of Deputies, Senate President 
Giovanni Spandolini, Giuseppe Giacovazzo, deputy minister of 
foreign affairs, Stefano Silvestri, professor at the Center for 
International Relations, Raiuno director Demetrio Volcic, who 
was special correspondent in Moscow for many years, and my 
colleagues Giuseppe Chiseri and Carlo Napoli from Radio Two's 
foreign department. [passage omitted] 
  [Shevardnadze]First and foremost, I would like to greet 
Batonebi Napolitano, Spandolini, and all the radio listeners and 
express my gratitude to all the organizers of this broadcast. 
Regarding the situation that has taken shape in Georgia, it is 
very difficult. However, certain positive events did take place 
in 1993. These were the general consolidation of our people and 
the defeat of such destructive and semifascist forces as the 
supporters of the former president and their armed opposition 
against the authorities and the Georgian people. There existed 
the fundamental danger of the division of the nation, but this 
has been eliminated since the supporters of the ex-president 
were defeated politically, morally, and militarily. As for 
Abkhazia, almost more than one-half of the population of 
Abkhazia has been evacuated. Of the population of 500,000 in 
Abkhazia, 250,000 persecuted Georgians are now in different 
regions of Georgia. Tens of thousands of Georgians have been 
destroyed and shot simply because they were Georgians. 
Unfortunately, this problem cannot, as yet, be resolved. The 
first round of negotiations is currently in progress in Geneva. 
The main point in this agreement is that the refugees should 
return immediately to their homes. The next round will also be 
held in Geneva on 11 Janury and we will be going there with 
definite hopes. If this is realized and the refugees return to 
their homes, a peaceful regulation becomes realistic. 
  [Cassieri] The beginning of the conflict in this part of 
Georgia is naturally connected with the new composition of the 
Soviet Union. However, what, in your view, was the direct 
motive and basis for the intensification of the autonomous 
movement in Abkhazia; what process that has taken place in the 
former Soviet Union over the last two years was able to 
contribute to this? 
  [Shevardnadze]This is the manifestation of the 
reactionary separatist movement. Not everyone knows that this 
is Georgian land on which Georgians and Abkhazians have been 
living for centuries. If we speak about proportionate figures, 
Georgians make up one-half of the population, whereas the 
Abkhazians constitute only 17 percent. Who is supporting this 
17 percent and how is it possible that 17 percent has been able 
to persecute 50 percent? This happened because the Abkhazian 
separatists were backed by Russia's reactionary force: Rutskoy, 
Khasbulatov, and the communists, fundamentalists and communists 
who were in the Supreme Soviet at the time. They rendered 
financial and material assistance and sent weapons and thousands 
of mercenaries there. This 17 percent is demanding that 
Abkhazia secedes from Georgia and unites with Russia. 
  [Cassieri] Apart from the responsibility of the old 
nomenklatura of the former Soviet Union, those people holding 
Soviet views, who, just two months ago, suffered another 
"purge," you specifically demanded that the Russian Government 
also assume responsibility, particularly when you were in 
Sukhumi in August and September by which time the Abkhazians had 
surrounded the city. That is to say, you demanded that Yeltsin, 
whom you felt was not giving you the necessary support in order 
to defend Georgia, should assume direct responsibility. 
  [Shevardnadze]I believe that Yeltsin was unable to 
control the situation, as the Supreme Soviet at the time was 
putting up considerable resistance and the majority of deputies 
supported those separatist actions by the Abkhazians. Yeltsin 
was unable to overcome this opposition in his conflict with 
these people. The opposition between these two forces gave rise 
to and aggravated the conflict in Abkhazia as well. You know 
that I was in Abkhazia at that time. It was terrible to see the 
destruction of this most beautiful part of Georgia. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Napolitano] First of all, I would like to say to Batoni 
Shevardnadze that I have often thought about him and his brave 
step to struggle against so many problems that have arisen in 
Georgia. I respect you very much and admire your character. At 
the beginning of October, President [as published] Shevardnadze 
appealed to those countries in Europe on whose help he was 
counting. I would like to ask Batoni president to what extent 
have those questions that were raised been coordinated on an 
international scale and what help is needed and what can the 
West do in this respect. 
  [Shevardnadze]Thank you very much. I likewise greet 
all of you and thank you for such an appraisal of my activities. 
My appeal, which has just been mentioned, signified our saving 
Georgia and democracy. It is a question of the salvation of 
democracy here, as Georgia has chosen a difficult path in a 
region that is already very difficult from a geographical point 
of view. The problems that were mentioned in my appeal are still 
pressing; the situation in Georgia remains very serious. There 
is total hunger. Georgia use to be a rich country where the 
people lived well. However, we now have hunger and cold. This 
is the fate of our nation. There are now hundreds of thousands 
of refugees in Georgia. If it were not for the help from the 
West, in particular from Italy and other countries, the 
situation in Georgia would be much worse. I appeal once more to 
everyone to whom the ideals of democracy are dear, to help 
Georgia so that, through our combined efforts, we can save this 
small but, at the same time, great country that has a 
centuries-old civilization. Once again, I thank you very much 
for your help. 
  [Giacovazzo] In spite of the great sympathy that I feel 
toward Batoni Shevardnadze, I do not have such a good knowledge 
of the problems in Georgia. I am more interested in issues 
related to Russia. The Zhirinovskiy problem is of concern to 
everyone at the moment, a problem that relates not only to the 
present time, but also to the future. Is is possible that this 
populist, ultraright- wing leader -- I don't know what to call 
him -- will enjoy even greater success in the 1996 presidential 
elections? To what extent is he a serious threat? Will we not 
see a unification of the left around Yeltsin? I have one more 
question that directly concerns Italy: You know that, this 
year, Italy is presiding over the Security Council that unites 
54 states including all the republics of the former Soviet 
Union. Italy wants to make active use of its status in the 
council and bring to a hasty end all the different conflicts on 
the territory of the former Soviet Union, in particular those 
taking place in Georgia. I would like to know how effectively 
Batoni Shevardnadze thinks this role may be used and what is 
possible for Italy to do this year as council president? 
  [Shevardnadze]I will try to answer in brief these 
difficult questions. I assumed that this process would occur in 
Russia and that 15-20 percent would support Zhirinovskiy. I was 
mistaken, but this had to take place in Russia. I think that 
this is due not so much to the victory of Zhirinovskiy's ideas, 
but rather to confusion among the electorate. Zhirinovskiy 
should have appeared after the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
However, it is unfortunate that the forces that were standing 
alongside him enabled him to acquire such influence. This is 
indeed worrying. However, there is the other side of the coin: 
Following Zhirinovskiy's success, Russian society has come to 
its senses. Unfortunately, prior to the elections, many 
democrats did not view him as a serious force and, therefore, I 
think they were justly punished. I am left with the impression 
that Russia's democrats have to unite and I believe that this 
will indeed happen. They will unite to prevent the emergence of 
fascism. If they unite, fascism will not take hold. If the 
democrats do not unite and fascism strengthens its hold, this 
will be terrible not only for Russia, but also for Europe and 
the whole world. However, I believe that this will not happen. 
Russia achieved great success when it adopted a new 
constitution. This creates a serious guarantee of democracy and 
this Constitution will enable President Yeltsin to eradicate 
fascism and dictatorship. I think that President Yeltsin will 
make use of this. Regarding the Security Council, I pin great 
hopes upon it. It should adopt an even more firm position 
particularly regarding such questions as ethnic conflicts. The 
Security Council can do this. Conflicts characterize the 
Caucasus, particularly Georgia. Europe should think how, as one 
force, it can overcome the economic crisis. If this crisis is 
not overcome on such a large territory, chaos could ensue, which 
will cost the world dear. I pin great hopes on Italy's 
presidency of the Security Council. We are ready to cooperate 
in every way possible so that your presidency will make an 
appreciable contribution.[passage omitted] 
  [Spandolini] I warmly greet President Shevardnadze and I 
fondly remember our first meeting in Rome in 1991 when your book 
"Freedom for the Future" was being presented. I recall your 
comments, which proved to be incredibly correct, a few months 
before the coup in Russia, about Gorbachev's future actions and 
your view that this transformation may not have brought the 
expected results. The freedom that was written about in that 
book is now more urgent than ever, as is the independence of 
Georgia.... 
  [Shevardnadze]Thank you. Let me give you my answer. 
The likes of Gamsakhurdia, Zhirinovskiy, Ardzinba in Abkhazia, 
and certain others in Russia are a dangerous phenomenon and I 
believe that, after World War II, the world paid less attention 
to fascism and analogous movements. In my view, this has cost 
the world very dearly and, therefore, we have to be vigilant 
and, what is more, analyze aggressive separatism and not 
tolerate what has happened in our region. As for Zhirinovskiy's 
supporters -- Gamsakhurdia and the others -- I myself know, 
through having had direct contacts with them over two years, 
that they are surrounded by many inexperienced people. Our 
people, for example, realized very quickly what Gamsakhurdia 
represented. This was the reason for his defeat. The great 
majority of his supporters are cooperating with us today. I am 
certain that we will cooperate with almost all of them as 
Gamsakhurdia propagated the ideas of national exclusivity, 
irreconcilability with other nations, and religious intolerance, 
and they could not have any future. People realized this and we 
are now cooperating with them. Many of Zhirinovskiy's 
supporters have chosen a different path. It only requires the 
unification of the democrats and Zhirinovskiy will no longer be 
dangerous. 
  [Cassieri] As the former [Soviet] foreign minister, you 
naturally know all the Soviet Union's secrets. When 
Zhirinovskiy threatened to use the "ultimate weapon," whom do 
you think he had in mind? The future destruction of their arch 
enemy or awkward neighbors? In your view, what was meant by 
this, if anything at all? 
  [Shevardnadze]I think that what Zhirinovskiy is saying 
represents the nostalgia of certain circles in Russia. Of 
course, it is based on Russian chauvinist ideology. We should 
view this as a chauvinist movement and a type of fascism: A 
chauvinist world outlook and imperialist nostalgia -- these are 
the two main characteristics of this movement. I would like to 
repeat once more that, in order to overcome this, it is 
essential for all democrats in Russia to unite. 
  [Spandolini] I realize that the European model is more 
acceptable for the CIS than the U.S. one. I am pleased to hear 
your view that Yeltsin will be able to curb the 
fascist-chauvinist wave that is currently affecting Russia. 
However, is Batoni Shevardnadze aware that the European 
Community is facing a great danger? Separatist movements have 
intensified in certain EC countries. Do you think that the same 
danger awaits the CIS? In short, is there a risk of a second 
Yugoslavia in Russia? 
  [Shevardnadze]When we compare the prospects for the 
development of the European Community and the CIS, I believe 
that the principle underlying the unification of the countries 
in the CIS should be the same as that which underlies the 
European Community. If this happens, the CIS will be a viable 
prospect. This is the first thing. The second demand: The CIS 
will survive provided that Russia proceeds along the path of 
democratic development. This is an essential condition. God 
forbid that it will happen, but if dictatorship becomes 
established in Russia and Russia's reactionary forces are 
victorious, naturally, the CIS will perish and I am convinced 
that Russia, likewise, will no longer survive. Therefore, the 
future of the CIS and Russia lies only along the path of 
democratic development. I think that Batoni Yeltsin understands 
this well. I will remind him of one step that has been taken: 
One of my friends, Aleksandr Yakovlev, a well-known Russian 
democrat, has been made head of Russian television. I think 
this is a very important fact. There should be more of these 
actions. 
  [Silvestri] I do not want to talk about the so-called 
"ultimate weapon" as I think that Batoni President Shevardnadze 
was right in saying that the ultimate weapon of war was 
political force. Moreover, Russia does have the ultimate -- 
atomic -- weapon, which is enough. It is more difficult to 
achieve stability in this region. Proceeding from this, I 
wanted to ask President Shevardnadze whether it will be possible 
to create elements of stability in the Black Sea region if there 
continue to be prolonged national conflicts between Muslims and 
Christians, in the main, in the Caucasus region. 
  [Shevardnadze]Thank you. This is how I see it: Given 
that there existed such a grandiose and most-powerful empire as 
that of the Soviet Union and that very little time has elapsed 
since the collapse of the Soviet totalitarian system, we should 
not be surprised that such a short period of time has been 
extremely dramatic. I believe that the world should take a 
better look at these processes. The changes that have occurred 
on our planet since the collapse of the Soviet Union are the 
subject of a separate discussion and the events in our region 
are taking place precisely against the background of this 
process. We have to take into account that not all the people 
were ready for independence. We are now passing through this 
difficult school. I firmly believe that we will achieve 
stability and that the Caucasus will likewise become a stable 
region. I would like to highlight two points here: 1. The 
importance of the CIS, if only from the point of view that it is 
necessary to revive the economy and it is impossible to do this 
unless ties are restored between the republics of the former 
Soviet Union; 2. The great unification of neighboring 
countries. The foundations for such an alliance have already 
been laid between the CIS and the countries of the Black Sea 
basin. Their principles of collective security are gradually 
coinciding and I believe that Europe and NATO should direct 
their attention to such regions as the Caucasus. The Caucasus 
is no less an explosive region than the Balkans. Therefore, I 
think that, in order to achieve peace, we have to implement 
collective measures. An explosion in the Caucasus could have 
the most serious consequences on a global scale, if we take into 
account what states could become involved in such a conflict. I 
would like to be more optimistically minded and think about 
peace and stability. 
  [Chiseri] As the program is coming to an end, we would like 
to draw certain conclusions: You correctly pointed out that one 
important factor that created a big danger to peace was 
aggressive separatism. Don't you think that there exist many 
reasons in the world for such a danger, for example, Islamic 
integration, which has surfaced in your region as well? 
  [Shevardnadze]I don't think this is the main reason. 
Such countries as Georgia have a centuries-old experience of 
religious coexistence. In this small country, whose population 
is only some 5 million, members of the Orthodox Church, Muslims, 
members of the Armenian national church [grigorianelebi], and 
Catholics have lived together for centuries. Georgians and Jews 
have lived together for 26 centuries and there have never been 
any conflicts between them, either of a religious or any other 
nature. It is precisely because we are located on the border 
between Islam and Christianity that history has enabled us to 
acquire experience, on the basis of which I am able to say that 
Georgians will live peacefully with people of all religions. I 
believe that it is possible to achieve a peaceful and stable 
situation. We also have to take into account the economic 
crisis. I think that, as soon as we overcome our economic 
difficulties, it will become easier for us to achieve stability 
as well. 
  [Napoli] We have been speaking of Islam and Zhirinovskiy's 
"secret weapon," but the greatest danger to Europe is presented 
by those four republics, in particular Ukraine, that were left 
with nuclear weapons following the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
  [Shevardnadze]I have very close relations with 
Ukraine's political forces. I know very well how they are 
disposed to this issue and I believe that the existence of 
nuclear weapons in Ukraine is being dramatized too much. The 
right course was not taken from the very start when we should 
have spoken with Ukraine as a country that possesses nuclear 
weapons. All the different nuances were not taken into account 
in time. I am certain that Ukraine will adhere to a position 
that befits a civilized country. I do not think that Ukraine 
presents any threat. I exclude such a danger. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I would like to ask you a 
question that any Italian might ask. You were a great friend of 
Gorbachev. Some three years ago, you separated from one another 
amid great uproar. Have you maintained personal relations with 
him? Do you think that Gorbachev is planning a political 
comeback? 
  [Shevardnadze]As regards my personal relations with 
Gorbachev, they are excellent. I respect him greatly and 
believe that he is one of the greatest persons of our century. 
As for his political future, I do not think that my good friend 
has a big political future. However, politics is full of 
paradoxes and one cannot exclude anything. If we reason 
according to the established laws of society, we should conclude 
that he has already fulfilled his mission and he will probably 
not be given the chance to embark on another.(passage 
omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What is your personal view of 
U.S. President Clinton? 
  [Shevardnadze]I believe that the American people have 
elected a worthy president. 
  [Cassieri] A few months before his departure from the 
political arena, Gorbachev said in self-criticism that the 
unification of the two Germanies had been a premature step, a 
political mistake [defekti]. The same has been said by U.S. 
Secretary of State Christopher. If you were speaking as foreign 
minister, what would you say in self-criticism? 
  [Shevardnadze]Regarding the unification of Germany, I 
believe it came too late. If this unification had occurred 
earlier, say in 1986, it would have been better. As for 
self-criticism, had both Gorbachev and I been able to control 
the collapse of the empire, this, naturally, would have spared 
us many problems. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Dzhaba Ioseliani, head of the Georgian </F>
delegation at the negotiations with the Abkhazian side in Geneva 
and commander of the "Mkhedrioni" paramilitary group, by Inga 
Nizharadze in Tbilisi; date not given: "`The Fact That We Are 
Right Is Recognized by the World'"] 
  [Text] [Nizharadze]Batono [Georgian polite form of 
address] Dzhaba, how did the second round of negotiations in 
Geneva go [on 11-13 January]? 
  [Ioseliani] Relatively normally. The main thing is that the 
world public and Russia are on our side. The fact that we are 
right in this matter is recognized by everyone. The Abkhazian 
side was constantly balking by clinging to unsubstantiated 
facts, as a result of which the negotiations were almost 
suspended. Judge for yourself: They submitted the most stupid 
conditions regarding the question of refugees -- that we take 
back only women, old men, children, and those men who did not 
take part in the fighting. In short, the Abkhazians conducted 
themselves in an uncertain manner, evidently realizing that 
their position was not right. Their fanaticism is the first 
sign of their lack of confidence. A fitting role was played by 
the UN, CSCE, and U.S. representatives who advised the Abkhazian 
side to behave more sensibly and not to pin their hopes on the 
world recognizing Abkhazia as a separate state from Georgia. In 
this way, the communique, which suited us and corresponded to 
the interests of Georgia, was signed. However, the Abkhazians 
called the methods ostensibly used to force them into signing 
this document "Beria-type methods." In answer to this, I told a 
joke, reminding them of the famous Abkhazian dramatist who, 
unfortunately, had not managed to write anything as he had been 
shot in 1937 by Lavrentiy Pavlovich [Beria]. 
  [Nizharadze]However, the view is being expressed that 
the second round of talks in Geneva ended in complete failure 
for the Georgian side.... 
  [Ioseliani] This is not how I view it. The talks were 
productive. The return of refugees to Gali rayon is to begin 
already on 10 February. This will be the first stage, following 
which refugees will return to the other rayons of Abkhazia. 
There will be complete disarmament and the withdrawal of all 
kinds of voluntary formations and individuals who went there to 
take part in the conflict, and so forth. I would advise those 
who think that we suffered a fiasco at the talks not to make 
such statements and draw such hasty conclusions. 
  [Nizharadze]What can you say about Russia's position at 
the second round of the negotiations? 
  [Ioseliani] That Russia undoubtedly feels its guilt and is 
trying in every way to make amends. Naturally, the Russians 
have got what they wanted: They will put on blue helmets and 
will fulfill the role of peacekeepers, not forgetting the fact 
that the peacekeeping forces are financed by the UN. 
  [Nizharadze]During your absence, the decision was 
adopted to disarm the "Mkhedrioni." How did you react to this 
and is there any truth in the rumors that the "Mkhedrioni" 
intends to re-elect its commander? 
  [Ioseliani] Let it disarm. If this proves beneficial and 
helps to improve the criminal situation in the republic, we are 
ready to obey and submit to this decision. The weapons will be 
kept in a safe place and, if it becomes necessary, we will again 
arm ourselves. Of course, it's a pity. The "Mkhedrioni" has 
been fighting for four years now; during this time, we have lost 
632 fighters and about 1,000 have been wounded. Probably the 
time has now come for the police to take over; they have been 
taking cover somewhere and are now swaggering about and 
dictating to us how we should behave. This is the law of life. 
This is what happened to the famous English Prime Minister 
Churchill who was not re-elected after the war because, as they 
put it: The war is over. Why do we now need Churchill? As 
regards my re-election, I would be glad if this happened. 
However, these are rumors, as are the claims that I have headed 
off to Austria with a 24 year-old girl in tow.

  [Text] Paris, 26 Jan -- A service in memory of the late 
Zviad Gamsakhurdia was held on Sunday at St. Nino's Georgian 
church in Paris. 
  Iberia's own correspondent reports from Paris that the 
service was attended by representatives of the Georgian emigre 
community. Present at the service was Z. Gamsakhurdia's son 
Konstantine and his family. 
  After the service, Father Archil read a text which did not 
mention that Gamsakhurdia had committed suicide. "The leader of 
the national movement, Z. Gamsakhurdia, was killed in an act of 
treachery and cruel cynicism," Father Archil pointed out. 
  After the ceremony, Father Archil told the Iberia 
correspondent that it was impossible to establish the fact of 
Gamsakhurdia's suicide. "He was a true Christian and could not 
have killed himself," Father Archil said. 
  In answering the Iberia correspondent's question about the 
place where Z. Gamsakhurdia is buried, Konstantine Gamsakhurdia 
said that the body should be within a 30-km radius of Zugdidi. 
In his opinion, the Georgian authorities are in possession of 
the body and the reports that the village of Jikhaskari is under 
the control of Gamsakhurdia supporters are rumors spread by 
Kremlin agents. In reality, Mkhedrioni units are in the 
village, and they are carrying out a genocide of the Samegrelo 
population, Konstantine Gamsakhurdia pointed out. 
  It should be noted that many representatives of the Georgian 
community in France were opposed to holding the service, since, 
in their opinion, this would cause a deterioration of relations 
with the present authorities in Georgia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bachuka Kardava, assistant to the chairman </F>
of the Georgian National-Democratic Party, board member of the 
all-Georgian movement "New Generation," by SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA 
correspondents Inga Abgarova, Tinatin Gviniashvili; place and 
date not given: "A Coup Is Being Prepared in Mingrelia on a 
Regional Scale"] 
  [Text] This is what Bachuka Kardava, assistant to the 
chairman [Georgiy Chanturiya] of the Georgian 
National-Democratic Party [NDP], board chairman of the 
all-Georgian movement "New Generation," stated in a conversation 
with our correspondents. 
  [Kardava] The keys to the resolution of problems in western 
Georgia, in particular in Mingrelia, lie in Tbilisi. All events 
that are taking place and being provoked in Mingrelia are being 
directed from the capital Tbilisi. Various politicians have 
always used Mingrelia and the problem of Zviadism as a card in 
their dirty game. Now, prominent people from the Cabinet of 
Ministers headed by the prime minister are standing behind those 
people who are preparing a coup directed against the rational 
policy being implemented by the current leadership of the rayon. 
Wasn't he [Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia] Zugdidi Gamgebeli 
[head of the local governing body] when, last winter, a 
relatively small group of Zviadists miraculously seized a large 
amount of military equipment that was being dispatched for the 
purposes of military combat in Abkhazia? In this case, it is 
not important whether Tengiz Kitovani, the defense minister at 
the time, knew about this or not. 
  What has been done cannot be undone. Today, in Zugdidi, 
former Zviadists, having united into a group and having received 
the status of military police, present a danger. After all, 
these are the same people who, in their time, having been in a 
position to help Sukhumi, did not cross the Kodorskiy range. I 
am in possession of precise information according to which they 
are being backed by important political figures. 
  I spoke about this at a closed session of the NDP congress 
and at the conference of the Mingrelian branch of the NDP. I am 
certain that this is clear sabotage against the head of state, 
and people are taking part in this whom one would not accuse at 
first sight. However, the culprits will, nevertheless, be made 
to answer. Their hidden game is becoming too obvious.

  [Text] St. Petersburg January 27 TASS -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin arrived in St. Petersburg on Thursday morning to 
take part in celebrations devoted to the 50th anniversary of the 
city's liberation from the Nazi siege. He was welcomed at 
Pulkovo airport by city Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak, head of the 
Leningrad regional administration Aleksandr Belyakov and other 
officials. 
  St. Petersburg, called Leningrad at that time, was 
completely 
surrounded by German troops on September 8, 1941. It then had a 
population of 2,544,000, but only 800,000 people survived to see 
the holiday salute marking the city's liberation on Thursday 
January 27, 1944. 
  About one million people, mostly women and children, were 
evacuated from the city in the period from January to November 
1942 through the only lifeline over Lake Ladoga, 642,000 died 
from hunger, and about 20,000 were killed during air raids and 
shellings. 
  The German Air Force and artillery demolished more than 
3,000 
buildings and damaged more than 7,000. The population of the 
city voluntarily worked Sundays, a total of 50 million working 
hours, to restore Leningrad. Its pre-war townscape was 
practically restored by 1947. 
  From the airport President Yeltsin went to the 
Piskaryovskoye 
memorial cemetery to pay homage to hundreds of thousands of 
Leningraders buried there. Then he will visit the Marino 
settlement in Kirov district of Leningrad region, where he will 
be shown the "Lifting of the Leningrad Blockade" Diorama Museum. 
In the afternoon the president will attend the opening of the 
all-Russia "salute the victory" folk art festival at the 
"Oktyabrsky" grand concert hall. 
  President Yeltsin will return to Moscow in the evening of 
the 
same day.

  [Text] St. Petersburg January 27 TASS -- This is "a holiday 
with tears in eyes", Russian President Boris Yeltsin said on 
Thursday upon arrival to St. Petersburg to participate in the 
celebrations devoted to the 50th anniversary of the end of the 
Nazi blockade of the city during World War Two. 
  He was referring to numerous victims of the 900-day blockade 
of the city which was called Leningrad at the time. Some 
historians say that over a million of city residents died of 
hunger and cold during the siege. 
  "On this day I could not but stay together with 
Leningraders. 
50 years have passed from the day when heroic efforts of 
soldiers and Leningraders rebuffed fascists from the city and 
thus ended the long blockade of Leningrad", the president said. 
  "No other city has lived through the same tragic events in 
its history which befell on the residents of the city on the 
Neva River. The Leningrad battle can be compared to the battle 
for Moscow and under Stalingrad, with the Kursk battle. 
However, the ordeal which Leningraders had survived cannot be 
compared to anything", Yeltsin said. 
  "Glory to war veterans who won this victory and eternal 
memory to those who were killed", the Russian president said and 
added that he, the government and the whole of Russia will 
always honour those who had given their lives to secure the 
great victory.

  [Text] St. Petersburg January 27 TASS -- President Boris 
Yeltsin had to cut his visit to St. Petersburg to one day 
because of important developments awaiting him in Moscow. 
  "Tomorrow will be a very tense day" and it is necessary for 
the president to be in Moscow, Yeltsin told reporters upon 
arrival to St. Petersburg on Thursday. He did not elaborate. 
  Initially the president planned to stay two days in St. 
Petersburg and to visit the fortress of Kronshtadt where an 
anti-Bolshevik uprising took place in 1921 and was drowned in 
blood. 
  Yeltsin has recently rehabilitated the victims of the 
uprising.

  [Text] Marjino January 27 TASS -- A monument to Marshal 
Georgiy Zhukov, who led the Soviet Armed Forces to victory in 
the Second World War, will be erected in Red Square in Moscow, 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin announced on Thursday [27 
January] in the village of Marjino, near St. Petersburg, where 
he arrived to participate in the celebrations devoted to the 
50th anniversary of the end of the Nazi blockade of the second 
biggest Russian city. The 900-day blockade was broken near the 
village on January 18, 1943. 
  Yeltsin said that would be an equestrian statue and added 
that everybody remembers how the marshal inspected the victory 
parade in Red Square in 1945. 
  "This is the right decision (to erect the monument)," 
Yeltsin 
said and added the symbols of Russian patriotism and valour 
should replace the cemetery of top Soviet leaders in Red Square. 
  The main Russian square houses the mausoleum where the 
mummified body of Vladimir Lenin lies. Behind the mausoleum are 
graves of top Soviet communist leaders and outstanding 
personalities. 
  Zhukov won the battle of Stalingrad, lifted the siege of 
Leningrad and seized Berlin, and most Soviet victories in world 
war two were connected with his name. After the war he became 
the Soviet defence minister and member of the ruling Politburo 
of the Communist Party. 
  It was he who actually led the arrest of Lavrenty Beria, 
head 
of the secret police and a close associate of Joseph Stalin, 
after the dictator died. 
  He supported Nikita Khrushchev when the communist leadership 
tried to oust him in June 1957, however Khrushchev, who feared 
the popularity of Zhukov, dismissed him from the post of the 
defence minister and Politburo member in the same year when the 
latter was on a visit in Yugoslavia. 
  Zhukov died in 1974.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz January 26 TASS -- The inauguration of 
Akhsarbek Galazov, first president of North Ossetia, took place 
today. 
  Putting his hand on the Constitution, the popularly elected 
president made a vow in the Russian and Ossetian languages: 
"When assuming the office of president of the Republic of North 
Ossetia, I swear to observe the Constitution, the laws of the 
Russian Federation and of the Republic of North Ossetia, to 
protect its statehood and territorial integrity, to respect and 
guarantee human rights, to ensure lawful interests of the 
multinational people of the Republic of North Ossetia, to 
promote their prosperity and wellbeing, to fulfil 
conscientiously the tasks I have been entrusted with." 
  Sergey Filatov, chief of staff of the Russian president's 
administration, who attended the ceremony, congratulated Galazov 
on assuming the office of president on behalf of President 
Yeltsin. He stressed that Galazov's election was a victory of 
the democratic forces of the republic. There is no doubt that 
Russia's revival is inseparably connected with the wellbeing of 
its regions. We should all work for peace and accord. 
  In his final address Akhsarbek Galazov cordially thanked all 
participants in the ceremony for their warm congratulations. 
"North Ossetia is a component part of Russia. Its multinational 
people cannot imagine their development in isolation from other 
republics, territories and regions of the northern Caucasus, 
from Russia. It is ready for political, economic and cultural 
cooperation with all areas of Russia and the Caucasus," he said.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz January 26 TASS -- "On instructions from 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, I warmly congratulate Akhsarbek 
Galazov with his taking office of president of the Republic of 
North Ossetia. I also congratulate the people who have such a 
leader." This was stated today in Vladikavkaz by Sergey Filatov, 
head of the Russian president's administration, at a meeting of 
the Supreme Soviet of the republic devoted to assuming office by 
the first president of the republic. 
  North Ossetia, Sergey Filatov stressed, has never suffered 
from anarchy. But it is necessary to change structures of 
power, this is the call of the time. The republic has been 
confidently carrying out democratic reforms against the 
background of social and political life in Russia. 
  Some republics, the head of Russian president's 
administration said, "believe that president is needed to 
protect the republic from the central power. This is an 
erroneous position. [The] president is necessary to become a 
connecting link between the center and the republic so that all 
our Russia lived as a single family". 
  I am sure, Sergey Filatov said, that the multinational 
people 
of North Ossetia "associate their revival with strong democratic 
power in the republic. This will help successfully resolve all 
complex problems in economics, political life and in the social 
sphere. What is more, this is possible with close interaction 
between all branches of power and the observance of the 
Constitution and Russian laws". 
  According to Sergey Filatov, Boris Yeltsin asked to convey 
that he would render all-round support both to the president and 
the people of North Ossetia.

  He said that his territory experienced a dire energy crisis. 
Meanwhile, the federal debt to Khabarovsk territory for the 
manufactured products and for the seasonal transportation of 
loads to the northern districts of the Amur region amounts to 
billions of rubles, said Ishayev. 
  The situation is aggravated by the forced stoppage of local 
industrial enterprises which cannot make planned payments to the 
federal budget.

<F P=106> [Report by Margarita Ziangirova: "Siberian Accord Decides </F>
Not To Appeal to Government"] 
  [Text] The first session this year of the "Siberian 
Accord" Interregional Association's Coordinating Council was 
devoted to questions of industrial policy and conversion. This 
time the heads of 19 republics, autonomous okrugs, krays, and 
oblasts from the Siberian region met in Omsk. 
  Having exchanged opinions, the members of the coordinating 
council concluded that different territories share many common 
problems. In this sense the experience of one of the programs 
of "Siberian Accord" -- Omsk conversion -- is particularly 
noteworthy. Despite the fact that only one-third of the funds 
required to implement the program have been allocated, the 
conversion program has nonetheless commenced. And it is already 
possible to speak of practical results. These include the An-74 
-- the first Omsk aircraft -- a tractor, and television sets. 
  But, sadly, everything could end there. Because there is not 
enough money to start series production of the new articles and 
goods. It is in this area that a common solution must be found, 
along with an answer to the question of what should be done 
next. If the country needs this aircraft, it means that we 
should pool the financial interests of all the region's oblasts. 
The coordinating council members viewed this means of 
integrating funds on mutually advantageous terms as one of the 
options for developing industry. Admittedly, other proposals 
were made too -- to appeal once again to the government to 
allocate money. But these suggestions were not supported by the 
majority, since there have already been many such appeals, but 
they have had little effect. 
  The conference participants adopted several fundamental 
decisions. These included the creation of new 
financial-industrial groups and an integrated data base, and so 
forth. 
  An organizational matter was addressed too. The new 
coordinating council chairman was elected. He is Valeriy 
Roshchulkin, deputy head of the Omsk Oblast Administration. The 
former council chairman -- Leonid Polezhayev -- has become the 
head of the interregional association.

  [Text] Vice President Yerik Asanbayev on 25 January 
received Korean Ambassador to Kazakhstan Kim Chang-kon at the 
latter's request. During the conversation they dealt with 
prospects for developing economic and cultural cooperation 
between our countries. 
  Bilateral official relations at present, noted Yerik 
Asanbayev, are exemplary and effective. South Korean 
businessmen in a short period of time have initiated production 
of televisions in Almaty and refrigerators in Karaganda. 
However, the dynamism of cooperation must be raised, especially 
in the sphere of providing credits to Kazakhstan. 
  To support the recently introduced national currency and to 
ease the transfer to a market economy we need support from 
outside, stressed the vice president. The republic needs to 
gather a critical mass of credits for a structural 
transformation of the economy and introduction of new technology 
in development of minerals. He expressed the confidence that 
the South Korean side, which at one time promised to allocate 
$350 million to Kazakhstan, will keep its word. Housing is 
built quickly and well in that country. To carry out the 
program of housing construction in our republic it is intended 
to make a close study of that experience in order to use it in 
action. Gratitude was expressed to the ambassador for 
humanitarian assistance to the value of 150,000 dollars, which 
had arrived that day in Almaty from Seoul. 
  Kim Chang-kon stated that he would exert every effort to 
strengthen friendly ties between the two countries, to improve 
economic links, and to attract businessmen from the Republic of 
Korea to Kazakhstan.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 26, BNS -- The passport office of a 
Russian police station in the former military base town of 
Paldiski in Estonia has still not turned over to Estonian 
authorities the files of the town's registry of residents. 
Russian officials earlier had promised to end the delay and 
hand the files over by Jan. 27. 
  The head of the Russian passport office at Paldiski today 
failed to turn out for a scheduled meeting with the Estonian 
commandant of the town, Col. Raul Luks, said Taimi Laar, 
municipal secretary at Paldiski. 
  Estonian officials say it is impossible to prepare for 
elections for the Paldiski town council or establish a normal 
civilian rule in the town until the files are delivered. 
  Justice Minister Kaido Kama, however, has said the files 
drawn up and held by the local Russian police office without any 
authorized supervision lately cannot be trusted. He said that 
even if the files were to be returned, Estonia would still have 
to call a new municipal census, and the country's own officials 
will have to register the town's legal residents anew. 
  Laar said the Russian passport office until very lately had 
continued issuing Estonian resident's passport inscriptions, 
which currently is the only means of confirming the passport 
holder's permanent resident's status. 
  She insisted that the office close its doors finally by 
Thursday. "If they won't close the doors by Jan. 27, we will 
have every reason to raise alarm," she added.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 26, BNS -- Leaders of the Petserimaa 
league, a lobbying group that stands for reunification of the 
Petseri/Pechory region with Estonia, expressed worries about the 
situation of Estonian citizens in the region now governed by 
Russia. 
  Russian authorities are at unease because the number of 
holders of Estonian passports is growing in the region, the 
leader of the Petserimaa league, Reet Tobre, said in a press 
conference today. 
  She said Russia was demanding that these people formally 
gave 
up their Russian citizenship. But this would also strip them of 
the right to own real estate in the region. After giving up 
Russian citizenship they would also have to apply for a special 
permit from Russian authorities to enter the border zone. 
  Tobre said Russia was constantly tightening its border 
regulations, thus making it more and more difficult for Estonian 
citizen residents to cross the border to Estonia. 
  The leader of the lobbying group didn't tell the number of 
Estonian citizen residents of the Petseri region, an Estonian 
territory between the two World Wars, saying she would do so 
only after Russia reveals the names of Estonian residents who 
have become officially Russian citizens. 
  The Soviet Union cut the region off from Estonia together 
with a strip of land in the North, east of the Narva river, and 
annexed the territories to Russia after World War II. 
  The Russian embassy in Tallinn so far has only said more 
than 
42,000 Russian citizens are living in Estonia. Embassy 
officials say they cannot reveal the names of Russian citizens, 
as Estonian authorities might begin a persecution of these 
people. 
  Tobre said that was rather the case with the Estonian 
citizens living in Russia.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Estonian government decided 
to close its trade mission in Ukraine. The prime minister's 
reason for this is the fact that the trade mission was set up in 
Ukraine a long time ago and has failed to fulfill the goals set 
for it. Furthermore, our trade mission has not yet been accepted 
in Ukraine to the required degree. Now that there is also an 
Estonian Embassy in Kiev, the trade mission's primary functions 
can be met through the embassy. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma, today 
received U.S. Ambassador to Russia Thomas Pickering, at the 
latter's request. According to the Federal Assembly's press 
service, the lengthy conversation touched on a broad circle of 
questions including the organization of the work of the State 
Duma and the priorities for its legislative work. 
  Rybkin noted that the plan for the work of the Duma has been 
coordinated with the activities of the president, the 
government, and other structures of power. The U.S. ambassador 
said that the United States was interested in the effective work 
of the Duma and was convinced of its necessity for Russia. In 
his opinion, its work will make it possible to resolve Russia's 
economic problems more quickly, including with the aid of the 
world community. 
  Pickering also proposed, on instructions from the U.S. 
Congress, assistance in organizing information technologies for 
the Russian Federal Assembly, ITAR-TASS reports.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 26 TASS -- Konstantin Zatulin, 
chairman of the State Duma's committee on CIS affairs, appealed 
to Russian parliamentarians on Wednesday to refrain from trips 
to the Crimea until after the second round of presidential 
elections there next Sunday. 
  He said such trips might provoke a "flare up of political 
passions" in and around this semi-autonomous republic within 
Ukraine, even though "nobody wants to steal Crimea from Ukraine 
overnight", or infringe on the right of "the Crimean people to 
express their will in deciding the peninsula's status". 
  Ukraine fears what it sees as an "unfavourable outcome" 
after 
the first round of the Crimean presidential elections on January 
16 revealed that a candidate representing the pro-Russian 
circles was in the lead. 
  Zatulin said Ukraine was unlikely to call off the second 
round of elections, a conclusion he drew after two days of talks 
with the Russian ambassador to Kiev and the Ukrainian ambassador 
to Moscow. "There is no danger that the second round of the 
presidential elections in the Crimea can be aborted", Zatulin 
said. 
  However, as a precaution, the Ukrainian parliament last week 
voted for an amendment to the Constitution giving Kravchuk power 
to annul any decision made in Ukraine or its "Crimean autonomy" 
if it runs counter to Ukraine's Constitution, laws or 
presidential decrees. In other words, Leonid Kravchuk is 
authorized to veto an unwelcome outcome of the presidential 
elections in the Crimea.

<F P=106> [Report by Petr Zhuravlev and Dmitriy Kuznets under the </F>
"Parliament" rubric: "Duma's Political Arithmetic. Were 
Committees Divided `Fairly?'"] 
  [Text] The exciting process of "the organization of the 
Duma's work" has unexpectedly ended in the peaceful distribution 
of the main posts among parliamentary factions. 
  There has been virtually no Duma faction displeased with the 
"organization." Only the "12 December Union" and the "Russian 
Path," groups that did not manage to register on time and, 
consequently, were not allowed to grab their share, were 
mightily displeased. The other factions resolved the issue 
amicably by adopting as a basis Gennadiy Zyuganov's scheme: 
"The organizational strength of each faction should be 
proportionate to its numerical representation at the State Duma, 
taking into account, of course, the faction leaders' opinions." 
  The communist leader even recommended that a mathematical 
method be used for calculating this: each elected post in 
parliament will be assigned a certain number of points, the 
points will be summed up, and the total number of State Duma 
seats will be divided by the sum. Thus the "price" of each seat 
will be calculated. Each faction, depending on its strength, 
may thus "buy" one post or another. As a result of further 
agreements, a joint "package" will be put together, which will 
be approved by the Duma. Presently it is hard to say if the 
faction leaders actually calculated anything, but the final 
distribution of the chamber's key offices fitted surprisingly 
well into Mr. Zyuganov's abstract mathematical model. For 
instance, only two persons were nominated to the posts of 
committee chairmen by the fairly numerous Agrarian Party [APR] 
faction (55 deputies) because the Agrarians ran out of "points" 
after Ivan Rybkin's election as State Duma speaker. The 
aggregate numbers of committee chairmen and their deputies from 
"Russia's Choice" and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
[LDPR] are equal -- the blocs hold 16 posts each. The "Choice" 
faction, however, comprises 78 deputies, while that of the LDPR 
has 63, so to strike "a fair deal" "Russia's Choice" was given 
the post of State Duma first deputy chairman, which was 
initially not foreseen, whereas the Liberal Democrats put up 
with "only" a deputy chairman. 
  In all, the LDPR leads in the number of "its own" Duma 
committee heads -- 5 out of 23. "Russia's Choice," the PRES 
[Party of Russian Unity and Accord], and the "New Regional 
Policy" factions have three chairmen each. The Agrarians, the 
communists, and the "Yabloko" faction nominated two chairmen 
each. It should be noted, however, that the value of the 
committees is somewhat different. The post of Geopolitical 
Committee chairman (held by LDPR's Viktor Ustinov) is clearly 
lower in importance than the post of Security Committee chairman 
(held by RFCP's [Russian Federation Communist Party] Viktor 
Ilyukhin). Still, there have so far been no specific objections 
in that regard from the Liberal Democratic chief. This may be 
attributed to the fact that the Geopolitical Committee is one of 
two State Duma committees where one faction (the LDPR's in this 
case) has an absolute majority. The second of these committees, 
on agrarian matters, is, of course, dominated by the APR. 
  There was no malicious intent, however, in APR's and LDPR's 
"occupying" one committee each; according to the State Duma's 
provisional rules of procedure, each deputy must be "assigned" 
to a committee, so no wonder that the Agrarians and the Liberal 
Democrats chose precisely those committees that suited them best 
according to their "area of expertise." The other factions were 
also given the chairmanship in committees of their "expertise:" 
"Yabloko," the budget and international affairs committees; 
"Women of Russia," on women's affairs; and the PRES, on regional 
policy, local authorities, and on CIS affairs. 
  The "fair" solution of organizational matters has so far 
proved only one thing: the communist-nationalist bloc of State 
Duma deputies, although it has a relative majority, did not 
venture to stage an open confrontation with the democrats; while 
the latter, having weighed it all, did not refuse to accept 
their due share. Only the disgruntled radical nationalists from 
the "Russian Path" called the day on which the personal 
"package" was approved "a black day for Russian patriots."

  [Text] On Wednesday night [26 January], the second unit of 
Lithuania's Ignalina nuclear power plant was shut down. 
  This nuclear power plant's information department told 
Interfax that after the first unit was switched off on January 
18 following a water leek, the second unit worked at a capacity 
of 1300 megawatts. 
  The same source announced that the second unit had been shut 
down following the failure of the manual control system for the 
reactor's stages (a button on the control board went out of 
operation). 
  The administration of the nuclear power plant stated that 
despite those malfunctions, the system of automatic control and 
the safety equipment remained in a working condition. 
  The reactor was shut down according to the safety 
regulations. The radiation situation did not change, says the 
administration's official press release. 
  Repair work has been done already and preparations are 
underway for putting the reactor back into operation, presumably 
on Friday. 
  In view of the 2nd unit's stoppage, Lithuania experienced a 
shortage of energy on Thursday, Lithuania's Deputy Minister for 
Energy Saulius Kutas told Interfax.

Communists"] 
  [Text] Vilnius -- Arrested Communists M. Burokevicius and 
J. Jermalavicius are now in Lukishskaya [as transliterated] 
Jail. The Lithuanian Prosecutor's Office is not carrying out any 
investigations, it is giving the "members of the professional 
underground," as they describe themselves, time to get 
accustomed to their new position. The first cross-examination 
showed that they do not really realize what happened. M. 
Burokevicius is still in the jail sick bay with cardiac 
insufficiency. 
  Meanwhile the Lithuanian General Prosecutor's Office has 
asked the corresponding bodies in Russia for the extradition of 
a few other people involved in the Vilnius coup case: Major 
General A. Naudjunas, Colonel J. Kasperavicius, and the leaders 
of the former USSR's power ministries, V. Kryuchkov and D. Yazov. 
  "We would never have gotten M. Burokevicius and J. 
Jermalavicius had Moscow not wanted this," K. Gashka, member of 
the Sejmas National Security Committee, told the newspaper 
RESPUBLIKA. He has no doubt that leaders of the Communist Party 
of Lithuania have been deliberately handed over to Lithuania so 
that a third country's tasks can be carried out by means of 
their trial in Vilnius. 
  What has happened has caused vehement discontent in Belarus 
among the Communist faction in the Supreme Soviet and set-tos in 
parliament. Belarusian General Prosecutor V. Sholodonov has 
given orders for an inquiry to be started into his subordinates' 
involvement in the "abduction" of Burokevicius and 
Jermalavicius. The parliamentary commission for national 
security, defense, and the fight against organized crime in 
Belarus has asked for the republic's internal affairs minister, 
V. Yegorov, and KGB Chairman Ye. Shirkovskiy to be removed from 
their posts (the former's resignation has already been 
announced).

  [Text] In his interview with Lithuanian national radio 
Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius stated that relations between 
Lithuania and Belarus may deteriorate after two pro-Moscow 
communist leaders, who were among the organizers of the 1991 
January crackdown in Vilnius, had been brought back from Minsk 
to Vilnius by the Lithuanian law enforcement officers. 
  The Belarusian MPs [word indistinct] their top law and order 
officials of handing over Mykolas Burokevicius and Juozas 
Jermalavicius to the Lithuanian side on an illegal basis. On 
Tuesday the Belarusian Parliament accepted the resignation of 
the Interior Minister and [words indistinct] service chief. 
  According to Prime Minister Slezevicius, the detention of 
the 
two communist hardliners was carried out successfully and had 
been coordinated with the law enforcement institutions in 
Belarus.. 
  Meanwhile chairman of the Belarusian Parliamentary Committee 
on National Security, Mechislav Gryb, claims that the two men 
were detained in violation of the Belarusian and international 
law. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Minsk on Tuesday Mr. Gryb 
stated that the cases nine other persons wanted by the 
Lithuanian law enforcement authorities would be reviewed on a 
separate basis and that any kind of, as he called, illegal 
handover, like that of Burokevicius and Jermalavicius, would not 
happen in the future.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 26, BNS -- The reaction of Belarusian 
authorities to the arrest of two Lithuanian communist leaders in 
Minsk will "undoubtedly cast a chill over our relations" with 
Belarus, Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius said on 
Lithuanian radio Wednesday. 
  The premier said he regrets such "energetic" reaction, which 
shows that Lithuania's neighbors "have not yet completely shaken 
off old principles and formulas." In Slezevicius' opinion, the 
problem also resulted from political tensions in Belarus. 
  The Lithuanian premier said the arrest operation in Minsk 
was 
indeed very successful and fully coordinated with Belarusian 
authorities. 
  Slezevicius said he will seek to further expand the earlier 
positive developments in Lithuanian-Belarussian relations.

Published"] 
  [Text] Vilnius -- The purpose of defense is to protect the 
independence, inviolability, and territorial integrity of 
Lithuania and also to guarantee its citizens' safety from 
external threats, the preamble to this document states. 
  In what situations can Lithuania's armed forces be used? The 
document answers this question by saying that aggression by 
another state or military alliance, civil war in neighboring 
states or an armed conflict between them which might spread to 
Lithuania, an invasion by uncontrolled military units or other 
armed groupings, a large concentration of military force near 
the Lithuanian border, or international terrorism constitute 
such situations. True, Lithuania prefers primarily political 
and diplomatic methods to eliminate threats. 
  The draft also points out that in strengthening its security 
Lithuania cooperates with other states and international 
organizations and bases itself on the universally recognized 
principles of international law. 
  The army constitutes the basis of Lithuania's defense 
system. 
  The section on cooperation with foreign states' military 
structures provides for participation in joint exercises, the 
training of joint peacekeeping subunits, and cooperation in 
guarding the state border.

  [Text] Baltic News Service has reported that Lithuanian and 
Kaliningrad negotiators failed to achieve any specific agreement 
on the transit of Russian passengers and cargo through the 
territory of Lithuania. 
  Yuriy Khlebnikov, an official from the international 
department at the Kaliningrad region administration office, told 
journalists at a news conference today that the talks failed to 
bring results. 
  The talks were headed by Virgilijus Bulovas, head of the 
group for the talks with the CIS and ambassador at large, and 
Harry Shmykhov, first deputy head of the Kaliningrad region. 
  A joint protocol has been prepared by the group experts from 
both sides, which confirms Lithuania's intention to open a 
Russian transit corridor on her territory. Although no dates 
have been mentioned, it is expected however that the corridor 
could start functioning at the end of the current year. Places 
in Lithuania will have to be earmarked and the procedure on how 
this transit will be controlled will have to be defined. 
  Lithuania is going to get acquainted with the experience of 
the West Berlin transit corridor, which was in operation until 
the Berlin Wall had been demolished. 
  It was announced that Lithuania proposed to simplify the 
procedure of granting transit visas at the border crossing 
points to cargo vehicles carrying so-called national economy 
goods. It was announced at the news conference in Kaliningrad 
that all the Russian passenger trains except two would travel 
through Lithuania non-stop and without border checks.

<F P=106> [Interview with Center Union chairman Romualdas Ozolas by </F>
unidentified reporter; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] While the politicians on TV are telling us about 
stabilization and improvement of living standards, what the 
people are saying is often quite the opposite: There is chaos in 
politics and there is stabilization of poverty in the families. 
  According to Romualdas Ozolas, Chairman of the Center Union 
and member of the Lithuanian Seimas, amid all this apparent 
confusion a common trend can be traced. 
  [Ozolas] In a nutshell this can be described as follows: 
fight for property. There are the left-wingers and there are 
the right-wingers, both sides are interested in grabbing as much 
as possible. This is carried out by using all means available -- 
those which are permitted and those which are not. Therefore 
the racket which is kicked up around it quite often amounts to 
demagogue, intrigue, and plain deception. 
  I think that this all should disperse after the distribution 
of property has been completed, after the state property has 
been transferred into the hands of individual persons. This is 
natural, only the trouble is that in the meantime, lawlessness 
and disrespect to state institutions reign. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Do you agree that the distribution of property 
will be completed by 1996, namely by the time when the term of 
the members of the current parliament runs out. Then, as Prime 
Minister Adolfas Slezevicius pledged, the law on declaration of 
income and property by the state officials will come into 
operation. 
  [Ozolas] I think that in principle this is what is being 
planned: to introduce the declaration on income and property 
around 1996. At that time, the current top-ranking state 
officials and those who rank below them and yet are capable of 
grabbing something will no longer have to worry about their 
reputation and especially about their political reputation. 
Whether they are re-elected or not, this would be of no further 
importance. Therefore the government will make efforts to stay 
in power until the end of term and then as God wills. 
  There is a possibility that the current left-wing government 
would have to step down earlier. It is possible that this could 
be beneficial, however, if the right-wingers propose a similar 
policy, which is to support large capital -- only then, I would 
not see any difference whether Lithuania is ruled by rich 
left-wingers or by rich right-wingers. [passage omitted] 
  I am very much concerned that the law on income and property 
declaration by the most senior state officials has not been 
introduced. I hope that we will push this law through although 
it will be somewhat spoiled, but then it would be better than 
nothing. It is simply annoying to hear about human rights 
violations in this matter when we know that this law is the 
basic means for the introduction of law and order in the 
financial life of the country. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] At today's news conference, you also spoke about 
international affairs and you mentioned that the forthcoming 
visit by the Ukrainian president may become one of the most 
important events of early 1994. 
  [Ozolas] The Ukraine is the most important neighbor and a 
possible ally of Lithuania in Central Europe. There will 
practically be no Eastern Europe without the Ukraine and the 
Baltic countries. There would be fragments and pieces of it, 
such as the Vyshegrad group or the Baltic states without it. 
The appearance of the sovereign Ukraine in Europe, and I say 
this believing that the Ukraine will continue to proceed towards 
her absolute independence from Russia... [pauses] If she fails 
to do this then our cooperation would be very much restricted. 
[passage omitted] However, if the Ukraine gets more and more 
independent, than I think both Lithuania and the Ukraine would 
have something to say concerning setting to right the life in 
Europe. 
  [Reporter] The Ukraine and Lithuania can cooperate not only 
in the economic sphere. You also attach great importance to the 
military union. 
  [Ozolas] To speak about a union would be too bold. So far 
there is no need to start designing such a union. However, if 
NATO continues to act as it has until now, then the countries of 
central and Eastern Europe would have to look for a way out of 
this situation and to set up their own security by their own 
efforts. Who else apart from the Ukraine can help Lithuania in 
such a situation and take care of the independence and security? 
In a political sense the Ukraine is neutral enough towards 
Lithuania and the Baltic states and the Ukraine has a great 
interest in Central Europe which cannot exist without Lithuania 
and the Baltic states. [passage omitted] These are mutual 
interests to put Europe in good order which would guarantee our 
independent life and peace in Europe. The Russian 
aggressiveness which is being manifested every day would 
inevitably influence Western Europe and I think that Western 
Europe will react to it by making similar steps. In this 
respect Central Europe has great possibilities for setting up a 
balance in Europe. 
  [Reporter] At the same time you said that NATO is at present 
not interested in cooperation with Eastern and central European 
countries. 
  [Ozolas] I would like to put it differently. It is 
interested not in pushing aside Russia which, feeling this 
interest of the United States as the main ally of Western 
Europe, endeavors to exert influence on Western Europe and the 
United States to be helpful. [sentence as heard]. This means 
the restoration of the former Soviet Union's expanse, and thus 
Russia mentions with exceptional ferocity the Baltic states. 
NATO responded to all this with silence. Clinton, our dear 
young president, also preferred to be silent. He even said that 
he himself would talk to the Baltic states about not insulting 
the Russian speaking people. 
  This is confusion by the U.S. president and much criticism 
has been levelled at him about this in his own country. I think 
that his telephone call to Latvia's president was an attempt to 
correct his behavior. But this is a very significant fact that 
a big state will always better understand another big state than 
a small one. 
  Therefore we say that we must pin our hopes on NATO, but 
mostly we must depend on our strength, incidentally, also with 
regard to our possible allies who live close by.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Algirdas Brasauskas, "exclusively </F>
for BERLINER ZEITUNG by IMA Press;" place and date not given: 
"We Want NATO Membership, But There Is No Feeling of Threat"] 
  [Text] [BERLINER ZEITUNG] Mr. President, what made the 
Lithuanians officially apply for NATO membership? 
  [Brazauskas] This decision is part of an ongoing process. 
Since the declaration of independence in 1990, we have proceeded 
along this path. This step is in line with the atmosphere in 
our society. 
  The precondition was the withdrawal of the Russian Army. 
Then I exchanged letters with NATO Secretary General Manfred 
Woerner. The resolution adopted by the Sejm on this issue on 23 
December was also of major significance in this respect. 
  [BERLINER ZEITUNG] Does your country feel threatened by 
Russia? 
  [Brazauskas] No. 
  [BERLINER ZEITUNG] When you applied for NATO membership, did 
you take into consideration possible reactions by Moscow? Were 
there any consultations? 
  [Brazauskas] We expected a reaction from Moscow. It was 
quite strong and reflects the complicated situation in Russia 
itself. Yet we do not believe that this reaction is a danger to 
the good relations between Russia and Lithuania. We hope that 
every European country will find its place in the new European 
security structures. 
  [BERLINER ZEITUNG] The collapse of the USSR began in the 
Baltic states. It seems as though the integration of former 
communist republics into Western structures begins there, too. 
Do you have the feeling that you are playing a special role and 
fulfilling a historic mission? 
  [Brazauskas] I do not believe that a single country, large 
or small, should be claiming that it is fulfilling a historic 
mission. 
  [BERLINER ZEITUNG] Do you think that Lithuania's acceptance 
by the European Union might be sufficient as far as military 
security is concerned, or will NATO membership remain the vital 
and imperative objective? 
  [Brazauskas] We do not expect the issue of our NATO 
membership to be settled positively in the near future. Yet we 
hope that the process leading to membership will soon be 
initiated. Lithuania believes that it will join NATO via the 
European Union. To use a metaphor, the European Union will open 
the door for us. If we are able to make use of the new 
opportunities, we will be much closer to NATO. 
  [BERLINER ZEITUNG] Mr. President, do you believe that in the 
current new historical period NATO should be giving way to new 
and broader security structures, including both the NATO states 
and the members of the former Warsaw Pact? 
  [Brazauskas] Forecasts are not very useful. What is 
important is for all countries from Vancouver to Vladivostok to 
feel secure in the future. 
  [BERLINER ZEITUNG] If Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, and the 
Czech Republic should become NATO members, Moscow will be left 
"outside." Do you think that this might have the effect of 
making Russia feeling psychologically isolated and less secure 
than today? 
  [Brazauskas] The system of antagonistic military blocs in 
Europe and the world should not be revived. We are obliged to 
ensure that the transformation and expansion of NATO does not 
provoke any hostile reactions from Russia. Lithuania does not 
want to isolate its eastern neighbors. I would like to make it 
clear that Lithuania's position toward NATO is not directed 
against neighboring states or other European countries, which 
must all find their place in the new security structures of the 
continent.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 26, BNS -- The Lithuanian president 
has appointed career serviceman Stanislovas Stancikas as the 
head of the Lithuanian State Border Defense Service. 
  Colonel Stancikas, 47, held the post in 1991-1992, but was 
dismissed by then Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius. 
  The new chief border guard received his military education 
in 
Russia. The president's entourage characterizes him as "an 
initiative worker with a strong feeling of responsibility." 
  Stancikas replaced Petras Dragunaitis who served as the 
temporary head of the service.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 26, BNS -- MP Andrius Kubilius, member 
of the parliament's rightist opposition, said it would hard to 
support an intiative of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party 
[LSDP] to take a no confidence vote in the Lithuanian government. 
  Kubilius said the LSDP statement, urging other political 
forces to back their initiative, lacks forecasts. "It is not 
hard to collect 28 votes that are necessary to start the no 
confidence process, but 71 votes are needed to express no 
confidence." This means that the no confidence vote would have 
to be supported by some members of the ruling majority, the 
lawmaker said. 
  Kubilius did not deny reports, however, that several members 
of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party would back to 
move in secret voting. In his opinion, the rightist opposition, 
the social democrats and those several members of the LDLP may 
become "a new parliamentary majority, which will be able to form 
a new government." 
  The lawmaker said the social democrats do not forecast 
possible steps of the president -- will he make the government 
resign or will he dissolve the parliament. 
  Kubilius said he has serious doubts about the indicated 
motives of the initiative. "I think that the accusations against 
the present government should be much more serious than 
non-fulfillment of the LSDP's instructions."

  [Text] Vilnius, 26 Jan, ELTA -- The decision by social 
democrats to achieve that Seimas should express non-confidence 
in the Government was called improper by the labour democratic 
faction. Social democrats had seven mandates in Seimas, so they 
could only support political forces which claim the resignation 
of the Government, member of labour democratic faction Albinas 
Lozuraitis told a news conference. 
  According to Lozuraitis, non-confidence in the Government 
could be expressed just by the right-wing political forces, but 
they remained silent. The right-wing opposition promised to 
hold a news conference on Wednesday [26 January] during which it 
was hoped to hear its opinion on the issues, however, the news 
conference was canceled. 
  During the news conference Lozuraitis said that the 
accusations brought by social democrats were not well-grounded. 
The ideas of social justice declared by them were supported by 
labour democratic party as well. Decisions adopted by the 
Government did not differ much from the requirements of social 
democrats, Lozuraitis noted. 
  Representatives of labour democratic party said that the 
reason of these accusations could be traced back to the 
rejection of the draft law on property declaration which was 
supported by labour democrats.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 26, BNS -- Leonid Mayorov, the commander 
in chief of the Russian Northwest Army Group, failed to sign 
around 100 documents on military property handover to Latvian 
authorities, said Ilgonis Upmalis, head of the bureau monitoring 
the troops' withdrawal. 
  The Russian servicemen have already quitted the 
installations, Upmalis said. Responsible officers handed the 
property over to Latvia, according to takeover-handover 
statements. 
  Mayorov, however, declined to sign the papers with a pretext 
he was not authorized to do that. 
  From the Latvian party, the papers were signed by State 
Property Minister Edmunds Krastins. 
  Mayorov may sign the papers after coordinating the signature 
with the representative of the Russian State Property Committee, 
who resides in Latvia, the army group's press officers told BNS 
that. 
  The resolution of the problem may take much time because 
many 
army bases have proprietors other than the Defense Ministry, 
said the bureau's deputy head Ludis Pavilonis. 
  Pavilonis claimed that the issue should be brought to 
interstate talks. Otherwise, the signature of documents on 
every separate property unit depends on the political situation 
in Moscow or else considerations.

<F P=106> [Article by Janis Kulmanis: "Zemribo: The Order of the </F>
North-Western Army Group Means Violation of Latvia's 
Sovereignty"] 
  [Text] Riga, 18 January -- The Chairman of the Latvian 
High Court Gvido Zemribo termed the North-Western Army Group 
commander's order, issued on 14 January, granting Russian 
military persons the right to use weapons in a conflict 
situation an evident violation of the sovereignty of the Latvian 
State. In a statement distributed today, G. Zemribo recalls that 
according to the Latvian Constitution, Latvia is an independent 
democratic state recognized by many countries of the world, that 
it is sovereign, and that "only the institutions of the Republic 
of Latvia have legislative, executive, and judicial power on the 
territory of Latvia and the power of any other state on it is 
absolutely excluded." The establishment of the principles of 
law in Latvia is the prerogative of the Latvian Government and 
other executive institutions. Nobody has granted such rights to 
the Russian Army. 
  DIENA has already written that the commander-in-chief of the 
North-Western Army Group has issued an order which states that 
"in the event of an assault or any other illegal action against 
Russian soldiers or military structures, they should be solved 
by all possible means, including the use of weapons. In the 
event of an attempt to occupy a military object, one should open 
fire" [na porozenije]. 
  As the chairman of the High Court therefore concludes, the 
order of the North-Western Army Group commander foresees that 
the decision about whether or not the action is lawful will be 
made by a soldier. "How dangerous this is and where it can take 
us, we can see in the examples of many bloody events on the 
territory of the former Soviet Union". 
  After having read this statement at a press conference, G. 
Zemribo recalled that the Russian Army is stationed on the 
territory of Latvia illegally, and that Latvia has no agreement 
with Russia stating that the soldiers of the Russian Army are 
not submitted to Latvian jurisdiction. Therefore they will have 
to answer for their deeds in accordance with the Latvian laws -- 
and this concerns the users of the weapons as well as those who 
have given them the respective orders. These crimes will be 
investigated by Latvian investigation institutions, not by the 
Russian military prosecution. 
  According to G. Zemribo, he is distributing this statement 
as 
the chairman of the High Court, and he does not wish to pay 
attention to the political aspect of this matter because "the 
court stays above politics". His only aim is to call Russia's 
attention to the possible juridical consequences of the 
announcement of the North- Western Army Group. 
  DIENA already wrote that the order of the chief of the 
North-Western Army Group was given after the incident that took 
place on 10 January between former president of Vidzeme District 
People's Deputies Council in Riga, Andrejs Rucs, and two 
generals of the Russian Army. Until now, only Latvian President 
Guntis Ulmanis has publicly expressed at a press conference his 
personal opinion that this order cannot be regarded as a correct 
answer to the president's correct behavior during the 10 January 
incident.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 26, BNS -- Latvian Prime Minister Valdis 
Birkavs, Economics Minister Ojars Kehris and Bank of Latvia's 
President Einars Repse left for Switzerland Wednesday [26 
January] to join the World Economics Forum in Davos. 
  The three-day forum will focus on the impact of geopolitics 
on the European security; global and regional 
micro-and-macroeconomics; unemployment; international trade; 
national and regional competition; and worldwide cooperation 
principles. 
  The issue of the Baltics as a temporarily undetermined 
geopolitical zone will be another topic for discussions. 
  The forum's activities will proceed in eight interest 
groups. 
Birkavs plans to join the subgroup of world economics leaders, 
according to the Government Information Agency (VIA). 
  Birkavs has prepared several speeches for the forum, 
centering on the role of the Baltic states in the world 
community and the economic stability and political security of 
Latvia. 
  "The consequences of the World War II are not completely 
removed yet. Regarding our country, they represent a 
stumbling-block that does not allow Latvia to integrate into the 
world processes efficiently and flexibly enough," Birkavs told 
VIA before his departure to the forum. "This obstacle will only 
vanish after the world recognizes its existence," Birkavs said. 
  During the forum, Birkavs is scheduled to meet with its 
Chairman Flavio Kotti, Nordic leaders, prime ministers of the 
Czech Republic, Belgium, Iceland, Hungary, Austria and India, 
and presidents of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Birkavs will 
also have talks with the World Bank leadership. 
  The Baltic premiers plan to stage a joint press conference 
Jan. 28 for journalists accredited to the forum. 
  Birkavs is scheduled to return home Feb. 1. 
  The World Economics Forum is an independent, 
non-governmental 
institution that unites leaders of states, businesses and 
sciences. It aims to promote cooperation of world countries in 
the name of economic and social progress. The first forum 
convened in 1971 at the Swiss government's initiative.

  [Text] Riga, January 26 (LETA) -- On Tuesday [25 January], 
agricultural workers from the Liepaja region met with the 
Latvian prime minister, Valdis Birkavs, in order to inform him 
of the present conditions of farmers in the region. The 
minister of agriculture, Janis Kinna, also participated in the 
meeting. Farmers are dissatisfied with high interests on the 
credit and insufficient state subsidies for agriculture. Prices 
have not been regulated, thus, a farmer has to sell five litres 
of milk in order to buy a litre of gasoline. 
  Janis Kinna told farmers that 11.9 million lats will be 
allocated for crediting of sowing. The state will allocate 
agricultural subsidies in the amount of 6.6 million lats. 
However, the term of the allocation of subsidies is yet 
unknown, money will be granted either in spring or in summer. 
  Valdis Birkavs pointed out that "it is not easy to go along 
the road towards normal agricultural production." Investments 
planned for the development of agriculture are insufficient. 
Speaking on the policy of the Bank of Latvia, Mr. Birkavs said 
that it is badly orientated to the economic development of the 
republic and that measures for strengthening of the bank system 
will be taken. 
  Today, the Latvian prime minister leaves for Switzerland in 
order to participate in an economic forum there. The president 
of the Bank of Latvia, Einars Repse, and economic minister Ojars 
Kehris, will participate in the forum, as well.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Irina Litvinova: "The Smiling </F>
Prime Minister Prefers To Act When Parliament Is In Recess"] 
  [Text] Riga -- Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis is in an 
unenviable position: He has admitted so many times that the 
east is still the Achilles heel of Latvian foreign policy, but 
unexpected political developments, such as the recent arrest of 
some Russian generals, keep putting off his desire to rectify 
the situation. 
  Guntis Ulmanis is new to politics. Until now, only his 
surname was well known: His grandfather's brother, Karlis 
Ulmanis, was perhaps the most striking figure in the history of 
prewar Latvia. Many were sceptical about the political future of 
the young Ulmanis, but they have been proved wrong. 
  He is frank, open, and not afraid to assume responsibility 
-- 
that is, of course, obvious. Ulmanis travels around the 
republic to meet people a great deal. According to the 
constitution, the president's functions are largely 
representative. He apparently does not bear political 
responsibility for the many decisions adopted by the Saeima 
(parliament) and the government. But it is clear that Guntis 
Ulmanis does not intend to be a mere figurehead. Admittedly, the 
president's potential to exert a more active influence on the 
situation is limited by legislation. That is why the quantity 
of his meetings with ordinary people and political leaders has 
yet to translate into quality of decisions and actions. Is this 
not indicated by the slight drop in the head of state's rating 
at the beginning of January: Words are all very well, but what 
about some action? 
  The Latvian leader's hobbyhorse is the unity of the Baltic 
countries. On taking up office, Ulmanis organized a meeting of 
the three Baltic presidents; and he constantly consults with 
them on all the most important aspects of foreign policy. 
  A feature of the Latvian situation is that the president, 
the 
Saeima, and the government have managed to retain unity. This 
conflict-free existence is perhaps explained by the fact that 
Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs' cabinet is formed by the ruling 
coalition in parliament, which incorporates the two leading 
factions: the Latvian Way and the Peasants' Union. When the 
Saeima is in recess, the Latvian government has extensive 
powers, which it uses. Valdis Birkavs, who headed the cabinet 
of ministers in the summer, is educated and a well-known lawyer. 
Journalists have nicknamed him "the smiling prime minster." 
  Birkavs can be seen as a veteran politician: He was deputy 
chairman of the Latvian Supreme Soviet. The prime minister 
endeavors to explain every move he makes and tries to avoid 
secrecy. 
  His team includes quite a few emigres, who have returned to 
help Latvia at this difficult time of revival. This certainly 
goes a long way to explaining their Western style of work, which 
means openness without fail. 
  Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs tries to maintain 
a 
balance between the wishes of emigre leaders -- many of whom 
have not returned to the republic but help by championing 
Latvia's interests in the world arena -- and the line taken by 
Latvia's own politicians. The minister believes that continuing 
talks with Russia will be the main task in 1994. 
  Janis Jurkans, Andrejevs' predecessor and current leader of 
the Latvian Accord faction, can be seen as the main opponent of 
the present foreign policy line. He believes that Latvian 
security can only be guaranteed by stabilizing Latvian society, 
which is impossible without serious consideration for the 
interests of Latvia's noncitizens, who make up one-third of the 
population. Jurkans does not dispute the idea of building a 
national, single-community state, but he proposes more liberal 
methods. 
  The desire to increase the percentage of Latvians in Latvia 
one way or another and bring their number up to a minimum of 75 
percent is producing laws which are drawing increasing attention 
to Latvia in the world community. Latvian politicians have 
requested the European Union to set up a program to repatriate 
people wishing to leave the Latvian state. In their view, 
Western Europe must carry some of the blame for the fact that 
the consequences of World War II have not been eliminated in 
Latvia, as reflected in the demographic situation. So far, 
however, these appeals have met with no response from Western 
countries. 
  Latvia is also dissatisfied because Russia does not have a 
comprehensive program to take care of its compatriots. The 
internal problem of how to treat permanent residents of Latvia 
who are not automatically granted citizenship, as is done in 
other former Soviet republics, has become one of the main 
problems of Latvian foreign policy. There is no doubt that this 
is holding back the development of normal relations with Russia. 
Incidentally, Russians are not the only ones to be left in a 
state of limbo: 81,200 Belarusians, 58,000 Ukrainians, 25,000 
Lithuanians, 23,000 Poles, 8,000 Jews, 3,000 Tatars, and 2,600 
Germans are also without citizenship.... 
  The foreign policy bias of the national radical opposition 
is 
well known: All those who have come to Latvia since 1940 are 
"colonists" with no rights other than the right to go back to 
their land of origin. And it looks as if this point of view is 
gaining increasing support. Judging by the results of 
sociological surveys, the positions of the Latvian Way faction 
were dramatically weakened on the eve of the local elections, 
but the hardliners have now strengthened them.

<F P=106> [Article by Martins Kibilds: "The Custom Tariffs Are </F>
Changing"] 
  [Text] Riga, 18 January -- According to a government 
decision, the customs tariff on imported goods has undergone a 
thorough change. 
  The main difference between the new and old tariff rules is 
the complete abandoning of the zero-tariff, that is -- every 
imported item will be subject to a customs duty, even if only 
symbolic, said Minister of Finance Uldis Osis at a press 
conference following a cabinet meeting. Besides, government 
ministries will no longer have the right to exempt certain 
categories of goods from customs tariffs, which has become a 
rather common occurrence. 
  The new customs tariffs introduced by the Cabinet of 
Ministers have their legal basis in Article 81 of the 
Constitution, therefore they do not need to be approved by the 
parliament and they are effective as soon as they are published. 
Nonetheless, the government is to present the draft law 
regarding import duties to parliament on 15 February. The rules 
issued today will be in force until this law is approved by the 
parliament. 
  The average customs duty will be 15 to 20 percent, and it 
will depend not solely on the type good, but also on the kind of 
agreement that binds Latvia with the country from which the item 
is being imported. The lowest duties (0.5-1 percent) are 
provided for imported raw materials, which were imported 
duty-free until now. The duty on semi-finished products will 
amount to 3-6 percent, and the highest tariffs are expected to 
be imposed on finished products. The main criterion for fixing 
the customs duty will be the demand for a particular product in 
Latvia and the possibility of manufacturing that item locally. 
If demand is low and the same goods are being manufactured in 
Latvia, the duty will be accordingly higher. For this reason, 
one of the highest duties (upwards of 50 percent) is expected on 
food, which -- as is commonly known -- Latvia can produce on her 
local market. 
  U. Osis expressed the view that the new tariffs -- in their 
ideal form -- would protect the domestic market from an invasion 
of outside goods. However, to achieve this, it is necessary to 
provide proper customs control and a duty collection mechanism.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Nadein article: "Boris Fedorov Says That Strobe </F>
Talbott Stabbed Him in the Back"] 
  [Text] Washington -- The U.S. Administration's restrained 
reaction to the absence of Yegor Gaydar and Finance Minister 
Boris Fedorov from the new government does not reflect the 
disappointment felt in the White House and the State Department. 
  Although some experts here do not absolve Yegor Gaydar from 
personal blame for the reformists' failure at the parliamentary 
elections, both Gaydar and Fedorov have become to a large extent 
symbolic figures for the West. Even their simple replacement by 
reformists of the same views but with different names would 
cause alarm to politicians and financiers. 
  Until the national economy demonstrates to international 
financial organizations its capacity to get through inflation to 
stability and prosperity Western countries will continue to hold 
back from experiments in search of a "special route" in the 
economy and, most importantly, will continue to hold on to their 
money. 
  The series of mutual recriminations which began immediately 
after the elections with the charge against Boris Yeltsin that 
he did not throw his authority behind the attacking ranks of 
Russia's Choice was continued by Jeffrey Sachs' attack on the 
World Bank and the IMF and a series of reports from Moscow 
talking about the indignation felt by Boris Fedorov and his 
colleagues at statements made by Strobe Talbott, the chief 
coordinator of the current administration's Russian policy. 
  The nub of the charges leveled by Sachs, until recently an 
adviser to the Russian Government, is that the World Bank and 
the IMF approached the needs of the former USSR in a stereotyped 
way. The entire current leadership must be changed, Sachs 
states, but the main blame lies with Western politicians, who 
will shortly spend on defense far more than Russia has required 
to find its place in the world. 
  Strobe Talbott's statement about "less shock, more therapy 
for Russians," which, as he has subsequently explained more than 
once, merely signified the need for greater attention to be paid 
to social problems but was in no way an appeal to slow down the 
pace of economic transformations in Russia, was described by 
Minister Fedorov as a "stab in the back." 
  For the time being the administration prefers to say 
nothing. 
For the time being Clinton is in no hurry to draw conclusions. 
And not because it is dangerous to hurry in politics. Since 
his visit Russia has clearly clearly fallen from the top of the 
president's agenda. It is perfectly likely that deep down 
Clinton is pleased with the turn of events, the changes in 
Moscow having afforded him the possibility, as it were, not to 
take resolute actions. 
  But one can definitely say that if some officials in the new 
Russian Government have tried to create an unfavorable 
impression of themselves in the American administration, they 
have entirely succeeded. A reporter who accompanied Treasury 
Secretary Bentsen on his trip to Moscow cites comments by 
Russian Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko indicating the 
latter's rejection of simple market truths. 
  To the American president's satisfaction, the situation in 
Russia has little impact on the overall level of his popularity. 
  Six months ago Bill Clinton set a record: His popularity 
during the first year since his election was the lowest for all 
American presidents since the country began conducting public 
opinion polls systematically in the thirties. 
  Now, on the eve of his first State of the Union address to 
Congress, the White House incumbent can be completely satisfied: 
54 percent of poll respondents approve of his administration. 
  The president still has one problem actually, but this is 
not 
seen as too substantial by the electorate: This concerns the 
Whitewater Development Corporation, where the Clintons' role has 
not yet been completely clarified. However, when polled, 
Americans are in no hurry to form a negative image of the 
president on the basis of hints and vague exposes in the mass 
media. 
  Six months ago Clinton sufferd setback after setback. After 
the failure of his job-creation proposals, two abortive attempts 
to appoint an attorney general, the military's opposition to the 
administration's intention to allow homosexuals to perform 
military service, and the sorry $200-haircut incident at Los 
Angeles aiport the president seemed flat on his back. 
  But the end of the year brought a series of successful 
international events, particularly those connected with the 
creation of free trade zones. The rising American economy and 
the successful European tour have all brought a triumphant 
conclusion to the young president's first year.

<F P=106> [Interview with Boris Grigoryevich Fedorov by correspondent </F>
Nikolay Svanidze in an office in Moscow on 26 January; from the 
"Details" program -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Svanidze] Boris Grigoryevich, today you spoke with 
the president. Did he accept your resignation or did he accept 
your conditions? How did your conversation actually finish? 
  [Fedorov] I repeat once again -- I have never resigned and I 
am not going to do so. I have not accepted the invitation to 
take a certain post in the cabinet which is being reorganized -- 
I mean the post of finance minister. The president confirmed 
this invitation and I, of course, did not accept it. I tried to 
explain my position to the president. He regretted that I did 
not accept this proposal. He advised me not to go away too far. 
  [Svanidze] Are you actually fulfilling the duties of the 
finance minister at the present moment? 
  [Fedorov] No, I am not. I have already signed an order. The 
order has not been yet formally issued, so I am still a 
minister. But I signed the order yesterday that my first deputy 
is to fulfill my duties. 
  [Svanidze] Dubinin? 
  [Fedorov] Yes. 
  [Svanidze] Boris Grigoryevich, you said in your statement 
that the country is rolling away and there is an economic coup 
in the country. What do you mean? 
  [Fedorov] I mean that if the government's program had some 
certain guiding lines, some certain methods of economic policy 
and instruments during the past two years and suddenly this 
direction has been changed -- instead of 3-5 percent inflation 
there will be 8-9 percent, although I could guarantee that in 
the present atmosphere, even 20 percent would appear to be a 
good result -- if we are told that economic romanticism has now 
gone and some non- monetary methods will be used and there will 
be some other policy, this means a change of policy [sentence as 
heard]. But I was invited by the president to carry out a quite 
definite, specific policy directed at fighting inflation and 
creating a normal market economy in our country. I worked on 
this for a year. 
  [Svanidze] You say that at the moment there are fundamental 
and open opponents of the policy of reforms in the government. 
Whom do you have in mind? 
  [Fedorov] The government is roughly the same as it was 
before, only the addresses, so to speak, of the people have 
changed. Clearly, that was the task in mind. You realize that 
even before the reorganization there was no majority of 
reformers in the government. They were in the minority, but 
there was an opportunity, at least, to carry out a certain 
policy. There was confidence in the premier. As soon as the 
premier changes course -- which he has spoken about -- naturally 
the status, say, of the minister of finance is reduced and the 
general correlation of forces in the government changes. In 
other words, naturally, to pursue the same course as before is 
extremely difficult. Therefore, if what the western press calls 
the worst central banker in the world -- Gerashchenko -- remains 
in the post of chairman of the Central Bank, then naturally, it 
becomes impossible to pursue a civilized normal financial 
monetary-credit policy. It is natural that those positions 
which Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Aleksandr 
Nikolayevich Zveryukha put forward were also fundamentally at 
variance from my own views and with those tasks which were set 
out in the program, and his presence in an office which was 
higher than the minister of finance, this also naturally makes 
this work very, very difficult, or rather, impossible. 
  [Svanidze] One must suppose that you did not hide these 
views 
from the president, and what was his reaction to them? 
  [Fedorov] I did not hide my views -- I never conceal my 
point 
of view. The president said that there was no need to hurry, 
that there might be changes, and that Gerashchenko, too, in 
principle, of course, was not going to be there for ever. He 
reaffirmed that he was opposed to changing the course. 
  [Svanidze] What is your prediction for inflation by the end 
of the year? 
  [Fedorov] As always, I gave my predictions in good time, way 
back in December -- a Christmas prediction, so to speak -- where 
I spoke about it increasing 20-fold, 2,000 percent, a rate of 
10,000, then I defined it a litle more precisely at something 
like a 12,000- fold drop in real per-capita incomes. There 
would still be a fall in production and capital investments and 
a devaluation of the savings of the population. In other words, 
I do not foresee any area where the indices will be any better 
than they were in 1993. On the contrary, we are getting close to 
going the same way as Ukraine. 
  [Svanidze] What do you intend to do now? 
  [Fedorov] Well, I'm a member of the Duma, and I intend to 
work there. 
  [Svanidze] In other words, you will move from a financier 
and 
an economist to becoming a professional politician? 
  [Fedorov] Well, you know, a minister, if he is a real 
minister, is also a professional politician. If he is just a 
cashier who dishes out cash then yes, of course, he is purely a 
technocrat. A technocrat has nothing to do with politics. I 
have pursued a policy and I have certain convictions that I will 
continue to uphold.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor Vasyl Tarasenko: "Ukraine Became </F>
Proprietor of Nuclear Weapons Much Earlier Than Great Britain, 
France, or China; Therefore, Ukraine Enjoys Full Rights of a 
Nuclear Power"] 
  [Text] Ukraine is constantly experiencing high pressure 
from different parties aimed at forcing Ukraine to eliminate its 
nuclear weapons. Economic, political, and financial pressure is 
followed by constant threats of increasing this pressure, though 
the history and the essence of this nuclear issue is well-known 
both in the CIS and the international community. 
  The reaction of public and state structures to this 
blackmail 
is diverse. A certain part, as the Supreme Council has stated, 
is ready to surrender to the domestic and foreign pro-imperial 
forces, which demand the elimination of nuclear weapons by 
Ukraine, while the supporters of the absolute independence of 
Ukraine refuse to eliminate nuclear weapons from Ukrainian 
territory. This part of the public cannot ignore the sad 
lessons from the history of Ukraine and the lessons connected 
with the role of nuclear weapons in the domestic and foreign 
policy of the imperial elite of the former USSR. 
  The international community knows that the leadership of the 
erstwhile USSR regarded the nuclear weapons as their strategic 
force, as effective pressure and their trump card in their 
expansionist foreign policy. Political and military structures, 
which existed in the USSR, specified the character of relations 
between the empire and the Republic of Ukraine. The empire used 
Ukraine's potential and suppressed its tiny sprouts of 
democracy, persecuted the tendencies for the revival of the 
national culture, and threatened all the attempts to gain 
autonomy, saying nothing about the creation of an independent 
state; it depressed Ukraine both morally and physically with the 
help of penitentiaries, working camps, forced hunger, and the 
murdering of the cream of Ukrainian humanitarian and 
scientific-technical intelligentsia. 
  Have not you heard threats and claims from Moscow -- the 
capital of the Russian Federation -- to divide Ukraine or to 
liquidate its independence along with demands to do away with 
Ukrainian national- democratic forces? Does not the notorious 
decision of the Russian legislature from 9 June 1993 repeat the 
black sides of Ukrainian history? Most importantly, this 
decision was adopted practically unanimously with seven 
abstentions and three rejections. Not only well-known 
chauvinists and supporters of the revival of the empire voted 
against it, but also the deputies who consider themselves 
democrats. In my mind, a certain part of the Ukrainian 
population, which has an ironical attitude toward this decree, 
is making a terrible mistake. The fact that this decree on 
Sevastopol was not implemented today means that it will be 
implemented tomorrow. 
  We should not ignore the fact that tactical nuclear weapons, 
withdrawn to Russia, have not been destroyed but have been 
carefully stored. In the midst of all these frightening 
circumstances, Ukraine is forced to repeat the same actions with 
its strategic nuclear weapons. 
  It seems to me that the high Ukrainian authorities differ in 
opinion on this issue. Otherwise, how could you interpret the 
17 August 1993 statement of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev during his visit to Sweden on the fact that in several 
days, Russia and Ukraine are going to sign an agreement on the 
elimination of strategic nuclear weapons stationed on the 
territory of Ukraine. In turn, our former Foreign Minister K. 
Morozov negatively commented on Kozyrev's statement and refuted 
it. Briefly, Ukrainian Foreign Minister A. Zlenko issued his 
statement refuting Morozov's commentary. Therefore, my opinion 
on the lack of unanimity in the Ukrainian Government has a 
strong footing. 
  However, currently, only nuclear weapons can guarantee the 
security and independence of Ukraine. We should not be so naive 
and shortsighted as to take seriously the promises of the United 
States to be our guarantor of independence because recent years 
have demonstrated a real price of such "guarantees." 
  In addition, the issue is being discussed in a topsy-turvy 
fashion. The statement, which says that Ukraine, by refusing to 
eliminate its nuclear weapons, becomes an illegal nuclear power 
and promotes the proliferation of nuclear weapons, is 
ungrounded. Or, perhaps, you can compare Ukraine with the North 
Korea, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq which have no status of being a 
nuclear state but wish to gain it. In reality, Ukraine, as a 
sovereign republic within the USSR, became proprietor of 
nuclear weapons much earlier than Great Britain, France, or 
China, because it became a nuclear state simultaneously with the 
USSR. From the very beginning of its existence as a nuclear 
state, Ukraine has been and is a sovereign subject of the 
international community. Indisputable facts prove this concept. 
For example, Ukraine participated in the San Francisco 
Conference in 1945 and it signed the UN Statute. In addition, 
Ukraine has also signed the peaceful post-war agreements with 
Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, and Romania.... 
  Ukraine, along with Great Britain, the United States, 
France, 
and other countries, is a member of numerous international 
organizations. Twice, it was elected a UN Security Council 
member. Moreover, the Russian Federation has never had such 
international prestige. Therefore, the legal international 
status of Ukraine after World War II has been similar to that of 
other independent states. 
  I would like to add one more fact. Ukraine has suffered 
materially, financially, and ecologically during the process of 
the creation of the USSR nuclear missile potential. Most of 
these nuclear weapons were produced on the territory of Ukraine 
at Ukrainian factories, and by hundreds of thousands of 
Ukrainian workers, engineers, and researchers. A considerable 
amount of these nuclear weapons were stored in Ukrainian 
territory. All this gives Ukraine the right to say that it has 
been and is a nuclear power, along with Russia, and the nuclear 
weapons stationed on its territory have been, from the very 
beginning, the property of the Ukrainian state, though the 
imperial circles of the former USSR cynically ignored Ukraine's 
international legal status by making it a colony, while its 
military potential with nuclear missiles was considered to be 
the USSR's property. 
  These circumstances give no right either to Western or to 
Eastern countries to demand that Ukrainian nuclear weapons be 
eliminated. According to international law, Ukraine could demand 
that the United States, the Russian Federation, Great Britain, 
France, and China, simultaneously with Ukraine, eliminate their 
nuclear weapons. Therefore, both West and East should realize a 
certain reality: The existence of Ukraine as a nuclear state has 
not upset the balance of power in the world; the formal 
appearance of Ukraine on the list of nuclear states has not 
added any additional units of weapons on the international 
arena. In fact, everything has remained without any changes. 
Political tricks will amount to nothing. West and East should 
realize that they can discuss the destiny of Ukrainian nuclear 
weapons only during the talks with other nuclear states, among 
which Ukraine will be a full-fledged member.

  [Text] Baku (January 25) TURAN--Armenia asked Russia to 
help in solving the problems regarding displacement of Russian 
troops at the borders of Azerbaijan with Iran. This problem was 
briefly discussed during the talks between Russian and Armenian 
Ministers of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev and Vahan Papazyan 
on January 20 in Moscow, a reliable source from Russian Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs reported. 
  Yerevan believes, that "being cut off from Iran by a Russian 
buffer, Azerbaijan will be more complacent at the negotiation 
table, and at the fronts as well". 
  The same source informed, that "the Russian party has the 
impression, Armenian side is looking for a respite after the 
serious defeats it was incurred during the recent battles." 
  According to the plan, Azerbaijan is to give broad political 
autonomy to mountainous Karabakh, "to offer as a gift", Shusha 
to the Armenians and to work out a plan for "humanitarian 
corridors" from Armenia to mountainous Karabakh via the towns of 
Lachin and Kelbadzhar. 
  This plan of Andranik Mihranyan, Russian president's adviser 
also envisions the creation of a demilitarized buffer zone, 
along all the borders of mountainous Karabakh. The 
responsibility for administrative-legal control in the zone will 
be carried out by the Russian peacemaking forces. 
  Representative of so-called RMK [Republic of Mountainous 
Karabakh] Arkadiy Gukasyan, as a member of delegation from the 
Republic of Armenia was participating in negotiations with 
Kozyrev. However, according to the official report of Russian 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev met Papazyan and 
Gukasyan separately.

  [Text] I shall familiarize you with a statement by Georgian 
Deputy Prime Minister Tamaz Nadareishvili. With obvious 
instigation from Vladislav Ardzinba's fascist regime, the 
criminal and socioeconomic situation in Abkhazia has sharply 
exacerbated. It can be said with confidence that complex 
anarchy is reigning there. The law enforcement bodies fail 
completely to monitor the situation, let alone the repressions 
carried out against the remaining Georgian population. 
Abkhazians and the Russian speaking population -- Russians, 
Armenians, Greeks, and others who are forced to leave the 
autonomous republic of Abkhazia and seek refuge somewhere else, 
are also alarmed. 
  In only the Ochamchire and Gali rayons over the last three 
months -- October-December -- about 40 Abkhaz combatants were 
killed in clashes between separate individuals and armed units 
over pillaged goods. On 10-11 January this year, almost a real 
war was waged between the Abkhaz population of the villages of 
Chlou and (Arasartikhi) in Ochamchire rayon. Famous people 
living in Abkhazia are falling victim to the lawlessness of 
Abkhaz combatants and mercenaries. The public was alarmed over 
the news of the beastly killing of Shitnik, the chief doctor of 
Sukhumi's ambulance service. Especially worrying are instances 
of the mass killing of people of various nationalities. The 
mercenary executioners Balov, Smetanin, and Krasnov set up an 
horrific slaughterhouse in the village of Odishi in Sukhumi 
rayon as a result of which about 30 people were killed, mostly 
of Greek nationality. 
  It is obvious that we are dealing with the genocide of the 
Greek population. Against this background, the populist 
statement by the Gudauta leader [Ardzinba] about the need for 
those Greeks who were evicted from Abkhazia in the 1940s to 
return to their homes can only be described as cynical. 
Drawing your attention to the above-mentioned atrocities, we 
call on the world community to strictly condemn the criminal 
acts committed by the Abkhaz combatants and mercenaries as well 
as their Gudauta patrons.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 26, BNS -- The Ignalina nuclear power 
plant began preparations Wednesday [26 January] for a start-up 
of its first reactor that was shut down Jan. 18 when a crack was 
detected in the reactor's emergency cooling system. 
  Viktor Shevaldin, Ignalina director, said the reactor will 
start to operate at a minimum output Friday and should reach its 
previous 750-megawatt output by Monday. 
  Shevaldin said a thorough examination of the crack in the 
emergency cooling system confirmed preliminary forecasts that 
the stoppage should be rated zero on the International Atomic 
Energy Agency scale and can be regarded as "a minor incident." 
  The Lithuanian State Atomic Energy Inspection gave 
permission 
to start the reactor when the defect was repaired.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Pavel Spirin, Vladimir Fedoruk </F>
and Georgiy Shmelev] 
  [Text] Beijing January 27 TASS -- "In shaping its foreign 
policy Russia proceeds from the strategic character of its 
good-neighbourly relations with the People's Republic of China. 
All the necessary prerequisites have been created in relations 
between the two states for ushering in a new stage of 
constructive partnership", Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev told Chinese political scientists at the People's 
Diplomacy Institute of China here today. 
  "Two 'continents' of modern civilisation -- Russia and China 
-- have firmly embarked upon the road of good-neighborliness and 
cooperation," he noted. "Traffic along this road was opened by 
President Boris Yeltsin's official visit to the People's 
Republic of China. Today, it is high time to consider the 
possibility of holding a second summit meeting, possibly already 
this year." 
  The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry formulated several 
principles of Russia's "Eastern policy", which proceeds from the 
growing importance of the region for the country's future. The 
Russian Federation maintains stable and balanced relations with 
all the nations, realising that the system of inter-state 
relations in the region, as in the world as a whole, has always 
been and will remain multi-polar. 
  The danger of major military conflicts is now lesser than 
ever since the end of the Second World War. "However, Kozyrev 
continued, there are quite significant sources of tension, not 
only inherited from the `Cold War', but also engendered by new 
problems. They include the problem of access to the resources 
of the Pacific ocean, including the sea bottom, and several 
border disputes. The upswing of religious and nationalistic 
extremism has found dramatic expression in Afghanistan, and is 
now threatening Tajikistan." [quotation marks as received] 
  "If we fail to resolve these problems in Asia by joint 
efforts, we shall be risking to get a very `explosive mixture', 
indeed," he added. "The most important question of all is the 
danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and missile 
technologies. Such a turn of events is not in the interests of 
the security of the entire region, including Russia, China and 
India," the minister stressed. 
  "The economic role of the Asia-Pacific region, which already 
accounts for 60 per cent of the world's industrial output, will 
apparently grow even further. In this sense, the XXI century 
will doubtlessly be known as the `Pacific age'. This growth of 
national might will not pose a threat to neighbours, but on the 
contrary, will create conditions for economic growth. In Asia, 
as in other parts of the world, economic progress contributes to 
progress in ensuring man's basic rights and liberties," Kozyrev 
stated. 
  Touching on the phased formation of a joint security system, 
the minister noted that Russia moves to set up a centre for 
preventing conflicts, to found a regional institute for 
scientific research in this domain. 
  At the same time, Kozyrev moved to draw up principles for 
weapons trade in the Asia-Pacific region, based on 
recommendations of the U.N. Security Council. Moreover, the 
Russian foreign minister believes that it is necessary to rule 
out attempts to interfere with normal commercial deals on the 
armaments market under trumped up excuses. 
  Kozyrev believes that both countries could jointly make an 
important contribution to regional security and cooperation. 
Guided by its policy of good-neighborly relations with the 
People's Republic of China, Russia remains fully dedicated to 
the principles of the Declaration on the Principles of Mutual 
Relations, signed at summit level at the end of 1992. This 
includes the entire complex of commitments assumed by both sides 
not to use force against each other in any form whatsoever, 
including the commitment not to be the first to use nuclear 
weapons. This is in line with the spirit and defensive nature 
of Russia's new military doctrine," Kozyrev said. 
  Kozyrev noted with satisfaction the Russo-Chinese 
cooperation 
in the U.N. Security Council. However, he said that 
peacekeeping and the implementation of peacekeeping operations 
remained among the most acute problems. He especially noted 
that Russia, together with other CIS nations, was now engaged in 
a peacekeeping operation in Tajikistan, "the purpose of which is 
to check the expansion of instability in this important region, 
which is close to China, too". Kozyrev expressed the hope that 
Russia would get more "comprehensive assistance" from the United 
Nations, the CSCE, and other international organisations. "This 
would be a better solution than the groundless statements on 
Russian neo-imperialism, made from time to time in the West," 
the minister stressed. 
  The two states, as permanent members of the U.N. Security 
Council, are also called upon to help solve the problem of 
nuclear weapon on the Korean peninsula on the basis of 
guarantees from the International Atomic Energy Agency," the 
minister added. 
  Turning to economic cooperation with China, Kozyrev called 
for its "qualitative development". He exressed Russia's 
readiness to take part in large-scale projects on the territory 
of China, including the construction of the world's largest 
"three gorges" hydraulic power coplex and in the modernisation 
of Chinese plants, built with the help of the former Soviet 
Union. 
  "It is absurd for Russia to counterpoise the 'Western' 
European and 'Eastern' Asian directions of its foreign policy. 
China has always been and will remain a reliable and good 
partner in the system of Russian global interests," Kozyrev 
stressed.

  [Text] Moscow, Jan. 27 KYODO -- Russia has proposed a 
joint economic development zone with China on a disputed island 
on the Amur River that forms the border between the two 
countries, a high ranking Russian Foreign Ministry official said 
Thursday [27 January]. 
  The official told KYODO NEWS SERVICE that Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev presented the proposal to his Chinese 
counterpart Qian Qichen when the two met in Beijing the same 
day. 
  The official said Kozyrev suggested establishing the zone on 
Greater Ussuri Island, known in Chinese as Heixiazi Island. The 
Amur river is known as the Heilong river in Chinese. 
  If the Chinese side agrees to the proposal, it could serve 
as 
a "model" for resolving a border dispute between Japan and 
Russia over four islands to the north of Japan, the official 
said. 
  The disputed islands are Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and 
the 
Habomai islet group, all northeast of Hokkaido. They were 
seized from Japan by the former Soviet Union at the end of World 
War II. 
  In 1991, China and Russia signed an agreement settling some 
of their differences over their common border in the east, but 
several portions remain in dispute, including islands in the 
Amur River, where Chinese and Soviet soldiers fought battles in 
1969. 
  The official said Kozyrev and Jiang agreed that Chinese 
president Jiang Zemin will visit Moscow for the first time in 
either October or November this year. 
  The official said that prior to the visit, Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will visit Beijing in May for talks 
with Chinese leaders, and Qian will then visit Moscow to 
finalize details of agreements to be signed during Jiang's visit.

  [Text] In Beijing today talks started between Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Chinese Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen. Our special correspondent Viktor Levin reports: 
  [Levin] As an official of the Russian Foreign Ministry 
announced, at a closed meeting of the foreign ministers of the 
two countries there was a discussion of problems raised at the 
conference in Blagoveshchensk. There, the heads of 
administration posed rather acutely the question that during the 
regulation of border crossings and the normalization and 
regulation of contacts between the two countries one should not 
forget, and one cannot forget, that these links are of vital 
significance to the inhabitants of these regions. The 
regulation and settlement should not damage the normal 
commercial and economic relations between the border provinces 
of China and Russia. 
  There was also discussion of the situation on the Korean 
peninsula. We do not know what the ministers said specifically, 
but one can surmise since both sides are very concerned about 
the plans of the DPRK to manufacture nuclear arms. Russia and 
China's positions coincide. Such a gloomy prospect places both 
sides on their guard. 
  In my view, many of the cards that the diplomats are holding 
close to their chest, so to speak, were displayed by Andrey 
Kozyrev, himself speaking at the Chinese People's Diplomacy 
Institute. Speaking of cooperation by Russia and China in the 
Security Council, he said that there are practically no problems 
being discussed in that body of the United Nations on which 
Russia and China have insurmountable differences or 
confrontation. On all questions, the minister stressed, there 
exists a very high degree of mutual understanding. 
  In his speech at the People's Diplomacy Institute, Andrey 
Kozyrev also revealed the thesis of constructive partnership. 
He mentioned it during the talks and now from this speech one 
can draw definite conclusions. Above all, the Russian foreign 
minister said, we propose making new strides on the road to 
strengthening mutual trust and ensuring mutual security. 
  It must be said that China received guardedly the new 
Russian 
military doctrine in which the provision of non-first use of 
nuclear weaponry is absent. But to the Chinese side's questions 
a precise and clear answer was given. 
  In the declaration signed during the summit meeting in 1992, 
or to be more precise in December 1992, when Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin was in China, it was stressed that both sides 
renounced the first use of nuclear weaponry and the minister 
again stressed this principle.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Grigoriy Arslanov, </F>
Vyacheslav Tomilin, and Georgiy Shmelev] 
  [Excerpts] Beijing, 27 Jan (ITAR-TASS) -- Russia and China 
see the preservation and development of long term bilateral 
relations of good neighborliness, friendship, and mutually 
beneficial cooperation as the most important condition for their 
prosperity and stability and a weighty factor in international 
security. This was emphasized at talks between the Russian and 
PRC foreign ministers that were held today at the Diaoyutai 
residence in Beijing for honored guests. 
  The heads of the two countries' foreign policy departments 
discussed a set of issues connected with preparations for a 
return visit to the Russian Federation by PRC Chairman Jiang 
Zemin. He is expected to arrive in Moscow for the second 
Russian-Chinese summit meeting in the third quarter of this 
year. The visit will be preceded by a trip to Beijing by 
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and a trip to Moscow 
by PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. 
  The coming Russian-Chinese summit meeting, Andrey Kozyrev 
said during the talks, is meant to raise relations between our 
two neighboring states to a new level, a level of constructive 
partnership. The development of Russian-Chinese links, he 
emphasized, is of priority importance in Russian foreign policy, 
which is not subject to any temporary variations. 
  China, the PRC foreign minister noted in turn, attaches 
great 
importance to dialogue and contacts between the leaders of the 
two countries, which promote deepened mutual understanding and 
trust. 
  The ministers stressed the importance of the set of mutual 
commitments by the sides not to use force against one another in 
any form, including not being first to use nuclear weapons. 
These fundamental accords were reached at the first 
Russian-Chinese summit meeting in December 1992. 
  After their talks the ministers signed an intergovernmental 
agreement about border crossing points between the two 
countries. The document specifies the legal and technical 
mechanism for the functioning of the crossing points and the 
procedure for their organization. These urgent matters, 
incidentally, were discussed at a regional conference of Far 
Eastern administration chiefs in Blagoveshchensk, in which 
Andrey Kozyrev took part, and during his meeting with the 
leadership of China's Heilongjiang province and the town of 
Heihe before his arrival in Beijing. So far there are 21 
crossing points along the Russian-Chinese border. Last year 
over 2.5 million people crossed the border from both sides. 
  A protocol was also signed on regular consultations between 
the Russian and Chinese foreign ministries on matters of 
interest to the sides. [passage omitted] 
  In the evening Andrey Kozyrev took part in the presentation 
of a Russian art exhibition at the Russian Embassy in Beijing. 
Works by the well-known artist Tatyana Nazarenko are 
represented in the display. Examples of traditional national 
handicraft and Russian costume were presented by Leonora 
Gorbunova, general director of the Ivanovo history museums. 
  The Russian foreign minister will be received tomorrow by 
PRC 
Chairman Jiang Zemin and will have a meeting with PRC Prime 
Minister Li Peng. In the afternoon he will fly to the Shenzhen 
special economic zone in southern China.

  [Text] Beijing, 28 Jan -- "Our visit is taking place on the 
eve of the most popular holiday in China -- Chunjie -- the 
holiday of Spring. This is a good omen for the further 
development of Chinese- Russian relations," PRC President Jiang 
Zemin stated at the Zhongnanhai party and political residence 
today during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, who is here on an official visit. 
  The leader of the PRC said that he was glad about the 
meeting 
with the Russian minister and cited a Chinese proverb in this 
connection: "Meetings with old friends are a source of 
particular joy." Jiang Zemin recalled that during the visit to 
Beijing by Russian President Boris Yeltsin in December 1992, a 
conversation rich in content took place between the heads of the 
two states. 
  Andrey Kozyrev, for his part, noted that the Chinese and 
Russian new years are starting with confirmation of a course 
aimed at goodneighborliness and partnership, the foundations for 
which were laid during the visit to Beijing by Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin. Kozyrev handed to Jiang Zemin a personal message 
from Boris Yeltsin containing an invitation to make an official 
visit to the Russian Federation.

  [Text] Beijing, 28 Jan -- This morning Li Peng, prime 
minister of the PRC State Council, received Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who is here on an official visit, at 
the Zhongnanhai party and government residence. 
  Greeting the Russian minister, Li Peng stressed that the 
visit of Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Beijing at the end 
of 1992 was an exceptionally successful one, that fruitful and 
business-like conversations on all aspects of Chinese-Russian 
relations took place. Ties between the PRC and Russia, Li Peng 
noted, are developing successfully on the basis of friendship, 
good-neighborliness and mutual advantage, in spite of the 
changes in the world and in our countries. 
  Andrey Kozyrev, in his turn, said that the purpose of his 
visit is not only to maintain the relations that currently exist 
between the two countries, but also to further expand them, to 
come out on a new, higher level of development in relations. In 
this respect, he noted, we intend to discuss the forthcoming 
visit to Moscow by PRC President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese 
leaders. 
  The Russian minister conveyed very best wishes from the 
Russian president and his words that Russia does not intend to 
back down even a single step on reform, on foreign policy, a 
priority trend in which is the development of goodneighborliness 
and partnership with China.

  [Text] Beijing, 28 Jan -- The "constructive partnership" 
which Russia is offering its eastern neighbor China implies a 
new, qualitatively higher level of contacts and ties between the 
two states. This was stated in Beijing today by Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev at a news conference for Chinese and 
foreign journalists. Replying to a question put by the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent, Kozyrev explained: "We shall not 
forget that China and Russia are two great regional powers, in 
several regions simultaneously moreover, be it central, western, 
or southeast Asia, that our regional cooperation embraces half 
the world. Moreover both countries are global powers, permanent 
members of the UN Security Council. 
  In the economy, the minister continued, saying "constructive 
partnership" presupposes a transition to higher and more stable 
forms of cooperation. First and foremost this applies to cross 
border contacts in which, in the opinion of Andrey Kozyrev, "a 
change over must be made from petty commercial deals to 
long-term joint projects." 
  Summing up the working part of his visit to the PRC, the 
Russian minister noted that in conversations with PRC chairman 
Jiang Zemin, State Council Premier Li Peng, and Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen, a mutual striving to develop cooperation was 
confirmed, and "the strategic, long-term nature of bilateral 
mutual relations that is not subject to the vacillations of the 
state of the market, the foundations of which were laid during 
the visit of Russian President Boris Yeltsin." 
  "We have mapped out a program of mutual visits, the 
culmination of which should be a trip to Moscow by PRC Chairman 
Jiang Zemin," the Russian minister pointed out.

  [Text] Beijing January 28 TASS -- The Russian and the 
Chinese sides engage in the work to delimit the border. The 
sides will disscuss the posibility of jointly using some islets 
so as not to cause damage by economic activity and not to create 
tension on the border. "An understanding on this matter has 
been reached in Beijing", Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, on a visit in China told a news conference on Friday. 
  Answering questions from Western correspondents, Kozyrev 
said 
that the military-technical cooperation with China is developing 
in the framework of goodneighbourliness and partnership. 
  "I have never denied the importance of military-techical 
cooperation. Quite the contrary, I have declared openly in 
China and in many other countries for the widening of this 
cooperation", the minister said. 
  Talk in the West about "Russian neoimperialism" distracts 
the 
attention from real problems connected with Russia's special 
role in the CIS and in the maintenance of stability in Eurasia, 
Kozyrev noted. There will be no changes in the course. The 
December elections and, what is the main thing, the adoption by 
nationwide voting of a new constitution have created an even 
more durable basis for the presidential foreign policy, he said. 
  Kozyrev said nuclear safety in the Korean peninsula was 
discussed at the negotiations in Beijing. The minister said the 
sides had very close positions, both being aware of the need to 
preserve the nuclear nonproliferation regime and treaty. Action 
in this area must be firm, balanced and cautious, he said. 
  "On my part, I noted that for Russia and China and for other 
countries of the region the problem of nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons, delivery vehicles and related missile 
technologies is a matter of safety. We are vitally interested 
that such armaments should not be brought into zones of 
conflict", Kozyrev said. 
  Regarding his forthcoming trip to the Shenzhen economic 
zone, 
Kozyrev said there is no need for blindly copying the experience 
of economic development of other countries.

  [Text] Beijing January 28 TASS -- Russian-Chinese trade is 
constantly expanding and the turnover totalled 7.68 billion US 
dollars in 1993 which is a 30 per cent increase compared to the 
previous year, according to Shi Guangsheng, Chinese deputy 
foreign trade and foreign economic cooperation minister. 
  He told a press conference on Friday [28 January] that 
Chinese exports to Russia grew by 15 per cent and amounted to 
2.69 billion dollars while Russian imports increased by 41.4 per 
cent and totalled 4.99 billion dollars. 
  Currently 27,000 Chinese are working in Russia where there 
are 2,000 joint ventures in which the share of the Chinese 
capital totals 82 million dollars, according to the deputy 
minister. 
  Georgraphic advantages and similarity in economies will 
allow 
both countries to boost equal and profitable contacts, he added. 
  Wu Yi, Chinese foreign trade and foreign economic 
cooperation 
minister, stressed that in general the Chinese foreign trade 
turnover grew 18.2 per cent in 1993 and amounted to 195.72 
billion dollars. Chinese imports went up by 29 per cent (103.95 
billion dollars) and exports by eight per cent (91.77 billion 
dollars).

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vadim Byrkin and Vladimir </F>
Gondusov] 
  [Text] Moscow, 27 Jan -- The Information and Press 
Department of Russia's Defense Ministry today described an 
article in the Japanese weekly SHUKAN BUNSHUN as "utter fiction 
and a provocative fabrication." The article claimed the 
existence of a secret report entitled "The Military Policy of 
the Russian Federation Toward the Asian-Pacific Region in New 
Political Conditions." Extracts from the report were reprinted 
in several Russian publications, which cited SHUKAN BUNSHUN as 
the source. 
  The SHUKAN BUNSHUN report alleges that "the center for 
military-strategic analysis" of the General Staff of Russia's 
Ministry of Defense prepared a report, marked "especially 
secret," on the involvement of 160 Russian nuclear scientists in 
nuclear research in North Korea. It said that Russian 
specialists had helped to develop North Korean nuclear warheads 
and the medium-range Nodong-1 missile. Extracts from the report 
were supposed to have been forwarded to the U.S. Defense 
Department on 22 October 1993, under the serial number 001 
SM-137, after it had been read by Boris Yeltsin and Pavel 
Grachev. 
  The Defense Ministry told ITAR-TASS that "there is no such 
center for military-strategic analysis." "There is a center for 
military-strategic research" but "not only did it not prepare 
such a report, it has never even heard of it." The Defense 
Ministry does not use serial numbers of the type mentioned in 
the article. It does not have the classification "especially 
secret." It uses "top secret" instead. The Information and 
Press Department describes this "sensation" as "totally 
concocted."

<F P=106> [Observer Aleksandr Golts report on interview with Colonel </F>
General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Armed Forces General 
Staff; place and date of interview not given: "`General Staff 
Secret Report' in Fact Blatant Forgery. Chief of Russian 
Federation Armed Forces General Staff Refutes Articles in 
Japanese Weekly and IZVESTIYA"] 
  [Text] The popular Japanese weekly SHUKAN BUNSHUN has 
published material which, if it were true, would cause an 
international sensation; the respected Russian newspaper 
IZVESTIYA has given a detailed account of this material. Citing 
a secret document from the Russian General Staff and an 
interview with an anonymous staffer from this organization, it 
is reported that Russia is allegedly assisting the 
implementation of North Korea's nuclear missile plans. Also, 
that our nuclear and rocket scientists have helped to develop 
the nuclear weapons [boyepripasy] which, it seems, the DPRK 
already possesses as well as the means to deliver these weapons. 
Moreover, it is claimed that, in the Russian military's 
assessment, the situation is so grave that the issue of 
establishing a joint system of ABM defense for Russia, Japan, 
and the United States needs to be addressed. 
  But it is probably no accident that neither the actual 
magazine nor IZVESTIYA has attempted to ascertain whether this 
document is genuine by making inquiries at its alleged source. 
  In reply to my question as to whether such a document really 
exists, Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Armed 
Forces General Staff, answered: "The articles in the Japanese 
magazine and IZVESTIYA are based on a gross and obvious forgery. 
It is only to be regretted that such a respected newspaper has 
fallen victim to forgers by publishing this material from its 
Japan correspondent Sergey Agafonov without any preliminary 
verification." 
  Indeed, it can only be conjectured why the photograph of the 
first page of the "document" was thought sufficient to remove 
all doubts as to the authenticity of the report. After all, it 
is unlikely that IZVESTIYA employs people specializing in the 
clerical work of the Ministry of Defense who would be able to 
distinguish a genuine document from a forgery. People who deal 
with office paperwork, however, are adamant that the Ministry of 
Defense never uses the kind of document serial numbers indicated 
in the article. But if this is the case, the ironic questions in 
the article addressed to the ministry and the General Staff are 
still left hanging in the air. After all, if no leaks took 
place, any hint that there is a little key which "opens General 
Staff safes for Japanese guests" is simply an insult. 
  However, other questions are now being raised. In 
particular, what was the point of publishing these unverified 
reports. Col. Gen. Mikhail Kolesnikov believes that "we are 
talking about a clear provocation with the aim of casting 
aspersions on the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff." 
Can it be that someone actually wants to rekindle the antiarmy 
campaign of the past few years? 
  At the same time the chief of General Staff is not ruling 
out 
the possibility that this episode has played into the hands of 
those who want to complicate relations between Russia and North 
Korea. 
  Yes, the nuclear problems of the Korean peninsula are 
currently very acute. Russia is not hiding its alarm at the 
fact that the DPRK has suspended its participation in the Treaty 
on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons. At the same time, a 
ranking Russian diplomat stated recently, we believe that 
sanctions against the DPRK -- on which some countries are 
insisting -- should be used only as a last resort, but there are 
those who would prefer to replace the complex process of 
negotiations with open pressure on Pyongyang. And is it not 
currently in their interests to make it seem as if Russia is to 
blame for the fact that the DPRK has allegedly acquired nuclear 
weapons?

<F P=106> [Sergey Agafonov report: "A Total of 160 Russian Nuclear </F>
Scientists and Missilemen Helped North Korea To Create a Nuclear 
Bomb. The Japanese Have Learned This from a Secret Report by 
the Russian General Staff"] 
  [Text] Tokyo -- The Japanese weekly SHUKAN BUNSHUN carries 
a detailed account of a secret report on North Korean nuclear 
affairs prepared by the Russian General Staff and an interview 
with an unnamed official involved in compiling that report, 
referred to in a note as "a leader." The report is entitled 
"The Russian Federation's Military Policy in the Asia and 
Pacific Region Under the New Military-Political Conditions." 
  It seems that more can be seen from the top of our General 
Staff building than from the U.S., Japanese, or NATO 
counterparts. At any rate, Russian specialists and analysts are 
more candid on the problem of the North Korean nuclear program 
and stricter in their judgments than their Western colleagues, 
who recently have repeatedly shared information with journalists 
-- true, their own journalists, not foreigners. It follows from 
the report, prepared for Grachev and then forwarded to Yeltsin 
(according to the Japanese magazine, which was told all this by 
our talkative secret agents in Moscow), that Pyongyang has 
scored major achievements in implementing a missile program and 
a nuclear program. The DPRK already has its own nuclear 
warheads and several hundred delivery vehicles capable of 
delivering the payload. 
  It is clear from the Russian report and from the mysterious 
"leader's" comments on it that Pyongyang embarked with 
particular zeal on its nuclear missile program in the second 
half of the eighties, with active Russian participation. Almost 
160 Russian nuclear scientists and missilemen have passed 
through North Korean laboratories and specialized centers since 
then. At present nine Russian nuclear scientists and 17 highly 
qualified missile specialists are working in North Korea. This 
is outside the framework of bilateral cooperation and is 
unofficial, as it were -- according to the "leader's" comments, 
many of our scientists have changed their names, and some have 
taken DPRK citizenship. Only it is not this that is important 
but the fact that the project to create the Korean Nodong-1 
intermediate-range missile was successfully completed with the 
assistance of Russian brains, and North Korea has accumulated a 
sufficient stock of enriched nuclear raw materials with the help 
of Russian scientists and technologies and now possesses 
approximately 10-12 kg of uranium-235 and 20 kg of 
plutonium-239. Citing the testimonies of four Russian 
specialists who recently returned from the DPRK after working in 
Korean nuclear complexes, the report maintains that Pyongyang 
already possesses one or two nuclear warheads and by the end of 
this year will roll several more off the conveyor belt. The 
DPRK is now engaged in creating a new generation of Nodong-2 
solid-fuel missiles with an increased hit range. According to 
Russian estimates, in the very near future our fuel technologies 
and know-how and our missile scientists and solid-fuel 
specialists will be objects of special attention for Pyongyang's 
agents. 
  In this connection the report proposes revising all existing 
technological agreements between Russia and the DPRK, stopping 
the leak of cadres, and devoting special attention to 
bridge-building with the United States, South Korea, and Japan 
for extensive coordination of actions. It is even proposed that 
we think about the prospect of creating some kind of regional 
ABM system involving Russia, Japan, and the United States. At 
the same time it is pointed out that not only Russia but also 
China has been involved in the DPRK's nuclear affairs, and the 
Chinese factor is now becoming the key one. 
  The document cited at length by the Japanese magazine is 
stamped "top secret" and was prepared by the Russian Defense 
Ministry General Staff Military-Strategic Analysis Center. 
After being read by Grachev and Yeltsin, extracts from the 
report were forwarded on the president's instructions to the 
U.S. Defense Department (within the framework of an information 
exchange). A facsimile of a Russian Defense Ministry form with 
the issue number 001 SM-137 and date of publication 22 October 
1993 is even given as an illustration. In short, there are no 
doubts about the authenticity of the document itself, but some 
questions do arise, and it makes sense to ask them. The first 
and most important question: On what unspecified grounds does 
Russian General Staff information get into Japanese hands, 
accompanied, moreover, by detailed comments and explanations by 
a "leader" working, to judge from the wording employed by the 
weekly, in the structure of the General Staff itself? Maybe no 
major secrets have been divulged, but the question needs to be 
answered if only for one reason -- a Japanese audience is the 
first to learn about the Russian military department's 
assessments, while the Russian audience, as is already the 
custom, is considered "second class." 
  Second question: On what terms and in what circumstances did 
the Japanese weekly obtain exclusive material from the Russian 
Defense Ministry? If it was on instructions from chiefs 
conducting an intricate publicity operation, I would like to 
have an idea of that intention. If it was without the chiefs' 
knowledge, it would be even better to know the whereabouts of 
the secret key which opens Russian General Staff safes for 
Japanese guests. 
  Finally, a third question, again one of considerable 
importance: Who in Japan (or some other country) will be the 
next happy possessor of Russian secret documents? If the 
Russian mass media are not old enough to have the honor of being 
the first to learn the Russian military department's viewpoint, 
they must at least get their bearings in the information area 
and know in which foreign journal or newspaper it will be 
possible to familiarize themselves with the views of their own 
Defense Ministry.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Zakharchenko] </F>
  [Text] Seoul January 27 TASS -- The South Korean Defence 
Ministry is discussing the possibility of using some Russian 
armaments exclusively for training and in experimental 
programmes. This was stated on Wednesday to South Korean 
journalists by Major-General Han Sung-Ui, a representative of 
the South Korean military establishment, in connection with 
press reports that Russia had recently offered to pay back South 
Korean credits by deliveries of the latest military 
technologies, the South Korean press reported today. 
  Han Sung-Ui said it was difficult to include Russian 
military 
hardware in the arsenal of the South Korean Armed Forces, 
because the latter were organised and equipped according to the 
American system. However, limited amounts of Russian armaments 
could be used to study the Russian tactics and military 
doctrine, and also to polish off operations to beat off a 
possible attack from North Korea, whose troops are armed with 
Soviet-type weaponry. 
  The representative of the Defence Ministry stressed that the 
Seoul government would go on adhering to the priority 
development of military cooperation with its closest ally -- the 
United States. At the same time, it will promote relations with 
the neighbouring countries, such as Russia and Japan, including 
in the sphere of defence. "I am referring primarily to 
exchanges of cadets and servicemen," Han Sung-Ui stated. 
  Director of the second Asia department of the Russian 
Foreign 
Ministry Nikolay Solovyov stated in Moscow that the Russian 
Foreign Ministry did not forward to the South Korean side any 
official documents on the sale or joint production of armaments, 
as well as of up-to-date technologies, in payment for Russia's 
debts. South Korean representatives have received a package of 
proposals on military-technical cooperation during Russian 
Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin's visit to Seoul last August. 
Confirming this fact, Solovyov noted that no official reply was 
received from the South Korean side so far.

  [Text] Beijing and Seoul are expressing concern about the 
U.S. plan to deploy the anti-missile Patriot system of the U.S. 
Forces in the ROK. 
  The United States is planning to introduce Patriot missiles 
into the ROK under the fabricated pretext [nalchodoen kusillo] 
that the DPRK has missile attack capability. 
  According to AFP reports from Seoul, ROK political circles 
are concerned about the possibility that nuclear talks with 
Pyongyang will go amiss [patan] due to the deployment of those 
missiles. 
  Beijing has officially opposed the attempt to deploy 
missiles. A spokesman for the PRC Foreign Ministry stated that 
the PRC opposes any action [imuiui haengdong] detrimental to 
peace and security of the Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yuriy Solton from the "Today's World" program] </F>
  [Text] The United States plans to send Patriot missiles to 
South Korea. The Patriot missile was used in the Persian Gulf 
war and performed well. Station commentator Yuriy Solton writes 
on this: 
  The Pentagon discussed this matter at the request of the 
commander of the U.S. forces in South Korea, though President 
Clinton has not approved it yet. Quoting U.S. CIA materials, the 
Pentagon is planning to deploy Patriot missiles--which is an 
antimissile system--in South Korea because Pyonayang is capable 
of attacking U.S. military facilities with [word indistinct] 
missiles. 
  It is difficult to believe that such an attack is possible. 
First of all, recently the U.S. CIA said that a North Korean 
military aggression is almost impossible. Also, according to a 
report by an independent U.S. [word indistinct], the Nodong-1 
missile, which is modeled after a Scud-type missile, does not 
pose a big threat. 
  Considering these factors, it can be estimated that the plan 
to deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea is made to apply 
pressure on Pyongyang. It is also estimated that through such a 
pressure the United States attempts to lead North Korea to allow 
international inspections of its nuclear facilities which have 
been under the suspicion of developing nuclear weapons. 
  Pyongyang should have cleared such suspicion by returning to 
the Nonproliferation Treaty. However, the deployment of U.S. 
Patriot missiles in South Korea will not be conducive to solving 
the nuclear issue. Rather, it will lead Pyongyang to take 
countermeasures, thereby further aggravating the situation of 
the Korean penisula.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Burbyga article: "Victims of Undeclared Wars. 4. </F>
Submarines Sometimes Never Come to the Surface At All"] 
  [Excerpts] In the past 27 years -- 1967 through 1994 -- 
there have been 20 underwater collisions between Russian Navy 
submarines and foreign nuclear submarines, mainly U.S. ones. 
Eleven of these "encounters" took place in the maritime combat 
readiness test sites of the Northern and Pacific Fleets, which 
are directly adjacent to Russia's shores. The latest collisions 
that were recorded involved the nuclear submarine Baton Rouge in 
the Barents Sea in February 1993, and the nuclear submarine 
Grayling in March 1993 (both were from the U.S. Navy). Military 
experts maintain that such incidents can lead to the loss of 
submarines together with their crews and an ensuing 
environmental disaster. Alas, there are full grounds for such 
depressing conclusions... 
  A K-129 Soviet diesel missile submarine (the Golf class 
according to NATO classification) was lost on 8 March 1968 in 
the northern part of the Pacific Ocean as a result of an 
unpremeditated collision with a U.S. Navy nuclear submarine. 
Captain First Rank Vladimir Kobzar, the submarine commander, 
and 98 crew members perished. 
  IZVESTIYA wrote about this tragedy in a series of articles 
under the general heading "Submarine from 'Graveyard' Bay" (Nos. 
154, 155, 156, and 158 in 1992). [passage omitted] 
  We have only spoken about one collision, which led to the 
loss of a submarine and crew, but there have been a lot of 
collisions like this. The same kind of collision occurred in 
1968 when an Echo-II class submarine from the Northern Fleet 
(Commander Captain First Rank V. Shekhovnov) collided with an 
unidentified U.S. navy nuclear vessel in the Barents Sea. 
  In 1979 another Echo-II class nuclear vessel belonging to 
the 
Pacific Fleet (Commander Captain First Rank B. Bogdasaryan) 
collided with the U.S. nuclear vessel Tautog off the Kamchatka 
coast. 
  In 1974, in the same area, a Yankee class submarine 
(Commander Captain First Rank Yu. Antonovskiy) collided with a 
U.S. Navy nuclear vessel... 
  In all of the listed cases, it was only by a miracle that 
the 
submarines avoided destruction. According to Admiral of the 
Reserve Vladimir Sidorov, former commander of the Pacific Fleet, 
these collisions (at the present time they are the most 
dangerous accidents at sea) could be stopped with the help of 
the signing of an agreement by the Russian and U.S. Governments 
on preventing incidents between submarines underwater. And, as 
the editorial office has found out, the American side was 
familiarized with a draft of this agreement back in June 1993...

  [Text] "Absolutely no threat to the Baltic countries" comes 
from Russia. Representatives from Russia and the Baltic states 
"simply have to gather together and constructively resolve 
problems inherited from their common past," Russian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin told a news conference in 
Moscow on Thursday. 
  According to him, Russia "has the impression that some 
Baltic 
politicians believe that they can ensure their national 
interests by means of confrontation with Russia." This is "a 
great delusion," Churkin noted. "They can protect their 
sovereignty in real terms only by building relations of 
partnership with Russia. Russia acts in precisely this way, and 
it hopes that this kind of approach will triumph," the deputy 
foreign minister said. 
  Speaking about the presence of Russian troops in the Baltic 
countries, Churkin said that Russia has already withdrawn 85% of 
its troops from there. He called attention to the fact that at 
the very beginning of this process Moscow insisted on the need 
to sign corresponding inter-governmental agreements. 
"Unfortunately, the Baltic countries failed to understand the 
realities we have to cope with, when, despite our serious 
internal problems, we remove our troops from there," Churkin 
said. Russia, he stressed, "is seeking to imbue this process 
with an element of greater cooperativeness." 
  According to Churkin, at present Russia and the Baltic 
countries are "at the decisive stage of final troop withdrawal." 
In his view, 90% of the agreement on troop withdrawal from 
Latvia is ready. What remains to be coordinated are questions 
connected with the situation of military retirees and with the 
functioning of the radar station in Skrunda. 
  With reference to the human rights situation in the Baltic 
countries, Churkin stressed that Russia "never linked the issue 
of troop withdrawal to changes in the situation of Russian 
speakers." "Moreover, it is Latvia and Estonia which insisted on 
such linkage, saying that the situation of ethnic Russians in 
the Baltic countries will improve after the withdrawal of 
troops. We view this as a promise. Let's see how they honor 
it," he said. 
  Speaking about Estonia's territorial claims to several areas 
in Russia's Pskov Region, Churkin pointed out that "there is no 
need to create additional irritants, which, as a matter of fact, 
will bring no practical results. We can take retaliatory 
measures, and our Estonian partners will not like it." In his 
view, "the territorial issue is clear. This is Russian 
territory, it is controlled by Russia, and our present border 
with Estonia has the status of state frontier."

  [Excerpt] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin 
said at a news conference that he does not consider it expedient 
to use the term near abroad in official statements and 
documents. In Churkin's opinion, it is precisely due to the use 
of this term that various misunderstandings have resulted and a 
negative reaction has come from some former USSR union republic 
capitals. In Churkin's opinion, the Baltic countries can in no 
way be included in the near abroad because those countries left 
the USSR even before it disintegrated and are not likely to seek 
CIS membership. 
  At the same time, Churkin emphasized that the term near 
abroad should not be interpreted as a threat against the 
sovereignty of any state because Russia, the CIS, and the Baltic 
countries were united into a country for years; consequently, 
they also have many problems in common, including the issue of 
the Russian-speaking population, said Churkin. 
  A meeting of representatives of Russian communities living 
in 
the near abroad took place in Moscow, with nearly 70 people 
attending. All those present found that there are human rights 
violations taking place in Latvia and Estonia, a fact that lifts 
international legal acts above the national ones. As a 
consequence, the Russian-speaking population has become 
stateless in those countries. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Maksim Yusin: "The Removal of Stanislav </F>
Shushkevich Was a Nasty Surprise for Moscow"] 
  [Text] The events of the evening of 26 January in the 
Belarus parliament came as a complete suprise to Russian 
diplomats. "We never imagined it would come to Shushkevich's 
resignation. Literally hours before the vote the Russian 
ambassador in Minsk was reporting on the situation in the 
republic -- and he expressed no alarm. What happened was like a 
bolt from the blue," a Russian Foreign Ministry CIS department 
aide admitted. 
  The removal of Shushkevich is not going to do 
Russian-Belarusian relations any good. Boris Yeltsin has lost a 
reliable ally, who unconditionally took his side last fall in 
the struggle against Khasbulatov and Rutskoy. The Belarusian 
leader was one of the few CIS leaders whose loyalty Yeltsin 
could always count on: In the past two years it is difficult to 
remember an occasion when Minsk has not supported a Moscow 
initiative in the context of the Commonwealth. 
  Shushkevich's stock was pretty high in the international 
area 
-- he was seen as a reformer and stalwart supporter of the 
market economy. Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, whose 
position most observers expect to be strengthened, adopts a 
different line. His views are much closer to those of his 
Russian colleague Chernomyrdin than to those of Yeltsin and 
Shushkevich. 
  The results of the vote removed the final doubts about the 
Belarusian parliament's orientation: The communists have a 
solid majority in it. The signs are that someone who will more 
easily find a common language with Zyuganov than with Yeltsin 
will be elected the new chairman of the Supreme Soviet. 
  In this situation there is practically no hope of the 
Belarusian leaders' carrying out serious reforms. The 
republic's economic prospects could not be gloomier. 
Nevertheless, Chernomyrdin will fly to Minsk in February to 
agree on a mechanism for the unification of the two states' 
monetary systems. Given that this step was causing thunderous 
protests on the part of Russian reformers even before 
Shushkevich's removal, one can imagine the kind of reaction 
there will be now that the Belarusian parliament has shown its 
hand. 
  As for Belarusian foreign policy, according to Russian 
diplomats, it will not change significantly. Minsk is too 
heavily dependent on Moscow and the leaders of the communist 
majority in the Supreme Soviet are unlikely to openly display 
their ideological enmity toward Yeltsin.

  [Text] The dismissal of Stanislav Shushkevich as Chairman 
of Belarus's parliament must not radically alter the character 
of relations between Russia and Belarus, a senior Russian 
diplomat responsible for ties with the former Soviet republics 
told Interfax on Thursday [27 January]. 
  The Belarussian leader's resignation was quite unexpected 
for 
Russia's foreign ministry, he said. Nevertheless Russia had no 
reason to fear that relations between the two countries would 
cool, since "all the branches of power and major political 
forces (except the Popular Front, which has about 10% of 
the 
vote in Belarus's parliament -- IF) stand for strengthening 
cooperation with Russia." 
  According to Interfax's interviewee, no one in Belarus needs 
negative changes in bilateral relations, since Belarus gets from 
Russia about 90% of its fuel, and Russia accounts for up to 
72% 
of Belarussian turnover. 
  As the diplomat said, Shushkevich's departure may even 
stimulate closer cooperation between the two countries in the 
framework of the CIS and on a bilateral basis. For instance, 
the former parliament chairman procrastinated on a decision on 
his country's joining the treaty on collective security, and 
notified the Russian leadership of a positive decision on this 
issue only on December 31, 1993. 
  With reference to the unification of the monetary systems of 
Russia and Belarus, which caused a controversial response in 
Moscow, Interfax's interviewee said that "the political 
dividends Moscow will gain as a result of the proposed agreement 
will outweigh the financial expenditure, and in the future this 
will bring Russia considerable profit." 
  Head of Belarussian diplomacy Piotr Kravchenko maintains 
that 
changes in the country's leadership will not affect relations 
with Russia. 
  The Minister-Counsellor of the Russian Embassy in Minsk, 
Vyacheslav Kovalenko, told Interfax that at Thursday's meeting 
with Russian Ambassador Igor Saprykin he stressed that the 
Belarussian leadership would continue its policy of 
rapprochement with Russia.

<F P=106> [Rustam Narzikulov report: "Shushkevich Has Been Converted </F>
Into the Ruble"] 
  [Text] On the evening of 26 January the Belarusian 
parliament realized the second of the two possible options for 
creating political conditions for the upcoming signing of the 
treaty with Russia on merging the monetary systems. 
  The first was that the parliament, in opposition to its 
speaker, was going to declare integration into a confederation 
with Russia. Implementation of this option, however, would have 
called for considerably greater organizational efforts and 
moreover a positive result would not have been guaranteed, 
because the Russian Federation leadership would have hardly 
agreed to the political merging of the two states. "Friends 
from Moscow" advised acting according to the "if there is no 
man, there is no problem" principle. 
  Apparently it was much easier to "remove" Stanislav 
Shushkevich, reanimating the old charges of corruption, than 
immediately to renounce statehood. The Lithuanian services, 
which spirited away Burokyavicius and Yermolavicius, came very 
handy as a cause for the resignation of the Belarusian speaker. 
  Thus the "problem of Shushkevich," who did not show 
enthusiasm over the merging of the monetary systems and 
therefore introduced a certain element of embarrassment into 
bilateral relations, has been resolved and the Russian prime 
minister can now go to Minsk in early February is a tranquil 
state of mind, fearing no complications. 
  The protests by Mr. Bagdankevich, chairman of the Belarus 
National Bank, can be discounted because he is obligated to 
carry out the decision by the republic's parliament. This also 
goes for the small deputies opposition. 
  Strange as it might seem, only Russia stands to gain from 
this course of events. If the naive Belarusian ex-communists 
think that they will be using the ruble on a par with the 
Russian citizens, they are grossly deluded. 
  In spite of Viktor Gerashchenko's great passion for 
supporting national and CIS production by "nonmonetary methods 
of fighting inflation," he has enough sense of measure to 
prepare the treaty on merging the monetary systems in such a way 
that its practical implementation depends on concrete technical 
accords. Therefore even with the accepted exchange rate of "one 
zaychik [Belarus currency] for one ruble," Belarus will hardly 
get the 1.6 trillion rubles owed it, as is apparent from the 
treaty. Even Mr. Gerashchenko did not consider it possible to 
grant it almost the entire second tranche from the IMF ($1.5 
billion) out of his tender affection for the former USSR 
brothers. 
  Signs are that so far the "merging" will be reduced to an 
extremely slow and agonizing procedure of exchanging the bills, 
which will substantially nullify any gain for the Belarusians. 
A similar picture can now be observed in Tajikistan, which has 
been in the ruble zone for two months now. The exchange of old 
Soviet rubles for new Russian ones is accompanied by so many 
restrictions (the population, for instance, is issued bills with 
denominations not higher than 500 rubles) that Russia is hardly 
feeling the effects of inflation imported from Central Asia. 
  Incidentally, the main reason for Shushkevich's and 
Bogdanovich's doubts about the expediency of entering the ruble 
zone was not their hypertrophied sense of sovereignty but the 
well-founded suspicions that they will be "fooled." 
  SEGODNYA has evidence indicating that Belarus will be 
confronted with something very much like the Tajik model. If 
the idea of quiet sabotage of the treaty is implemented, its 
results (political and economic) will have to be recognized as 
far from the worst possible for Russia. 
  A feature of the Russian Federation Government in recent 
years, however, has been that its course of action can be 
reversed within just one day. Therefore there are no guarantees 
that the top leadership of the Central Bank and the Council of 
Ministers is not playing its own game, unknown to outsiders, and 
that a few months later a new state formation will not emerge -- 
a Russian-Belarusian confederation. In this event the already 
unhealthy Russian economy will have to feed a neighbor with a 
population of 10 million.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Alexey Bukalov, Alexey </F>
Golyayev, Ivan Ivanov, and Sergey Startsev] 
  [Text] Rome January 27 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin ended talks with his Italian counterpart 
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi on Thursday [27 January] by signing a 
package of bilateral agreements, including a statement of the 
Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of Italy. 
  At a news conference after the talks, the Russian and 
Italian 
premiers expressed satisfaction with the state of bilateral 
ties, stressing that both countries have big potential for their 
development in the future. 
  Ciampi said he was pleased to hear from his Russian 
counterpart that there will be no backtracking on reforms in 
Russia. He admitted that Russia is facing certain difficulties 
which are inevitable on the way towards a free market economy. 
  Chernomyrdin said that the upcoming G-7 summit meeting to be 
held this coming summer and to be attended by Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin should begin the transformation of G-7 into G-8, 
at least on a political level. 
  Both prime ministers had discussed various aspects of 
cooperation with international organisations, including the 
European Union and NATO, paying special attention to the 
Partnership for Peace programme. The sides also focused on 
bilateral trade and economic relations between Italy and Russia, 
prioritising cooperation in power engineering and oil and gas 
production. 
  "As for Italy and Russia, our business is going pretty well. 
Italy is our second largest, after Germany, trade partner in 
Europe. We have signed such contracts with it, of which not 
every country can boast. For example, a contract with the group 
ENI to modernise gas pipelines in russia is estimated at about 2 
billion U.S. dollars. In return, Italy will receive extra six 
billion cubic meters of gas annually," Chernomyrdin said. 
  Ciampi told ITAR-TASS that Italy supports reforms in Russia, 
stressing that the boosting of energy production and energy 
exports are vital for the Russian economy. 
  Speaking about Russia's position on the Bosnian settlement, 
Chernomyrdin said that this topic had not been discussed during 
the talks. He pointed out to Russia's desire to settle the 
conflict in the Balkans as soon as possible by using "civilised 
political methods." "In this respect the positions of our 
countries are close," the premier said.

  [Text] Russia's new foreign policy has been the cause of 
much concern in the West, above all because we have noticed that 
there is a desire to return to a situation where Moscow is 
central to the former Soviet republics. Stefano Picchi asked 
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Adamishin about this: 
  [Begin Adamishin recording] Our policy has been changing, 
not 
only in the last few days but over the past year. In what 
direction is it changing? It is becoming more pragmatic -- let 
us say, more interested in the defense of our national 
interests. We may have passed through a somewhat romantic 
period when we thought that because we had a correct foreign 
policy we would no longer have any problems. This was not the 
case. 
  Even when going in a correct direction you must still find a 
way of solving problems, because interests do not always 
coincide. I will give you an example: Russia's role in the 
former Soviet republics is not always recognized. Sometimes it 
is said that in these republics we are going back to imperialist 
ways, that we want to rebuild the Soviet Union. It is not true. 
We have seen, we have established that unless Russia plays an 
active role it is very difficult to have stability, security, 
and tranquillity on our border. The former republics want 
Russia's active role; they want it. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Vadim Markushin and Sergey Pashayev report: "Western Group </F>
of Forces' History Will Continue With Its Withdrawal"] 
  [Text] A good hundred journalists assembled at the Russian 
Embassy in Berlin for a press conference given by Colonel 
General Matvey Burlakov, commander in chief of the Western Group 
of Forces [WGF], and their expectations were justified. During 
his half-hour speech the commander in chief briefed the 
journalists in great detail on the progress of the Russian troop 
withdrawal from FRG territory and the problems associated with 
it. 
  Housing construction in Russia for the families of the WGF 
servicemen being withdrawn is the most painful problem, M. 
Burlakov stressed. As you know, this has been exacerbated 
because the units' withdrawal to new basing locations has been 
speeded up. The withdrawal has been speeded up, but the pace of 
apartment construction not been stepped up, indeed it has even 
slowed down. At present there are still 13,000 servicemen's 
families without housing. This year's plans make provision for 
the commissioning of around 45,000 apartments; however, given 
the current lag, I have my doubts, the commander in chief said, 
that these plans will be fulfilled. 
  The press conference also touched on the subject of the 
planned celebrations to mark the Russian troop withdrawal from 
Germany. They have been given the "go-ahead" in principle, 
notably during a recent telephone conversation between H. Kohl 
and B. Yeltsin. And the Russian side has put forward a concrete 
plan for these celebrations. What adjustments will the Germans 
make to it? And when? M. Burlakov was hopeful that an answer 
is in the offing. 
  Of late, according to the commander in chief, there have 
been 
plenty of articles in the German press concerning the state of 
the WGF and the withdrawal of its units home. Whereas most of 
these articles reflect the true state of affairs, there are also 
obvious falsehoods. DER SPIEGEL and DIE WELT are particularly 
guilty of this. 
  And another point. Millions of our compatriots have served 
in Russian garrisons in Germany. How can we preserve the memory 
of the good that has come of our relations? According to the 
commander in chief, units are today discussing the idea of 
setting up a public organization to continue the history of the 
WGF.

<F P=106> [Report by Gennadiy Charodeyev: "Turkey Closes Bosporus To </F>
Russian Tankers"] 
  [Excerpts] Turkey intends unilaterally to introduce its 
own special procedure governing the passage of civilian ships 
and warships through the Black Sea Bosporus and Dardanelles 
straits. That would be a revision of the international 
convention signed back in 1936. [passage omitted] 
  The "closure" of the Black Sea straits to oil tankers would 
significantly affect the interests of the main oil exporter -- 
Russia. 
  Murat Uzun, Turkish assistant secretary for maritime 
affairs, 
told journalists that the new rules have one purpose -- to 
guarantee ships safe passage through the Black Sea straits and 
"in no way do they imply a change in the actual conventon." 
  According to Professor Kamil Bekyashev, a Russian specialist 
in the sphere of the international law of the sea, the 
convention does not entitle Turkey to regulate the passage of 
nonmilitary ships through the straits. Nonetheless, the Turks 
are constantly tightening up the terms of passage on a 
unilateral basis. Recently the Turkish Government approved more 
than 20 rules restricting freedom of navigation in the straits. 
But there is a great deal of sense in Turkey's actions, 
IZVESTIYA expert K. Bekyashev and Foreign Ministry 
representatives believe. The waters of the straits are also the 
waters of ports, and the ships are crossing a port's territory, 
as it were, so they are under Turkish jurisdiction. 
  The modern law of the sea allows strait states to establish 
rules governing the safety of shipping and protection of the 
marine environment against pollution. Foreign ships are obliged 
to observe them. 
  Russian diplomats understand the Turkish authorities' 
decision to "establish order" in its straits. At least, it is 
the topic of talks planned for February in Istanbul.

  [Text] Even though the world community's response to the 
new Russian initiative concerning a settlement in Bosnia is 
"cautious, it makes it possible to go on with these efforts, 
above all with those aimed at convening the UN Security Council 
[UNSC] for a session in Geneva," said Russia's Deputy Foreign 
Minister, Vitaliy Churkin, on Thursday in answer to Interfax's 
question. 
  There is no intention of "forcing the European Union 
countries out of the process of settlement," he said at 
Thursday's briefing in Moscow. "We simply want to utilize the 
political weight and prestige of the UN Security Council to 
bring this affair (settlement: Interfax) to an end. It's not 
our fault that not all the European countries involved in this 
process are members of the UN Security Council," Russia's deputy 
foreign minister said. 
  Earlier on Thursday, Churkin said, he spoke with U.S. 
Ambassador Thomas Pickering about the new Russian initiative. 
According to him, the attitudes taken by the two countries have 
much in common. Nevertheless, he added, "neither Russia nor its 
European partners should look back at Washington all the time in 
their efforts to settle the crisis in Bosnia." 
  "As for the reaction of European countries, there is an 
impression that a session of the UN Security Council scares them 
more than the consequences of the war in Bosnia do," Churkin 
added.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian 
at 0335 GMT on 27 January, as part of the "Radio Slavyanka" 
program of the Russian Defense Ministry, carries a recorded 
report on the views of Eduard Vorobyev, first deputy commander 
in chief of Russian ground troops, regarding the prospect of the 
use of force to stop the warring sides in Yugoslavia. 
  Vorobyev says: "The Americans regard the operation to 
enforce peace as a peacekeeping operation. We are not yet in 
complete agreement on this and believe that this issue needs 
additional working through. Servicemen would not be acting as 
peacekeepers, and the primary method of achieving the ultimate 
objective would be the use of weapons. How, subsequently, would 
those servicemen be able to carry out the task of peacekeeping?" 
  Vorobyev adds: "Whether we like it or not, carrying out an 
operation to enforce peace would, alas, result in the death of 
people, including civilians. We can also, unfortunately, see 
this in the example of Yugoslavia." He continues: "We believe 
that the operation to enforce peace should be taken out of the 
framework of the peacekeeping operation. Of course, a situation 
may arise when force must also be used, but there need to be 
special units for this, which should be armed appropriately." 
  In conclusion, Vorobyev says: "The servicemen or military 
units taking part in peacekeeping operations use weapons only in 
exceptional cases--above all, in self-defense."

<F P=106> ["tu"-signed report: "Germans and Russians Eternal Friends"] </F>
  [Text] Moscow -- In Russian nationalist leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy's opinion, Germans and Russians are "eternal 
friends." The chairman of the right-wing extremist Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), which surprisingly came out 
on top in last December's elections, said that a "Berlin-Moscow 
axis," to be extended to the Indian capital Delhi, should secure 
stability in Europe and Asia. 
  At a joint press conference with Munich publisher and 
chairman of the extreme right-wing German People's Union (DVU), 
Gerhard Frey, Zhirinovskiy said he is in favor of large-scale 
joint German-Russian projects. This should include a highway 
from Berlin via Kaliningrad and Moscow to Vladivostok. He also 
demanded more German language teaching in Russian schools. The 
LDPR leader spoke out against ethnic German Russians leaving the 
country. They should be kept in Russia, where there is plenty 
of space for more settlers from Germany. Together with Frey, 
Zhirinovskiy laid a wreath at the memorial of the soldiers 
killed in the war against Napoleon's troops, to commemorate the 
Russians "who liberated Europe together with the Germans." 
  Again, Zhirinovskiy demanded the resignation of Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Economics Minister Alexandr Shokhin, 
and the head of the privatization authority, Anatoliy Chubays, 
the last reformer in the cabinet. According to Zhirinovskiy, 
all three are politicians who want to keep Russia down. Kozyrev 
could only save his skin if he took a "clear pro-Serbian 
position" immediately. Also, the government must demand an end 
to the international blockade of Serbia, Libya, and Iraq. It 
should, furthermore, reintegrate the Crimea into the Russian 
Federation because the people there no longer want to be part of 
Ukraine. 
  According to the Russian news agencies, the Public 
Prosecutor 
in Moscow has instituted proceedings against Zhirinovskiy, 
accusing him of warmongering. Zhirinovskiy called these reports 
a "hoax." According to INTERFAX, the proceedings were instituted 
following inquiries by various public authorities, mass media, 
and private individuals.

Admiral Eduard Baltin was appointed to the post of Black Sea 
Fleet [BSF] commander. In an interview for a UNIAN 
correspondent on the occasion of this date the BSF commander 
said that he comes out against the fleet's politicization. 
According to the admiral, despite a number of agreements 
reached by the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, the status of 
the fleet remains suspended thus giving rise to problems as far 
as the material basis and the personnel are concerned. Eduard 
Baltin pointed out that the preservation of the Black Sea Fleet 
as a combat unit and an outpost on the borders of the 
Commonwealth countries are regarded by him as a priority at the 
present stage. The BSF commander is anxiously waiting for the 
heads of the two states to find a solution acceptable to both 
sides.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 28 (ITAR-TASS) -- Leading Russian 
newspapers continue to focus on the resignation of Belarusian 
parliament speaker Stanislav Shushkevich. The NEZAVISMAYA 
GAZETA newspaper notes that legislators voted down Shushkevich 
because they blamed him for splitting "the democratic movement 
in the republic". 
  He has not created either his party or a group in parliament 
over 18 months' work as speaker, which would have supported him 
unconditionally. This has resulted in the present logical end," 
[no opening quotation marks as received] the newspaper notes. 
  Speaking of Shushkevich's activities as parliament speaker, 
the newspaper writes that he "tried to keep at least illusory 
balance in relations with Russia, on which the Belarusian ruling 
elite now seeks to impose the main responsibility for 
maintaining the economic status quo". 
  The TRUD newspaper has a different opinion on this event. It 
called the decision taken by the Belarusian legislature "a 
political drama of Stanislav Shushkevich". The newspaper 
reminds its readers in an article printed on the front page that 
"the formally proclaimed sovereignty of Belarus started assuming 
more real outlines" after Shushkevich became parliament speaker. 
  "The main event of that time for Belarus was to lend the 
declaration on state sovereignty the status of a constitutinal 
law which clearly recorded the republic's desire to become a 
law-governed democratic state with a developed market economy as 
well as a nuclear-free and neutral state," TRUD says. 
  However, TRUD continues, it became clear in the recent past 
that "the law was nothing but a political set in the performed 
play with sovereignty for the pro-communist parliamentary 
majority and bureaucracy which grabbed executive power at all 
levels". 
  Shushkevich's resignation took place "under the evident 
influence of changes in Russian politics, feeding the Belarusian 
political establishment with hopes for conservation of its own 
power," claims the newspaper. 
  TRUD predicts that the resignation will trigger a deeper 
political crisis in the republic and tougher administrative 
measures in the domestic policy, which will lead to "a drastic 
review of the course defined by the above declaration on state 
sovereignty". 
  The IZVESTIYA newspaper headlines its article on this event 
as follows: "Shushkevich's resignation is a revenge of opponents 
of reforms in Belarus and a gift to Yeltsin's opponents in 
Russia". 
  The newspaper quotes a statement by prominent writer Vasil 
Bykov who spoke about an onslaught of pro-Communist forces, 
while leader of the Belarusian People's Front Zenon Poznyak 
describes parliament's position as treacherous towards 
Belarusian national interests. 
  Claiming that the event was preceded by well-orchestrated 
preparations, Poznyak predicts the establishment of an 
authoritarian regime in Minsk. 
  Writing on the same event, the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper 
notes that the latest developments in Belarus are logical, and 
the reasons for the resignation were caused, above all, by 
confrontation in the Belarusian parliament. 
  According to the newspaper, "the national democratic 
opposition which is in minority and supports Shushkevich, lost 
to the parliamentary majority backing Kebich who pursues a 
resolute course for rapprochement with Russia and represents 
pragmatists who are ready to waive some elements of illusory 
sovereignty for the sake of saving the republican economy". 
  The newspaper also publishes a refutation by Mikhail 
Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed 
Forces, of an article in a Japanese weekly saying that Russia 
allegedly contributed to the implementation of North Korean 
missile-nuclear plans. 
  Kolesnikov said that the article was a crude fabrication. 
  Commenting on the appointment of Sergey Dubinin as acting 
finance minister, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA suggests that people may 
now "expect an improvement in the results of the ministry's 
work, since Dubinin will bring conceptual issues to cabinet 
meetings instead of newspaper articles". 
  The same newspaper features an article by Yuriy Skokov, 
chairman of the Russian Federation of Manufacturers (the 
federation includes the league of assistance to munitions 
factories, the Russian union of industrialists and 
entrepreneurs, the agrarian union, the union of work 
collectives, the Russian chamber of commerce and industry and 
the union of oil producers). 
  Asked by the newspaper about reasons for the recent drop in 
the rouble's rate, he said that "many financial problems have 
now become not a subject for professional solutions but a theme 
for speechifying politicos". 
  Besides, Skokov said, "we have no normal foreign political 
activities and do not have a clear understanding of what our 
currency is worth".

  [Text] Moscow January 27 TASS -- Former Soviet Defence 
Minister Dmitriy Yazov, one of the 1991 August failed coup 
leaders, now tried for high treason admitted on Thursday that 
troops had been brought into Moscow regularly between 1990 and 
1991 and it had never been registered in any documents. 
  Yazov said that in the majority of cases former Soviet 
President Mikhail Gorbachev had issued only "oral instructions," 
adding that even the deployment of troops in Baku in january 
1990 had not been preceded by such "formalities" as a written 
order of the Soviet president. 
  At the previous hearings, the former defence minister denied 
statements that plans had been made to storm the White House, 
the seat of Russian President Boris Yeltsin at that time. 
  He admitted that the coup attempt was unconstitutional as 
were the measures taken against the former soviet president who 
was removed from power and isolated at his Black Sea dacha. 
  He said the reasons for declaring a state of emergency in 
the 
former Soviet Union were extraordinary and much stronger than 
was envisaged by the law on the state of emergency. 
  Yazov stressed that he had ordered the troops on high alert, 
but denied he had ordered Soviet Air Forces on full combat 
readiness. He noted that all orders to the troops had been sent 
by the command of the airborne troops, who, apparently, have 
overstepped their powers.

<F P=106> [Valeriy Rudnev report: "The SCSE Case: Flawed Evidence of </F>
the Prosecutor's Office Is Excluded From Judicial Process"] 
  [Text] The continuing judicial process in the Russian 
Supreme Court in the SCSE (State Committee for the State of 
Emergency) case begins increasingly to resemble the sessions of 
an academic council, where decisions are discussed and adopted 
on academic questions of criminal law and a model for future 
judicial procedure is perfected. 
  Just recall the historic ruling establishing the adversary 
nature of the process, the direct appeal to legislators to 
remove a deficiency in legislation, and the direct references in 
judicial documents to the Russian Constitution. New ground in 
judicial practice was also broken during the cross-examination 
of Marshal Dmitriy Yazov. 
  It is well known that, following Yazov's arrest at Vnukovo-2 
Airport, the marshal was cross-examined 22 and 30 August 1991, 
first as a suspect, then as a defendant, without the 
participation of an attorney. (Incidentally, the videotape of 
these very cross-examinations turned up in the hands of crafty 
journalists from DIE SPIEGEL in mysterious, and, quite possibly, 
criminal circumstances.) Yazov's defense attorneys, Nikolay 
Pechenkin and Lev Abdeldyayev, asked the Military Collegium to 
exclude the record of these examinations from the range of 
evidence being discussed in the judicial process. However, the 
state prosecution persistently returned the accused marshal to 
the evidence that he gave to the Prosecutor's Office 
investigators in the absence of a defense attorney. In other 
words, the question arose of the admissibility of evidence 
obtained in violation of the law. 
  Formerly, the courts endeavored to ignore such problems, 
which are of a theoretical rather than a substantial character. 
The Russian Federation Supreme Court Military Collegium under 
the chairmanship of Anatoliy Ukolov invervened and issued the 
following ruling: "The suspect or defendant in a criminal case 
has the right to have a defense attorney either from the moment 
the charge is filed, or from the moment of detention or the use 
of preventive restrictions amounting to arrest. Evidence 
obtained from a suspect or defendant in violation of this right 
to a defense attorney has no juridical force and cannot be used 
to prove the charge leveled." 
  This means that yet more holes have appeared in the 
indictment against the members of the SCSE and their associates. 
At the very least, the court has forbidden the subsequent use 
of evidence given by Yazov 22 and 30 August 1991 and the 
examination records compiled as evidence on this basis. 
  According to an ITAR-TASS report, the former head of the 
Union miltary department admitted the unconstitutionality of 
measures employed in August 1991 against Mikhail Gorbachev, 
former head of the USSR, and also the actual creation of the 
USSR SCSE. However, Yazov, referring to the reality of the 
collapse of the unified state, again stressed the forced nature 
of the top USSR party and state leaders' actions at that time. 
  According to Yazov no combat orders were given to the 
military formations sent into the capital; an instruction was 
given only to place the Armed Forces on combat alert. 
  The examination of Dmitriy Yazov continues.

  [Text] Moscow, 27 Jan -- "Russia has rejected the 
post-August reform version" -- this was the main result of the 
parliamentary elections in the opinion of Gavriil Popov, 
chairman of the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms [RMDR]. 
He said this today at a news conference devoted to the second 
RMDR Congress due to be held on 29 January. 
  The former mayor of Moscow believes that with the 
implementation of the "shock therapy" policy, a westernist 
version of reform had been chosen, of which the essential 
elements became the dissolution of the USSR and annihilation of 
Russia's military-industrial capacity, in which the West had an 
interest. He called "shock therapy" a "model for the complete 
destruction of the country and its subordination to 
international monopolies." In the opinion of Gavriil Popov, 
neither the Gorbachev nor the post-August concepts of reform 
have solved the main problem for Russia -- the transition to a 
postindustrial society, and therefore the country is faced with 
the "task of developing a third model for the period of 
transition." He insists that the development of "a Russian 
model for the post-industrial society" requires "gigantic work," 
which may be done only as a result of the unification of the 
centrist forces in Russia. 
  The RMDR leader believes that there is no need to create a 
fuss about the new government. In his opinion, it is a 
"caretaker government for a year-and-a-half, the task of which 
is to purify the country of the extremes of a westernist policy." 
  Analysing the reasons for the defeat of the RMDR in the 
elections (the movement failed to gather the five percent of 
votes necessary to enter parliament), Gavriil Popov gave as one 
of the reasons the unsuccessful attempts to form an electoral 
coalition with other parties. "We did not expect that Russia 
would reject the westernist policy right away," he said, adding 
that this was the main strategic mistake of the RMDR. The 
movement's congress will be devoted to the results of the 
elections and the elaboration of the RMDR's tactics and strategy. 
  Gavriil Popov said that accusations being made against him 
of 
corruption in his time as mayor could only be explained by the 
fact that after August 1992 he had "come out against the line 
being taken by the Russian Government."

  [Text] Vladimir Malyshev, ITAR-TASS correspondent in 
Athens, reports that Yannis Yannikos, the Greek owner of the 
PRAVDA newspaper, has denied the statement by its editor in 
chief Viktor Linnik alleging that the former organ of the CPSU 
Central Committee had allegedly severed relations with him, had 
suspended publication, and intends henceforth to rely only on 
the support of Russian business circles. 
  In an interview in the Athens newspaper TA NEA, Yannikos 
recalled that PRAVDA INTERNATIONAL, which he heads, possesses 55 
percent of the newspaper's shares and does not intend to 
cooperate with Russian businessmen. 
  The Greek Communist publisher said that the newspaper has no 
economic problems as he has sufficient funds to continue its 
publication. In the view of Yannikos, Linnik's statement does 
not reflect the view of the PRAVDA editorial staff, many of whom 
oppose the editor. 
  In Athens it is said that the interview given by the Greek 
owner of PRAVDA testifies to the serious split within its 
management connected with the newspaper's crisis and the sharp 
drop in the number of copies being printed. The local press 
recalls in this connection the storm that blew up in 1992 when 
the Athens publisher, who was known to few people in the Greek 
capital, unexpectedly became the owner of what had once been one 
of the most authoritative Russian newspapers. Assumptions were 
voiced that the funds used for publishing PRAVDA were certainly 
not the personal funds of Yannikos, but rather CPSU money that 
had earlier been transferred abroad. He flatly denied this but 
was quite unable to explain where he got the millions of dollars 
to support this publication.

<F P=106> [Leonid Nikitinskiy article: "Constitutional Court </F>
Constituted as Previously Gives President First Warning"] 
  [Text] On Tuesday [25 January] the Constitutional Court 
Judges' Collegium discussed the question of restoring Judge 
Valeriy Zorkin's powers, which had been suspended previously 
because of the court chairman's active participation in 
political activity. 
  Following those of his colleague Luchin, although unlike him 
not resorting to a hunger strike, Zorkin's rights as a 
constitutional judge were restored. The decision was made at a 
closed meeting of the judges by seven votes to three. 
  Thus the Constitutional Court, which under the well-known 
presidential edicts was, as it were, put into suspended 
animation at least until the new constitution came into force, 
has woken up like a long-dormant volcano. Its first decision 
was an emphatic reminder of the existence in the Russian state 
of another pole of political opinion, which was merely 
temporarily pushed into the background by the elections to the 
Federal Assembly and their rather surprising results. 
  In the fall, after Boris Yeltsin issued Edict No. 1400, the 
Constitutional Court was possibly too hasty in taking the view 
that this edict was to be categorically rejected as 
anticonstitutional. This in turn played a part in escalating the 
confrontation between the branches of power, and probably to a 
certain extent provoked the White House into attempting to 
resolve the conflict by force. During this period a draft 
document terminating the Constitutional Court judges' powers in 
one form or another was discussed in presidential circles. 
However, having given preference to democratic elections and to 
putting the constitutional draft to a referendum rather than 
introducing temporary direct presidential rule, Yeltsin was 
unable within the framework of this logic to contemplate the 
abolition of the Constitutional Court in addition to the 
elimination of Soviet power. 
  For their part the judges made a compromise, effectively 
declaring their decision on Edict No. 1400 erroneous and, like 
wise chess players, offering the figure of ex-Chairman Zorkin 
"as a sacrifice." 
  As a result of this gambit the Constitutional Court judges 
gained not only a necessary breathing space but also very strong 
positions regarding the new constitution. Under it the 
Constitutional Court, in particular, decides cases concerning 
whether both federal laws passed by the Federal Assembly and 
normative presidential edicts and government decrees conform to 
the Constitution, and also interprets the Constitution. 
  It follows from the Constitution's transitional provisions 
that all 13 Constitutional Court judges, elected under the old 
procedure for protecting the old constitution, in their former 
capacity and without any losses "move" with their lifelong 
powers to a new "constitutional field" (to use the ex-chairman's 
favorite expression). Another six judges, who must be appointed 
by the Federation Council after being proposed by the president, 
will have to be co-opted onto the collegium in addition to the 
13 existing judges. Possible candidates are already being 
proposed in political and legal circles. Understandably, both 
organs of power involved in the appointments will try to fill 
the six vacant posts with people on whom they can rely in the 
future. But the Constitutional Court judges, without waiting to 
be "diluted" in this way, are hurrying to take measures to 
secure their own independence. 
  Internal questions concerning the Constitutional Court's 
life are affected only in form by the decision to restore 
Zorkin's powers in connection with his cessation of active 
involvement in politics, which impedes the exercise of a judge's 
functions, and by the similar decision regarding Luchin not long 
before this. Essentially the judges, anticipating the question 
which they have not yet been asked aloud by the organs of the 
legislative, executive, and presidential branches, have declared 
that they are once again ready to adopt an active political 
position in the existing balance between the branches. 
  All the indications are that this position will be an 
extremely inconvenient one for the president, which is evident 
from the fact that Zorkin, to whom Yeltsin has a widely known 
"political allergy" (mutual), has had his powers restored, and 
this is especially so in the absence of Vitruk, an acting 
chairman most loyal to Yeltsin. 
  The Constitutional Court's decision can be regarded both as 
a 
reaction to the defeat of the presidential team (or of the teams 
acceptable to him) in the 12 December elections and as a symptom 
of the weakening of Yeltsin's positions regarding other poles of 
political opinion, including the government. 
  The Constitutional Court, while no longer cunning in the 
sense that it says it will keep completely aloof from the 
country's political life, is again becoming an important and 
effective factor (like an ambuscade force) in Russian politics. 
At the moment it is difficult to say whether this will help to 
improve it. Maybe it would be no bad thing if the 
Constitutional Court did not start repeating its previous 
mistakes and lapsing into its own power ambitions but served as 
an effective brake, henceforth cautioning Russian politicians 
against excessively sudden movements and going too far.

  [Text] The Economic Freedom Party is prepared to withdraw 
its support for Boris Yeltsin and call for early presidential 
elections if "he tries to take a compromise stance or reduce the 
role he plays to that of an arbiter in forming the government 
and determining the reform course." This was the decision 
adopted by the party's third convention held in Moscow on 
January 26. 
  The political resolution of the convention says that the 
party will back the president if the government policy "gives 
priority to financial stabilization, tangible support for 
entrepreneurship, reduction of taxes and taxation reform and 
providing the right climate for economic restructuring." 
  The party thinks that the situation in the country "may 
culminate in increased social tension and economic hardships." 
Still, President Yeltsin is said to have a real potential to 
prevent this development if he "forms a government of reforms 
rather than a coalition government sheltering behind reformist 
phraseology." 
  "As things stand in Russia today, the president must not 
agree to the role of an arbiter some would impose on him," the 
political resolution runs. 
  The party will take an active part in regional and local 
elections. "It is on success in these elections that the party's 
future will largely depend," the party chairman Konstantin 
Borovoy said at a news conference Wednesday. He also said that 
the Economic Freedom Party intended to interact with democratic 
and reform forces and would work for a broad democratic 
coalition in parliament.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] INTERFAX has learned that ex-Finance Minister Boris 
Fedorov prepared a review "Russia's Finances in 1993," a kind of 
Finance Ministry report of the work done. The document also 
includes prognoses on the developments in the country's economy 
in 1994. 
  According to Fedorov, the principal conclusions are: 
  1. In 1993, the ministry on the whole stuck to the 
anti-inflation orientation of Russia's financial policy and make 
a considerable step forward. The most ingenuous analysis shows 
that there was no "shock therapy" at all. 
  2. Nearly all principal decisions have already been made, 
the only thing left is to calmly and consistently pursue this 
policy, develop a set of instruments and build market 
institutions and mechanisms. 
  3. A market economy already exists in Russia, and it is 
possible to regulate it by market means, e.g. by monetary 
measures. There is no real alternative to the policy that is 
being pursued, and there could not be one. 
  4. The results would have been more substantial, had the 
government and the Central Bank supported and pursued the 
monetary and credit policies they proclaimed. The Finance 
Ministry alone cannot restructure the whole country's economy. 
  5. The turn away from reforms which began to take shape in 
the beginning of 1994 (shift to mythical non-monetary methods, 
raising the industrial output at the expense of additional 
emission, neglect of elementary financial discipline) is doomed 
to failure. The situation in the economy will inevitably 
worsen. A market economy cannot be regulated by the same 
methods that Gosplan (the State Planning Committee) used. 
  6. Any waiver of this policy must be short-term and 
politically motivated. It is already impossible to reverse the 
course of the development of Russia' economy by peaceful means. 
However, it is the people who will pay out of their own pockets 
for the waiver. "Red businessmen" are throwing the country into 
an abyss of limp decay and non-competence again. 
  The review also suggests three versions of the financial and 
economic policies for 1994: 
  THE FIRST VERSION implies "refusing the wide-spread idea 
that 
problems of structural reconstruction might be solved at the 
expense of monetary emission, especially when the conditions for 
the effective use of financial resources in the real sector are 
not yet created." 
  According to the first version, it would be more expedient 
to 
gradually reduce the Central Bank's emission by about three 
times compared to 1993 and keep it down to 5% of GDP in 
the 
fourth quarter of this year. In this case, inflation would 
amount to 5-6% a month by this summer. The ruble would 
trade 
against the US dollar at 2,000-2,500 in the second half of the 
year. By the end of the year, GDP would shrink by another 
8-10% compared to last December. After a sharp fall in the 
first quarter of 1994, people's real incomes would grow by 
another 10% by the end of the year, e.g. by about the 
same as 
in 1993. 
  THE SECOND VERSION envisions that the government will 
continue to support industries by emitting more money and 
granting credits, but very discreetly. 
  According to this version, the Central Bank's emission would 
reach 9-10% of GDP in the first half of the year and 
decrease 
by 1.5 times by the end of the year. This would allow 
preservation of the average monthly inflation rate of 
11-12% 
obtained by the end of 1993 and a positive re-financing interest 
rate. On the whole, GDP would be shrinking by about 7-9% 
by 
December 1994. People's real incomes would remain the same as 
in 1993. The ruble's rate would grow slower than the inflation 
rate and would total 4,500-5,000 rubles per US dollar by the end 
of the year. Like the previous one, this version would make 
possible constructive cooperation with international financial 
institutions, real financial aid and agreement in restructuring 
Russia's foreign debt. 
  THE THIRD VERSION "reflects the situation taking a feasible 
shape in late January 1994: A reverse from the moderately 
strict credit and monetary policies pursued in 1993." According 
to this variant, the government will boost monetary emission to 
cover the budget deficit, as the Central Bank will grant more 
credits. There will be re-introduced the institution of 
privileged credits, delays of payments and writing off the 
agro-industrial complex's debts. 
  The review points out that in its assessment of the 
quantitative parameters of this version, the ministry took into 
account the presidential decree setting the maximum deficit of 
the federal budget financed at the expense of the Central Bank's 
credit at 7.5 Tn rubles. 
  This is why the credit emission was more likely to expand at 
the expanse of the Central Bank's credits to the industries 
(seasonal works in agriculture, delivery of goods to the 
northern regions, aid to the fuel and energy complex, etc.) and 
channelling its incomes to the budget. In addition, decisions 
to pay out a number of "production" debts to defense 
enterprises, agriculture, and for purchase of grain from the 
budget of 1993 are being prepared. 
  Taking into account the expected tax earnings in the first 
quarter of 1994 and the maximum deficit limit set by the 
president, payment of the "production" debts is possible only if 
the announced indexing of salaries of employees of state bodies 
is cancelled. Therefore, the inflation mechanism will function 
in the following way: the Central Bank's credits to the 
industries and the "production" re-orientation of budget 
spending will result in a swift aggravation of the situation in 
the budget sphere. This will indeed require indexing the 
salaries of budget-supported enterprises' employees in the 
second quarter. 
  To support the industries balancing on the brink of the 
budget's survival, the credit emission will have to increase up 
to 25-30% of GDP by mid-summer. This is a moderately 
realistic 
assessment of the activities of "red businessmen" (the Ukrainian 
government granted credits totalling half of GDP in 1993). So, 
Russia may face a "Ukrainization" of its economy in the third 
quarter of 1994. Negative processes in finance will be further 
aggravated by an outflow of capital and a sharp drop of the 
ruble. 
  The authors of the review point out that "the attempt to 
replace monetary methods for control of inflation with 
non-monetary ones such as restricted prices, compulsory sale of 
all hard currency earnings, fixed rate of the ruble, obligatory 
deliveries , etc., will finally mean gradually curbing not only 
economic, but also political reforms, and the course for 
democratization of society."

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General of Aviation Viktor Kot, </F>
commander in chief of the Russian Air Force, by Major Sergey 
Babichev; date, place not given: "Air Force Acquires New Image. 
Colonel General of Aviation Viktor Kot, Commander in Chief of 
the Russian Air Force, Discusses Some Results of Last Year's 
Combat Training and Aviators' Tasks This Year"] 
  [Text] [Kot] I will not hide the fact that last year was 
a difficult one for us. Not everything was done as we planned 
and as we would have liked. Nonetheless there is some cause for 
satisfaction. I think that the main task was accomplished: The 
combat readiness of the Air Force matches the requirements of 
the time. 
  The High Command focused its main efforts on implementing 
the 
plan for the organizational development of the Air Force, which 
made provision for improving the organizational structure and 
the command and control system, and on creating combat ready 
aviation groupings on Russia's new borders. A fundamentally new 
approach to the use of the Air Force was sought. It was 
essential to arrive at a balanced ratio between combat and 
support components. To some extent we have achieved this. 
  [Babichev] It was pointed out when the Defense Ministry 
summed up the results of 1993 that flying time had dropped in 
the Air Force. What impact has this had on the state of combat 
readiness? 
  [Kot] The country's economic difficulties have affected the 
combat readiness of the Air Force and the Armed Forces as a 
whole. Irregular supplies of fuel and lack of the requisite 
quantity of spare parts prevented the flight training plan from 
being implemented in full. 
  But when talking about figures for overall flying time you 
must bear in mind that in this period there has been a 
tremendous drop in the number of Air Force personnel, flight 
personnel included. The size of the aircraft pool has dropped as 
a result of obsolete aircraft being removed from the arsenal. 
You could not therefore have expected overall flying time -- 
compared with last year -- to remain the same with that kind of 
reorganization of the Air Force. 
  Nonetheless throughout the past year we tried to keep 
personnel's air combat proficiency at the requisite level. 
Exercises conducted in conjunction with other branches of the 
Armed Forces demonstrated that we were successful in this. 
  As well as tackling combat training tasks last year 
military-transport pilots transported over 10,000 [as published] 
people and over 11,000 tonnes of national economic freight. We 
delivered technological equipment to the Surgut oil men, metal 
working machines to the Norilsk mining and metallurgical 
combine, and humanitarian freight from Germany. Residents of 
various parts of the country experienced military-transport 
aviation's aid. 
  Logged flying hours and lasting skills have always been the 
basis of successful flight operations. Regrettably, pilots' 
average flying time is in fact a long way from well-founded 
norms. I myself am a pilot and know where this can lead. 
Nonetheless, in 1993 we managed to somewhat reduce the number 
of air crashes. 
  While being aware of the acuteness of problems of material 
and technical support for the Air Force and their adverse effect 
on flight safety, I must admit that they are not responsible for 
the chronic accident rate. Most of the accidents in the air 
could have been averted had personnel acted competently. 
Accidents and crashes are primarily due to flagrant deviations 
from procedures for organizing flights and carrying out missions. 
  When analyzing the results of the year we would note that, 
despite all the difficulties inherent in the situation, around 
90 percent of aviation regiments operated accident-free. The Air 
Force High Command has not created any special conditions for 
them. This convinces us that it is possible to avoid accidents 
and disasters when flying. All that is needed is systematic 
preventive work by all categories of airmen. 
  [Babichev] You broached the question of the reduction in 
personnel. It is a topical subject, one that worries many 
people, sometimes giving rise not only to well-founded demands, 
but also to misinterpretation.... 
  [Kot] That's true. I would like to point out right away 
that it is primarily the Air Force managerial apparatus that is 
being cut back. Authorized strength has been cut by 34,200 
servicemen in total. 
  The Air Force remembers the grim wholesale cadre cuts during 
the late fifties and early sixties. The result being thousands 
of shattered lives and a drastic slowdown in aircraft 
development. It subsequently took the Air Force almost 25 years 
to take wing again. The present reduction in officer cadres has 
had virtually no impact on the activity of combined formations 
and units. It is primarily officers who have completed their 
legally prescribed term of service and who are socially secure 
who are being discharged. We are not ordering those people to 
stay on if they have decided to leave military service for some 
reason and find themselves a post in civilian structures. 
Admittedly, there are fewer of them around now. The reverse is 
already starting to happen. Many people have become 
disenchanted after working or attempting to work for commercial 
structures and are asking to be reinstated in the ranks of the 
Armed Forces. 
  [Babichev] What is the reason for this, in your view? 
  [Kot] I primarily think that this is happening because 
officers are more secure than they were before and, second, it 
is hard for a military man -- after several years serving in a 
team of officers where he always met with understanding, 
experienced mutual assistance, and felt confident in the future 
-- to get accustomed to new relationships, different ways of 
achieving objectives, and the individualism that exists in a 
civilian environment. Part of my job is to talk to officers who 
have had an opportunity to compare life in and outside the Army. 
Many of them are profoundly convinced that by no means everyone 
can find a niche on civvy street. We take an understanding view 
of those who are determined to continue serving in the Air Force. 
  When thinking about the future of the Air Force, we pay 
particular attention to young officers. Despite the acute 
housing problems almost every one of them, on entering a line 
unit after graduating from school, gets a place in an officers' 
hostel. Where possible family men are given apartments. What 
is more a relocation allowance -- which did not previously exist 
-- to some extent helps overcome material difficulties. 
  [Babichev] The problem of servicemen's social security has 
always been among the most acute. Not least for those returning 
home from nearby foreign countries and further afield. How do 
things stand now in the Air Force with the troop withdrawal? 
What has been done for the "returnees"? 
  [Kot] In 1993 around 200 units were withdrawn from nearby 
foreign countries and further afield, including two formation 
command elements, four combined formation command elements, 17 
Air Force regiments, and support units. People's futures and 
tremendous work involved in accommodating the withdrawn units 
and personnel and preserving the tremendous material assets and 
equipment lie behind these figures. 
  We are doing everything to ensure that every servicemen 
feels 
that there is a reception waiting for him at home. Thus, in the 
past year around 6,000 apartments have been built under the 
capital construction plan, over 900 finished apartments have 
been bought with state budget money, over 200 with 
extrabudgetary funds, and over 600 apartments procured through 
foreign firms' efforts. 
  While aware that these figures will not alleviate the 
acuteness of the housing problem, we are working for the future. 
The situation is as follows: At the beginning of 1994 families 
without apartments total around 30,000 people. 
  [Babichev] Viktor Sevastyanovich, in the new year of 1994, 
it 
is evidently not only the housing problem that is worrying Air 
Force command. What else affects combat readiness? 
  [Kot] We are most concerned over the good repair of the 
aircraft fleet and the problem of further improving aviation 
technology and arms. The drop in defense order appropriations 
and the lag in the indexation of the allocated funds are forcing 
us to seek new approaches to resolving these problems. 
  We are focusing our main efforts on top-priority 
developments 
of fifth-generation aviation complexes and buying spare parts to 
maintain the aircraft fleet in a state of good repair. 
  We are not complaining about the problems, but seeking ways 
to resolve them. The leadership of the Air Force High Command 
realizes the importance and complexity of the tasks set by the 
defense minister for the new training year and is taking steps 
to carry them out.

  [Text] Information has come to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS from 
trustworthy sources about a new reorganization of the Russian 
state security structure. 
  The president's staff is processing documents on the 
creation 
of yet another special service. Plans are in the works to 
remove the military intelligence directorate from the Russian 
Federation Federal Counterintelligence Service, and to create on 
its basis a separate state security structure. This is being 
done in order to place the military counterintelligence men in 
control of the army directly under the president of Russia.

<F P=106> [By G. Sablin and A. Troshin from Kaliningrad; from the </F>
"Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Sablin] The combat and tactical training of Baltic 
Fleet crews and ships deserves the highest appraisal. This 
opinion was expressed to journalists by Admiral Igor Kasatonov, 
first deputy commander in chief of the Navy, summing up the 
results of his visit to bases of Russia's oldest fleet. 
Dwelling on the timescale for the withdrawal naval forces from 
Latvia, he confirmed the readiness of the last major unit -- a 
submarine brigade -- to quit Liepaja by 1 June of this year. 
  At the same time Igor Kasatonov stressed that with the loss 
of its bases in Baltic countries, the Russian Navy will not lose 
its might or mobility. 
  [Admiral I. Kasatonov] Whereas the fleet now has 27 percent 
of nuclear warheads, this figure will rise to 42-47 percent by 
the year 2000. On 21 December I had the honor of being the 
senior Ministry of Defense official attending the laying of the 
keel of the latest submarine. In addition, the keels of a 
number of surface vessels have also been laid, and individual 
vessels have been commissioned. 
  However, the concept of a new fleet, the fleet for the third 
millenium, needs to be confirmed. Naturally, it will have to 
pass through government.

<F P=106> ["ADS" report: "Russia Sells Fewer Weapons"] </F>
  [Text] Russian armaments and military hardware export last 
year was $2.117 billion (35 percent of 1990 exports); the export 
of civilian products was $513.6 million (26 percent of the 1990 
exports). This was reported on 26 January at the collegium of 
the State Committee on the Defense Industry by committee 
chairman Viktor Glukhikh. Export, according to him, should 
become one of the main sources of funds for the upkeep of the 
military production and research facilities because the 
purchases of armaments and military hardware, as well as budget 
appropriations for Russia's Defense Ministry, have been sharply 
curtailed. To be successful on the foreign market it is 
necessary to create a new system of organization of foreign 
economic activity by Defense Ministry enterprises. With this in 
mind, the State Committee on the Defense Industry has drawn up a 
draft law on Russia's military-technological cooperation with 
other countries, and a draft government decree granting to 
enterprises independence in foreign economic activities. Viktor 
Glukhikh thinks that the main role in the weapons market should 
belong to the developer and producer.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of the State Duma </F>
Defense Committee, by Vladimir Klimov: "Sergey Yushenkov: The 
Army Needs To Be Thoroughly Reformed"] 
  [Text] Sergey Nikolayevich Yushenkov is chairman of the 
State Duma Defense Committee. Our military observer Vladimir 
Klimov asked him to talk about the committee's work plans. 
  [Yushenkov] We will be approving the work plans at a 
committee sitting in the very near future. The draft laws we 
will be preparing and the changes to existing laws can be split 
into several groups. 
  In the first I would place laws envisaged by the Russian 
Federation Constitution: the Law on Martial Law, the Law on the 
State of Emergency, and the Law on Alternative Service. That 
represents our foundation. The laws are extremely wide-ranging 
in their effect and they require meticulous, detailed study. 
  The next group comprises laws connected with the main points 
of the military doctrine. Basically we will be examining 
amendments to existing laws. For example, the Law on Military 
Obligation and Military Service must be brought in line with 
presidential edicts and the military doctrine. Changes will be 
made to the Law on Defense, the Law on the Status of Servicemen, 
and the Law on Additional Guarantees and Compensation for 
Servicemen. 
  The third group -- perhaps it should be regarded as the 
second in terms of importance -- will include laws that will set 
parameters for the reform of the Armed Forces. First, the Law 
on Defense Expenditure. That is, the economic and financial 
aspects of the reform and the identification of the structure of 
expenditure and the quantitative parameters. Equally important 
is the Law on Civilian Monitoring. If we are building a 
rule-of-law state, then this implies civilian monitoring of the 
activities of the power structures, glasnost, and access to 
information -- in fact, hitherto, certain topics that are not 
state secrets have been declared closed. 
  The next group of laws regulate military service in the 
border forces, internal forces, and special services. They 
might include social guarantees for servicemen, members of their 
families, and people who have been discharged into the reserves. 
  [Klimov] What is your relationship, Sergey Nikolayevich, 
with the power structures, in particular with the Defense 
Ministry? 
  [Yushenkov] Above all I must stress that we are not the 
Armed Forces Committee, but the Defense Committee. Anything 
relating to defense falls within the sphere of our activity: 
the military-economic, military-technical, and the actual 
military policy of the state. And the part of the 
military-industrial complex that services defense. 
  We have not been operating for long, so we do not have any 
close contacts with the power structures as yet. But we are 
already developing a working relationship with the Defense 
Ministry. 
  [Klimov] Sergey Nikolayevich, what can be regarded as the 
priority problems in the social sphere? 
  [Yushenkov] Things are difficult for society and even more 
difficult for the Army, since it is very hard to be a stable 
organism in an unstable society. You know what a problem the 
draft is at the moment. As a result officers are sometimes 
performing the functions of privates: guard details, alert 
duty. But they are not getting paid and are not being given 
apartments. 
  The Army needs to be thoroughly reformed, not merely for the 
sake of it, but in order to be able to achieve the goals the 
Armed Forces face. 
  [Klimov] Only a very strong team can tackle such important 
and extensive plans. Who is on the committee? 
  [Yushenkov] There are 16 people. Some of them are very well 
known. For example, Artur Nikolayevich Chilingarov, president 
of the association of polar expedition members, a man who spent 
six months at the North and South Poles and got in the Guinness 
Book of Records. Dmitriy Antonovich Volkogonov needs no 
introduction. Colonel General Yuriy Nikolayevich Rodionov is 
Russian Federation deputy chief military inspector. 
  [Klimov] The current composition of the State Duma is 
extremely varied. Are you optimistic about the future, Sergey 
Nikolayevich? 
  [Yushenkov] There are questions on which common sense must 
prevail. Although there are bound to be people in the Duma who 
will place political and ideological functions before actual 
legislative activity. This must be seen as inevitable. 
Churchill said that demcracy is the worst form of government, 
but mankind has not come up with anything better.

  [Text] St. Petersburg January 27 TASS -- "For the president 
when he is resolving the most important problems of the 
country's life, it is very important to see sentiments of the 
people, understand how they live, what they need and in what 
mood they are," mayor of St. Petersburg Anatoliy Sobchak told 
ITAR-TASS summing up the results of Boris Yeltsin's visit to St. 
Petersburg where he participated in the festivities devoted to 
the fiftieth anniversary of the full lifting of the blockade of 
Leningrad during World War II. 
  Despite this holiday, the head of state and the leadership 
of 
the city and the region, at a meeting behind closed doors, 
managed to discuss a wide range of actual problems for the 
region which demanded the settlement at the presidential level. 
  According to Anatoliy Sobchak, the president promised to 
support the St. Petersburg authorities in financing, from the 
federal budget, the construction of new metro lines which are 
extremely necessary to the city. The mayor of St. Petersburg 
obtained Boris Yeltsin's consent to promote the St. Petersburg 
project of accomplishing the construction of the dam [as 
received]. This issue will be submitted for the Russian 
Government's consideration. 
  Participants in the meeting discussed the possibilities of 
crediting of house building which is very actual for St. 
Petersburg where considerable part of the population are still 
living in shared flats. The spectrum of issues discussed today 
was extremely wide, also including subsidizing products of stock 
breeding which are delivered to St. Petersburg from the 
Leningrad region, timely receipt of funds for the preparation 
for the Good Will Games due to be held in summer, and quoting 
some kinds of goods. 
  Special attention was paid to the settlement of problems 
with 
petrol taking into account that the Surgut Company is the 
monopolist in petrol deliveries to St. Petersburg and therefore 
maintains prices for this fuel at the highest level in the 
country. According to Anatoliy Sobchak, the city authorities 
proposed to the president the mechanism for overcoming the 
monopolism in this field, and the president intends to sign an 
appropriate decree. 
  The sensation of the day was the St. Petersburg mayor's 
report that Boris Yeltsin agreed in principle to turn the city 
of Kronshtadt into a free economic zone. This city will be 
stage-by- stage opened up for tourists and citizens of St. 
Petersburg. The navy base located on the territory of 
Kronshtadt will have to be moved to some other place. According 
to Anatoliy Sobchak, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev who 
was present at the meeting said "yes" on this issue. 
  In addition, many problems concerning the Leningrad region 
were solved at the Russian president's meeting with the 
leadership of this region.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Lukhashov report in the "Marathon" column: "Moscow </F>
and Kazan: A New Round of Negotiations. Will Tatarstan Get a 
Special Status?"] 
  [Text] As SEGODNYA's correspondent has learned, the next 
round of talks between the Russian and Tatar delegations on the 
signing of a treaty of mutual delegation of powers and 
jurisdiction has been scheduled for 4 February. On the 
following day a meeting will take place between Boris Yeltsin 
and Mintimer Shaymiyev. 
  It is hard to understand what is forcing the Russian 
authorities to undertake this generally unpopular move at this 
moment. In the Kazan corridors of power this treaty is being 
described in no other way than interstate. Possibly Mr. 
Shaymiyev's hints that if the treaty is not signed before 13 
March (on that day repeat elections to the Federal Assembly are 
set in Tatarstan), "the republic's people will react 
accordingly." 
  Be that as it may, the talks have continued for two years, 
and they are now nearing the finish line. 
  According to Tatarstan Vice President Vasiliy Likhachev, who 
is head of the delegation to the talks, the most intensive 
period of coordinating the sides' positions has now begun. Not 
only the draft treaty is being discussed but also draft 
intergovernment agreements, seven of which were signed last 
year. At present five more are pending: on crime control (it 
is practically ready), on finances (the debate is over 
Tatarstan's demands for independence in defining the interest 
rate on credits allocated by the Russian Central Bank and also 
that the republic's government be granted the power to influence 
its share in money emission), on budget relations (through how 
many channels and in what volume to remit taxes to the center), 
on military matters, and on foreign economic activity. On the 
latter issue Tatarstan demands that the republic's status on 
foreign markets be adjusted to its constitution, which says that 
"Tatarstan...is a subject of international law." 
  The Tatar delegation members' optimism is enhanced by the 
fact that, according to Mr. Likhachev, "the Russian side relates 
with understanding to the republic's aspiration to define its 
status in the Russian Federation." The Russian side at the 
talks is represented by Sergey Shakhray, Aleksandr Shokhin, and 
Viktor Gerashchenko. The Russian delegation is led by Vice 
Premier Yuriy Yarov. The Tatarstan vice president, with this 
setup, also considers realistic the long-cherished idea of 
formalizing Tatarstan's special status in the Russian 
Constitution. 
  "At the same time we understand the measure of our 
responsibility in this activity," says republic Prime Minister 
Mukhammat Sabirov. "There are two viewpoints from which the 
results of this work can be perceived by Federation components. 
But we believe that Tatarstan has matured for a new type of 
relations with Russia and for a mutual delegation of powers. I 
am sure that the whole of Russia will follow our example. This 
is the only way of guaranteeing stability of the Russian economy 
and Russia's unity..." 
  Furthermore it also needs to be taken into account that the 
repeat nomination of deputy candidates to the Federal Assembly 
should be completed a month prior to the elections, that is to 
say on 13 February. Therefore the Russian and Tatarstan 
delegations do not have very much time left. And if after two 
years of talks the treaty is finally signed, then one would 
probably agree with Vasiliy Likhachev who has already defined 
this event as historic.

  [Text] Sevastopol -- The Black Sea Fleet Press Center 
reports that over 20 combat ships of the Black Sea Fleet put out 
to sea on 26 January in accordance with the plan for 1994 to 
practice combat training tasks. One of the aims of the Black 
Sea Fleet sailors' training exercise is to provide instruction 
for their young reinforcements, with 4,500 conscripts from 
Ukraine among them. 
  The command of the Black Sea Fleet, in the words of Mykola 
Savchenko, Ukrainian Navy Press Center head, did not coordinate 
its actions with respect to this training exercise, either with 
the Navy commander or the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, which 
contravenes the accord between the Russian and Ukrainian 
presidents of 17 June 1993. In particular, it contravenes 
Article 6, in accordance with which the fleet command was to 
have notified not only the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and the 
president of Ukraine in advance, but also the leadership of 
Sevastopol and the Crimea.

  [Text] Chairman of the Ukrainian parliament's Commission on 
Legislation and Law, a leader of the Ukrainian Communist Party, 
Aleksandr Kotsuba, doubted that the ratification of the Moscow 
statement of the three presidents (U.S.A., Russia and Ukraine -- 
IF) could "guarantee the total security of Ukraine." 
  He said in an interview with INTERFAX-Ukraine that it was 
necessary to consider some provisions of the trilateral 
statement in the parliament. In his words, it was hard to 
understand "why primarily the SS-24 missiles controlled by us 
must be withdrawn from Ukrainian territory and not the obsolete 
SS-19 which we do not control and cannot launch." 
  In his opinion, "it was necessary to demand the 
states-parties to the Helsinki, Paris, Vienna and Lisbon 
agreements and the UN member-states to participate in the 
agreement of the three presidents. It is necessary that not 
only Ukraine give up its missiles but that the other parties 
also reduce their numbers," Kotsuba pointed out. 
  He said that the president and the cabinet of ministers 
through the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry should initiate a number 
of treaties.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma by an </F>
unidentified reporter; place and date not given: "The First 
Serious Test for the Agreement by Three Presidents Will Be Its 
Ratification"] 
  [Text] The Moscow meeting of the three presidents that 
committed Ukraine to getting rid of its nuclear arsenal remains 
in the limelight of public attention. KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI asked 
Leonid Kuchma, a politician and expert in missile-building, to 
comment on the event. 
  [Reporter] Your opinion about the decision of the Russian, 
U.S., and Ukrainian presidents is interesting as the position of 
a politician and, more importantly, as a professional who has 
spent many years designing and building missiles. 
  [Kuchma] Let me single out several aspects of this 
undoubtedly momentous event for Ukraine. It is so important 
that I think the Ukrainian president should have first consulted 
with the public before making such a decision. He could then 
have used some trump cards in his discussions with parliament. 
Generally speaking, people should be involved in making such 
key decisions as this one, so that no one gets the impression 
that some deal was cut. 
  Now on to the decision itself. Its first aspect is purely 
political. It is no secret that over the past two years, 
deliberately and with the active participation of international 
media, people have been cultivating the image of Ukraine as a 
resentful, unstable, and unpredictable partner. Unfortunately, 
at that time, the world equated our country with such countries 
as Libya, North Korea, or Iraq. The main directions of this 
misinformation, and that is putting it mildly, are well known -- 
"communist reserve," "the country of bellicose nationalism," 
etc. But what really strikes the nerve of Western society is 
the notion that Ukraine is a "new nuclear monster." 
  I believe that in the beginning of this year, all conditions 
were ready for the complete political isolation of Ukraine 
followed by the liquidation of its independence. This state of 
things called for a breakthrough, a move capable of refuting at 
least some of the unfounded accusations thrown at Ukraine. And 
such a move that invoked positive reaction of the world has been 
made, I believe. 
  Secondly, a pretext for uncivilized economic pressure on 
Ukraine exerted by forces interested in it was removed. At 
present, one can no longer say that Ukraine poses a threat to 
Europe or the world, or that it stands in the way of global 
nuclear disarmament. This is why one needs to change their 
attitude and language during negotiations with Ukraine. 
  Third, it is a change in character of general European 
politics. On the one hand, Ukrainian stubbornness in 1993 made 
Europe and the whole world aware of its existence and managed to 
get the point across that it was ready to comply with 
international agreements -- only without hurting itself and with 
respect to its rights and interests, including economic ones. 
On the other hand, the hand- twisting practices applied by its 
partners in negotiations have hardly earned them much credit in 
Europe, showing that there are "little" and "great" countries in 
relations among states. 
  [Reporter] What can you say about the economic aspects of 
the agreement? Is it good for Ukraine, considering its trade and 
payment imbalance and growing oil debt to Russia? 
  [Kuchma] I would rather refrain from making an outright 
euphoric assessment. Ukraine was granted the right of full 
participation in nuclear disarmament, enjoying all of its 
benefits and advantages. Let me also not repeat the widely held 
belief that Ukraine supposedly received a generous gift. As of 
now, Ukraine has received nothing more than documented 
confirmation of its right to receive compensation for giving up 
its nuclear weapons, which were created to a large extent at the 
expense of its natural resources, finances, and labor potential. 
I am not excessively optimistic about the agreement's economic 
aspects, because I am confused by the all-too-vague terms of 
Ukraine's admission to the uranium markets, too vague terms and 
degree of compensation, as well as Bill Clinton's equivocal 
promises about economic cooperation and unrestrained investments 
in Ukraine. 
  Generally speaking, I agree that we undoubtedly saw Europe 
take a big step toward peace. It is hard to ignore the 
political significance of the event. However, the way the 
agreement was signed and the methods applied to reach a 
consensus were humiliating, not so much for Ukraine as for its 
overseas partner. In particular, I am sure that Mr. Clinton's 
tactless remark at Boryspol Airport in Kiev was humiliating to 
himself, most of all. 
  [Reporter] As far as I can remember, your position at the 
closed Supreme Council session in June of last year was slightly 
different. At that time, you were against Ukraine's nuclear 
disarmament. 
  [Kuchma] That is not true. I have always believed that for 
Ukraine, nonnuclear status is the only correct path for the 
future. I have always stressed this. However, in June of last 
year, we were told to disarm without any serious security or 
territorial guarantees, as well as any hint of compensation. 
The Ukrainian budget and economy will not survive nuclear 
disarmament on their own. Let me remind you that it was my 
government that came up with the proposal to handle the issue of 
nuclear disarmament in a complex manner, taking into 
consideration dismantling, transportation, processing, and so 
on. It was the first to bring up the problem of compensation 
for tactical missiles and emphasized the need to respect 
Ukrainian interests and rights in solving the problem of 
strategic missiles and intercontinental missile silos. I am 
glad that these rights and interests have eventually been 
recognized and taken into consideration. 
  In addition, the agreement provides Ukraine with access to 
large long-term credits, which would enable the country to 
establish a stabilization fund for its national currency and, 
therefore, curb inflation. The latter is the main precondition 
for saving the Ukrainian economy from collapse and increasing 
investments into it. One should not think, however, that this 
will come automatically without a hard work. We have no right 
to lose our chance, as was the case in 1992, when Ukraine had 
the potential to overcome the crisis. 
  [Reporter] What do you think will next happen to the 
agreement? It was negatively assessed by almost all Ukrainian 
political parties. 
  [Kuchma] The agreement's fate will depend on the goodwill of 
politicians. We know some "patriots" who did not manage to 
become professionals and whose words and judgments are much 
faster than their reasoning. At first, they forced the 
nonnuclear status into the Declaration of Independence, and now, 
the same people do not want to keep their promise to the people 
and the world. It would be a good thing to ask them when they 
were sincere -- when they promised an influx of Western money in 
return for nuclear weapons, or now, when they want to intimidate 
everyone with the missiles? In my opinion, their criticism is a 
result of a lack of political professionalism. Anyway, the 
first serious test for the agreement of the three presidents 
will be its ratification by the Ukrainian Supreme Council. I am 
afraid that, as usual, instead of the document's text or its 
geopolitical meaning being addressed, the main topics of 
discussion will be personal squabbles and a clash of interests 
between the executive and legislative branches. 
  If we manage to overcome this hurdle, the rest will depend 
on 
the goodwill and readiness of the United States and Russia to 
fulfill their obligations, as well as on our ability to take 
advantage of this historic opportunity.

  [Text] According to a decision of the Ukrainian Supreme 
Council, the Ukrainian contingent of the UN forces in the former 
Yugoslavia will be doubled in the next few months. Additional 
personnel and arms are already been sent to the Ukrainian 
battalion in Sarajevo. Despite the considerable losses 
sustained by the battalion while carrying out its peacekeeping 
mission -- six servicemen have been killed and about 30 wounded 
over a period of 18 months -- there is no shortage of 
volunteers. This is the only Ukrainian Army military unit in 
which three to four candidates are competing for each post. 
Indeed, many parents are asking commanders to send their sons 
to serve precisely in this subunit. The reason is simple: Each 
man here gets about 10 times more than the Ukrainian defense 
minister. For the first time, servicewomen have been included 
in the new personnel of the battalion. These Ukrainian Amazons 
will be able, where necessary in combat conditions, render first 
aid to their male colleagues.

  [Text] Quoting official sources at the Azerbaijani Defense 
Ministry, TURAN reported that the dispatch of military hardware 
and arms from Russia to Armenia has been stepped up in recent 
days. According to Azerbaijani intelligence data, the arms and 
military hardware are being flown from Sochi to Gyumri on board 
military cargo planes. The same source says the Russian 
military cargo planes are carrying out around 30 flights a day. 
  TURAN claims that Armenia has already received a few dozen 
modern tanks from Russia. According to the news agency, the 
arms dispatch was stepped up following Armenian defeats on the 
battlefront. 
  As proof, TURAN cites an AFP correspondent in Armenia 
claiming that officials in Yerevan are not hiding that the flow 
of military hardware from Russia became possible after Yegor 
Gaydar resigned; he was stingy about this. 
  In connection with untrue Azerbaijani press reports, a SNARK 
reporter asked Seyran (Shakhbugaryan), the head of the Armenian 
Defense Ministry Press Service, to comment on this issue. 
(Shakhbugaryan) stated that the military cooperation between 
Russia and Armenia is in line with the status of the Russian 
troops in Armenia. Beyond that, no arms have ever or are being 
dispatched.

  [Text] Yerevan, 27 Jan (ARMENPRES)--The relative calm 
prevailing on Armenia's borders for the last few days was again 
disrupted today. The Azerbaijani Army formations shelled Sotk 
(former Zod) in Vardenisskiy Rayon with Grad rockets at 1730 
today. 
  At the same time, two SU-25 warplanes belonging to the 
Azerbaijani Air Force violated our Republic's airspace and 
dropped two bombs around Sotk. 
  Our border guards took countermeasures and silenced the 
enemy, shooting down one of the two SU-25 planes. 
  There are no casualties but there is destruction on our 
side.

<F P=106> [Report by David Petrosyan under the "Internal Affairs" </F>
rubric: Once Again About the Power of the Party Apparatus. On 
Circumstances of the Resignation of Armenia's State Security 
Chief"] 
  [Text] Armenian political quarters continue to discuss the 
reasons that made President Levon Ter-Petrosyan fire Eduard 
Simonyants, chief of the State National Security Directorate 
(SNSD). His duties were, quite unexpectedly for everyone, 
temporarily transferred to David Shakhnazaryan, the president's 
ambassador at large. 
  The need for a structural adjustment of this far from simple 
organization has come to a head. Interestingly enough, that has 
been started precisely now that the former SNSD chief seemed to 
have been ready to get ahead with leisurely evolutionary changes 
and to direct his staffers to fulfill the tasks of intelligence 
and counterintelligence in the interests of national security 
rather than to crack down on dissidents. 
  The opposition press has put forward various versions trying 
to account for this reshuffle. In particular, left-wing radical 
publications argue that the fired SNSD chief not only was part 
of the elite of the virtually ruling party, the Armenian 
Pan-national Movement (APM), and was one of the team of the 
president's chief national security adviser, Ashot Manucharyan, 
who resigned last summer. It is this team of the "internal" 
intellectual opposition that the powers that be allegedly fear 
most of all, and the president's moves come precisely from the 
desire to get rid of the stranger. 
  There is, however, yet another interpretation of the events. 
Last December, Armenian Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan tried 
unsuccessfully to get parliamentarians to amend the law "On the 
State Bank." He based his demand on the fact that only by 
including the head of the State Bank in the government was it 
possible to curb inflation and carry through reforms. 
Parliament staunchly beat back the premier's attack. A new 
idea then arose: to put in the state bank director's chair 
"their own man" -- Bagrat Asatryan, chairman of one of the 
parliamentary commissions and member of the APM board. That, 
however, was opposed by some APM functionaries and 
parliamentarians who argued that Mr. Asatryan, being an 
economist, was not still a banking expert, whereas Mr. Isaakyan, 
who held this office, was a professional. Judging from some 
signs, the negotiations were not long: The party bosses 
demanded, in exchange for support in parliament, that the last 
"stranger" head of one of the "power" agency in Armenia be 
removed. 
  The recent session of the Armenian parliament all the same 
confirmed Bagrat Asatryan in the post of director of the State 
Bank of Armenia. APM deputies honored the terms of the deal, 
and the executive branch had no other option but to keep its 
part of the bargain. 
  The opposition believes that the one to gain from this 
resignation is, first and foremost, the "omnipotent" Internal 
Affairs Minister Vano Siradegyan, whose agency at last has real 
chances to turn into a "superministry" and to exercise even 
greater control over many spheres of the republic's internal 
life. 
  Local political observers nevertheless hope that David 
Shakhnazaryan, who has proven himself to be a serious political 
figure, will be able to keep his agency out of politics, and 
that Armenia is not threatened with "witch-hunting."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>
  [Text] United Nations Organisation January 28 TASS -- 
Georgia is urging the U.N. Security Council to "launch a 
full-scale peace-keeping operation in the whole territory of the 
Abkhazian region," says a letter of Georgia's permanent 
representative at the United Nations Pyotr Chkheidze, circulated 
here on Thursday as a Security Council document. 
  According to the letter, the war in Abkhazia "has brought to 
a critical condition the economic situation of the Republic of 
Georgia and turned hundreds of thousands of people into homeless 
refugees. There are no visible signs that their situation is 
improving." The letter pointed out that this situation "may 
create serious preconditions for spontaneous actions on the part 
of 300,000 refugees and displaced persons," and may bring to 
naught the agreements reached by the two sides in Geneva. 
  "Taking into account those circustances and facing a real 
danger of another wave of violence in that region, the Georgian 
Government is urging the world community to render assistance in 
launching a full-scale peace-keeping operation on the whole 
territory of the Abkhazian region, using the U.N. force or, if 
this problem cannot be resolved quick enough, using any other 
force sanctioned by the U.N. As is known, this approach has been 
recorded in a communique on the second round of talks, held in 
Geneva," the letter said. 
  "Quoting provisions of the communique and taking into 
consideration the understanding of this request, displayed by 
the Russian leadership, as well as its direct interest in 
preventing the spreading of the conflict outside the Georgian 
territory and, in the long run, in the stabilisation of the 
situation in the whole area, the Georgian leadership is 
welcoming Russia's readiness to take part in the peace-keeping 
operation in Abkhazia with a view to attaining that goal. 
Contingents from other countries may be attached to Russian 
peace-keeping units, along with the participation of U.N. 
military observers, in accordance with a Security Council 
resolution," the Georgian representatve wrote.

  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali advised the 
Security Council [UNSC] to prolong the mandate of the UN mission 
of observers in Georgia until 15 March 1994. It was mentioned in 
the speech by the UN secretary general on the situation in 
Abkhazia, which was circulated here in the United Nations as a 
document of the Security Council. 
  It is mentioned in the speech by Butrus-Ghali that the 
Security Council on 4 November 1993 adopted Resolution No. 881 
and approved maintaining a presence of a small UN mission of 
observers in Georgia until 31 January 1994 for establishing 
links with both of the conflicting sides as well as Russian 
military contingents. The Security Council decreed not to 
prolong the mandate of the mission beyond 31 January 1994 unless 
the secretary general reported to the council of considerable 
progress in carrying out the measures aimed at achieving a solid 
peace. 
  The Geneva memorandum of understanding signed on 1 December 
1993 points to a hopeful progress in establishing a solid peace 
in the region, said Butrus-Ghali. It was exactly in this 
connection that on 22 January 1994 the Security Council adopted 
Resolution No. 892, said Butrus-Ghali, which gives a sanction to 
the United Nations to gradually deploy about 50 additional 
military observers -- besides the five who are already there [in 
Georgia]. 
  Butrus-Ghali said: In Paris, the Georgian head of state 
Eduard Shevardnadze and I thoroughly discussed the situation in 
Abkhazia. He asked me earnestly to give recommendations to the 
Security Council for a speedy deployment of the UN military 
observers in Abkhazia. Considering the results of my talks with 
Shevardnadze, I ordered my colleagues and the chief military 
observer of the UN observers' mission in Georgia to study the 
expediency of a further growth -- over 55 observers -- of the 
number of UN observers in Georgia.

  [Text] Tbilisi January 28 TASS -- The Liberation of 
Abkhazia Organization (LAO), which is well-known for its radical 
statements and judgements about the questions of the return of 
refugees to abkhazia and restoration of georgia's jurisdiction 
over this autonomous republic, has been functioning in Tbilisi 
since the past four months. It comprises 16 georgian public 
movements and organizations which were forced to leave the 
conflict zone at the end of September 1993 and are at present 
located in tbilisi. 
  The radicalism of this organization's leadership was clearly 
manifested during today's meeting of the LAO leadership with 
representatives of the parliamentary majority. On behalf of the 
alo its chairman Boris Kakubayev has called on Georgian leader 
Eduard Shevardnadze and parliament to arrangee a meeting of LAO 
representatives with Russian President Boris Yeltsin during his 
forthcoming official visit to Tbilisi on February 3-4. 
  "If we are denied such ameeting, then we will be compelled 
to 
start a hunger strike in the near future at different places in 
Tbilisi, demanding to arrange our meeting with the president of 
Russia to expound our vision of the Abkhazia problem," Boris 
Kaubayev said. Georgian parliamentarys vice-speaker Vakhtang 
Rcheulishvili noted that President Yeltsin's programme of 
meetings in Tbilisi is not planned by the Georgian parliament, 
but by the president of russia himself and his team. 
  Boris Kakubayev's demand has evoked a contradictory reaction 
of those present who continued debating problems of Abkhazia and 
after LAO representatives and Boris Kakubayev himself left the 
conference hall. They explained it by the fact that the 
majority of deputies, comprising this parliamentary majority, 
had not come to the meeting. Kakubayev considered it as an 
indifference and lack of consideration to problems of Abkhazia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia by Nina </F>
Ambrosova; place and date not given: "Otar Patsatsia: `My 
Business Is To Serve the People....'" -- all questions published 
in boldface] 
  [Text] [Ambrosova]Batono [Georgian polite form of 
address] Otari, we know that you are currently very busy but you 
will agree that the accusation leveled against you by Bachuka 
Kardava, president of the young National-Democrats, is a serious 
one. What can you say regarding his statement? 
  [Patsatsia] Unfortunately, it has become a tradition here 
for young people to try to acquire high positions by using the 
most unacceptable methods. Kardava's statement testifies to 
this. I am sure that, if I were to offer Kardava the post of, 
say, procurator in Zugdidi, he would not dare say those things. 
I consider the statement to be wholly without foundation and 
not supported by any kind of proof. Perhaps I am being 
reproached for the fact that, in my time, I conducted a 
conciliatory policy in Zugdidi. However, even today, I adhere 
to the same view: There are not so many of us that we should 
kill one another and that brother should wage war against 
brother. This does not signify in any way my alliance with the 
Zviadists. Incidentally, I agree that Zviadism is a problem 
that has been artificially implanted in western Georgia. 
Throughout my life, I have proceeded from the belief that I 
should serve my people and not certain individuals. I would 
like to ask my opponents this question: What have they 
themselves done for Georgia? Apart from fighting fiercely and 
without scruples for the top position, forgetting that there is 
only one such position. Are there not more important problems 
facing Georgia such as economic and social problems? 
  [Ambrosova]In this respect, as far as we know, has 
Russia not granted Georgia 10 billion rubles credit? How will 
this money be spent? 
  [Patsatsia] Some of this money has already been used to pay 
our debts. We have also bought gas and fuel oil. We assume 
that the credit will be spent on paying for fuel and energy 
resources that are essential so as finally to activate industry 
and, at the same time, revive the economy. The means for this 
will be drawn in general from official long-term credits and not 
only those from Russia. This will enable us to implement work 
at the Tbilisi State Rayon Power Station that will be able to 
produce an additional 300 megawatts of electric power and, after 
putting into operation a new power bloc, to regulate the 
functioning of the network of Ingurskiy power stations. 
  [Ambrosova]The oil-prospecting work that is already in 
progress in Georgia should certainly be a boost to the 
economy. 
  [Patsatsia] Yes, you are right. In this respect, contacts 
have been established with Britain and Australia. In July, we 
are planning to install processing units at the sites. Of 
course, the initial extractions will be insufficient for 
Georgia's needs but there are great prospects for the future. 
In addition, exploration work is going on into new deposits in 
which Georgia is undoubtedly rich. 
  [Ambrosova]Batono Otari, you are often called an 
opponent of the market economy. With what is this 
connected? 
  [Patsatsia] This is connected with the fact that people here 
have a false understanding of many things, including the market 
economy. I am an advocate of the so-called Korean model of a 
state-controlled market economy. According to this model, a 
number of branches, those that are strategically important, 
should be controlled by the state. After all, if the state 
loses its monopoly on, for example, the food industry, how are 
we to exist? General privatization or rather misappropriation 
[prikhvatizatsiya] is taking place here, which will not bring 
the state anything; it is only being robbed. Ten percent of the 
population, in whose hands state property has been concentrated 
as a result of this misappropriation, has brought the entire 
nation to a state of impoverishment. The mafia rules here, if 
only as far as those coupon credits are concerned. As a result 
of the policy conducted by the previous government, huge sums of 
coupons, most of which were issued to private firms and 
individuals, have not brought the state a single kopeck and, 
what is more, most of these sums have not been returned. 
  [Ambrosova]Do you think that we will be faced with the 
threat of total collapse if Georgia does not join the ruble 
zone? 
  [Patsatsia] In principle, entry into the ruble zone is 
necessary. However, this remains just one question connected 
with the multitude of problems both here and in Russia. 
Economic relations between the countries of the former Soviet 
Union have changed radically. If, up to now, we have been 
living on subsidies, we can expect no one to feed us for free 
both in the CIS and the ruble zone. Yes, we will receive help 
with material and technical supplies. However, we will have to 
conduct financial policy ourselves. In order to do this, the 
economy has to be put back on its feet. 
  [Ambrosova]For how long will our government function 
without being approved? 
  [Patsatsia] I hope that the government will be approved 
within a month. I do not rule out changes in its composition. 
One can expect anything nowadays.

<F P=106> [From the "Digest" column: "Dialogue" between the </F>
newspapers SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO (Zhirinovskiy's Falcons) and 
ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI (Caucasian Military Gazette) 
containing quotations by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), and Zurab Gagnidze, 
chairman of the National Ideology Party of Georgia (NIPG)] 
  [Text] [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "Tomorrow, we will turn off 
the power in the Urals and it will be dark everywhere -- in the 
Baltic republics, the Caucasus, and Moldova. Everyone will shut 
up. Telegrams will be sent to the Kremlin: We surrender. Where 
is the Russian sanitary corps?" (Vladimir Zhirinovskiy [V.Z.]) 
  [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] The NIPG was the only 
party in Georgia that congratulated Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on his 
election success. The telegram states, in particular: "The 
successful outcome of the elections manifested the aspiration of 
the Russian people toward independence. We wish you success in 
following this course. We hope that the victory of the LDPR 
will have a positive influence on the achievement of genuine 
freedom in Georgia...." 
  [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "We have so many bacteriological and 
chemical weapons that we can contaminate the entire planet. We 
will infect everyone. We will have a crater but the whole world 
will perish. In two weeks...." (V.Z.) 
  [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] "Certain politologists 
call Zhirinovskiy a fascist out of ignorance. In actual fact, 
he is not a fascist but a nationalist in the best sense of the 
word." (Zurab Gagnidze [Z.G.], chairman of the NIPG, candidate 
of philosophical sciences) 
  [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "Furthermore, we are not seeking 
praise. However, the fact that President Saddam Husayn received 
us as the leaders of an opposition party and did not receive 
anyone else -- I was the first Russian received by him after the 
war.... He received me because a friend had arrived, a person 
whose position was well known. We exchanged gifts." (V.Z.) 
  [ZAKAVKASKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] "I believe that Gaydar is 
a bigger fascist...." (Z.G.) 
  [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "We can frighten [them]. I can tell 
you straight away: I will blackmail them. I'll tell them: If 
you start interfering in Russia's affairs in the south, we will 
take effective measures.... We already have military platforms 
in space. They don't know where they are. The weapons are ready 
there and targeted on the United States. If Yeltsin tells them 
that he has apparently given instructions to remove some of 
those weapons targeted on the United States, I, on the contrary, 
can tell Clinton that we have targeted all our weapons on 
America...." (V.Z.) 
  [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] "The LDPR is trying to 
preserve the national originality of its people...." "One can't 
help being attracted to.... The main thing is the struggle 
against American aggression. For a long time now, the Russian 
and Georgian intelligentsia have been alarmed by the spiritual 
expansion of the United States." (Z.G.) 
  [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "Troubles for Russia have always come 
from the south. All corruption began in the south when Stalin 
created favorable conditions for his native Georgia. This 
despot ruled Russia for 30 years during which time Georgia 
became perverted and tainted with corruption that spread to 
Armenia and Azerbaijan and subsequently to the East and central 
Asia; it crept to the surface and finally engulfed the whole 
country." (V.Z.) 
  [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] Correspondent: "Aren't 
you afraid that Zhirinovskiy will carry out his promise to 
create the provinces of Tiflis and Kutaisi on the territory of 
Georgia?" 
  [Gagnidze] We have to understand one another and locate the 
painful spots.... 
  [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "The most effective method -- perhaps 
the only method -- of putting an end to the bloody conflicts in 
the south and the Near East is to create a so-called `sanitary 
corridor' and, thereby, separate the irreconcilably bellicose 
countries. Russia is required to implement this division, a 
country that, in the process of historical development, has been 
called upon repeatedly by countries in the East to act as an 
arbitrator and protector (defender) of weak [states] who have 
been subject to the aggression of neighboring peoples. This was 
the case with Georgia and Turkmenistan that voluntarily attached 
themselves to Russia...." (V.Z.) 
  [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] "One would like to 
believe that all his recent assurances are sincere...." (Z.G.) 
  [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "The small nations can raise an 
objection; they will say that they also would like to have their 
own states. My answer will be: You should have thought about 
this a few centuries ago." (V.Z.) 
  [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] "I am very sorry that 
Shevardnadze has refrained from giving an assessment of the 
victory of the liberal democrats." (Z.G.) 
  [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "The ideal variant would have been to 
preserve the Russian empire. Some people do not like the word 
"empire" but I like it very much. It is a normal good word." 
(V.Z.) 
  [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] "In such conditions, our 
party has every reason to rely upon the support of the broad 
mass of the people. Let no one be worried by our small numbers. 
It is not a matter of quantity. The Communist Party suffered a 
crisis due to the excessive increase in the number of its 
members. The main thing is that there is support for our 
party's ideology. The future is ours." (Z.G.) 
  [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "The principal aim is the restoration 
of the Russian state (within the borders of the USSR)" -- from 
the LDPR program.

  [Excerpts] Riga, Jan 27, BNS -- Latvia's Cabinet will 
resign if the parliament adopts a needy budget that will soar 
inflation and force the government into borrowing money from the 
Bank of Latvia, Finance Minister Uldis Osis told BNS Thursday. 
  The government agrees to redivision of some of the planned 
spendings but it rejects attempts to hike the budget shortfall 
to a limit that will provoke heavy inflation, said Osis. 
  The government bases its work on the two principal criteria, 
the priority of economic development and reforms, and the 
macroeconomic stabilization, the minister said. 
  "If the increased budget deficit causes inflation and 
undermines the macroeconomic stability I will be the first to 
retire," Osis said. 
  The government's resignation is inevitable then because it 
will not be able to follow the course of reforms in compliance 
with the distorted budget plan. 
  On the other hand, there are no other political forces in 
Latvia that could set up a tenable government, Osis said. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Latvian Saeima [parliament] is considering the budget 
plan in its current plenary session.

<F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Gromak: "Relying on NATO.... Will Draft </F>
New Regulations Help Real Strengthening of Latvian Armed 
Forces?"] 
  [Text] Riga -- The Latvian Defense Ministry has prepared 
new regulations for drafting people into active military 
service. They envisage reducing the categories of citizens who 
are exempt from compulsory military service. 
  Currently there are 6,500 people serving in the Latvian 
Armed 
Forces, 550 of them officers. These figures break down as 
follows: There are 1,500 enlisted men and 150 officers serving 
in the Army, 3,800 enlisted men and 340 officers in the Border 
Guard, 600 seamen and 30 officers in the Navy, and 150 enlisted 
men and 30 officers in the Air Force. 
  The Latvian Navy has 15 ships and combat craft, of which six 
are undergoing repair and two are mothballed. The Air Force has 
two An-2 aircraft, two L-410 transporters, and six Mi-2 
helicopters. One aircraft and four helicopters are combat ready. 
  Latvia wants to guarantee its national security primarily by 
joining NATO. As we know, to date these efforts have not been 
successful. And some news agencies report that the Latvian 
Government has decided to allocate funds to buy two Russian Mi-8 
helicopters....

  [Text] Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev believes that his 
country can truly become economically independent only with 
assistance from Russia. Speaking at a press conference in 
Bishkek on Thursday [27 January], the president emphasized that 
the arrival of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and the 
visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin planned for 
February "would assist with settlement of the issues concerning 
support of Kyrgyz industrial enterprises which directly depend 
on economic relations with Russia." "If we break these 
relations, there is a risk for the Kyrgyz to go back to their 
traditional nomadic life of cattle breeders," the president 
pointed out. 
  For the time being, it is impossible to resolve the current 
economic issues, like supplies of equipment and fuel material 
and lubricants, without the assistance provided by Russia. This 
also threatens the future of agriculture. 
  In connection with this, the president emphasized that 
double 
citizenship would conform with the interests in preserving the 
economic potential of Kyrgyzstan, since this would help to 
maintain the working potential of plants where most workers were 
Russians. He refuted the assertion that this might lead to 
destabilization of inter-ethnic relations. 
  Commenting on the changes in the Russian Government, the 
Kyrgyz president said that the situation should not be 
exaggerated. "The reforms in Russia will continue since now they 
are irreversible," Akayev pointed out. In his opinion, 
Chernomyrdin was the man who could carry out the policy of 
economic reforms in Russia.

  [Text] Bishkek January 28 TASS -- Kyrgyz President Askar 
Akayev issued today an appeal to the Kyrgyz people entitled "I 
am guiltless before people and before my own conscience." He 
took this step in connection with a referendum, scheduled for 
January 30, which should give an answer to the question: Can the 
president continue to discharge his duties or not? The reason 
for the referendum is that the Kyrgyz Constitution, adopted on 
May 5, made illegitimate all branches of power existing in the 
republic, which was used as a pretext by the forces opposing 
Akayev. As a politician, the president decided to resolve the 
problem with the help of a nationwide referendum. 
  Akayev explained the essence of his policy in the appeal. He 
maintains that "now the majority of people in our republic and 
all political forces favour a market-based economy, economic 
freedom for the strong and social protection for the week." 
Despite a rather difficult economic situation in the republic 
and the continuing decline of living standards, the president 
believes that "solid economic preconditions have been created 
for the people to feel the first accomplishments, brought by our 
economic reform, in 1994, for us to start living just a little 
better." 
  "If the Kyrgyz people support me at the popular referendum, 
I 
shall stick to the policy of reform, the policy which will 
ensure, in the long run, the well-being of our people and the 
prosperity of the republic," Akayev stressed in the appeal.

  [Text] Chisinau January 27 TASS -- "The proclamation of 
unification with Romania in defiance of the will of the majority 
of citizens of Moldova will lead to war which will not be 
limited by the republic's borders and will develop into a 
regional conflict," Petr Luchinskiy, chairman of the Moldova's 
Parliament, told a news conference here today. 
  According to the parliamentary speaker, such a development 
of 
events is possible if parliamentary elections in Moldova 
scheduled for February 27, will be won by the parties coming out 
in favor of the unification with Romania. 
  "If the parliament adopts the decision on the unification 
with Romania, then the Dniester region and Gagauzia will secede 
from Moldova, and hotbeds of tension will arise in Chisinau and 
Beltsy (city in the north of Moldova), as well as in some 
northern areas with concentrated population of national 
minorities," Petru Luchinskiy stressed. 
  The chairman of the parliament believes that strengthening 
of 
state independence of Moldova is now the only possibility to 
evade bloodshed in the republic where almost one third of the 
population is represented by other nationalities. "Moldova is 
supported in this by the world community which is interested in 
the preservation of peace and stability on the Balkans where the 
war is raging," the speaker pointed out. 
  Petru Luchinskiy believes that a crisis situation is forming 
in the left bank districts of Moldova. Commander of the 14th 
Russian Army, General Lebed, accused the Tiraspol leaders of 
corruption but in response to this the Tiraspol leaders imposed 
a special state in the region "seeking to isolate themselves 
from the outer world." 
  At the same time, the head of the Parliament of Moldova is 
convinced that the crisis in the Dniester region may be settled 
in the near future.

of Dniester president and government issued today a communique 
about the recent meeting of general Aleksandr Lebed, commander 
of 14th Army, with representatives of Women's Committee in 
Tiraspol, Tighina (Bender) and Grigoriopol. The communique 
states that Lebed has called the Dniester leaders "alcoholics 
and mafiosi who sold and lost in booze-ups the Moldovan Dniester 
Republic." He said that "the direct presidential governing is 
now introduced in Dniester and the Soviets will be dissolved; as 
a consequence the Moldovan Dniester republic disappears until 
February 28th. Russia has its problems and no one will be 
concerned about Dniester as long as the present leadership is at 
power." According to the communique, Lebed also stated that 
Dniester did not need its own army and that the Dniester 
Ministry of Defence required too much armament from the 14th 
Army.

Russia demanded to grant special juridical statute to Moldova

  [Excerpts] Brussels, Jan 27,-- Lithuania signed up for 
NATO's new limited partnership plan Thursday [27 January], 
becoming the first former Soviet republic to embrace the deal. 
  Before signing the partnership document at the NATO 
headquarters, President Algirdas Brazauskas, stressed 
Lithuania's plans to eventually join the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. 
  "As she begins her participation in the `Partnership for 
Peace' program, Lithuania has a clear goal of becoming a 
fully-fledged NATO member," Brazauskas told ambassadors of the 
16 NATO nations. 
  That aim could bring a clash with Russia, Lithuania's mighty 
neighbor and former ruler. 
  Moscow opposes any eastward expansion of the Western 
military 
alliance and reacted with alarm earlier this month, when 
Lithuania became the first of its former Warsaw Pact satellites 
to formally apply for NATO membership. 
  President Boris Yeltsin's press secretary, Vyacheslav 
Kostikov warned then that Lithuania's move could provoke "a 
negative reaction in Russian public opinion" and play into the 
hands of the country's extreme nationalists. 
  Brazauskas sought to allay Russian fears. 
  "Lithuania's position regarding NATO membership is not 
directed against any neighboring or other European states," he 
said in a speech at NATO headquarters. 
  The integration of Eastern European nations into NATO and 
other Western structures would "significantly support the 
strengthening and continuity of democratic processes in Russia," 
he added. 
  Lithuania became the second former Warsaw Pact state to 
accept the "Partnership for Peace" offer made earlier in the 
month at a summit of alliance leaders. Romania signed up on 
Wednesday. [passage omitted] 
  Brazauskas echoed the determination of other leaders that 
the 
partnership must be a step toward membership -- not a 
replacement for it. 
  "I imagine that this initiative does not completely satisfy 
every state that is striving for closer proximity to or 
membership of NATO," he said. 
  "It is a compromise plan." 
  Under the partnership proposal, the East Europeans must 
share 
information about defense budgets and defense forces, promise 
civilian control over the military and standardize weapons 
systems. 
  Each nation is expected to work out a specific work plan 
with 
the allies, tailored to its needs and capabilities.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Audrius Baciulis from Brussels] </F>
  [Excerpt] President Algirdas Brazauskas signed the 
documents of a new NATO program--an invitation and a declaration 
on the Partnership for Peace---in Brussels today. 
  According to this act, Lithuania has the right to take part 
in all the events and projects of the Partnership for Peace 
program. Lithuania has become the second Eastern European state 
to join this NATO program. The documents of Partnership for 
Peace were signed by the Romanian foreign minister yesterday. 
  Brazauskas arrived in Brussels today from Holland, together 
with Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys and Minister of National 
Defense Linas Linkevicius. At noon Lithuanian time, he was 
welcomed at the entrance to the NATO headquarters in Brussels by 
Ambassador Amadeo de Franchis, acting NATO general secretary, 
and Adolfas Venckus, Lithuanian ambassador at the European 
Union. After a brief conversation with de Franchis, Brazauskas 
went to the oval NATO hall, where 16 NATO members were waiting. 
  In his welcoming speech, de Franchis said that NATO was 
pleased at this decision by Lithuania and stressed that Article 
8 of the Partnership for Peace provides that, if there is a 
threat to the state taking part in the Partnership for Peace 
program, to the security and independence of that state, NATO 
would begin intensive consultations with that state. Active 
participation by Lithuania in the Partnership for Peace program 
would step up its rapprochement to NATO. The ambassador of 
Belgium--which represents Lithuania's interests in 
NATO--(?Gering) said that the idea that Lithuania should come 
closer to NATO emerged in this organization as early as 
September of 1992, after a speech by Vytautas Landsbergis at the 
North Atlantic Assembly. The Danish ambassador stressed that 
the Partnership for Peace has been created, not in place of NATO 
membership, but as a direct path to it. NATO, for its part, 
will do everything to see that this process develops 
successfully. 
  In a reply speech, delivered in English, Brazauskas stressed 
that Lithuania's security is indivisible from European security. 
It is best ensured by joining European structures--above all, 
the European Union and NATO. Lithuania will strive to become a 
member of these organizations. Lithuania welcomes the 
Partnership for Peace program, but Brazauskas thought that it 
did not satisfy the requirements of states striving to become 
NATO members. This is a compromise solution oriented toward the 
future. He stressed that Lithuania, as already stated in a 
letter to Manfred Woerner, is striving to become a full NATO 
member. Lithuania supports common aims by the Baltic states to 
integrate in Europe and will do everything for the further 
integration of the Baltic states. 
  Brazauskas also stressed that Lithuania, according to 
international standards, demands a complete and unconditional 
withdrawal of the Russian Army from the Baltic states. Russia's 
statements about the near abroad and about its rights to 
maintain peace on the former Soviet Union's territory have 
nothing in common with the international law and the Partnership 
for Peace program. 
  Brazauskas expressed his belief, in conclusion, that a day 
will come when the Lithuanian president will sign in this hall a 
document stating that Lithuania has become a full NATO member.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania </F>
in Vilnius on 20 January: "On Russia's Policy Toward the Baltic 
States"] 
  [Text] Assessing the developments in Russia and its 
foreign policy, the Seimas [parliament] of the Republic of 
Lithuania notes with concern that recent statements by some 
Russian officials concerning the Baltic states have taken on a 
harsher tone. The words of Russian Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev 
about Russia's defense interests in Lithuania, Latvia, and 
Estonia, which are constantly called "the near abroad 
countries," and about a possible suspension of the Russian Army 
withdrawal from Latvia and Estonia confirm this. No ambiguous 
maneuvers can reduce the negative meaning of these words. 
  The presence of the Russian Army in the Baltic states and 
the 
delay in its withdrawal not only increase instability in Latvia 
and Estonia and create possibilities for conflicts and 
provocations there, but also endangers Lithuania's security. 
All of this shows that Russia ignores signed international 
agreements and documents and, through this, poses a threat to 
world peace and stability. 
  The Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania expresses great 
concern over Russia's current policy toward the Baltic states 
and hopes, at the same time, that processes of democratization 
will continue there, and that Russia will respect the 
independence and territorial integrity of the Baltic states. 
  [Signed] Ceslovas Jursenas, chairman of Seimas of the 
Republic of Lithuania

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 28, BNS -- The International Monetary 
Fund is concerned about the increasing rate of inflation in 
Lithuania, which resulted from the monetary policy carried out 
by the Lithuanian central bank, Adalbert Knoebl, head of the 
IMF's Baltic Department, said at a press conference in Vilnius 
Thursday [27 January]. 
  He said active development of the Lithuanian economy is 
unlikely if inflation is not stopped. The fund will try to 
persuade the Lithuanian central bank to carry out a tighter 
monetary policy, he said. 
  Knoebl criticized the bank for buying too much hard currency 
and exceeding the permissible limit of cash in circulation. 
According to the Lithuanian economic policy memorandum, the 
amount of cash in circulation must not rise above 1,100 million 
lits by March 31, but 1,266 million are in circulation already. 
  Knoebl said the fund began consultation with the Lithuanian 
Government and the central bank on ways of continuing Lithuanian 
economic reforms. Both sides are now working on a long-term 
economic policy memorandum for Lithuania. The new memorandum 
would cover a period of three years and would come into effect 
at the end of this year, he said. 
  Knoebl said the memorandum should include strict 
requirements 
that would accelerate Lithuania's transition to a market 
economy. The IMF official said Lithuania's primary tasks are to 
carry out a number of structural rearrangements, to speed up 
privatization, to reform enterprises and to reorganize the 
financial sector. 
  Knoebl said it is extremely important to stabilize the 
economy even more, because, in his opinion, the economy started 
to recover. The official statistics does not properly reflect 
private businesses, he said. 
  In March, the IMF Board intends to discuss Lithuania's 
adherence to the economic policy memorandum. The fund's 
mission, led by Knoebl, came to Lithuania to collect information 
for a report that will be presented to the IMF Board.

<F P=106> [Article by Seimas and Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party, </F>
LDDP, member Bronislovas Genzelis: "The Development of 
Lithuanian-Polish Relations"] 
  [Excerpts] I think that the development of friendly 
relations with Poland is one of the most pressing goals of our 
foreign policy. We should seek the signing of the interstate 
agreement and the declaration on goodneighborly relations in the 
immediate future. This way, we would lay a firm foundation for 
the coming generations and leave the former misunderstandings to 
history. [passage omitted] 
  Poland's current government is favorable to Lithuania, and 
it 
understands our problems. Conditions for normalizing the 
misunderstandings inherited from history are emerging. This 
process requires mutual goodwill. Unfortunately, there are 
certain forces both in Lithuania and Poland wishing to open past 
wounds and plot new conflicts. For example, during their recent 
visits to Warsaw, Lithuanian Seimas [parliament] Chairman C. 
Jursenas and Prime Minister A. Slezevicius met with almost all 
Polish leaders, Sejm factions and committees. Those meetings 
did not raise any demands similar to those which were 
unexpectedly put forward by 82 Polish Sejm members. We suppose 
that this was done on the initiative of some Lithuanian Poles' 
Union leaders, while the esteemed deputies of the Polish Sejm 
did not familiarize themselves with the situation. 
  If one side denies the existence of uninterested forces in 
its country and searches for them at its neighbor's place, it 
will be difficult to reach an agreement. This would immediately 
cause its mistrust in the other side and doubts about the 
latter's goodwill. One side must respect the law of the other. 
  Under the Lithuanian law, no sections of foreign 
organizations can operate on its territory. This law is not 
directed against Poland in particular. When we voted for it in 
the Supreme Council, we saw the threat of Russian imperialists. 
The latter were trying to set up branches of their political 
organizations in Lithuania at that time, which posed a threat to 
its statehood. 
  Laws restricting wishes of one neighbor and having no 
significance to the other are impossible in a democratic 
country. There had been attempts to establish a Russian 
university and other organizations in Lithuania. Such ideas 
were abandoned later. Currently, we do not notice Russia's 
attempts to set up any organizations in our country, although 
the threat to our independence has not disappeared. I wish our 
friends, the Poles, realized these subtleties. 
  I would also like the Polish community to understand the 
reasons for disbanding the self-governments in the Vilnius and 
Salcininkai regions. Those self-governments declared 
unequivocally that they did not recognize Lithuania's 
independence or abide by Lithuanian law, and that they 
considered themselves part of the USSR. Their actions can be 
considered nothing short of a revolt against Lithuania's lawful 
government. 
  Politicians must always behave responsibly everywhere. They 
must always remember that each tactless move may result in broad 
comments. The actions of some officials from the Polish Embassy 
in Vilnius arouse many emotions. I do not doubt the good 
intentions of these officials. However, I cannot help noting 
that the meeting of the Polish ambassador with journalists on 
New Year's eve evoked an unfavorable reaction. This meeting was 
interpreted as the ambassador's attempt to teach our journalists 
what, where and when they should write about Poland. Meetings 
between Polish Embassy employees and local officials of the 
Polish nationality from the Vilnius region held without our 
government's consent also invoke negative attitudes. I think 
that such events should be abandoned or at least coordinated 
with our officials, the more so that separate Polish citizens 
arrive in Lithuania and try to negate its statehood. I would not 
like to attach great importance to these facts, however, I 
cannot help mentioning them. 
  Thus, we must outline the future ways for our countries' 
rapprochement. It might be expedient to think about closer 
cooperation with other states as well, for example, Belarus, 
Ukraine, the Visegrad group, and so on. 
  We must think more about the future. The neighboring empire 
[Russia] which inflicted suffering on us, has been shattered 
slightly, but it has not yet collapsed. It would be naive of us 
not to feel its threat. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Justinas Karosas, chairman of the LDDP </F>
faction in the Seimas, by Gintautas Kniuksta in Vilnius; date 
not given: "J. Karosas: `I Will Never Admit That We Are Making 
Concessions to the Opposition...'" 
  [Excerpts] [Kniuksta]One would like to speak about 
something pleasant and bright in the beginning of the new year. 
The current period is not indulgent to you, politicians. Talk 
about the party's split and extremely categorical statements by 
some of its members show that something is wrong in the 
Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] family as well. Might 
I be wrong? 
  [Karosas] The situation in the LDDP family, as you put it, 
is 
the same as in our society. Over those 50 years, we have 
acquired a bad habit of saying that everything used to be all 
right everywhere. 
  Western parliamentarians even fight among themselves. 
Discussions in the legislature is a completely normal 
phenomenon. [passage omitted] The difference of opinions is a 
sign of the community's democratization. 
  Another issue is that Seimas' [parliament] activities will 
not be effective until we develop a critical approach toward 
ourselves and overcome personal ambitions. I think that the 
Seimas' work last year was satisfactory. However, I would like 
the legislature to make greater progress over the next year. 
  [Kniuksta]Nevertheless, let us recall Vytautas 
Petkevicius' statements, Vytautas Bubnys' withdrawal from the 
LDDP faction, and the conference of LDDP members in the Klaipeda 
region. Might you have underrated those people? Might you have 
not proposed some higher positions to them? By the way, do you 
agree that the LDDP faction has some casual people who do not, 
perhaps, deserve their status of Seimas members? Certainly, 
this is an internal party problem. Believe me, however, that it 
interests the community as well. 
  [Karosas] All of us are casual people in the Seimas to a 
certain extent. Many of us did not intend to become 
professional politicians. We were just fated to become so. 
  Disagreements had to come out sooner or later, because since 
the very beginning, our party has had not only moderate members 
but also militant or more radically oriented ones. The latter 
imagine that a democratic state can be created by resolute and 
extreme actions. Some of them often proposed to change employees 
in self-governments immediately, in a word, to make serious 
changes, forgetting that in a normal community employees can be 
dismissed only in line with the law. I understand the 
legitimate anger of some people. They were painfully 
mistreated, blackmailed, and laid off by the former government. 
Now they are demanding the same treatment for those who did 
that. However, someone must rise above this rage and think how 
to lay the foundation for our democratic state. I suppose that 
we must undertake this mission. This orientation has a 
perspective and meets the standards of a civilized and 
democratic community. 
  I hope that the new majority that will come after the next 
elections will discontinue this type of behavior. It will abide 
by the law, recognize that one ruling party replaces another, 
and so on. I do not claim that there is no irresolution in the 
activities of our party, but I speak out against the arbitrary 
restructuring of government institutions by ignoring the law and 
forgetting that such actions will wind up the coil of hatred. A 
democratic state cannot be created in such a manner. 
  [Kniuksta]By the way, the LDDP is being reprimanded for 
lack of resolution. Do you agree that your party is continuing 
the chain of mistakes begun by Sajudis? I have heard in 
Samogitia [Lithuania's northwestern part] that the LDDP works as 
though it lived in 1988 and tries to flatter the opposition. 
However, nothing good will come out of this friendship because 
V. Landsbergis' tactics are very clear. 
  [Karosas] I understand those opponents who think and talk 
like this. Unfortunately, the current opposition is not that of 
a democratic community. It follows the principle "the worse the 
better" and does its best to implement it. They think that this 
will help them to win more political capital. 
  Let us remember the opposition's behavior after our victory 
in the elections. Its high-ranking members were travelling 
throughout the world and spreading the thought that communists 
were returning to power, that Soviet socialism would be 
restored, that no foreigner would invest in Lithuania, and so 
on. [passage omitted] This is an open sabotage of state 
interests and a damage to its prestige. Party interests are 
never raised above the state in normal society. 
  The opposition forgets that its blackmailing statements or 
actions are damaging to the state's interests. I will never 
admit that we are making concessions to the opposition. We 
simply want to stop winding the coil of hatred which I have 
already mentioned. The fact that a party has its majority in 
the Seimas and its government does not mean that such 
authorities are agreeable to all society. The majority rule 
cannot be identified with the state and society, because about 
one-third of the Lithuanian people voted for the opposition. 
Certainly, it is totally abnormal when officials, who are our 
political opponents, openly ignore Seimas laws or government 
resolutions. 
  We have not yet managed to reach an agreement with the 
opposition because the latter imagines that a consensus would be 
ruinous to it. A consensus would be useful to the state, and 
thus, to the ruling party as well. All this is unacceptable to 
the opposition. 
  We are forced to follow the principle of the so-called 
"voting machine." We have no other option if we want to do 
something beneficial for the state. However, we cannot ignore 
the opposition, and a certain search for a dialogue is 
essential. Another issue is that our success here is rather 
poor, and this irritates people. 
  However, we must overcome this hostility. If we turned 
away from the opposition, we would create a totalitarian rather 
than a democratic state. By the way, the opposition has simply 
provoked us since the very first days of Seimas' work. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Kniuksta] Thus, the LDDP is forced to maneuver, although 
some people assess such tactics differently. 
  [Karosas] [passage omitted] One of the more prominent 
achievements of our moderate policies or maneuvering is that the 
division of society has almost disappeared today. This success 
cannot be denied. 
  When two years ago we went to rural districts, people would 
speak only about Brazauskas, Landsbergis, and other politicians. 
We hear something completely different today: They usually 
raise specific everyday problems. If we had not pursued such 
moderate policies, we would again have two distinct camps today. 
Therefore, I understand the opposition's pressure on 
television. By taking advantage of a million-strong public, it 
would be possible to incite people again and engage in overall 
negation of any positive sides of the current government. 
  [Kniuksta] By the way, some of your opponents also 
admit this. Tensions have eased after the elections, and the 
constant search for enemies has disappeared. It is enough to 
remember the speeches of the former Supreme Council chairman 
[Landsbergis] about crawling coups, revolutions, packs of dogs, 
and so on. However, can a situation with strikes and pickets of 
teachers, medical workers, and farmers be called stable? 
  [Karosas] This stability is fragile. However, I think that 
everyone would agree that prices in stores do not change each 
day. This is incomparable with what we had six months or a year 
ago. Finally, let us take hot water and heating. These are also 
the signs of stability. Certainly, these are only the first 
signs, and we have nothing much to rejoice in. Life, albeit 
poor, is more stable, and people have some hope in the future at 
least. 
  Strikes and pickets occur throughout the world. They are 
especially attractive to people who have left the socialist 
camp. Formally, these people dissociate themselves from 
socialism, but actually they want it. Recent sociological 
studies show that only 6 percent of those polled believe that 
they are themselves responsible for their lives. All others 
accuse the Seimas, the president, and the government, rather 
than themselves. They want the state to take care of them, plan 
prices, crops, and so on. 
  The most interesting thing is that this socialism is also 
advocated by the conservatives or our opposition. For example, 
Mr. G. Vagnorius' proposals concerning the indexation of incomes 
and agriculture clearly demonstrate that the conservatives want 
socialism. What a paradox! 
  The worst thing is that strikes and pickets are extremely 
politicized. [passage omitted] 
  Behaving in this manner, it is as though the opposition does 
not understand that the disruption of political stability is 
dangerous to Lithuania, particularly against the background of 
the recent events in Russia. For example, the conservatives' 
congress declares the idea of early elections, while 
Zhirinovskiy wins the elections in Russia a week later. The 
destabilization encouraged by our opposition coincides with 
similar processes in Russia, which is extremely dangerous to the 
state. 
  Finally, what does the unstable situation mean to foreign 
investors? Lithuania's prestige is low as it is, while we want 
to continue to shake it with strikes and so on. How can we say 
that the conservatives help the state if they tolerate and 
encourage such acts? 
  [Kniuksta]Let us go back to the economy. Memorandums 
are in fashion today. The liberals also write them. In their 
opinion, LDDP's economic policy ruins the hope for economic 
reform in the country. The LDDP which won the elections by the 
majority of farmers' votes ignores their interests. 
  [Karosas] The liberals have already received one bitter 
lesson during the previous elections by demonstrating the idea 
of pure liberalism typical of the late 20th century. It seems 
that this was not enough for them. They are proposing pure 
liberalism as the greatest achievement and the clearest doctrine 
forgetting our reality and the fact that the current free market 
is a social market. By the way, some liberals, angry with their 
defeat in the elections, criticize us for socialism, while the 
social democrats accuse us of liberalism. 
  We, as social democrats, are told that LDDP policies are not 
social democratic. However, the social democratic policy can be 
implemented only in an efficient social economy of a free 
market. [passage omitted] 
  We are only creating an economic foundation for society 
based 
on a social market, which is a necessary condition in 
implementing the principles of social democracy. Therefore, the 
state must look for provisional options. We engage in 
discussion with farmers who sometimes drag us into the planned 
economy which has no future. However, we cannot reject their 
request to regulate certain issues. 
  Farmers were instructed for many years what to grow and how 
much. Last spring, the government rendered much assistance to 
farmers, but this support returned as a stone to its garden. 
Farmers said that we had helped them to sow the crop but that 
we did not want to buy it. Such "clashes" are likely to occur 
many times. 
  People must get accustomed to the "do-it-yourself" 
principle. 
We understand perfectly well, however, that the state and its 
institutions must help people in the transitional period. 
Certainly, certain "clashes" between the state and the people 
are inevitable. However, when the state does not do something, 
people themselves must undertake it. [passage omitted] 
  [Kniuksta] We hear from the same people that the LDDP 
is doing nothing, that it is drifting down the stream, and that 
all achievements are spontaneous. 
  [Karosas] I think that the element of spontaneity is a 
normal 
social condition, but I do not agree with the thought that the 
LDDP is doing nothing. Last year, we created the basis for the 
continuation of economic reform and restrained inflation. We 
know that A. Slezevicius' government inherited some debts -- $43 
and $28 million for gas and nuclear fuel, respectively. The 
government paid off these debts over a short period of time and 
created conditions for the normalization of gas deliveries and 
the production of electric energy. Does this say nothing? 
  [Kniuksta]I think that the future of industry is very 
problematic. Although still breathing, industry is clearly 
dying. 
  Let us take the system of education, for example. It is 
obvious that there are too many higher educational 
establishments in Lithuania, but not in the sense that Lithuania 
has enough educated people. We simply cannot afford so many 
higher schools. The same applies to the national defense 
system. True, Mr. Landsbergis holds a different opinion on 
these problems. I say to him: "How can I invite 100 guests if 
I have only one refrigerator of food. Will I not look 
ridiculous?" The professor replies that there must be three 
refrigerators full of food. From where can we take them? 
  Many structures of our young state were created according to 
the principle "we must have the same as in the West." Since a 
drop in production was catastrophic, the burden of supporting 
such expensive structures became heavier on taxpayers. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Kniuksta] The Council of the Citizens' Charter 
maintains that the interests of the ruling LDDP dominate radio 
and television programs. In my opinion, LDDP's propaganda is 
insufficient. The LDDP underrates the power of the mass media 
and advocates its activities too little. Another thing is when 
some mass media have a liking for a particular political 
force.... 
  [Karosas] Yes, we advocate the ideas of our party and the 
state insufficiently. We did not care about this when we began 
our work in the Seimas. Now we are trying to speak on the radio 
and write more articles. Many opponents still imagine that the 
ruling force has newspapers, television, and radio in its hands. 
However, the mass media themselves choose sources of 
information in democratic society. 
  I think, and people will agree with me, that we hear more 
representatives of the right-wing opposition on radio and 
television today. The worst thing is that we lack official 
information about the government's work even in the 
state-supported mass media. [passage omitted] 
  It is useless to try to change something immediately. Much 
time will pass until we develop people's political culture. 
This cannot be achieved by administrative measures. On the 
other hand, it is abnormal when some papers defile the president 
elected by the nation, or when the chief of television prevents 
the director of the Statistics Department from addressing the 
public and familiarizing it with official data about the 
country's economic and financial condition. 
  [Kniuksta] What are your personal relations with 
Vytautas Landsbergis? 
  [Karosas] We maintain certain official relations. I do not 
like to characterize my political opponent and I consider it to 
be incorrect. I can only say that no politician, if he is 
democratically oriented, should assume the role of a messiah, 
the only true defender of independence. If a politician lacks 
self-criticism, and if he sees only mistakes in the behavior of 
others, he will inevitably raise himself above the rest and will 
readily or unwillingly assume the position of the father of a 
nation or a state. Nor do I like Machiavellian politicians. 
  [Kniuksta] How are you preparing for the elections to 
self-government councils? By the way, how do you assess the 
elections in Kaisiadorys [elections did not take place due to 
low voter turnout]? Have you learned any lessons? 
  [Karosas] The elections have shown that people have become 
less politicized and that they cannot be bought with political 
chatter. People are beginning to understand that impossible 
things cannot really be accomplished. We are moving from the 
politicized stage in the community's life to the economy. 
Therefore, the force that will propose comprehensible and 
realistic measures for the resolution of problems will win the 
elections. I think that our government has possibilities to 
resolve the problems over the remaining three years in such a 
way that would increase our prestige during the next elections.

  [Text] Estonia's Foreign Ministry has expressed concern 
over statements made by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy 
Churkin at a news conference on Thursday. 
  In a press release issued on Friday, the Estonian ministry 
welcomed Churkin's "condemnation" of the 1940 events but 
denounced his refusal to qualify them as the annexation or 
occupation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union or as a 
Soviet aggression against them. 
  "International law did not begin in 1945, as Mr. Churkin 
asserts," the ministry says. 
  It says Estonia has for a long time "shown patience and 
goodwill and has made many concessions in order to solve 
problems which it inherited from the 50 years of Soviet 
occupation." 
  The ministry says the fact that Russian officials have 
completely ignored Estonia's efforts and have instead made a 
series of propaganda attacks and poorly concealed threats does 
not serve to strengthen trust or ensure stability.

  [Excerpt] Tallinn, Jan 27, BNS -- The Estonian parliament 
today discussed the text of a statement concerning Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's speech, which 30 legislators 
submitted on Jan. 19. 
  Kozyrev's remarks defined the Baltic states as belonging in 
Russia's sphere of influence and justified a continued illegal 
presence of Russian troops in Estonian territory. 
  Vello Saatpalu, chairman of the parliamentary Foreign 
Commission, proposed to wind up the discussion and prepare a new 
statement. Several MPs expressed their dissatisfaction with the 
parliament's standing rules under which urgent issues cannot be 
added to the agenda, and referred to the example of the 
Lithuanian parliament, which reacted to Kozyrev's speech the 
same day it was delivered. The Estonian parliament failed to 
reach a decision today because the time ran out and the 
legislators did not agree to prolong the session. [passage

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 27, BNS -- Next to no progress has 
been achieved in recent months in preparing the Estonian-Russian 
summit, Foreign Ministry Chancellor Alar Olljum told BNS. 
  Russia made an official proposal for a meeting between 
President Boris Yeltsin and President Lennart Meri last autumn. 
The summit was then expected to take place in November or 
December. 
  Olljum reiterated that the meeting between the presidents 
can 
take place only after the principal issues of the 
Estonian-Russian relations have been resolved. He had in mind 
in the first place the setting of the final deadline for the 
Russian troop withdrawal. 
  "From the first, we were not sure the summit could soon take 
place," Olljum told BNS. "It was primarily Russia's statement 
that sparked interest in the press." 
  Olljum voiced hope that the troop withdrawal deadline -- 
Aug. 
31 -- proposed by Russia will be officially confirmed at the 
upcoming meeting between the Russian and the Estonian 
delegations next week. 
  Estonia agreed to the deadline in principle but will not 
accept any strings. 
  When Russia for the first time suggested the August deadline 
last autumn, it made a number of stipulations concerning "social 
protection" of Russians residing in Estonia, money for housing 
construction, and other issues. 
  Olljum expressed the opinion this was a "propagandistic 
step."

  [Text] January 25 -- Estonian and Latvian ministers for 
Internal Affairs met in Riga, Latvia, for discussions on 
co-ordinating the activities of their ministries. 
  The meeting, a constructive attempt to foster closer 
co-operation, covered such issues as the continued presence and 
activities of Russian troops in Latvia and Estonia, combating 
crime and the operation and organisation of their respective 
ministries. 
  Latvia and Estonia face similar problems in their attempts 
to 
curb crime, said Latvian Interior Ministry's State Secretary, 
Andris Staris. The discussions underlined the need for 
information exchange between the countries in the level of 
ministers and department heads to be more effective in combating 
the problems. The ministers also agreed to coordinate their 
activities on the CIS Internal Affairs Ministers' conference at 
which Estonian and Latvia maintain observer status.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 27, BNS -- The Estonian Government 
attaches this year great importance to speeding up the 
privatization of industrial enterprises, giving top priority to 
selling agricultural processing firms and timber, chemical and 
construction companies. 
  The Cabinet's privatization program for 1994 stipulates 
that, 
first of all, the enterprises on which offers have been made are 
to be put on the privatization list. 
  The government regards bidding, bidding combined with 
negotiations, and public sale of shares as the principal methods 
of privatization. The main criterion of choice is the need for 
additional conditions such as investments and job retention. 
  The Cabinet plans to use more widely public bidding. 
  The government considers it necessary to start this year 
privatization through public sale of shares. The state will 
retain an average of 25 percent of the capital stock, which is 
later to be sold for the privatization vouchers. 
  The sale of enterprises' shares for privatization vouchers 
is 
to begin not later than the second half of the year. The 
vouchers will be used also in selling property and controlling 
blocks of stock, when a part of the purchase price set by the 
Privatization Agency will have to be paid in money. 
  The government is of the opinion that no restrictions must 
be 
applied to the privatization process and it must be maximally 
open. The participation of local businessmen in the process is 
to be promoted by the application of favorable installment 
payment conditions, privatization vouchers, and Article 32 of 
the privatization law.

  [Text] Tallinn -- A second consignment of Israeli weapons 
has arrived in Estonia for the use of the national defense 
forces. The sub-machine guns, pistols, and anti-aircraft guns 
and missiles in question cost Estonia $60 million. Israel has 
pledged to supply weapons until the end of 1995 and Estonia will 
pay for them before the year 2000. This deal once caused a 
scandal in parliament because the contract for the supply of 
such a costly consignment of weapons was kept secret. 
Government officials quickly came up with a justification: The 
accelerated withdrawal of the Russian troops was, it is claimed, 
linked specifically to the appearance of "Uzi" sub-machine guns 
in the Estonian army. Our lads took fright and left.

  [Text] Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk today gave 
instructions to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine on a number 
of issues which had been discussed during his meeting with a 
group of people's deputies of Ukraine from the Republic of 
Crimea on 24 January. The meeting took place at the request of 
People's Deputies of Ukraine Matiyko, Reva, Sevastyanov, and 
Terekhov. Discussed at the meeting were social and economic 
problems facing the Crimea and also the ways toward improving 
the crime situation which has of late taken shape there. 
  During the conversation the people's deputies of Ukraine 
asked President Kravchuk about his attitude toward the 
presidential election in Crimea. In this connection Kravchuk 
said: I respect the right of the electorate to elect the 
president they want, but if the president of the Crimea Republic 
violates the law and the Constitution of Ukraine then I, as the 
president of Ukraine, will use my constitutional plenary powers 
and take relevant measures to revoke the illegitimate decisions. 
  This was reported today by the press service of the 
president 
of Ukraine and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: No 18 (508) for </F>
27 January 1994] 
  [Text] Ukraine will take every step to preserve its 
territorial integrity if the new Crimean president attempts to 
redraw the borders and violate the Helsinki agreements, head of 
the Ukrainian president's service for domestic policy Nikolay 
Mikhalechenko told Interfax. 
  "If the law on the president of Crimea goes against the 
constitutions of Ukraine and Crimea -- too bad for this law," he 
said. He also stated that the provisions of this law must be 
brought in accordance with Ukrainian and Crimean legislation. 
"Otherwise, this law will be considered anti-constitutional," he 
said. 
  According to the law on the president of Crimea, the 
president shall have the right to appoint the prosecutor 
general, chairman of the security service and interior minister, 
and control the operations of the Ukrainian army in Crimea. 
  To quote Mikhalechenko, the law on the delimitation of 
powers 
between the Ukrainian and Crimean bodies of state authority 
envisages consultations on the Ukrainian policy in Crimea, and 
on the appointment of the prosecutor general, the head of the 
security service and the commander of the national guard. 
"Consultations with the parliament, not the president," he said. 
  He described Russia's approach to the Crimean problems as 
"carefully weighed-out and realistic." "If a realistic policy 
is implemented, we shall solve the problem of the Black Sea 
Fleet, and Russian citizens will be able to spend their holidays 
in Crimea," he said. 
  Candidate to the post of Crimean president and leader of the 
Crimean Republican Party Yuriy Meshkov told a press conference 
in Sevastopol that the results of the first round of elections 
(during which he scored 38.5% of the votes -- Interfax) "are the 
choice of the people who have lost hope and for whom Russia is 
the only source of inspiration." "This is not a manifestation 
of nationalism," he said. 
  Meshkov believes that the simultaneous holding of the second 
round of presidential elections in the Crimea, the referendum on 
the Crimea's status, and the parliamentary elections in Ukraine 
and Crimea should be held simultaneously on March 27 to save 
expenses. As we have reported already, the second round of 
presidential elections in Crimea is scheduled for January 30. 
  Meshkov also said that there would be no complications 
between Ukraine and Crimea. "The idea of the referendum does 
not imply Crimea's secession from Ukraine. Neither does it 
imply any redrawing of the borders between Ukraine and Russia," 
he continued. What is actually meant here is the right to take 
decisions in the sphere of Crimea's economic and cultural 
relations with Russia, Ukraine and other countries 
independently, he said. "It is extremely dangerous to adhere to 
the old policy of Crimea's rigid dependence on Ukraine. We can 
tackle many of our problems on our own," he said. 
  To quote Meshkov, measures are taken to establish contacts 
with the Kiev authorities. "Our representative has already met 
with the Ukrainian leaders," he said. 
  He pointed out that Russia treated the developments in 
Crimea 
normally. "A hostile attitude to Crimea on the part of Boris 
Yeltsin is absolutely ruled out. Time will show what his normal 
attitude will be like," he said. 
  He noted that he shared the position of the Kuchma-Grinyov 
bloc because it advocated normal relations between Ukraine and 
Russia.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 28 TASS -- "Yuriy Meshkov, 
representing the Russia Bloc, seems to have the best chances at 
winning the January 30 presidential elections in the Crimea", 
Emile Payin told ITAR-TASS. Payin is head of the Committee on 
National Politics under the Russian Presidential Council and a 
respected political scientist. 
  The Russian Bloc is made up of political parties who support 
the reunification of the Crimean Peninsula with the Russian 
Federation. The Russian Party, the Black Sea Fleet Officers' 
Assembly, and the Russian Popular Council have been the most 
active in supporting such a move. And they all have been 
supporting Yuriy Meshkov for president of the Crimea since 
February 1993. 
  What are the possible consequences of their struggle? 
According to Payin, "it would be impossible to peacefully and 
legally turn the Crimea over to Russia: Leonid Kravchuk has the 
right, given to him by the Ukrainian parliament, to overrule any 
decision taken by the Crimean authorities which contradicts the 
Ukrainian Constitution and threatens that state's territorial 
integrity". 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry has also declared its 
unwillingness to strain relations between Russian and Ukraine 
over the Crimean question, taking into account the current 
situation in both countries. 
  After his victory in the first round of the presidential 
elections, Meshkov himself announced that he was not going to 
insist on the Crimea's withdrawal from Ukraine and unification 
with Russia. Meshkov intends to fight for equality between 
Ukraine and Russia in Crimean matters, especially concerning the 
Black Sea Fleet, according to Payin's assesment. 
  No matter what the results of the voting are, Payin predicts 
that ethnic tensions in the region will rise. However, he 
emphasized that, "any expected result in the elections at the 
current stage will not be cause for a reexamination of the 
Crimea's fate or status". 
  Despite Russia's determination not to inflame the subject, 
Payin is sure that "the election results will not bring the 
Crimea reconciliation, since it is completely possible that 
those groups who are unsuccessful in the elections will step up 
their illegal political activities. Despite the balanced 
position occupied by Kiev and Moscow, there are forces in both 
Russia and Ukraine who have a lot to gain from destabilising the 
political situation. These are the "soldiers of fortune", who 
have already shown up in the Dniester area, Abkhazia, and other 
regions of conflict", the presidential advisor explained.

<F P=106> [T. Ryabchikova report on news conference by Yuriy Meshkov, </F>
candidate for Crimean president, with unidentified reporters in 
Simferopol on 18 January: "`Meshkov Is Okay,' Said Journalists 
After News Conference"] 
  [Excerpts] Yesterday in Simferopol, a news conference was 
held by Yuriy Aleksandrovich Meshkov, a candidate for president 
of the Crimea, in the Afghanistan War Veterans Club. 
  In his introductory remarks, Yu. A. Meshkov read a 
statement: 
"Based on the preliminary results of the 16 January elections, I 
would like to express my sincere gratitude to all Crimean voters 
who have confided in me and have thus demonstrated their solid 
civic position. 
  "Your choice permits me to say that the people of the Crimea 
-- who have rejected the old nomenclature laws -- favor 
democratic changes, a close union with Russia and other CIS 
states, and a better life in general. Over the last few years, 
we have been fighting together for all these values. 
  "I would like to reassure all citizens of the Crimea that 
the 
victory of a representative of the political coalition `Russia' 
will not sharpen our relations with Ukraine, while, at the same 
time, our relations with Russia will receive new stimulus. 
  "I am addressing you, my esteemed citizens of the Crimea, 
with gratitude and hope that you will support me in the future. 
Please, vote again on 30 January and reaffirm your choice. I 
am sure that you and I will be able to change our lives for the 
better." 
  Yu. Meshkov then answered a lot of question from 
journalists. 
  [Reporter] Do you believe that Kiev can prevent the run-off 
election on 30 January? 
  [Meshkov] I have strong confidence in President Kravchuk, 
who 
excludes such violent methods in policy. You know his viewpoint 
on the presidential elections in the Crimea -- these elections 
are legal. I believe that President Kravchuk will keep his word. 
  [Reporter] Will you dismiss former officials? 
  No, said Yuriy Aleksandrovich, a lot of them are experts in 
their fields. It is easier to destroy than to build. 
Therefore, I will not take their party membership into 
consideration. Only one criterion will be a factor, and that is 
professionalism. 
  [Reporter] What do you think about astrologists? 
  [Meshkov] I view them with humor. 
  One of my colleagues noticed that Meshkov did not correspond 
to his image of a war hawk. So, what about the image? 
  Yuriy Aleksandrovich answered that the image of being a 
militarist and a separatist has nothing to do with him because 
it was invented by his opponents.

  [Text] The radio and television debates between Nikolay 
Bagrov and Yuriy Meshkov, the candidates for the post of 
president of Crimea, planned for today and tomorrow will not now 
take place. In an official statement on his refusal, Yuriy 
Meshkov accused his opponent of using state media funds to 
discredit other candidates for the post of president. In 
Meshkov's opinion, this propaganda machine is now aimed at him. 
In addition there have been threats against him and his family. 
In such conditions, Yuriy Meshkov believes, it is impossible to 
take part in a discussion at the same table as Nikolay Bagrov.

  [Text] Kiev, 27 Jan -- At the evening sitting of the 
Supreme Council session, deputies discussed the draft plan for 
the economic and social development of Ukraine for 1994 and the 
draft state budget. Andrey Pecherov, chairman of the standing 
commission for issues of planning, finances, the budget, and 
prices, particularly noted in his speech that a change of 
parliament would inevitably occur. It is not ruled out that the 
functions of the president could be changed this year. There is 
in fact no prime minister or institution for managing the 
economy. Under these conditions it is necessary to confirm the 
fundamental indicators of both the plan and the budget. 
Pecherov proposed that the state budget be compiled for the 
year, but with confirmation every quarter. He assured the 
deputies that specialists are guaranteeing the implementation of 
indicators for both the plan and the budget. Touching on the 
proposals made by commissions concerning the expenditure part of 
the budget, Pecherov stressed that expenditure on the Army does 
not meet today's needs and contradicts military doctrine. This 
expenditure for 1994 is envisaged at 16,823,610,000,000 
karbovantsi. On behalf of the commission, Pecherov proposed 
that the military part of the budget be reexamined by the 
Defense Council and presented to parliament for confirmation by 
15 April. 
  As regards pensions the commission chairman proposed that 
the 
pension fund be transferred from the Ministry of Social 
Protection to the Ministry of Finance, and that tough controls 
be established. The Commission for Issues of Planning, the 
Budget, Finance, and Prices made this proposal: "Until order is 
brought to the system of payment for labor in the national 
economy, to make additional payments as from 1 January to 
specialists in education, science, culture, health care, social 
security, and physical education, to the level of the average 
monthly wage of employees in the national economy as a whole, 
and to finance the said expenditure by general grants from the 
budget. On average 21 billion karbovantsi per month are needed 
for this, and approximately 12 trillion per year. The 
commission proposes that the government elaborates a procedure 
within two weeks for paying the said increases." 
  Deputy Pecherov subjected the actions of the government to 
harsh criticism. The government does not want to assume 
responsibility. If this continues, noted Pecherov, then we will 
have nothing to discuss with the government.

  [Text] Kiev -- People's deputies discussed the draft state 
budget for 1994 at this morning's plenary sitting of the Supreme 
Council. According to People's Deputy Mykola Biloblotskyy, a 
deficit-free budget reminds one of a book with a nice cover, but 
without the equivalent content. People's Deputy Mykola Naumenko 
proposed that the 14 trillion karbovantsi, which he predicts 
will be the deficit of the pension fund in 1994, be transferred 
to the budget. "It is about financing the superstructure of the 
state, said people's deputy Ruslan Bodelan. Compared to 1993, 
expenditure on defense is being increased by 5.82 times, on law 
enforcement bodies by 6.88 times, on bodies of legislative 
authority by 17 times, and executive authority by almost 6 
times. However, it is planned to increase expenditure on social 
protection only by 2.28 times." 
  Many deputies spoke about a concealed defecit, which is 
being 
transferred to local budgets, and about the reduction of 
expenditure on the needs of Chernobyl sufferers. Yukhym 
Zvyahilskyy, acting prime minister of Ukraine, called on 
deputies "not to fear administrative measures." 
  The Supreme Council adopted a resolution "On the plan for 
the 
economic and social development of Ukraine for 1994," which 
confirms the fundamental indicators of the plan, and establishes 
the personal responsibility of the Cabinet of Ministers and 
other executive bodies for their implementation. The Cabinet of 
Ministers is obliged to report to the Supreme Council every 
quarter on the implementation of this plan. 
  The people's deputies voted on the law "On the state budget 
of Ukraine for 1994" four times, but it did not get the required 
number of votes. Amendments and additions to many legislative 
acts were made, in particular to the Criminal Code and Code of 
Criminal Practice of Ukraine, regarding economic crimes, 
deliberate tax evasion, currency regulation, and currency 
control, and also to the decree of the Cabinet of Ministers on 
issues of customs regulation, to the Customs Code of Ukraine, 
and to the decree of the Cabinet of Ministers "On the procedure 
for imposing customs duty on objects being taken out of the 
country." A resolution was adopted, "on a list of goods subject 
to excise duty," and others. 
  Plenary sittings of the Supreme Council will continue on 1 
February.

  [Text] Kiev, 26 January -- At the Supreme Council's morning 
session deputies passed a Supreme Council resolution on the 
state privatization program. It consists of five points: 
  1. To approve the state privatization program. 
  2. The Supreme Council of the Republic of Crimea and 
Congresses of People's Deputies of all levels should elaborate 
and approve by 1 March 1994 corresponding regional privatization 
programs based on the state program. 
  3. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, jointly with the 
Supreme Council commission for issues of economic reform and 
management of the national economy, is to prepare and submit for 
the Supreme Council's consideration by 1 March proposals on 
introducing changes and additions to Ukraine's legislative acts 
with the aim of creating conditions for the implementation of 
the state privatization program for 1994 and ensure that the 
interests of the socially unprotected strata of Ukraine's 
population are protected. 
  4. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers is to prepare by 15 
February and submit for the Supreme Council's consideration the 
draft law on privatization of land plots and proposals on 
introducing additions to the criminal code and Ukraine's code on 
administrative violations in the part that relates to imposing 
sanctions for violating the privatization legislation. 
  5. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers is instructed to 
ensure that a single computer information network for 
implementing privatization and a single data base on 
privatization facilities is created by 1 April 1994. 
  People's Deputy Popov, the head of the commission on basic 
sectors of the national economy, made a speech. He informed 
deputies about the situation that had arisen with regard to 
"Blasko" Black Sea shipping company. An analysis of the 
activities of the Black Sea shipping company for the first six 
months of 1993 had indicated a 16-fold drop in the level of 
annual clear hard currency receipts, compared with 1992. The 
total indebtedness of the Black Sea shipping company to the 
state budget is 106 billion karbovantsi. The hard currency debt 
of the Black Sea shipping company over nine months of 1993 was 
$5.6 million. Information about the construction of an 
administrative building for $10 million, the purchase of a nine 
seater luxury plane, and the construction of a business center 
for more than $3 million was confirmed. The commission 
qualified these actions as an "irresponsible and inexpedient use 
of state property and funds that led to material losses for the 
state in the form of state enterprises." "Some irregularities 
in the way the accounts were kept give grounds to suspect the 
existence of 'double accountancy,' which enabled those 
responsible to avoid paying tens of millions of dollars to 
Ukraine's hard currency fund," said Popov. 
  The conclusions that Popov made in his speech were: Such 
actions "forced the commission to approve a demand to the 
cabinet of ministers to dismiss Ukrainian Transport Minister 
Klympush and the president of "Blasko," Mr. Kudyukin, from their 
posts."

  [Text] If the Ukrainian parliament refuses to join the 
treaty on nonproliferation of nuclear weapons [NPT], this may 
lead to a conflict between the republic's legislative and 
executive branches of power. This was said to Interfax by a 
high-ranking official from the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. 
  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk called upon the 
parliament to ratify the START I and to sign the treaty on 
nonproliferation on January 24. 
  According to the diplomat, the parliament's plenary session 
may finish on Monday with no decision made on the president's 
proposal. This will mean that the settlement of the issue will 
be deferred for an undetermined period of time. 
  "The Russian president suspended the Supreme Soviet's powers 
and assumed its authority for the period of transition," the 
diplomat remarked. "However, the Ukrainian Constitution does not 
mention the right of the president to sign documents on joining 
international treaties in the period of parliamentary 
elections," he emphasized. 
  Deputy Ukrainian Foreign Minister Boris Tarasuk said that 
the 
withdrawal of nuclear military charge from Ukrainian territory 
would continue until the guaranteed terms for their utilization 
expired.

  In compliance with the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces 
in 
Europe, Ukraine continues to reduce its conventional armaments. 
Since the beginning of this year, four international inspection 
groups have already visited our state. They familiarized 
themselves with the practical implementation of the treaty 
provisions. They visited the Lvov, Nikolayev, Kiev, and 
Zhitomir armored vehicle repair plants. In the near future, 100 
tanks and 60 armored fighting vehicles will be liquidated at 
these enterprises.

<F P=106> [By Vladimir Plotnikov; from the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The generals have developed various options for 
Ukraine's territorial defense without leaving their 
headquarters. Guns, tanks, and other combat equipment has also 
remained at the dpots, first because no orders have been given 
and, second, because there are no fuels or lubricants. It was 
for this reason that the movement of combat vehicles has been 
stopped or reduced to the absolute minimum. To study 
instruments on tanks, for example, they are not started up but 
simply given an electric charge. In other words, the Ukrainian 
army has found itself in the grips of an energy crisis, just 
like the whole of the country's national economic complex. 
Firing from an ordinary rifle is virtually the only accessible 
element of fire training. 
  Yet over the same period rumors have spread in Ukraine that 
large-scale military exercises are being conducted in Crimea. 
  [Crimean Supreme Council Chairman N. Bagrov] Any exercises 
on 
Crimean territory are coordinated with the Supreme Council and 
the Presidium. I repeat that the reports you mention are 
disinformation. No exercises are being conducted on Crimea's 
territory.

discuss candidacies for the post of the Belarusian Supreme 
Soviet chairman. The Supreme Soviet Presidium session, held with 
the participation of Prime Minister Kebich and the heads of the 
oblast executive committees, has nominated five candidates for 
the speaker post: Mikalay Vaytsyankow, Myachyslaw Hryb, Mikhail 
Marynych, Viktar Danilenka, and Uladzimir Lysakevich. However, 
the list was not complete. Today, the people's deputies added 
to this list Vyacheslav Kebich, Hyenadz Karpyenka, Viktar 
Hanchar, and Valantsin Vyalichka. The majority of the 
candidates refused to accept their nomination. Thus, the list 
of candidates for the speaker post includes three names: 
Myachyslaw Hryb, head of a parliamentary commission; Mikhail 
Marynych, deputy chairman of the State Committee for Foreign 
Economic Relations; and People's Deputy Viktar Hanchar.

and the post of head of the Interior Ministry department at the 
executive committee of the regional council (soviet) of the 
Vitebsk region. He has been a deputy of the Belarusian 
parliament since 1990. Hryb is heading the Permanent Commission 
for National Security, Defence and Anti-Crime Struggle. He is 
the supporter of strong power, of the introduction of executive 
Presidency in Belarus and of the ratification of the collective 
security treaty. He maintains that, when discharging his duties 
in parliament, he tries not to be guided by political likes and 
dislikes, but to be businesslike and objective. "We have all 
come from the past, but we should look forward," he said. 
  Mikhail Marynych, 53, was born in the Gomel region, 
graduated 
from the Belarusian Polytechnical Institute. He worked his way 
up from the job of a plumber to the post of Minsk mayor. At 
present he is deputy chairman of the State Committee for Foreign 
Economic Relations. He is a centrist by his political views. 
Marynych favours the consolidation of forces for getting the 
national economy out of the crisis and for reforming it. 
  Viktor Hanchar, 36, is the youngest of the candidates. He is 
a professional lawyer and an assistant professor. He worked for 
a long time at the Institute of National Economy (now it is the 
Belarusian Economic Academy) and became popular thanks to his 
active stand in parliament, brief and clear statements. He is 
often called Belarusian Sobchak. Hanchar is an active supporter 
of a market-based economy, of attracting a new generation of 
leaders for managing the state and the national economy, who are 
not burdened with the stereotyped notions typical of the past. 
During the past several years he has been a deputy mayor of the 
city of Molodechno. Many specialists, including foreign ones, 
believe that Molodechno has made an impressive headway in the 
creation of a market-based economy.

  [Text] Minsk January 28 TASS -- Ousted speaker of the 
Belarusian parliament Stanislav Shushkevich is absent at the 
current session of the parliament which is to elect a new 
country's leader. 
  Sources in his close entourage said he is staying in his 
countryside residence in order "to quietly, without emotions 
consider what has happened and how to act". 
  Spokesman of the Belarusian parliament Vasiliy Vorobev 
hinted 
that Shushkevich would hardly agree to become the chairman of 
the CIS Parliamentary Assembly, the post proposed to him by 
Vladimir Shumeyko, the speaker of the Federation Council, the 
upper chamber of the Russian Parliament. 
  The post was earlier occupied by former Russian speaker 
Ruslan Khasbulatov who was arrested after the October opposition 
rebellion in Moscow. 
  Vorobev said that the statement of Shushkevich's adviser who 
said that the former leader might accept the post "reflects 
mostly the personal opinion of the adviser, rather than of 
Stanislav Shushkevich". 
  However, Vorobev said that he had not spoken with 
Shushkevich 
on the subject and added that it is too early to make any 
predictions.

  [Text] Today, Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich 
gave what was probably the scantest interview of his life. 
Asked by a BELINFORM correspondent whether the dismissal of 
Stanislav Shushkevich from the office of Supreme Soviet chairman 
will affect the upcoming signing of documents on the unification 
of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems, he simply said: 
No.

<F P=106> [Interview with People's Deputies Vasil Chepik, Viktar </F>
Alampiyew, and Alyaksandr Lyadko, by Mikhail Rudkowki; place and 
date not given -- recorded; passages in boldface are in Russian] 
  [Text] [Rudkowski] What is your opinion of the dismissal 
of Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich, and who is 
your choice to replace him in this high state post? 
  [Chepik] First of all, I want this interview to be 
transmitted to our radio listeners in its full extent. I think 
that last night's session was nothing out of ordinary. It is a 
normal course of developments. I only regret that it occurred 
so late. In confirmation of this, I can say that the situation 
in the Republic of Belarus -- especially in the economic arena 
-- has become extremely difficult during the period we were 
under the leadership of Stanislav Stanislavovich [Shushkevich]; 
it has reached a critical point. The work of the Supreme Soviet 
was paralyzed. Practically, we were concerned more with demagogy 
than concrete legislative work. The work of the Supreme Soviet 
Presidium was also paralyzed. As a result -- we have all those 
negative phenomena within society. Therefore, I see that a 
normal process has begun at last. 
  [Rudkowski] You did not answer the second question -- who is 
your choice to assume this post? 
  [Chepik] I cannot specify names today. However, I see 
many talented candidates, including deputies as well, who are 
qualified to deal with this task more successfully than our 
former speaker did. 
  [Rudkowski] Whom do you have in mind? 
  [Chepik] I have in mind chairmen of the oblast 
executive committees, chairmen of various [Supreme Soviet] 
commissions, and other people's deputies. I cannot answer this 
question right now, because we are now conducting political 
consultations. 
  [Rudkowski] I have also invited People's Deputy Viktar 
Alampiyew to speak. The question I asked earlier is now 
directed to you. 
  [Alampiyew] I will use the words of Vladimir Ilyich 
[Lenin]: A Bolsheviks' dream, which was nourished by them over 
the last two years, has come true. At last, they decided to 
throw out the umbrella, under which they were staying all the 
time -- that is to say, Stanislav Shushkevich, a sole democrat 
in power. Now they took the lead in their own hands. With 
respect to a new Supreme Soviet chairman, I can say frankly that 
I do not see any candidate among the current Supreme Soviet 
body. It would be better to leave this choice to either a newly 
elected Supreme Soviet or a direct general ballot. In the latter 
case, none of political factions in the parliament will be able 
to [word indistinct] the speaker, as was done by the Belarus 
faction with regard to Mr. Shushkevich. 
  [Rudkowski] I also pose the same question to People's Deputy 
Alyaksandr Lyadko. 
  [Lyadko] I regret very much that the people's deputies voted 
against Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich last 
night. The Belarusian nation is one, and we all have to live and 
work in this nation. There must be accord between communists 
and Belarusian Popular Movement adherents. I would hope that 
this post is given to someone with Shushkevich's political 
views; I also wish that there were peace in Belarus, and that we 
were able to work for the welfare of Belarus.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Krushinsky] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 28 TASS -- Those who favour closer 
economic integration between Russia and Belarus do not feel that 
Stanislav Shushkevich's removal as head of the Belarusian 
parliament is the final blow to their plans. 
  Well-known Russian business executive and entrepeneur and 
parliament member Aleksandr Titkin is sure that Belarus's 
foreign economic policy will remain unchanged as long as the 
republic's government is headed by common-sensed Vyacheslav 
Kebich. 
  Although Titkin could not foresee what would happen if 
Kebich 
were to be forced out of his job, he hopes that common sense 
will carry the day in the Belarusian government. Titkin said 
Belarus is less subject to nationalist passions than many of its 
neighbors. 
  Titkin expressed the opinion that the merging of the 
Belarusian and Russian economies should be carried out 
carefully, without haste, in order to shield the Russian economy 
from additional problems. In particular, he said it is 
essential for Russia to avoid handing out hidden subsidies to 
its western neighbor, and to avoid pressure from the 
"Belarusian" roubles on the internal Russian market (in case the 
two states' monetary systems are merged). 
  "I even think it would be better if the Belarusian "rabbit" 
notes remained in circulation for the initial stage, until we 
come to complete agreement on tax, pricing, and tariff policy", 
Titkin announced. 
  45-year old Titkin was head of a financial investment 
company, Russian investment technologies, until the December 12 
elections. As deputy in the federation council, he has begun to 
work on the finances committee, which is responsible for the 
budget, financial, currency, credit and tax policy, monetary 
emission, and customs regulations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Radkevich, chairman of the State </F>
Committee for Foreign Economic Relations, by Larisa Grigorovich; 
place and date not given: "Belarus-United States: Partnership 
Across the Ocean"] 
  [Text] [Radkevich] A package of documents was submitted for 
adoption by the U.S. and Belarusian leaders [during President 
Clinton's visit to Belarus]. The most important of them was the 
Agreement on Promotion and Mutual Protection of Investments. 
The drafting of the document demanded maximum efforts on the 
part of the two sides and lasted for almost a year. 
Representatives of more than 30 ministries and departments 
participated in debates over this key document, all the 
preliminary drafts were discussed at the sessions of the Supreme 
Soviet and Council of Ministers committees. 
  [Grigorovich] Could you brief us on the legal basis of this 
document? Have there been any problems in drafting it? 
  [Radkevich] The document creates a legal basis for the 
involvement and efficient use in Belarus of the vast potential 
of U.S. investments. Regardless of the firm and often 
uncompromising stance of the U.S. side, we managed to alter the 
text of the agreement adjusting it to the real state of affairs 
in the economy and to Belarusian laws. 
  By the way, before signing the agreement with Belarus, the 
United States signed bilateral agreements on promotion and 
mutual protection of investments with Russia, Armenia, 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Moldova. 
  [Grigorovich] As is known, according to the Belarusian-U.S. 
agreement on trade relations signed in February 1993, the sides 
granted each other the status of most favored nation. What 
effect did it have on our relations? 
  [Radkevich] This in particular means that Belarusian 
enterprises and companies do not have to pay higher customs duty 
for exporting their products to the United States. In addition, 
our products enjoy all the privileges granted to other states. 
  Belarus would receive other privileges had it joined the 
U.S. 
General System of Preferences, temporarily exempting certain 
categories of products from customs duty. Prime Minister V. 
Kebich once sent a letter to the United States regarding this 
issue. Unfortunately, for some reason, President Clinton made no 
declaration concerning Belarusian admission to this system. 
Yet, we are continuing to work in that direction. 
  [Grigorovich] What is your opinion about other agreements 
and accords discussed and signed during Clinton's talks with the 
Belarusian leadership? 
  [Radkevich] I want to underline that during the talks the 
U.S. side promised to increase financial aid to Belarus within 
the framework of the Nunn-Lugar Law to $100 million, although 
the agreement signed by the Belarusian defense minister and the 
U.S. secretary of defense stipulated $63. 56 million. This 
project envisions realigning military technologies and potential 
to civilian tracks and establishing an exports control system. 
The latter is to prevent the proliferation of mass annihilation 
armaments from Belarus to other states and to restore the 
environment at former strategic missile facilities. Belarus is 
to provide material and technical assistance and services 
necessary to establish a communications hot-line with the 
Republic. A further increase in assistance will depend on the 
progress of economic reform in Belarus, including privatization 
and denationalization. 
  I would like to point out that Belarus will not receive 
these 
financial means in "monetary" form -- they will be apparatuses 
for discovering nuclear substances and narcotics, communication 
equipment for customs checkpoints, and the like. 
  [Grigorovich] Will any joint structures and organs be formed 
to step up our economic relations? 
  [Radkevich] Belarus and the United States have agreed to 
form a bilateral committee for promoting business. Its efforts 
will be directed at revealing and resolving problems hampering 
business activities. The committee will be headed by U.S. 
Department of Commerce Adviser Jan Kalicki and S. Atroshchenko, 
deputy chairman of the State Committee for Foreign Economic 
Relations. 
  A U.S. business center will be opened in Minsk. The project 
has been approved by the United States Agency for International 
Development. The opening of the center is scheduled for the 
first half of 1994. The U.S. Congress has already earmarked $7 
million for establishing business centers in Russia and other 
CIS states. The share for Belarus is $1 million. 
  [Grigorovich] On the eve of President Clinton's visit to 
Minsk, the Belarusian Ministry of Finance reportedly signed a 
general accord with the U.S. Exports and Imports Bank on 
stimulating projects. 
  [Radkevich] The signing of this agreement was preceded by 
strenuous work. We are very grateful to the U.S. Embassy in 
Minsk for the assistance they rendered. 
  All in all, our Republic may receive some $1 billion from 
the 
credit line opened by the Eximbank for Belarus. Only those 
projects will be subsidized whose priority meaning for the 
national economy will be confirmed by the Belarusian Ministry of 
Finance and the National Bank. 
  [Grigorovich] How do you assess the general state of 
Belarusian-U.S. relations? 
  [Radkevich] Relations between our states have been 
constantly expanding and developing. Preliminary data 
demonstrate that the aggregate products turnover between Belarus 
and the United States reached $126 million in 1993. The U.S. 
credit line has been fully utilized, which gives grounds to hope 
that it will be expanded in the future. U.S. business circles 
have been manifesting a growing interest in our Republic. As of 
today, U.S. companies have invested in 123 Belarusian 
enterprises; 18 firms have opened their branches in Belarus. 
  Belarus feels the U.S. support on the international arena, 
especially in such influential economic organizations as the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the 
IMF, which allocated $226.3 million to Belarus in 1993.

by Belarusian Interior Minister Vladimir Yegorov and KGB 
Chairman Eduard Shirkovskiy at 1500 [1300 GMT] on 27 January has 
been called off. As BELAPAN has learned, the management of the 
National Press Center has withheld its consent to hold the news 
conference, explaining that the ministers are just "private 
people." At the press center of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, a BELAPAN correspondent has learned that, in connection 
with the dismissal of [Supreme Soviet Chairman] Stanislav 
Shushkevich, Vladimir Yegorov considers the press conference 
ill-timed. Nevertheless, the Journalists' Union of Belarus is 
currently working on holding such a press conference.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The media and the authorities should have one 
another's best interests at heart, if both of them are Russian. 
But the journalist proposes, while someone else disposes. 
  [Milyanchikov] It looks as though Russia's leaders remember 
Russian Television only on days that are critical either to the 
country or to themselves personally. At such times, a live 
relay from a rally can be organized, a necessary program can be 
broadcast, and people can even work nights. 
  But, during the rest of the time, the Russian TV and Radio 
Company -- set up, I remind you, at the instigation of Boris 
Yeltsin for the fight against Gorbachev -- turns out to be 
superfluous. 
  Today, at any rate, at a meeting of the company's leaders at 
the Finance Ministry, it became clear that Russian TV is only 
hindering the government. It asks for money. But there is no 
money for it. The state company, which is totally dependent on 
the state, will only be given half of the money needed, and most 
of that will go on paying the communications engineers. 
  This means that the amount of broadcasting will have to be 
almost halved. Many programs will disappear -- "K2", "Program 
A", "The Best NBA Games", the Disney cartoons, "Santa Barbara", 
and the Monday thrillers. The company no longer has any money 
with which to buy them. Thousands of people who trusted Boris 
Yeltsin in 1990 and who left the then rich Ostankino for the 
disordered life of Russian TV will be dismissed. 
  Today, in the office of General Director Anatoliy Lysenko, 
arguments have already been heard about what is to be cut and by 
how much. [video shows meeting in progress, unidentified man 
speaking]. 
  [Unidentified speaker] I see this simply as the death of the 
channel. Well, we are now trying to find something, but, in 
general, the president's decree talked about reduction -- and it 
has to be viewed as a kind of therapy, the shedding of a small 
amount of broadcasting -- but today we can already see that it 
is not therapy. It is surgery. It is amputation. It is the 
amputation of state television. 
  [Milyanchikov] A similar fate awaits Radio Rossii.

  [Text] Late one evening at the end of last December, at a 
Russian Foreign Intelligence Service secret dacha rented by 
Arkadiy Volskiy, a meeting was held between Mr. Zhirinovskiy and 
the commanders of a number of divisions from the Moscow military 
district. This information was reported to MOSKOVSKIY 
KOMSOMOLETS by a member of one of the secret services, who also 
said that the conference had been of an antipresidential nature. 
The officers and generals had questioned why no one had thought 
of summoning them to the defense of the White House during the 
October mutiny. 
  Here are some short commentaries by the persons and 
organizations named in the newspaper article: 
  Tatyana Samolis, press secretary to the director of the 
Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. I quote her statement: 
We have never rented nor are we renting anything to anyone. 
  Boris Nefedov, leader of Arkadiy Volskiy's group of 
consultants: The Russian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs does not rent any premises of this kind from the 
Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, and Zhirinovskiy has never 
been in our buildings and did not hold any conferences with 
anyone. 
  As for the views of the military, here is my colleague Anton 
Grishin: 
  [Begin Grishin recording] The military authorities of the 
Tamanskaya Division categorically denied the information 
supplied in the MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. The reaction of 
representatives of the military authorities of the Dzerzhinskiy 
Division only slightly differed from the position of their 
Tamanskaya colleagues. It was pointed out to a correspondent 
that it was impermissible that rumors of this kind, which bring 
Russian officers into disrepute, should be spread. 
  There does exist, however, an unofficial viewpoint on the 
meeting which is reported to have taken place between the leader 
of the Liberal Democratic Party and the division's commander. 
Thus a number of officers of the Tamanskaya Division, for 
instance, did not rule out possibilities of the kind, saying 
that if there had been a meeting, then it would explain a great 
deal -- among other things, the result of the 12 December 
elections. I remind you that an overwhelming majority of the 
personnel of the Tamanskaya Division voted for Mr. Zhirinovskiy 
at the elections. [end recording] 
  I can add one more detail to what has already been said. 
There is a suspicion that Mr. Zhirinovskiy arrived at the 
meeting of military commanders to thank the military in person, 
so to speak, for the elections. 
  By all accounts, the leadership of the Defense Ministry was 
not informed that the meeting would take place. However, the 
representative of the ministry declined to comment on the 
occurence in question, since he did not possess, as he put it, 
any information at all. Moreover, the representative of the 
press service expressed doubt as to the reliability of the 
source used by MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS.

  [Text] Moscow January 28 TASS -- Commander of air-borne 
forces Yevgeniy Podkolzin refuted a report by the MOSKOVSKIY 
KOMSOMOLETS newspaper that representatives from an air-borne 
division commander participated in a secret meeting held by 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the ultra-nationalist Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia, with the military late in December, 
reports the same newspaper on Friday. 
  It quotes Podkolzin's words that "not a single air-borne 
division or brigade commander sent his officers to this or other 
meetings". 
  Referring to an unidentified Russian intelligence officer, 
MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS wrote in the report published on Thursday 
that the LDPR leader held the meeting at a secret country house 
of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. 
  The report noted that the meeting was spearheaded "against 
the president and that Zhirinovskiy called on army officers to 
cooperate and pointed to the need for rapprochement between some 
parliamentary groups and commanders of combat units".

  [Text] The press service of Russian Union of Industrialists 
and Entrepreneurs has denied a report on a meeting between 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and the commanders of a few army 
divisions. On 27 January, MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS published an 
article saying that a meeting took place between Zhirinovskiy 
and the commanders of several army divisions at a conspiratorial 
dacha belonging to Russia's external intelligence service, which 
was being rented by the union's leader Arkadiy Volskiy. The 
article claims that the conference was of an antipresidential 
nature. 
  In this connection, the document says, the press service of 
the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs believes 
it necessary to state that the information given does not 
correspond with reality and is of a provocative nature. Neither 
Volskiy nor the Russian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs have rented or are renting any dacha belonging to 
the external intelligence service, and Zhirinovskiy has never 
been in the Union's buildings and held any conferences. The 
document also points to the serious moral and political damage 
which the publication is inflicting, both on Russia's president 
and on the union, and says that the leadership of the Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs is sending the relevant 
materials to court.

  [Text] The new cabinet's make up may well support 
speculation that the Chernomyrdin government will try to roll 
back the reforms, secretary of the Russia's Choice Party in 
parliament Sergey Yushenkov told reporters on Thursday. 
  In his words, Chernomyrdin has managed to persuade the 
President and form a cabinet of his own choice, an indication of 
a gradual shift of federal authority to the Prime Minister. 
  For his part, RC public relations officer Kirill Ignatiyev 
said the party would ensure political support to its five 
ministers in the cabinet carrying out RC goals. 
  These are Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays, Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev, Science and Education Minister Boris Saltykov, 
Minister of Culture Yevgeniy Sidorov and Environment Minister 
Viktor Danilov-Danilyan. 
  Saltykov in turn has said he will remain in the cabinet as 
long as he can implement reforms within his area of 
responsibility. 
  Yushenkov hopes the Russian President is well aware of how 
fatal it will be to wind up reforms and will be able to muster 
up enough strength to take appropriate decisions. 
  He said that under the constitution, Yeltsin can name a 
Prime 
Minister but not individual ministers. 
  The RC is ready to bring a non-confidence motion against the 
government if it adopts unacceptable resolutions including one 
on the budget, Yushenkov said.

"Dubinin Becomes Finance Minister. An Absolutely Normal Career"] 
  [Text] Sergey Dubinin has been appointed acting finance 
minister for the time being. There is hardly any doubt, 
however, that Sergey Dubinin will survive the trial period and 
become a full- blown minister. 
  Admittedly, Sergey Konstantinovich Dubinin has worked in the 
government fairly long and not just by dashing in and out -- 
although formerly he always played second fiddle. Before 
becoming first deputy finance minister, he was Vladimir Mashits' 
deputy at the State Committee for Economic Cooperation. He came 
there from a scientific environment (they say that Gaydar 
attended his seminars). Dubinin's work at the Economic 
Cooperation Committee was fairly effective; he was involved in 
negotiating interstate treaties on deliveries between the CIS 
countries and the Baltic states. Dubinin's competence in CIS 
matters does not raise any doubts as to his orientation toward 
Russian national interests. 
  Aside from overall economic competence, Dubinin is known for 
a healthy blend of theory and practice -- at any rate, he is not 
dogmatic. Another noteworthy feature is his ability to work 
fruitfully as part of a "team," which is typical for most chiefs 
who have held first deputy posts. Of course, any postponement 
of inflation a la the political campaign-94 is out of the 
question. This does not mean, however, that the tap of credit 
resources will be fully open. On the contrary, one may expect 
an improvement in actual results of the ministry's operation, 
because at Council of Ministers meetings Dubinin will raise 
conceptual matters instead of newspaper pages, which will be a 
compensation to a certain degree for the office holder's loss of 
a deputy prime minister's title: the status of deputy prime 
minister and the post of the Credit Commission chairman, plus 
presidential confidence, enabled Fedorov to work (refuse to give 
money) virtually without discussing his steps. Dubinin appears 
to be able to bring relations between a finance minister and a 
Central Bank chairman back to a normal working relationship. 
  On the whole, Sergey Dubinin, keeping a low political 
profile, is the best choice for Chernomyrdin's government of 
pragmatists.

"President Has Not Forgotten About `Power' Ministries and 
December Elections. Serious Reshuffles in Defense Ministry May 
Follow Two or Three Months From Now"] 
  [Text] According to confidential information received from 
presidential structures, the question about the first deputy 
prime minister in charge of the "power" ministries has been put 
on ice for the next two or three months. At the same time, 
there still remains the question about what practical 
conclusions should be drawn in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 
Defense Ministry, Foreign Intelligence Service, and the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service on the results of the December 
voting, and who and in what way is going to guarantee the 
loyalty of these structures to the present authority in the 
future. Work is proceeding apace in this connection on the 
creation of a special presidential organ for "oversight" of the 
"power" ministries, an organ that would inspect all types of 
their activities as well as take care of "ideological" work and 
personnel policy. 
  The most probable candidates to take over the position of 
head of this organ are Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov and Oleg Lobov. 
Incidentally, it has transpired that Mr. Lobov has become the 
head of a special commission that has begun compiling efficiency 
rating reports on Federal Counterintelligence Service staffers. 
This and Lobov's special relationship with the president 
increase his chances, while he is also sure going to keep his 
post of Security Council secretary. In this situation, Yevgeniy 
Shaposhnikov would quit the army to become Russia's first 
civilian defense minister. 
  The president is not likely to push Pavel Grachev completely 
aside, although many things will come into focus following the 
investigation in the State Duma defense committee into unseemly 
facts some experts think have a direct bearing on the current 
defense minister.

  [Text] "The Russian president, after reorganizing the 
government, does not intend to curb reforms. He is determined 
to continue them," Interfax was told Thursday by the chairman of 
the Central Bank Viktor Geraschenko. 
  Regarding statements by former Finance Minister Boris 
Fedorov, Geraschenko said that they seem to be like a "quarrel 
in a communal kitchen." "I have never had to live in a communal 
kitchen," he went on, "except for when I was evacuated from 
Kazan, and I am accustomed to correlating my actions with those 
of people who live and work beside me." 
  "Even different approaches to the reform must not reduce to 
kitchen squabbles," said Geraschenko. 
  "My attitude to Boris Fedorov has always been normal and I 
believe his rhetorical attacks against myself and Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha are down to his age and character and I will not be 
losing sleep over them." 
  "Fedorov is not that fine an expert in finances, and his 
resignation will not be dramatic for Russia," believes 
Geraschenko. "There have never been indispensable workers and 
there will not be any in the future," he said. 
  He confirmed that fact that the reforms were reoriented to 
meet social needs and flatly denied Fedorov's statements that 
agriculture was a "black hole" through which the agroindustrial 
complex was still seeking credits. 
  Geraschenko believes that it is unwise to rely on food 
imports. Any country sustains its agricultural production, even 
if it is less expensive to buy food abroad, he believes. 
  "It is necessary to import food and at the same time 
increase 
agricultural production in Russia," said the chairman of the 
Central Bank of Russia.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 27 TASS -- Sergey Yushenkov, chairman 
of the State Duma Defence Committee and a leader of Russia's 
Choice, said his faction may call for a vote of confidence in 
the Viktor Chernomyrdin government. 
  Yushenkov told a news conference on Thursday the call will 
come if the faction finds "decisions made by Chenomyrdin's 
cabinet pose a real threat of a catastrophe in Russia," 
particularly in a situation where "the president remains all but 
the last guarantor of reforms and stability in Russia." 
  Commenting on the latest reshuffle in the government, the 
parliamentarian said the decision that Yegor Gaydar and other 
pro-reform ministers should quit was taken by Russia's Choice 
think-tank. However, no complete exodus of the faction's 
members from the government was planned, he added. 
  First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays and other four 
ministers, including Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, will 
continue to work under Chernomyrdin. As one of the four, the 
Science Minister Boris Saltykov put it, "as long as I am able to 
carry on reforms, I will stay in the government. I believe this 
will eventually be more effective than any spectacular demarche."

  [Text] Judging by everything, the government crisis in 
Russia will continue for some time on the frontpage of 
newspapers and featuring prominently on radio and television in 
Russia and not just in Russia alone. The alarm at the 
consequences of Boris Fedorov's departure from the cabinet had 
barely abated when the Foreign Ministry and its head came under 
ever more pronounced attack. Some observers now ask how long 
will Andrey Kozyrev manage to stay in his post? Let us hear the 
point of view of the political scientist Andrey Kortunov: 
  [Kortunov] Kozyrev is currently one of the last 
representatives of the radical team within the new, moderate 
government. I think that heightened criticism can be expected 
in the nearest future in many areas indeed. 
  In the first place, it is thought that the Foreign Ministry 
is not defending the interests of the Russophone population in 
the close neighboring countries with enough consistency. It is 
thought that the ministry is taking a stance that is too 
pro-Western as far as a whole gamut of international issues is 
concerned, essentially following in the wake of Washington's 
foreign policy, for instance regarding the former Yugoslavia. 
  Apart from this, Kozyrev is blamed for the somewhat 
discursive nature of our foreign policy and for the inability to 
determine with any precision the new place and role of the 
Russian state within the system of modern international 
relations. 
  This criticism is not wholly justified, in the first place 
because foreign policy is not being made by the Foreign Ministry 
alone -- the Security Council and other ministries and 
departments have taken an active part in the elaboration of our 
foreign policy, which, in the final analysis, is Yeltsin's 
foreign policy and not Kozyrev's. 
  However, the question is to what extent can this criticism 
lead to changes in Russia's foreign policy and in the personnel 
composition of the Russian Foreign Ministry. I think that if 
one proceeds from the constitutional norms, the Russian 
Federation president has enough powers to have foreign policy 
made exempt, in practical terms, from debates in the State Duma, 
so as to be able to pursue a sufficiently consistent and 
constructive foreign policy course. 
  Yeltsin is clearly intent on pursuing presidential foreign 
policy, a policy that would be independent of the domestic 
political circumstances in Russia. On the other hand, if one 
focuses on the evolution of the Russian Federation's foreign 
policy course over the past several months, a certain tightening 
up is, of course, clearly discernible. In particular, it is 
possible to speak of a greater pressure, above all economic 
pressure, but also diplomatic pressure, upon the close 
neighboring countries. It is also possible to speak of attempts 
to set up Russia's own, liberal concept of nationalism that 
would oppose the ideology of Zhirinovskiy and his party and it 
is also possible to speak of some new nuances in the attitude 
toward the West. 
  How great are the current foreign minister's chances to 
retain his place within the new Cabinet? 
  I think that what is, perhaps, the best circumstance in the 
minister's favor is the fact that the president has essentially 
removed the power-wielding ministries from the remit of the 
council of ministers and the prime minister. The foreign 
minister, the defense minister, and the minister of internal 
affairs are currently subordinate directly to the president of 
Russia and hence there is a hope that Boris Yeltsin will, 
nevertheless, retain Andrey Kozyrev as his minister.

  [Text] St. Petersburg January 27 TASS -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin is upset with his failure to persuade Boris 
Fedorov and Ella Pamfilova to stay in the government, 
presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov said. 
  In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday, 
Kostikov warned against attempts to overdramatise the situation. 
  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has repeatedly said 
lately 
that he will remain adherent to the course of reform, Kostikov 
said. At the same time, he said Chernomyrdin's statements at the 
recent agricultural conference in Oryol, Central Russia, 
resembled "the distribution of unbaked bread" and caused certain 
alarm. "The president is closely watching the situation in the 
government and will not allow (anyone) to backtrack from reforms 
while publicly pledging (one's) adherence to them," the 
spokesman said. 
  He recalled that the new government has been working only a 
few days since the reshuffle and has not taken any real steps 
yet. "The president is inclined to judge by deeds, not by 
words," Kostikov added. He noted that the president is 
concerned about statements which can be interpreted as partial 
restoration of "the administrative-command distribution and 
state planning system." 
  "Under the new Constitution, the president has enough powers 
and possibilities to direct the government and insist on the 
continuation of the course chosen by Russia, the spokesman said. 
  Asked about Yeltsin's relations with the parliament, 
Kostikov 
replied that the tragic experience of the October events in 
Moscow has given food for thought for both the president and the 
parliament. The president was the first to draw conclusions and 
meet with the heads of the parliament houses. "I think the 
deputy corps which has passed the trial of democratic elections 
is interested in constructive interaction with the president," 
Kostikov continued. He said number one task is to isolate 
extremist forces in the parliament. 
  Kostikov said that the president is preparing a message to 
the parliament in which he will outline the main tasks facing 
the country. It will reiterate his adherence to the 
continuation of the tough anti-inflationary policy and 
privatisation as one of the key prerequisites for the country's 
transfer to a market economy. These measures will be 
accompanied by social welfare guarantees, especially for those 
in need. "No one will give out unbaked bread from uncollected 
wheat," the spokesman said. 
  "The president has no intention of interfering in the 
operative work of the government and wants to see what the 
corrections proposed by Viktor Chernomyrdin will give. There 
may be various variants of tactics, but the president has a 
clear-cut limit, that is the continuation of reform. If he sees 
that a tendency towards its curtailment has emerged, he will nip 
that tendency in the bud," Kostikov said.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Golyayev: "Oleg Soskovets: We Must </F>
Bring Order to the Economy"] 
  [Text] The latest conference of the government commission 
on operational questions went on for over three hours and 
examined measures to stabilize the work of the aluminum industry. 
  As in other sectors of the national economy, problems have 
been building up here and they are holding back production 
development. The situation is aggravated by the fact that prices 
of this metal have slumped on the world market (we are largely 
responsible for this) and demand has fallen in Russia itself. 
The enterprise leaders addressing the conference insisted that 
some kind of influence be brought to bear on the energy 
industry, which has raised the prices of its products -- in 
their view, this is inhibiting the sector's development. But, 
as Railways Minister Gennadiy Fadeyev, who also came in for a 
great deal of criticism, said at the conference, you cannot 
generate your own economic prosperity at the expense of others. 
  After the conference First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets 
answered journalists' questions: 
  [Question] How is the government reorganization going to 
continue, indeed there is still one first deputy chairman 
vacancy? 
  [Soskovets] There isn't a second first vice premier's post 
in the plan that I possess. Nor is there an industry 
commission, which I allegedly head. 
  [Question] The resignations of Gaydar and Fedorov got people 
saying that the reforms were over. What do you think? 
  [Soskovets] I do not see in what way Fedorov and Gaydar are 
more market-orientated than I.... The government's main task? 
We must bring order to Russia.

<F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Mikhail Stetsyuk for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Sevastopol January 28 TASS -- "The command of the 
Black Sea Fleet has violated agreements with the Ukrainian and 
Crimean leadership, under which it is necessary to coordinate in 
advance all movements of the personnel and armaments," the press 
centre of the Ukrainian Navy announced Thursday. 
  It circulated a statement which said that the Ukrainian 
Defence Ministry and the Ukrainian Navy had been put before the 
accomplished fact. No one had informed them in advance about 
the planned exercise. 
  The statement pointed out as well that prior to the official 
announcement of the beginning of the exercise coastal guard 
units of the Black Sea Fleet had been put on a high combat alert 
and an exercise had been held on loading the hardware on landing 
boats. 
  Such actions on the eve of presidential elections in the 
Crimea may heighten tension in the region and create conditions 
for all kinds of provocations which, of course, is 
impermissible. Since during the transitional period the Black 
Sea Fleet belongs simultaneously to the two countries, Ukraine 
and Russia, the mutual informing of the Black Sea Fleet and the 
Ukrainian Navy of the exercises, training, as well as the 
movement of personnel and armaments connected with them, is in 
line with the fraternal atmosphere, good neighbourly relations 
and the consolidation of trust and mutual understanding, the 
statement said.

  [Text] The Armenian Defense Ministry Press Service has 
reported relative calm in all the border regions of Armenia 
since last night. 
  The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army Headquarters has 
reported that fierce battles are going on in the north of 
Kelbadzharskiy Rayon, along the Seydlar, Chatly, and Kamyshly 
line. The Azerbaijani side has sent a large force to the front 
and, despite huge losses, is still trying to break through the 
defensive line of the Karabakh fighters at any cost. The 
Karabakh side first checked the relentless pressure before 
launching a counter-attack, sending the enemy back. There are 
losses on both sides. Casualty figures are being determined. 
  The situation is also tense in Mardakertskiy Rayon, where 
fierce fighting is taking place near Tonashen. 
  Only positional exchanges of fire are occurring on the rest 
of the war fronts.

  The leaders of these parties also added that Eduard

  [Text] Riga, Jan 27, BNS -- Latvia should stage a 
referendum to decide on the fate of the Russian-operated radar 
station in Skrunda, the Baltic nation's President Guntis Ulmanis 
told local authorities in the Ludza town. 
  MPs cannot not assume the enormous responsibility for the 
future and the health of people in Latvia if the problem is as 
important as the Skrunda issue is, Ulmanis said Jan. 26. 
  Latvia has evidence of new-type radiation across its 
territory what could be aimed at determining movements of space 
objects, Ulmanis said. In his opinion, Russia is looking for 
new ways to control the airspace above Europe and Latvia. 
  If the guesses prove right, Latvia could possibly attain 
reduction of the term for the preservation of the radar station, 
the president said. 
  As reported, Russia wants to keep the radar for five more 
years. If Latvia agrees to this condition, Russia will complete 
the withdrawal of its troops by September, said Russian 
delegation head Sergei Zotov.

<F P=106> [Oleg Medvedev report: "The Duma's Legislation Activity Is </F>
Limited by the Constitution"] 
  [Text] The State Duma's Committee on Legislation and Legal 
and Judicial Reform, headed by Vladimir Isakov, Boris Yeltsin's 
long-standing opponent, yesterday submitted to other committees 
a draft declaration on the succession of the Federal Assembly as 
the supreme legislative and representative power body. In it, 
the Duma is proclaimed a political successor the Supreme Soviet. 
If adopted, this declaration will become the State Duma's first 
serious challenge to the president. 
  So far this is merely a declaration -- a document whose 
adoption does not entail any legal effects. In a conversation 
with KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent, Mr. Isakov stated that 
since the deputies' attitude to this document is controversial, 
it should be executed precisely in the form of a declaration and 
submitted to the Duma only after being carefully studied in the 
committees. Apparently Vladimir Isakov sees the declaration as 
a feeler of the deputies' attitude to this sensitive issue. 
Apart from the declaration, the legislation committee is 
preparing a number of other draft laws that can give rise to 
serious friction with the president. Laws based on concepts 
differing from the president's are also ripening in other 
committees. 
  The constitution, however, substantially limits the 
possibility of adopting laws not suiting the president. The 
Duma can approve such a law: to do so, the majority of deputies 
need to vote for it. Further, the law is submitted to the 
Federation Council: the president uses all levers on its 
members to influence them either to adopt the law or reject it. 
If the president's efforts are unproductive, he can use his 
veto power. To override his veto requires two-thirds of the 
vote in both houses of parliament, which is very difficult to 
get. Thus, in making the first attempt to pass a law which is 
absolutely unamenable to the president, the Duma has been 
confronted with the problem of its own legislative powerlessness. 
  To overcome it, the Duma should probably seek the 
president's 
opinion at the early stages of work on draft laws. 
(Incidentally, a proposal has come from the presidential 
administration whereby not only adopted laws but also their 
drafts should be sent to the Kremlin). This opinion is 
apparently also shared by Mr. Isakov. According to him, each law 
adopted by the Duma must be the result of a compromise, 
combining provisions both attractive and not very attractive to 
the president: this should make the draft law veto- proof. 
  Not only the Duma but also the president and the government 
are interested in such a compromise formula: If the latter fail 
to find a common language with the house and block the laws 
adopted by it, the lower chamber of parliament will very soon 
become a politically embittered and aggressive state body, a 
powerful center attracting all those unhappy with the president, 
including those who have invested heavily in electing "their" 
deputies in the hope for future profits resulting from the 
passage of beneficial laws.

  [Text] Novosibirsk -- Vasiliy Lipitskiy, 
Novosibirsk-elected State Duma deputy, and leader of the "Free 
Russia" People's Party, intends to press for parliament to pass 
a decision to amnesty Khasbulatov, Rutskoy, and other 
participants in the October events in Moscow. Vasiliy Lipitskiy 
already moved in one of the first parliament sessions that this 
question be included on the agenda, but his motion was rejected. 
In the opinion of Duma Deputy Ivan Anichkin, the failure of 
Vasiliy Lipitskiy's first attempt to secure the release of the 
Lefortovo prisoners is explained only by the lack of 
coordination in the actions of the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia [LDPR] group of deputies, who voted against the proposal. 
"But we will be able to agree on this question with 
Zhirinovskiy," Ivan Anichkin thinks.

<F P=106> [Ilya Bulavinov, Semen Ulyanich report: "Parliamentarians </F>
Get Down to Security"] 
  [Text] Aleksandr Piskunov, deputy chairman of the State 
Duma's Defense Committee, yesterday met with Andrey Kokoshin, 
first deputy defense minister, and Sergey Stepashin, first 
deputy chief of the Federal Counterintelligence Service. They 
discussed questions of interaction between the power structures 
and the parliament committee. 
  There are practically no doubts that a single coordinated 
line on military policy will be worked out, Aleksandr Piskunov 
believes. One of the first priority tasks, in his opinion, is 
consideration of the military budget for 1994. The committee 
has already prepared a draft law on procedures for the 
participation of Russian troops in peacekeeping operations 
abroad. 
  It seems that Mr. Piskunov will after all manage to come to 
agreement with the military department. In the former 
parliament he also worked on the defense committee -- as deputy 
chairman -- and therefore has extensive experience in dealing 
with the Defense Ministry, which looked good amid the general 
state of relations at the time between the executive and 
legislative branches. 
  As a high-ranking official at the Defense Ministry told 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent, his department is counting on 
Aleksandr Piskunov, who is more sophisticated in military 
matters, than on Sergey Yushenkov, former professor at the 
Military and Political Academy, or Dmitriy Volkogonov, another 
representative of Russia's Choice in the Defense Committee, who 
is suspected of intending to pass a law on alternative service, 
seen by the army generals as undesirable, and also of being 
inclined toward various reorganizations in the military 
department. 
  As for the Security Committee, the scheme of its 
interrelations with the power structures will apparently be 
different. Among the committee members are such prominent 
opposition figures as Aleksandr Nevzorov, Stanislav Govorukhin, 
and Yuriy Vlasov. With this composition, the committee chairman 
-- communist Viktor Ilyukhin -- is, according to a source in the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service, a man with whom one can 
talk. Furthermore, owing to his commitment to the idea of 
strong centralized state security bodies, Ilyukhin evokes secret 
sympathies among the hitherto untouchable KGB, tired of constant 
reorganizations.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 27, BNS -- Lithuanian Prime Minister 
Adolfas Slezevicius said he needs to meet with his Belarusian 
counterpart Vyacheslav Kebich. 
  Kebich survived a no confidence vote in the Belarussian 
parliament Wednesday [26 January], but the Belarusian lawmakers 
managed to oust Parliament Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich. 
  Commenting on the developments in Minsk, Slezevicius told 
reporters Thursday that the search for solutions to several 
disputed problems, like the Adutiskis railroad station, has 
stopped and experts have "used up their ability" to deal with 
these matters. 
  The Lithuanian premier said he is glad that Lithuania joins 
NATO's Partnership for Peace program. "We want Lithuania to be 
among the first in this field, and this is a very important step 
in enhancing security and considering Kozyrev's (Russian foreign 
minister) statements." 
  Commenting on the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party's 
proposal to take a no confidence vote in the government, 
Slezevicius said the initiative is a "normal action...and the 
right of all politicians and political parties." 
  The premier said the social democrats simply try "to attract 
attention to a petty party that is poorly represented in the 
parliament." 
  Slezevicius said the earlier governments failed to stabilize 
the economy and to stop crime.

  [Text] Friday, January 28 -- Russia will agree to the 
involvement of the international experts only after the removal 
of the fuel rods from the Paldiski reactor, Foreign Ministry 
Chancellor Alar Olljum announced after returning from an 
international conference in Stockholm dedicated to the 
dismantling of the reactors. 
  The removal of the fuel has been practically agreed upon and 
it should be completed between April and July, he said. Russia 
has decided to complete it without international aid, referring 
to state secrets, he added. 
  The conference failed to agree on the guarantees of safety 
during the removal and transportation of the fuel rods, Olljum 
said, explaining that Russia's equipment either fails to meet 
the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] requirements or 
has been classified. Olljum added that Estonia may ban the 
removal operations in case of doubts in its safety, but such 
moves could be misunderstood. However, the process should be 
monitored by Estonian and foreign experts, the chancellor said. 
  Most problems should be discussed at the next round of the 
Estonian-Russian negotiations, Olljum told the press. But he 
added that practically no progress had been made in the 
preparations of the intended Estonian-Russian summit meeting. 
The meeting would only be possible after the settling of the 
deadline for the Russian troops withdrawal, Olljum said.

to interfere in the affairs of Simferopol yet. Nor is he likely 
to make use of the right granted by the Supreme Council to annul 
the Crimea's legislative acts in the event they are not in 
accordance with the Ukrainian Constitution. This was a 
statement made by presidential adviser Mykola Mykhalchenko. In 
his words, there is now no formal reason for such interference. 
It is only after the election of the peninsula's president, in 
the adviser's view, that any specific steps by Kravchuk can be 
expected in this area. 
  This was a report by Rukh-Press.

  [Text] Minsk January 28 TASS -- Three lawmakers remained in 
the list of candidates for the post of the Belarusian speaker 
after consultations among lawmakers, self-nominations and 
refusal of some candidates to join the race. 
  First Deputy Speaker Vyacheslav Kuznetsov told the 
parliament 
on Friday [28 January] that the three are Mechislaw Hryb, 
chairman of the parliamentary commission on national security, 
defence and anti-crime fight, Mikhail Marynych, deputy chairman 
of the state committee on foreign economic relations, and 
lawmaker Viktar Hanchar. Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich 
refused to vie the post. 
  Hryb and Marynych were nominated by the presidium of the 
parliament which held a meeting on Thursday and which was 
attended by Kebich and heads of republic's regions. 
  The presidium also nominated three other candidates -- 
Nikolay Voytenkov, head of the Gomel region, Viktor Danilenko, 
the ambassador in Russia, and Vladimir Rusakevich, deputy head 
of the Brest region. However, the three immediately announced 
that they quit the race. 
  Hanchar was nominated by Aleksandr Lukashenko who initiated 
the no-confidence vote to former speaker Stanislav Shushkevich. 
  Other candidates nominated by lawmakers included Prime 
Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, Chairman of the Party of Popular 
Accord Gennadiy Karpenko and Ambassador in Latvia Valentin 
Velichko. However, they all withdrew themselves from the list.

ITAR-TASS correspondents. Kazakhstan's head of state is in 
Davos to take part in the world economic forum that is being 
held here. 
  "In December last year Kazakhstan acceded to the Treaty on 
the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and ratified it," he 
said. "My official visit to the United States will take place 
in mid-February and there we will exchange ratification 
instruments. The Supreme Council of Kazakhstan has also 
ratified the START I Treaty. True, we did carry out a great 
deal of work before that." This was completed during the 
meeting in Moscow of the presidents of Russia, the United 
States, and Ukraine; and Belarus made a contribution to this, 
too. 
  There were several points at issue. "The first was the 
guarantee by the nuclear states that there will be no nuclear 
attack on Kazakhstan," Nursultan Nazarbayev continued. "We now 
have this guarantee, including from China. The second point was 
that the cost of the enriched uranium in the nuclear warheads 
should be returned. An agreement on this has been reached with 
the United States. The third point was economic matters, 
investment in Kazakhstan, and economic integration with the 
Western states, including the United States. When agreement was 
reached on these three issues, we went ahead with the 
ratification of the treaties on nuclear problems. 
  The president stressed that "Kazakhstan has never wanted to 
be a nuclear power, if only because 500 nuclear charges were 
exploded on the territory of Semipalatinsk Oblast, including 87 
in the air and 107 on the surface. Hundreds of thousands of 
people are still suffering and Kazakhstan was left to face their 
problem alone. I closed down that test site by decree. From 
this everyone will understand Kazakhstan's striving to rid 
itself of these weapons and not have them on its territory."

  [Text] Davos January 29 TASS -- Russia is interested in 
developing cooperation with Europe and other countries of the 
world, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told a news 
conference in Davos on Saturday [30 January]. 
  Chernomyrdin is in Switzerland to attend the World Economic 
Forum that is in progress here. 
  "We want to work in the world community and want to join the 
European Union. We want G-7 to transform into G-8. We want to 
live and trade on equal terms will all," he said. 
  Chernomyrdin pointed out that Russia is also interested in 
boosting contacts with the Organisation of the Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC). Speaking about his meeting with 
OPEC Secretary-General Subroto of Indonesia to be held on 
Sunday, the Russian premier stressed that he will "try to 
discuss the whole spectrum of questions concerning oil 
extraction and supplies. I can say already now that Russia will 
not object to the consideration of the question of its joining 
OPEC." 
  in a bid to dispel mounting concerns in the West, following 
recent changes in the Russian government, Chernomyrdin said that 
Russia will not depart from the course of reform. The serious 
work that has begun in the country will be continued, he 
reassured. 
  "Russia will not divert from the path on which its has 
embarked. Russia will not backtrack because market mechanisms 
have already been created. But these mechanisms need to be 
filled with substance. I have already said and I will say it 
again that we will not lead our country to the point of shock... 
But we will not be able to do without therapy either," the 
premier said. 
  Among the main tasks of the government in 1994 Chernomyrdin 
named the continuation of efforts to fight inflation in the 
country.

  [Excerpts] Davos, 29 Jan -- Russia will not deviate from 
its course of reforms. The serious work that has been started 
in the country will be continued. This was stated today by 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, speaking at a 
news conference here. He is in Davos to take part in the world 
economic forum. [passage omitted] 
  V. Chernomyrdin said that the fight against inflation is one 
of the main areas for the government's work in 1994. Last year 
the task was to knock down the rate of inflation from over 30 
percent to 12-15 percent a month. This task was fulfilled. "We 
should now keep to this level," the Russian prime minister 
stressed. "The rate of inflation will fluctuate around 20 
percent a month in the first half of the year. We will try to 
bring it down to 15-18 percent by the end of the year." The head 
of the Russian Government noted the need for the restructuring 
of industry and of agrarian and other sectors of the economy. 
According to him, this will play a predominant role. He 
pointed out that there would not be any control over wages and 
distribution. The government is raising the question of 
granting more rights to the regions. 
  Touching upon the formation of the government, V. 
Chernomyrdin reported that there were no lengthy talks with the 
president on cadre reshuffling. This question was discussed in 
early December and, but for the elections, but for the 
referendum, the reshuffle would have been carried out last year. 
"Therefore, there's no need to think things up, everything is 
going as agreed with the president," he stressed, adding that 
the reorganization of the government is continuing. [passage 
omitted] 
  "Russia has always played and will continue to play a 
certain 
role in the world community. Difficult processes which are 
painful for us are under way in Russia today. We are 
experiencing difficulties. In order to join the market economy 
in a real way, to move forward into the world community, we 
should bring everything into line with the demands of market 
relations." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Davos, Switzerland, January 30 TASS--Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin's policy of an in-depth democratic 
reform of Russian society, the economy and political 
institutions will be continued with due regard, primarily, for 
the national and strategic interests of Russia and proceeding 
from the principles inherent in the new Russian Constitution, 
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told a plenary 
meeting of the World Economic Forum here on Sunday night. 
  Touching upon the problem of foreign investments in the 
Russian economy, Chernomyrdin emphasised that last year had seen 
no cardinal changes as regards Russia's readiness for 
cooperation. Inside Russia, conditions for the operation of 
foreign investors gradually change, albeit too slowly, he said. 
  Russia can accept and "digest" foreign investments amounting 
to at least 10,000-12,000 million U.S. dollars a year, not as 
"aid" but on mutually beneficial commercial terms, Chernomyrdin 
said. 
  "We are prepared for joint work in this respect, to set up, 
in particular, a multilateral council of foreign and Russian 
bankers, investors, and entrepreneurs and jointly examine 
investment cooperation possibilities with respect to particular 
sectors and enterprises," the Russian prime minister said. 
  Chernomyrdin expressed readiness to participate in the work 
of such a council, a session which could be held in Moscow in 
May-June. 
  In conclusion, the Russian premier voiced hope that the 
World 
Economic Forum would promote the understanding of the processes 
taking place in Russia. 
  Then he answered questions asked by plenary meeting 
participants. 
  January saw a campaign during which Russia was accused of 
curtailing reforms and the Russian Government was alleged to 
have a desire to reverse the reform process. 
  "I would like to state once again: Russia will not turn 
backwards and will not swerve off the road of reforms. This is 
guaranteed, primarily, by the Constitution which reflects the 
realities of a democratic society, democratic Russia. We have 
the president who is the guarantor of what we do now. You may 
rest assured that my government will go ahead with reforms and 
will not turn off the road," Chernomyrdin said.

  [Text] Davos January 31 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin held a series of meetings with 
representatives of political and business circles of Western 
countries during his two-day visit to the Swiss resort city of 
Davos to attend the World Economic Forum. 
  Chernomyrdin met with Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, 
Swiss federal adviser Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, OPEC Secretary 
General Subroto, EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development] directors and managers of a number of major 
commercials banks. 
  "We have attained our goal at the talks -- there was a 
thorough and professional discussion of problems and 
difficulties faced by Russia," Valentin Sergeyev, head of the 
press service of the Russian Government, told ITAR-TASS. "There 
is no question of reforms or no reforms on today's agenda. We 
are for reforms, but the question is how they should be carried 
out, who should help us and by what means the reforms should be 
fulfilled," Sergeyev said. 
  "The forum in Davos was beneficial for all, including the 
West and Russia, for the general comprehension of problems we 
are facing today and which might arise tomorrow," Sergeyev said. 
He pointed out that in the opinion of the Russian delegation, 
this time the talks were not merely a discussion in character, 
which shows that a new stage in the comprehension of Russia's 
problems has begun. "It was not the question of what to do but 
rather how this should be done that was at issue," Sergeyev said. 
  "Our cooperation with the West is not merely a declaration, 
but quite a concrete matter. Earlier, we discussed aid, whereas 
today, we are speaking about mutually advantageous cooperation, 
while the word "aid" sounds like nonsense. Today, we are not 
merely discussing investments, but rather ways in which Russian 
goods, but not only raw materials, can enter the world market. 
In short, the Davos forum has risen to a qualitatively new 
level in its businesslike atmosphere, approaches and expected 
results," Sergeyev said.

  [Text] Davos (Switzerland), 30 Jan -- All the talk about a 
change in the reform course in Russia is premature, and in the 
West it is also too emotional, Dmitriy Ryurikov, the Russian 
Federation president's adviser on international affairs, told an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent; Ryurikov is taking part in the World 
Economic Forum under way here. 
  "I believe that some statesmen and journalists in the West 
should deal more with facts and figures, and be more sober and 
more pragmatic," he said. "The budget has not been announced, 
nor has the government's program, even the composition of the 
government has not been finalized, and on the whole it contains 
the same people. There have been assurances from the president 
and there have been assurances from the prime minister. What 
else do you need?" 
  Ryurikov believes that the main foreign aid to Russia would 
be the opening of markets to Russian goods. The effectiveness 
of such a measure was evident last year. If this tendency 
continues that will be the best aid. As to assistance from 
international financial bodies, it should be directed at support 
for specific projects, preferably unconnected with government 
structures, and, preferably, in the regions. 
  Russia had and has its place in the world economy, said the 
president's adviser said. I think that now it must make this 
place more advantageous, and, by changing itself, change its 
stand in the world. Precisely this will be the subject at all 
the talks related to Russia's participation in the Naples G-7 
meeting. 
  Dmitriy Ryurikov considers that the discussions at the Davos 
forum, in which heads of states, leaders of world business and 
eminent scientists are participating, are useful. According to 
him, the forum is useful, it allows to detect the mood of 
business people and foreign government circles in respect to 
Russia, permits to find out what interests them in our country. 
And, in turn, it gives us the opportunity to voice our 
questions, to talk about our concerns.

  [Text] Davos, Switzerland January 31 TASS -- The situation 
in the Russian economy is not hopeless but there are many 
difficulties to overcome before seeing the light at the end of 
the tunnel, according to participants in the seminar on the 
Russian national economy within the World Economic Forum in 
Davos, Switzerland. Representatives of Russia differed greatly 
in their views on the situation. 
  Yakov Urinson, first deputy minister of the economy, was 
optimistic on the whole. He cited his ministry's forecast, 
according to which the situation will be held under control in 
the months to come provided the tough economic policy is 
maintained, the state budget revenue strengthened and 
institutional transformations and the privatisation drive 
continued. This will slow down the slump in 1994, and the gross 
national product will dwindle by eight per cent as against 12 
per cent last year. Urinson spoke in favour of supporting 
specific groups of population in the hope that stabilisation of 
social life will be possible this year, as well as an increase 
in the labour and business activity of the middle class. 
  There are no political forces in Russia capable of stopping 
privatisation, the seminar was told by Vice-Premier Anatoliy 
Chubays, who is chairman of the State Privatisation Committee. 
According to Chubays, 70 per cent of shops, stores, restaurants 
and other enterprises in the same sphere had been privatised by 
January 1, 1994. He stressed the need for dialogue with the 
parliament concerning further privatisation. "The bulk of the 
population supports reforms, and this is the source of my 
optimism," Chubays stressed. 
  Although the political situation in Russia in 1993 was very 
complicated, the market reforms continued, according to 
ex-finance minister and parliament member Boris Fedorov. He 
said he viewed as a success the continued deregulation of 
prices, an end to import subsidies and financial infusions in 
the Commonwealth member-countries, and the struggle against the 
budget deficit. "Without these measures the inflation rate could 
have been much higher," he said. Fedorov announced that the 
rouble exchange potential against the dollar increased 
three-fold last year, but this increase was too slow and too 
painful. The reform objectives were not made quite clear to the 
people, he said. For all that, he stressed that the term "shock 
therapy" is not fully applicable to Russia's economic policy. 
As concerns the short-term perspectives, Fedorov said that 
recent changes in the policy and playing up to the public were 
fraught with an economic disaster in the next few months. But 
in the mid-term, one may reasonably be more optimistic. 
  According to economist Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, one of the high- 
priority tasks is the toughening of control over the inflation 
rate. He spoke against soft credits and stressed the need for 
further privatisation, particularly in agriculture. He 
recommended Western investors to concentrate on Russia's 
regions. "I am optimistic about the future, but not about this 
year," Yavlinskiy said.

  [Text] Davos January 30 TASS -- Uzbek President Islam 
Karimov, currently attending a world economic forum in 
Switzerland, said in an interview with ITAR-TASS that countries 
of the former Soviet Union are stronger now than a year ago and 
seek economic cooperation which might pave the way for resolving 
political issues. 
  "The euphoria which all of us experienced in a purely 
political aspect when everyone advocated sovereignty, is 
weakening," Karimov said, he pointed out that "political 
sovereignty appeared to rest on economic issues", adding that 
economic independence turned out to be more important than the 
political one and that there was a growing desire to communicate 
with each other in a purely economic aspect. 
  Karimov drew particular attention to the situation in 
Ukraine, pointing out that there were times when this republic 
occupied a kind of an isolated position. "I think that was a 
mistake," Karimov said. "Today, we strongly need economic 
cooperation which will promote the solution of political 
problems," the Uzbek president said in conclusion.

  [Text] The Defense Ministers of Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and 
Kazakhstan held a working meeting in Bishkek on Friday [28 
January]. 
  As the Kazakh minister Sagan Nurmukhametov told newsmen 
after 
the session, the sides signed a protocol on mutual assistance 
and on republican resources for their armies' logistic supplies. 
  He stressed that the meeting least of all meant secession 
from the CIS Collective Security Treaty. On the contrary, he 
said, its results will contribute to broader cooperation between 
the collective security pact members. 
  As Uzbek Defense Minister Rustam Akhmedov remarked, the 
consultations pave the way for closer ties between the three 
Central Asian states in anti-aircraft defense and in other 
fields. He voiced hope that Russia would join the alliance, 
since it was interested in reinforcing its southern borders more 
than any other state. 
  The Uzbek and Kyrgyz ministers also signed a bilateral 
cooperation accord for 1994.

  [Text] A two-day meeting of the defense ministers from 
Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan has ended today in 
Bishkek. Our correspondent Aleksandr Knyazev reports. 
  [Knyazev] The three ministers have signed a protocol on the 
results of their meeting, which states that full mutual 
understanding on all issues discussed was achieved. Among these 
issues are the joint use of the installations and facilities 
inherited by the sovereign armies from the USSR Armed Forces. 
In particular, Lieutenant General Akhmedov, the Uzbek defense 
minister, reported that a decision has finally been found on the 
use of two training grounds. 
  The training ground of the Airborne Assault Forces deployed 
in Andizhan Oblast of Uzbekistan is situated on the territory of 
Osh Oblast in Kyrgyzstan, and the training center of the 
Osh-based Motorized Mountain Rifle Division is situated near 
Andizhan. The regularly-held training exercises of the Uzbek 
airborne assault forces were often causing serious problems in 
the relations between the two neighboring republics. Similar 
problems exist with Kazakhstan. 
  The ministers have also discussed mutual interaction in the 
field of arms and equipment supplies, the training of officers 
and specialists, military transport, and other issues. It was 
noted that military cooperation between the three countries is 
not aimed at creating a separate military alliance, but will be 
carried out within the framework of the CIS Collective Security 
Treaty of which these three republics are members.

<F P=106> [Leonid Brodskiy report: "First Deputy Minister for CIS </F>
Affairs Appointed. Post of Minister Still Vacant"] 
  [Text] Vladimir Mashchits, former chairman of the State 
Committee for Economic Cooperation with the CIS Countries, was 
appointed by government decision yesterday as acting chief of 
the new Ministry for Cooperation with CIS Member Countries with 
the rank of first deputy minister. 
  Vladimir Mashchits is 39 years old. Before his appointment 
as chairman of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation with 
the CIS Countries [State Cooperation Committee] he was Russia's 
authorized representative on the Inter-Republican (later 
Inter-State) Economic Committee; earlier he worked at the 
Central Economics and Mathematics Institute. 
  Vladimir Mashchits' new appointment can be interpreted as 
follows: the agency he heads is growing, acquiring new 
functions and objectives, whereas the former State Cooperation 
Committee chairman himself is unable to keep pace with the 
expansion. 
  In fact, figures who not long ago were in charge of Russia's 
economic relations with the former USSR republics have changed 
completely. Typically, both Aleksandr Shokhin, recently deputy 
prime minister and chief supervisor of economic relations with 
the CIS countries in the Russian Government, and Vladimir 
Mashchits were relegated to lower rungs of the government 
hierarchy. In this context it is worth noting that Vladimir 
Mashchits belongs to the first, "Gaydar" government draft, a 
fact that could not but influence his effective demotion, 
although he has never stood out too much. 
  On the whole, however, there is no doubt that Russian CIS 
policy will have new guidelines. One may even discern what they 
will be like to a high degree of certainty. To all appearances, 
geopolitics will take precedence over economic calculations, and 
integration -- under Russia's aegis and based on resuscitating 
the ruble zone -- will come to the fore. 
  The Ministry for Cooperation with CIS Member Countries 
(apparently modeled on the British Ministry of Commonwealth 
Affairs) has an important role to play because it has been 
entrusted not only with economic, but also with political 
functions. And while Vladimir Mashchits performs the duties of 
an acting minister, a new candidacy is apparently being picked 
at the political kitchen, a person whose political clout and 
views should correspond to the new objectives of a new stage in 
Russia's relations with the former Soviet republics. 
  [Article includes the following boxed passage] 
  -- The State Committee for Economic Cooperation with the CIS 
Countries was an agency accumulating proposals from all Russia's 
economic agencies on the development of cooperation with the 
former USSR republics. Particular importance in the committee's 
activity was attached to the credit and financial aspects of the 
cooperation. 
  -- The Ministry for Cooperation with CIS Member Countries, 
while retaining all the functions of its predecessor, has also 
taken over political support for the integration.

<F P=106> [Report by Captain Second Rank A. Lobskiy: "Admiral I. </F>
Kasatonov: `I Side With These People and I Am Ready To Defend 
Their Interests'"] 
  [Text] A group of officers from the Navy's Joint 
Chiefs of Staff headed by Admiral Igor Kasatonov, deputy 
commander of the Russian Navy, has paid a three-day visit to the 
Baltic Sea Fleet. 
  The inspection was aimed at organizing combat, tactical, and 
command training for the new year, as well as to examine issues 
connected with the withdrawal of fleet units from the Baltic 
states. 
  Summarizing the results of the inspection, Adm. Kasatonov 
emphasized that the Baltic Sea Fleet positively distinguishes 
itself among other Russian fleets. The final grade received by 
the fleet -- "good." 
  Nevertheless, Igor Vladimirovich [Kasatonov] devoted the 
main 
part of his speech to an analysis of shortcomings and 
oversights. After all, as one of the officers pointed out, 
"Kasatonov would not be Kasatonov if he were less adamant." 
  In the opinion of the admiral, there are many shortcomings 
in 
the organization of command, the headquarters' performance in 
the development of naval combat tactics is poor, many officers 
are not sufficiently acquainted with documents regulating their 
responsibilities, and the work at headquarters is improperly 
organized. 
  However, I dare say that the most important part of the 
inspection on the Baltic Sea Fleet was Kasatonov's visit to the 
city of Liepaja, where he met with Latvian Navy Commander G. 
Zeibots. In the course of the meeting, they discussed issues 
connected with the transfer of Russian Navy facilities to the 
Lithuanian side. According to Zeibots, the Lithuanians feel 
resentment toward Russian servicemen who, in his opinion, do not 
properly prepare the facilities for the transfer, which makes it 
impossible to use these facilities. As an example, he cited a 
building in Bolderaja, a suburb of Riga, which had been handed 
over to Latvia half ruined. Yet, the Russian side refuted such 
accusations. Providing two Liepaja military schools as an 
example, they proved that facilities are transferred in suitable 
conditions, however, following the transfer, they are left 
completely unprotected which leads to pilferage. 
  G. Zeibots admitted that such complications really exist, 
but, he believes that the main problem is the lack of 
appropriate transfer procedures. 
  Also discussed at the meeting was the possibility of 
Russia's 
using the Liepaja and Riga ship repair yards. The commander of 
Latvian Navy requested that Adm. Kasatonov sell two signal 
cannons which are essential for Latvia to conduct protocol 
ceremonies. According to the former's words, although this issue 
has already been discussed for more than two years, it has not 
been resolved. 
  Assessing the results of the meeting, G. Zeibots noted that 
in general it was conducted in a business-like, constructive 
atmosphere. He also emphasized that the complex problems, which 
appear in connection with the withdrawal of Russian troops from 
Latvia, are solved more constructively in cooperation with the 
Russian Navy leadership than the Command of the Army. 
  The same day, Adm. Igor Kasatonov met with Liepaja 
administration representatives. Imant Vismins, head of the 
administration, requested the Russian Navy Command complete the 
pullback of naval units from Liepaja by 10 May 1994. In his 
opinion, this is necessary to stabilize the political situation 
in the city on the eve of municipal elections scheduled for the 
end of May. 
  Admiral Kasatonov stated that the deadlines for the 
withdrawal are defined by a special timetable, which takes into 
account the capabilities of the railroad system, accessibility 
of new facilities for moving troops, and coordination of 
timetables for the withdrawal of Russian troops from other 
Baltic republics, Germany, and Poland. He also emphasized that 
the Russian Navy Command may fulfill the request of the Liepaja 
Administration, if the necessity of doing this is convincibly 
motivated and the rights of the Russian-speaking population are 
guaranteed and protected. 
  Leaders of the trade union committees of the Liepaja Naval 
Brigade and representatives of veteran organizations who 
participated in the meeting recalled facts testifying that 
civilian personnel of Russian military units are discriminated 
against in terms of housing and certain other issues. 
  "I entirely side with these people," stated Igor Kasatonov 
adamantly, "and I am ready to defend their interests." 
  According to Vismins, the Liepaja branch of the Department 
of 
Citizenship and Immigration is not subordinated to the City 
Administration. Nevertheless, he promised to apply measures for 
assuring compliance with Latvian law if it is violated. 
  Having heard reports by commanders of Russian units deployed 
at the Liepaja Naval Base and examined the timetable for their 
withdrawal, the first deputy commander of the Russian Navy noted 
that the timetable for withdrawal of equipment, property, and 
personnel had been thoroughly cross-examined and is completely 
realistic. 
  In a conversation with a STRAZH BALTIKI correspondent, he 
agreed that it is possible to complete the pullout of the 
Liepaja naval brigade by 1 June 1994. The greatest difficulty, 
which cannot be definitely solved at the moment, is housing for 
the families of servicemen. 
  At the same time, Adm. Kasatonov emphasized that the issue 
of 
the Navy's withdrawal will be solved in the context of Russian- 
Lithuanian relations and based on government agreements. 
  Yesterday, the officers' group headed by Adm. Igor Kasatonov 
departed for St. Petersburg.

<F P=106> [Interview with Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first deputy </F>
commander of the Russian Federation Navy, by A. Lobskiy; place 
and date not given: "Despite Reductions the Fleet Continues To 
Develop"] 
  [Text] [Lobskiy] Comrade Admiral, how do you assess 
the results of your work with the Baltic Sea Fleet? 
  [Kasatonov] Analogous inspections concerning the course of 
combat training are currently being conducted on all four 
Russian fleets. Of course, the situation in the Baltic Sea 
Fleet has an array of characteristic features, since to meet 
with those people and inspect units and vessels, one must leave 
the country and pay visit to countries of the near abroad. 
However, we did not experience any difficulties; the Latvian 
authorities facilitated our work. 
  In general, inspections of units deployed in Kaliningrad 
Oblast and at the Liepaja Naval Base showed that the Baltic Sea 
Fleet is well prepared for the new training year, organizational 
problems have been solved, and methodological issues have been 
examined. The Baltic Sea Fleet has successfully begun the new 
training year, and I hope it will end the year the same way. 
  I visited the Liepaja submarine brigade, and despite the 
fact 
that the troops are to leave the base soon, the results of 
combat training were just brilliant. This happening one more 
time merely testifies to the fact that the Baltic Sea Fleet, 
despite all its problems and difficulties, maintains 
self-control and manageability and efficiently performs tasks of 
combat training. 
  [Lobskiy] Has the Naval Command set any new goals for 
the Baltic Sea Fleet for the new year? 
  [Kasatonov] Of course. In connection with the fact that we 
have lost many of our Baltic bases, it is necessary to reexamine 
issues concerning communication, combat training, coordination, 
and command. 
  [Lobskiy] The issue of establishing in Kaliningrad 
Oblast a unified defense rayon with a joint command, supply 
system, etc., has been examined for long time. What is the 
opinion of the Russian Naval Command on this issue? 
  [Kasatonov] Great attention has been paid to issues of close 
cooperation among units of the Navy, Army, and Antiaircraft 
Defense, in the plans for combat training in 1994. Such work 
was conducted before. The command of the Russian Navy supports 
the establishment of a unified structure in the oblast, however, 
you probably understand that this issue does not fall within our 
competence. 
  Returning to the question concerning new tasks, I will point 
out that the Baltic Sea Fleet will have to establish relations 
with navies of our former Baltic republics, which are today 
sovereign states. That is a very important task for the Baltic 
Sea Fleet. The commanders of these countries' navies also 
understand the importance of this issue. I met with Latvian 
Fleet Commander Zeibots, and I must admit that he expressed his 
willingness to initiate a constructive dialogue between our 
navies. Certain steps have already been made to establish a 
system of secure naval traffic, rescue operations, and early 
warning. The results of this work will be defined by the 
effectiveness of relations which are currently being established 
by the Baltic Sea Fleet Command with representatives of the 
Baltic states' navies. The Russian Naval Command is interested 
in continuing this work and will render any necessary support. 
  [Lobskiy] You visited Latvia and met with 
representatives of the local authorities, commanders of military 
units, and workers. What problems should be resolved immediately? 
  [Kasatonov] According to reports prepared by commanders of 
Liepaja garrisons -- both our commanders and the Latvians -- 
they have established working relations and jointly solved many 
problems. The same can be said regarding relations with local 
authorities. However, certain violations of the rights of 
Russian-speaking workers and servicemen of the fleet have taken 
place. We addressed this issue at a meeting with the head of 
the Liepaja Administration, and he promised to take necessary 
steps. I will report on this issue to the commander in chief 
and the Russian Defense Ministry. If this attitude does not 
change, the Russian Foreign and Defense Ministries will have to 
apply extraordinary measures. 
  In general, in my opinion, a wise approach begins to prevail 
in the position of Baltic states, and I believe that all the 
problems will be solved at the negotiating table. The Baltic 
Sea Fleet Command has appropriate experience in this field, and 
it skillfully conducts its work in this direction. Speaking 
about Russian-Latvian relations, in my opinion, the Latvian side 
does not take into account the fact that Russia began to build 
those seaports and bases as early as the 17th and 18th 
centuries, and that, for example, Liepaja is closely connected 
with Russian history. This is the cradle of our submarine 
fleet. In this century, Russia has also done a lot to develop 
the infrastructure of these cities and seaports. I hope that 
these issues will be solved justly and by means of civilized 
negotiations. 
  [Lobskiy] Comrade Admiral, last year, the Russian 
Federation Government adopted a program for revival of the 
Russian Navy. Does it include a chapter concerning the Baltic 
Sea Fleet, and if it does, what is its substance? How will the 
fleet look on its 300th anniversary? 
  [Kasatonov] The military doctrine of our state defines 
defense tasks for the Navy, as well. Moreover, the importance 
of the Navy's role in the country's defense system will be 
increasing, since the number of nuclear warheads and ammunition 
deployed in the Navy will increase. Whereas the number of the 
Navy's nuclear warheads currently amounts to 27 percent of the 
total number of nuclear warheads, in the future, it will climb 
to 42-47 percent. Nevertheless, concrete elements of the Navy's 
development will depend on the results of economic reform. 
Today, the Navy is not only being reformed and reduced, but it 
also continues to develop. Recently, several modern battleships 
have been launched, and on 21 December, I participated in the 
launching of the newest nuclear submarine, the Severodvinsk. 
  The Navy continues to conduct its regular cruises, patrols, 
and visits. Of course, all this is conducted in a different 
context than it was five or ten years ago. Today, the Navy 
fulfills appropriate international agreements on early warning 
of all sorts of incidents, which have been signed with various 
countries, conducts joint naval exercises, and pays working and 
official visits. This year, similar activities are to be no 
less frequent than they were last year. 
  The concept of naval development in the third millennium is 
currently being examined, and what is most important, the 
Russian Government and the highest authorities of our state 
express their understanding. This allows us to be optimistic as 
to the future of the Navy. 
  [Lobskiy] You know about the problems of the Black Sea 
Fleet very well. How do you assess the current situation in 
Sevastopol? 
  [Kasatonov] Certain forces have been trying to entangle the 
Black Sea Fleet in political battles. This is the reason behind 
its instability, spread of crime, and activation of Mafia 
structures and nationalist, extremist forces. The murder of 
Captain First Rank Andrey Lazebnikov, a Russian officer, is the 
latest evidence of this. Moreover, the situation is not 
improving, only further deteriorating. 
  Whereas Russia has proved its ability to solve the problems 
of the Black Sea Fleet, the other side has shown nothing but 
ambitions. In accordance with the Massandra agreements, this 
issue should be solved this year. If we keep waiting, history 
will never forgive us. 
  [Lobskiy] Igor Vladimirovich, during your visit to 
Liepaja, you discussed the possible sale of scrap metal sunk in 
Latvian ports. However, the issue remained unresolved. 
Unfortunately, a great many material resources are being 
wasted, despite the fact that they can be cashed in today. 
  [Kasatonov] Negotiations on property have been proceeding 
since we started our withdrawal. Today, Lieutenant Colonel 
Buyanov, a representative of the Central Department of Material 
Resources within the Russian Federation Defense Ministry, is in 
charge of these issues. Practically speaking, everybody admits 
that the current activities are inefficient. However, there are 
no appropriate legislative acts, government resolutions, or 
other documents. Apparently, such a situation satisfies 
somebody. 
  [Lobskiy] Is there any hope that the situation will 
change? After all, the Navy commander has stated that if he had 
the right to decide about the fate of the remaining property, he 
would not take a kopek from the state coffers to build housing 
for servicemen. 
  [Kasatonov] We have repeatedly addressed this issue to the 
Defense Ministry leadership and the government. And we will 
continue to do so in the future. However, I am not convinced 
that this issue will be resolved. 
  [Lobskiy] What is your opinion of the reform of the 
personnel service structure? 
  [Kasatonov] The defense minister has issued an order in this 
regard, and, as is known, one must not evaluate orders. 
  [Lobskiy] But, even a preliminary examination of this 
document shows that an array of aspects of such work has been 
eliminated. For example, there has been no other structure 
dealing with the social problems of servicemen. Now, these 
kinds of activities will be reduced if not discontinued. 
  [Kasatonov] Yes, such a threat really exists. However, I 
can say that, in a certain amount of time, maybe a year or half 
a year, we ourselves will analyze the work of the new structures 
and submit our conclusions to the defense minister. I am 
convinced that everything will be taken into account. These 
structures are to comprise only chief and deputy commanders, 
therefore, our job will be to help them organize their work and 
draw conclusions. 
  [Lobskiy] Igor Vladimirovich, how would you comment on 
the results of the recent elections in our country? 
  [Kasatonov] Our country has entered on the path of 
democratic development, which has been confirmed by the results 
of the elections. Another issue is that we can encounter 
certain setbacks and obstacles on this path, and they should be 
reckoned with. I believe that the common sense of our people 
will prevent any cataclysms. 
  [Lobskiy] Comrade Admiral, during the tragic events in 
Moscow, certain newspapers disseminated a report saying that, on 
behalf of Rutskoy, you were proposed to take the side of the 
White House. Was that true? 
  [Kasatonov] Nobody came forward with such a proposal to me. 
Probably, because I instantly declared my position: The 
president of Russia is the commander in chief. Moreover, it is 
immoral to solve political problems by means of military 
battles, as the former leaders of the Supreme Soviet did. 
  Another important lesson coming from these events is that 
politicians, civil activists, and authorities should base their 
activities on the Constitution. Only such a path will safeguard 
the interests of Russia, its economic growth, and stabilization 
in society and the Armed Forces. This is a prerequisite for the 
effective development of the country and its government.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 29 (ITAR-TASS) -- Today's leading 
newspapers do not single out any main topic. Commenting on the 
resignation of the Belarusian parliament speaker, the 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes: "Specialists and 
politicians will repeatedly examine the results and consequences 
of Stanislav Shushkevich's resignation. 
  "But the first conclusion can be drawn even now: The actual 
omnipotence of one political force has been again regained from 
this time. The parliamentary majority led by premier Vyacheslav 
Kebich will not have any more 'a whipping boy' in the face of 
the former speaker. The party of power headed by the government 
will be now obliged to assume full responsibility for the 
republic's future." 
  The same newspaper deals with the Azeri-Armenian conflict 
over Nagorno-Karabakh in another article. "While Moscow and 
Yerevan continue to make conjectures on how Aliyev (Eds: the 
Azeri president) managed to consolidate the army in such a short 
period of time, Baku continues to keep mum and is in no hurry to 
refute reports by some Russian media that Afghan mujahideen make 
up the core of the renovated army. 
  "Moscow's insistent call to stop combat operations put a 
difficult dilemma before the Azeri leader: either to make 
concessions and agree to talks with the Armenian side, or to 
ignore the Russian side's diplomatic pressure. 
  "In the first instance, Aliyev risks to lose support of 
Azeri 
population, in another, to force Moscow to look for other 
methods of pressure on the present Azeri leadership.+ 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Aleksandr 
Dzasokhov, member of the state Duma (lower chamber of the 
Russian parliament) from North Ossetia, who says: "The state 
Duma has gathered a motley, and nevertheless, political elite of 
the Russian state, especially from Moscow. 
  "If this is the case, it should conduct affairs in a 
responsible way, as an elite should do. This is especially 
important, since a democratically elected parliament is being 
formed for the first time. 
  "This is the start of a truly multi-party system, and 
parliament will be responsible for how it will work." 
  According to the TRUD newspaper, "social tension at mines of 
the Kuznetsk coal basin has become dangerous from the beginning 
of the new year. Workers refuse to go to work in some or other 
mines. 
  "The reason for such a sitution is not only months-long 
delays with payment of wages and unfulfilled promises by the 
government. Lack of funds prevents miners from purchasing the 
most necessary equipment to carry out mining operations and 
(what's the most dreadful thing) to ensure labour safety." 
  The IZVESTIYA newspaper focuses on the rouble's rate. 
"Relative stability of the rouble over the past few days," the 
newspaper writes, "gave a brief respite to all money dealers. 
There is a chance now to cast a retrospective glance and to draw 
some conclusions. 
  "The most important of them evidently is that times have 
passed for good when the government could artificially fix an 
exchange rate between the rouble and the dollar. The situation 
is quite different these days: The rate of the national monetary 
unit is now among the main indicators of the efficiency of the 
government's activities." 
  The same newspaper runs an article by state Duma member 
Vasiliy Lipitskiy advocating an amnesty to members of the state 
emergency committee and detainees of the Lefortovo prison (eds: 
members of the State Emergency Committee engineered an abortive 
state coup in 1991. They are now on trial but released from 
prison. Lefortovo detainees started a state coup in Moscow in 
October 1993 and are under investigation now). 
  "Such an amnesty, in Lipitskiy's opinion, could draw a line 
under the past and become a step to national reconciliation," 
the newspaper notes. 
  The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper writes about breakdowns and 
emergencies in the Russian federation last year. "The year 1993 
witnessed over 1,200 serious breakdowns and emergencies in 
Russia, which claimed the life of 1,100 people. 
  "The unstable social and economic situation in the country 
indicates that the number of breakdowns, disasters and other 
emergencies will be at least the same this year," the newspaper 
notes. 
  The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper examines the problem of 
piratic fishing by foreign ships in Russian territorial waters. 
  "The solution of the piratic fishing problem faces the 
following question: Will Russia be a powerful state which will 
be reckoned with by close and distant neighbours?" asks the 
newspaper. "The process is reverse for the time being," it adds. 
  The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIA newspaper carries an interpellation by

Russian peasants. He notes: "Peasants have no hard currency on 
their bank accounts as well as villas in California. 
  "Their homes are here, and they will do their best to

and to feed urban population. But if, God forbid, hunger strikes 
any place, the blame will fully rest with Misters Gaydar, 
Fedorov and other enemies of the Russian countryside.

<F P=106> ["Review of Sunday night television analytical news shows"] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 31 ITAR-TASS -- The political crisis 
in Belarus and presidential elections in the Crimea were in the 
focus of independent television's Sunday analytical programme 
ITOGI. 
  The removal of Stanislav Shushkevich from the post of the 
Belarussian parliament chairman was an unpleasant surprise for 
Moscow and quite unexpected by Russian diplomats, according to 
ITOGI host Yevgeniy Kiselev. He said the removal of Shushkevich 
"means nothing good for Russian-Belarussian relations". 
  "Yeltsin has lost reliable ally who unconditionally took his 
side last October," Kiselev said. "The Belarussian leader was 
one of the few commonwealth leaders on whose loyalty Yeltsin 
could always count. Shushkevich's reputation was very high also 
on the international arena where he was viewed as a reformer and 
a staunch advocate of the market economy. 
  A report from Minsk about the events preceding Shushkevich's 
resignation and reaction to the fact in Russia and other 
countries cited different views on what happened in Belarus. 
Belarussian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich disagreed with the 
allegation that the toppling of Shushkevich was tantamount to a 
"communist coup". "It was nothing of the kind. All the forces 
in the pariament remained there and the policy pursued by the 
parliament will continue to be pursued, Kebich said. 
  Itogi paid much attention to the unification of the monetary 
systems of Russia and Belarus and the creation of a single 
rouble zone of these two countries. According to a survey 
conducted by the public opinion fund, 32 per cent of Russian 
citizens last week believed that Russia should unify its 
monetary system with that of Belarus, even if the Russian 
economy suffers from the move. Fifty per cent of those polled 
were opposed to the move, and 18 per cent had not yet made up 
their minds. 
  As concerns changes in the Russian Government, most Russian 
voters were "sceptical in their attitude", according to Yevgeniy 
Kiselev. He proceeded from the results of another poll 
conducted by the public opinion fund which revealed that 27 per 
cent of those polled believed the reshuffle would affect 
negatively the lives of the Russian people. Only 17 per cent 
believed that the resignations and reshuffles in the government 
would yield a positive result. Thirty per cent of those polled 
said the government changes would not affect the life of the 
population in any way. Twenty-six per cent were uncertain. 
  "The results of the past two years enable us to say that 
many 
tasks in reforming our economy and switching to a market economy 
have failed to be accomplished," economist Stanislav Shatalin 
said in an interview with the Ostankino television Sunday 
programme Voskresenye. "An analysis of the past two years shows 
that we must re-define guidelines for our social and economic 
policy," Shatalin said. 
  "While the past week was critical and most unpleasant in the 
political career of one of the initiators of the commonwealth, 
Stanislav Shushkevich who resigned under the insupportable 
burden of the problems -- political and economic -- which arose 
in the wake of the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the 
coming week threatens much unexpected in connection with the 
same problems to another consignee of the first commonwealth 
agreement, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk", Kiselev said. 
Much will depend on the outcome of the second round of the 
presidential elections in the Crimea, he said. A report from 
Simferopol made it clear that the pro-Russia Yuriy Meshkov was 
running well ahead of his rival in the first presidential 
elections in the peninsula republic contested by Ukraine and 
Russia. 
  Itogi recalled that a criminal cases was opened last week 
against parliament member Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who heads the 
parliamentary faction of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia. 
Zhirinovskiy is charged with war propaganda under Article 71 of 
the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. 
  First Deputy Chief of the Federal Counter-Intelligence 
Service Lieutenant-General Sergey Stepashin spoke in an 
interview with Itogi about the aims and tasks of this 
organisation established on the basis of the former Security 
Ministry. He said that although the number of the personnel has 
been cut almost by half, the number of operational, 
counter-intellligence units remained the same. Asked if the 
names of KGB informers would be made public, Stepashin said, "We 
will do everything to prevent it". He explained that all 
similar services across the world maintained "undercover 
personnels", "regardless of whether the state is democratic, 
anti- democratic, communist or any other". Moreover he said it 
was wrong not to keep the promise of confidence given to former 
KGB informers, because "it was destroy their lives". The 
general expressed anxiety about the considerable leaks of 
nuclear, military and other technologies, as well as about 
attempts at recruiting Russian researchers and specialists by 
foreign special services. 
  Itogi reported on the latest developments in the Vil 
Mirzayanov's affair -- this Russian chemist is now in custody on 
charges of revealing state secrets relating to the production of 
new chemical weapons in Russia. The programme reported that 
Mirzayanov's colleague Vladimir Uglev announced his intention to 
make public on February 4 the formula of the secret chemical 
substance unless Vil Mirzayanov was released by that time.

  [Text] Beijing January 29 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev met the leaders of the north-western Chinese 
province of Shaanxi in the ancient Chinese capital of Xian on 
Saturday [29 January], the final day of his official visit to 
China. At the meeting, the sides discussed how to boost 
bilateral trade and economic relations. 
  The Russian minister also visited a museum of terracotta 
figurines made in the epoch of first Chinese emperor Qinshihuang 
(3d century B.C.) and made a sight-seeing tour of Xian. 
  During the four-day visit, Kozyrev held talks with his 
Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen. The sides confirmed mutual 
desire for the development of political, trade, economic and 
military cooperation, pointing to the need for raising 
Russian-Chinese relations to a higher level of constructive 
partnership. 
  They stressed the importance of cooperation between the two 
great powers in maintaining stability in the Asia-Pacific region 
and throughout the world. 
  The sides signed two documents on the results of the talks: 
An intergovernment agreement on check points on the 
Russian-Chinese border. The agreement will streamline and 
simplify the inspection and passage regime. They also signed a 
protocol on political consultations between the Russian and 
Chinese Foreign Ministries. 
  Kozyrev had meetings with the country's leaders -- the 
Chinese Republic's Chairman Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng. 
The Russian minister conveyed a personal message from Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin to the head of the Chinese state, 
containing an invitation to come to Russia on an official visit. 
  In compliance with an understanding reached during the 
Russian minister's visit, the second Russian-Chinese summit is 
planned for the third quarter of this year. 
  It will be preceded by trips of Russian Premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin to Beijing and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen 
to Moscow. Kozyrev also confirmed an invitation to Premier Li 
Peng to visit Russia. 
  The Russian foreign minister toured Shenzhen, a special 
economic zone in the country's south. 
  Kozyrev departed for home in the evening, local time.

  [Excerpts] Brussels, Dec 30 (AFP) -- The surge of 
ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in Russia's general 
elections has stepped up pressure on NATO to allow one-time 
enemies from the former Soviet bloc to join the military 
alliance, NATO officials said Thursday [30 December]. 
  Bulgaria and Macedonia became Thursday the latest in a host 
of former communist states pressing to join the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation, which is due to hold a two-day summit 
starting January 10 when the enlargement issue will be raised. 
  NATO heads of state and government are expected to endorse a 
plan to step up cooperation with the states of East Europe at 
their annual summit without granting them membership in the 
alliance. 
  Among those knocking on NATO's door are Hungary, Poland, the 
Czech Republic, Romania and the Baltic states of Lithuania, 
Latvia and Estonia. 
  Russia, which fears being "locked out" of Europe, and its 
military leadership oppose their former Warsaw Pact allies 
joining NATO in the near future, and Western leaders are anxious 
to avoid fanning nationalist passions in Russia's newly-elected 
hung parliament. [passage omitted] 
  Bulgarian President Zhelio Zhelev said Thursday he had 
informed Russian leader Boris Yeltsin that Sofia wanted to join 
NATO in the wake of Zhirinovsky's visit. [passage omitted] 
  Kiro Gligorov, president of the former Yugoslav republic of 
Macedonia, told parliament Thursday his country would ask to 
join the Western defence alliance, saying "it is very important 
for the security of the region that we join the NATO council, 
and NATO itself, as soon as possible." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Foreign Minister Willy Claes is 
very disappointed by the lack of progress on the situation in 
former Yugoslavia. Annie Lameus reports: 
  [Lameus] Willy Claes deplored the fact that the warring 
parties were driven by a logic of war rather than peace, and he 
reserved particularly harsh criticism for the leader of the 
Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic: 
  [Begin Claes recording] The Serbian side continues to bear a 
crushing responsibility in this tragedy. I cannot find a single 
good thing to say about someone like Karadzic, whom I consider 
one of those most to blame for this tragedy. Even in general, 
however, when, like school teachers, we ask these various 
gentlemen whether they are prepared to commit themselves to a 
cease-fire over a given period -- with international public 
opinion as their witnesses -- and these gentlemen answer yes 
without the slightest hesitation and then we see that nothing, 
but nothing, is respected, then we have to ask ourselves some 
questions. [end recording] 
  On 1 January, Greece will take over the European Presidency. 
Greece still refuses to recognize the Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia as long as it bears the name Macedonia. Other 
European countries have recognized this republic and, this 
morning, Willy Claes announced that Belgium would soon be doing 
the same.

  [Text] Austria's membership in the European Union (EU), 
Vienna's commitment on human rights issues, and attempts at 
defusing the crisis in the Balkans are the priorities of 
Austrian foreign policy at the turn of 1993/94, Foreign Minister 
Mock said. 
  "Full membership in the European Union is an absolute 
priority of Vienna's foreign policy at the moment," Mock said. 
Austria wants to share the responsibility for maintaining 
security in the European Union "in a very restless Europe" as an 
equal member. 
  Austria's commitment to human rights became apparent during 
three major events in 1993. Vienna was the venue of the first 
Christian-Islamic Conference, the United Nations Human Rights 
Conference, and the first summit of the Council of Europe heads 
of state and governments. In spite of different views, the 
Human Rights Conference contributed to "strengthening the 
controls in enforcing human rights," Mock said.

Smuggled to Austria in Car Tank"] 
  [Text] Eric de Zwart (32) has been traveling to Austria 
from his home country, the Netherlands, several times a year to 
sell drugs. 
  The disguise was perfect: In the winter months, he was 
studying to become a skiing instructor. In a number of winter 
holiday resorts, this smart "sunny boy" was a welcome visitor. 
He also traveled regularly to Vienna and Lower Austria. 
  Everywhere he was received by "friends," who waited for his 
deliveries. The man from Rotterdam had intensive contacts with 
Austrian drug dealers. He sold them hashish that he heat-sealed 
in plastic bags, hid in the gasoline tank of his car, and 
smuggled into Austria. 
  Over the past two years, Eric de Zwart smuggled at least 38 
kg of hashish worth 4 million schillings from the Netherlands to 
Austria. 
  He has now been arrested by Lower Austrian criminal police 
officers at the Walserberg highway border crossing, carrying 4 
kg of cannabis resin. Eric de Zwart was to have handed over the 
drugs to an Austrian dealer at the highway restaurant in 
Mondsee. No information on his contacts has been revealed. 
Detailed investigations are under way.

  [Text] Brussels, Dec 30 (AFP) -- The Serbs are 
"overwhelmingly responsible" for the continuation of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy 
Claes said here Thursday [30 December]. 
  He called for the maintenance, and possibly the 
strengthening, of sanctions against Serbia as "the only solution 
for making the belligerents lay down their arms." 
  Analyzing Belgium's six-month term as president of the 
European Community, Claes, accompanied by Prime Minister Jean 
Luc Dehaene and Finance Minister Philippe Maystadt, admitted 
that "despite all the initiatives taken, we were not able to get 
things moving." 
  Last week's meeting in Brussels between the Bosnian warring 
factions and the 12 EC foreign ministers "was a great 
disappointment," he said. 
  The fact that the ceasefire agreed to by all factions at 
that 
meeting was not respected "puts their representativeness in 
doubt," he added. "The different parties seem to be more 
inspired by a dialectic of war rather than peace." 
  "It has been clearly proven that the Serbian faction, and 
notably Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, continues to have 
an overwhelming responsibility in this tragedy," Claes said. 
  The foreign minister, warning that military invention by the 
West could lead to an internationalization of the conflict, 
called for more pressure against the belligerents instead. 
  "More violence will not solve things," he said. 
  Asked about the decision of several EC countries to 
establish 
diplomatic relations with the Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia, Claes said Belgium would "follow their example" after 
it gives up the EC presidency. 
  Greece, which will take over the presidency from Belgium on 
January 1, "is ready to accept this decision," Claes said. 
  The presence of European diplomats in Skopje "could make the 
Greeks accept a compromise" over the name and the flag of the 
Macedonian Republic, he added. 
  Greece has refused to recognize Macedonia's independence and 
establish relations as long as the republic keeps its current 
name and flag, which includes symbols claimed by the Greek 
people.

  [Text] Brussels, Dec 30 (AFP) -- Belgium will establish 
diplomatic relations with the Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia (FYROM) soon, Foreign Minister Willy Claes announced 
Thursday [30 December]. 
  France, Germany, the Netherlands, Britain, Italy and Denmark 
announced in mid-December that they would set up diplomatic ties 
with Macedonia. 
  Claes told a news conference here, "Belgium will follow this 
example as soon as its presidency of the European Union ends." 
  Greece will succeed Belgium as six-month president of the 
12-nation European Community on January 1, to be followed by 
Germany on July 1. 
  Athens has criticized its EC partners for establishing 
diplomatic relations with its northern neighbor which it insists 
must change its name before it should be recognized. 
  Greece has a northern region also named Macedonia and says 
it 
fears the former Yugoslav republic may have territorial claims 
on the region.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 2 (AA) -- Turkish Embassy in Belgium 
on Sunday [2 January] warned Belgian Foreign Ministry on 
incidents that happened in Brussels last night. 
  Embassy under secretary Ali Koprulu evaluating the incidents 
said Turkish citizens should be calm against provocations. 
  Koprulu said he talked to Belgian Foreign Ministry officials 
and wanted them to put an end to the outlawed separatist 
terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization's 
activities in this country. 
  Ten Turkish citizens and five Belgian policemen were wounded 
in a clash in Brussels on Saturday when Turkish citizens were 
protesting the outlawed separatist terrorist PKK organization's 
meeting. Turkish citizens were trying to prevent a meeting of 
between 150 and 200 terrorists from taking place in a hall in 
the Saint-Josse area of north Brussels. Turkish citizens became 
angry when the terrorists attempted to hang a flag outside over 
the balcony. 
  Police intervened later and dispersed the crowd with a water 
cannon shortly after midnight. Police officials said many 
Turkish citizens were taken into custody and several windows and 
car windscreens were broken. 
  PKK terrorists were taken from the spot in small groups.

<F P=106> [Report by George Timmerman: "Belgian-Walloon Arms Exports: </F>
`Business As Usual' -- Trade to Gulf States Continues"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 29 Dec -- In a few weeks Foreign Trade 
Minister Robert Urbain [PS: French-speaking wing of the 
Socialist Party] will have to present his report on the Belgian 
arms trade to parliament for the first time. The publication of 
such an annual report is required by the new and stricter Arms 
Export Act of 5 August 1991, which only came into effect on 16 
April 1993. The new law, which prohibits arms exports to 
countries which do not respect human rights, was passed under 
pressure from the SP [Dutch-speaking wing of the Socialist 
Party] and the Volksunie [People's Union]. All signs seem to 
indicate that despite the law, little has changed. The motto for 
the Walloon-Belgian arms manufacturers remains: "Business as 
usual." 
  The export of murderous weapons is traditionally viewed as a 
very sensitive political issue. It is not just a moral 
question. Since all the large producers of "classical" weapons 
are on the other side of the language border [Wallonia], it is 
also a loaded issue in community terms. Reasons enough to raise 
as much fog and secrecy as possible around this aspect of our 
export efforts. 
  On 17 May 1993 Volksunie Senator Nelly Maes asked Minister 
Urbain which countries in North America and in the Near and 
Middle East are supplied with arms by Belgium. The answer was: 
"Since the publication of a list of countries which purchased 
arms in Belgium is extremely delicate given relations with these 
countries, the discussion of this report [on the application of 
the new Arms Act] with the agreed confidential framework offers 
the opportunity to further break down the information into 
geographical areas." 
  In his answer, Urbain also revealed that since the new Arms 
Act took effect, from 16 April to 15 May, licences were granted 
for the definitive export of weapons, ammunition and materiel 
for military usage, valuing 1,888 billion Belgian francs [BFr]. 
These products were overwhelmingly destined for NATO countries 
(BFr1,542 billion) and countries placed on the same footing as 
NATO countries (BFr135 million), he said. Other areas appeared 
to be of secondary importance, according to Urbain's figures: 
the Near East (BFr48 million), Asia (BFr114 million), Latin 
America (BFr29 million), Africa (BFr2 million) and East Europe 
(BFr15 million). 
<H5>  Double? </H5>
  However, reliable and fairly detailed information in the 
possession of the editorial office, drawn up by the Customs and 
Excise Administration of the Finance Ministry, point in another 
direction. This information mainly covers the period just 
before the new Arms Act took effect (January 1991 to July 1993). 
Of course the large and apparently very urgent arms deliveries 
to Turkey by plane from Zaventem fall under sales to NATO 
partners. However, a civil war is clearly taking place in 
Turkey, so that arms exports to it were prohibited under the old 
law too. In addition, very large consignments of weapons were 
transported by ship from Antwerp and Zeebrugge to Saudi Arabia 
and other Gulf States, such as Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab 
Emirates. Has this enormous trade to the Gulf States suddenly 
dried up since the new Arms Act took effect? Since the middle 
of April this year all licence applications have been examined 
in the light of the provisions of the new Arms Export Act, 
according to minister Urbain. All-in-all, in the first month 
since the new law took effect, "one export application was 
refused, because the destination was obviously violating human 
rights." In any case the amount quoted by Urbain of BFr1.8 
billion in one month seems strikingly large. By way of 
comparison: Foreign Affairs Minister Willy Claes (SP), in 
answer to a previous parliamentary question, said that Belgian 
arms exports stood at BFr11.5 billion in 1991. If the period 
under examination of mid-April to mid-May 1993 is representative 
of the whole year, then in the course of this year arms exports 
would have climbed to BFr21.6 billion. That is nearly double the 
amount compaired to two years ago. 
<H5>  Outdated </H5>
  There was a time gap of no less that 18 months between the 
passing of the Arms Export Act by parliament and the publication 
of the implementation decrees in the Official Journal. During 
all this time the new Arms Act was in a dead letterbox. 
Insiders do not doubt that the postponement in the royal 
decrees should be blamed above all on delaying maneuvers by the 
PS. 
  This party, which is closely linked to the Walloon arms 
lobby, had every interest in the longest possible maintenance of 
the arms export licence system provided for under the outdated 
1962 act. Only when a parliamentary committee of inquiry was set 
up due to the efforts of Louis Vanvelthoven [Dutch-speaking wing 
of Socialist Party], Nelly Maes [People's Union] and Johan Van 
Hecke [Christian People's Party], could work be started on 
changing the law. On 10 September the text was published in the 
Official Journal. Scarcely two weeks later the "Martens eight" 
government fell over different interpretations by the 
communities of certain articles in the act. The French-speakers 
wanted a large arms delivery to Saudi Arabia. And they had 
their way, due to the lack of decrees on implementing decrees 
for the new act. Subsequently a mediocre scheme applied of 
"federalized" ministry arms export committees, each of which 
decided on the allocation of arms export licences for its own 
region. The task has been taken over by Ministers Claes and 
Urbain since the present government took office. 
<H5>  Political Support </H5>
  Belgian arms exports mainly benefit two companies located in 
Wallonia, namely Mecar and FNNH [New National Factory of 
Herstal, formerly FN]. Mecar produces a product range 
comparable to that of PRB, which in the meantime has been sold 
to the British Astra company. Mecar is a subsidiary of Allied 
Research Associates and most of its shareholders are U.S. 
officers and Saudi Arabian sheiks. Virtually the whole of 
Mecar's production is destined for countries like Kuwait, Saudi 
Arabia and, until recently, Iraq. Specialists point to the 
possibility that Mecar was specially set up in Belgium by the 
United States to get maximum benefit from the flexible Belgian 
legislation on arms exports. The Walloon-U.S. ammunition maker 
can count on the virtually unconditional support of a number of 
Walloon politicians. 
  The same applies to FNNH, at present owned by the French 
Giat 
[Association of Land-Based Weapons Industries] group. FN has 
long been the country's most famous arms producer. The Walloon 
regional investment company SRIW has not only provided repeated 
financial support to Mecar and FNNH. To safeguard the export 
licences of both companies, at the end of 1991 PS chairman Guy 
Spitaels was even prepared to have a political and institutional 
crisis, which led to the fall of the Martens cabinet.

<F P=106> [Report by Georges Timmerman: "Turkey: `Limited Amounts?'"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels 29 Dec -- A year ago, in December 1992, VU 
[People's Union] MP [Member of Parliament] Paul Van Grembergen 
asked Foreign Trade Minister Robert Urbain [PS: French-speaking 
wing of Socialist Party] to immediately stop all arms deliveries 
to Turkey. An Amnesty International report had once again shown 
that human rights were still not being respected in Turkey. The 
report spoke of mass executions, torture, and attacks on the 
Kurdish population. 
  "Turkey is not a traditional purchaser of arms from 
Belgium," 
Urbain answered soothingly. "In so far as licences were still 
granted for the delivery of arms, ammunition, and military 
equipment to Turkey, it concerns very limited amounts." Since 
Turkey was not on the embargo list, and no EC country was 
prepared to announce an embargo, at that time Urbain regarded it 
as "not opportune to suspend or withdraw the current export 
licences, which as mentioned are very modest." Strictly 
speaking, Urbain's reasoning is correct. Earlier that year the 
EC had decided to not announce an arms embargo against Turkey. 
In exchange the Turkish government promised to henceforth 
respect human rights. 
  The documents now in the possession of DE MORGEN prove that 
minister Urbain may have been right regarding the number of new 
arms export licences. But in 1991 and 1992 Turkey was a big 
customer of the Belgian arms manufacturers. The quantities 
supplied at that time can scarcely be described as "limited" and 
"modest." On 20 May 1991 five army transport planes left 
Zaventem airport for Turkey carrying a consignment of military 
vehicles and arms of Belgian origin. In total they weighed 97 
tonnes. Two days later five army transport planes again left 
with a similar destination and a load weighing 118 tonnes. 
Another two days later saw the departure of five army planes 
carrying a total of 115 tonnes of military vehicles and arms; on 
28 May five of the same aircraft again departed with a total of 
115 tonnes. 
  (On 20 May 1991, on the very first day of this series of 
deliveries, Foreign Affairs Ministers Claes was minimizing arms 
exports to Turkey: "This year only one export licence was 
granted for a batch of ammunition worth 12 million Belgian 
francs [BFr]," Claes said. "As for the future, I want to point 
out that companies do not always inform my department about 
projects which are still under negotiation, so that I cannot 
give any accurate information about possible orders which are 
still in the pipeline.") 
  This overview does not take into account smaller shipments 
which were transported by Sabena or Turkish Airlines: 238 kg of 
pistols (on 9 February 1991), 154 kg of arms (1 May 1991), 17 kg 
of pistols (3 July 1991), 335 kg of arms (14 December 1991), 501 
kg of arms (12 February 1992), 266 kg of pistols (14 March 
1992), 2,733 kg of ammunition (25 April 1992), 246 kg of arms (1 
August 1992), 207 kg of arms (19 September 1992), 120 kg of arms 
(3 October 1992), 154 kg of arms (21 October 1992), 982 kg of 
arms (24 October 1992) and 907 kg of machine guns (11 November 
1992). 
  In addition there was a load of 265 cases of rifle grenades 
(around 6 tonnes) produced by Mecar [subsidiary of Allied 
Research Associates] which left Antwerp by ship for Turkey on 29 
January 1991. Finally a ship left Zeebrugge for Turkey on 16 
February 1991 loaded with 322 tonnes of Belgian-made 
projectiles. This means that in 1991-92 Turkey bought nearly 
800 tonnes of arms in our country.

<F P=106> [Report by Georges Timmerman: "Saudi Arabia Remains a Mega </F>
Customer"] 
  [Text] Brussels 29 Dec -- Most of the 120 major weapons 
shipments from the ports of Antwerp and Zeebrugge in recent 
years have been destined for Saudi Arabia or the other Gulf 
States. 
  Detailed information in DE MORGEN's possession shows that 
between January 1991 and April 1993 more than 40 consignments of 
Belgian weapons left for Saudi Arabia, seven went to Qatar, five 
to Oman, and five to the United Arab Emirates. 
  Mecar-Seneffe [subsidiary of Allied Research Associates] 
mainly supplied smoke generators, igniters, percussion caps, 
rifle grenades, and mortar bombs to the Saudis. However, FN 
Herstal [National Factory of Herstal] was the biggest supplier. 
  This company supplied hundreds of pallets of ammunition of 
every caliber, automatic hand weapons, rifles, machine guns, 
heavy machine guns, mortars, Kalashnikovs, hand grenades, 
antitank projectiles, antiaircraft artillery and components for 
every type of other weapon. 
  The lists of arms shipments from our two sea harbors show 
that a considerable share of Belgian arms exports were destined 
for Third World countries. 
  For example arms shipments went to Thailand (11 tonnes of 
war 
ammunition and 755 tonnes of components for 155-mm projectiles 
from FN Herstal on 8 February 1991), Venezuela (2,000 rocket 
motors and 1,560 rocket heads from Forges de Zeebruges on 12 
February 1991, 13 tonnes of ammunition and projectiles on 31 
December 1991), Chile (two 90-mm cannons with accessories from 
Cockerill-Seraing on 14 May 1991 and 28 February 1992), Botswana 
(some 7 tonnes of arms, components, and bayonets from FN Herstal 
on 19 September 1991), Taiwan (3 tonnes of arms and components 
from FN Herstal on 14 January 1993, various shipments of rocket 
motors from Forges de Zeebruges) and Indonesia (79 tonnes of 
ball powder from PB Clermont on 13 December 1991). 
  Third World countries were also massively supplied with 
Belgian arms from Ostend and Zaventem airports. 
  To give a few examples: 945 kg of explosives, grenades, and 
gas masks to Rwanda (6 January 1993), 14.9 tonnes of arms 
components and ammunition to Dubai (28 April 1991), 144 kg of 
arms to Singapore (29 July 1991), 325 kg of mortars to Zaire (4 
December 1991), more than 5 tonnes of arms and accessories to 
Jordan (25 March 1992), 425 kg of ammunition to Burkina Faso (23 
April 1992), 320 kg of arms to Brazil (24 September 1992), and 9 
tonnes of ammunition and 22 tonnes of explosive to Somalia (19 
December 1992).

Arms Export"] 
  [Excerpts] Brussels, 30 Dec -- "The data published 
yesterday by DE MORGEN are correct," according to Nelly Maes, VU 
[People's Union] senator. For years she has been quietly 
battling weapons exports. After comparing DE MORGEN's articles

808 crates of kalashnikovs to Saudi Arabia on 19 July 1991.

  [Text] Brussels, Dec 30 (AFP) -- Belgium "accomplished its 
mission" during its six-month presidency of the European 
Community, especially by seeing through the Maastricht Treaty 
and the adoption of a battle plan against unemployment, Prime 
Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene said Thursday [30 December]. 
  Belgium, which passes the rotating EC Presidency to Greece 
on 
January 1, also helped to unblock negotiations on several 
technical issues such as the structural fund, the budget and 
steel, he said during a press conference attended by Foreign 
Minister Willy Claes and Finance Minister Phillipe Maystadt. 
  The Maastricht Treaty on closer European union, which 
provides for the establishment of a single currency by the end 
of the century, has now come into force after ratification by 
all EC states. 
  The European Monetary Institute, precursor of a future 
European central bank, will be established on New Year's Day. 
  Dehaene called on the Executive Commission to give "total 
priority" to the Community's white paper recommendations on 
competitivity, growth and employment adopted in December by 
member states. Thanks to this document, "the Community knows 
which path to take to get out of the crisis," he said. 
  The premier emphasised the importance of trans-European 
networks in transport, energy and telecommunications. 
  December's summit had agreed an annual investment of ECU20 
billion ($22.8 billion) over six years for such projects, but 
left a question-mark over funding for an ECU8 billion ($9.12 
billion) section of the budget. 
  Claes expressed satisfaction with the conclusion of the GATT 
trade talks during the term of Belgium's presidency and said 
that a series of meetings had allowed "greater cohesion" at the 
heart of the Community. 
  He also felt it would be possible to conclude talks on 
enlarging the Community by the end of February and in principle 
Austria, Norway, Finland and Sweden could join by the start of 
1995. 
  The ministers regretted that they had not been able to 
convince their EC partners to adopt a tax on carbon dioxide 
emissions. Belgium and the Commission wanted to make the tax an 
integral part of a European employment strategy by providing new 
sources of income to relieve social burdens. 
  They also referred to the August exchange crisis which 
forced 
Community members to widen the European Exchange Rate Mechanim 
bands from 2.5 to 15 percent, but Maystadt was satisfied with 
the ERM's hold on currencies. 
  "Since August 2, member states have resisted the temptation 
to follow lax policies. We have returned to a situation of 
rather great stability," he declared. 
  The Community should be defining "new rules of the game" 
during 1994 to ensure a better division of responsibility for 
intervention by central banks during periods of tension, Dehaene 
added.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Netherlands Company Finances </F>
Zhirinovskiy's Party"] 
  [Excerpt] Moscow/Amsterdam -- The Netherlands company 
Global Money Management (GMM) is one of the largest financial 
backers of the Russian neo-fascist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. 
  The Amsterdam-based company is owned by the Muscovite A.V. 
Nenachov (age 27) and has at least "paid a considerable part of 
the campaign costs for the Russian parliamentary elections." 
This was reported in the SEGODNYA [TODAY] newspaper. 
  The paper said that the "sub-criminal GMM," which launders 
illegally earned money for Russians in the West, also bought a 
place on the electoral list for Aleksej Soejev, Nenachov's 
23-year-old adviser. 
  The journalist Michail Leontjev did not dare reveal his 
sources out of fear of legal action, "or worse." For the same 
reasons he did not want to dwell excessively on the evidence 
which he says he has. 
<H5>  One and One-Half Million </H5>
  Zhirinovskyi's campaign cost approximately 1.5 million 
guilders. The Russian media has speculated for months about who 
paid the money. The Iraqi leader Saddam Husayn and the 
ultraright German millionaire Gerhard Frey are also said to be 
sponsors of the popular Russian nationalist. Other rumors tell 
of the information services and the army. 
  Zhirinovskiy was the big winner in the elections. In the 
run-up to the vote he bought a huge amount of broadcast time on 
television to present his extreme views. He seeks the expansion 
of the "Russian Empire" and wants to revive the KGB secret 
service. Zhirinovskiy maintains that his campaign was paid for 
by thousands of individual supporters. 
  In Moscow an answer machine explains in Russian and English 
that the GMM company is closed. The Amsterdam office was closed 
"for Christmas" so that it was not possible to obtain any 
comments on the claims. 
  Previously the company has said that it has been active 
since 
1969, but the registration with the Amsterdam Chamber of 
Commerce dates from 29 January of this year. The share capital 
of the limited company, which is based in offices on the 
Herengracht canal, stands at 200,000 guilders. Director 
Nenachov is the only shareholder. 
<H5>  `Zhirinovsky's Party Gives Criminals a Chance of Power' </H5>
  Amsterdam/Moscow -- Nearly every day Global Money Management 
(GMM) presents itself on Russian television as an international 
investment company. 
  Director Nenachov says that his company -- which has placed 
and paid up share capital of 42,000 guilders -- has invested 
nearly 20 million guilders in Russia and that GMM has not taken 
one cent out of Russia. 
  GMM's Netherlands head office is not registered with the STE 
[Share Dealing Monitoring Foundation]. The STE's spokeswoman 
said that the company probably does not operate on the 
Netherlands market. "GMM cannot provide any security-related 
services in the Netherlands, because it does not have a license 
to do so," the spokeswoman said. 
<H5>  Warning </H5>
  However, the Dutch central bank (DNB)is acquainted with GMM. 
In a recent letter to the company, the central bank referred it 
to the rule that nonbanks are prohibited from taking savings 
from the public. "GMM is not a bank or a financial institution 
and therefore is not under the supervision of the central bank. 
But as a Netherlands limited company they are obliged to 
respect Netherlands law." The central bank said that at present 
there was no question of GMM having committed an economic crime, 
but the letter should be seen as a warning. 
  Financial circles revealed that ABN AMRO [General 
Netherlands 
Bank -- Amsterdam/Rotterdam Bank] in Amsterdam had been GMM's 
company bank. The bank would only reveal that ABN AMRO has no 
(further) relationship with GMM. It is not known which 
financial institution is now GMM's company bank. [passage

<F P=106> [By Rowan Dore, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Text] Britain today told Sudan to "immediately reconsider" 
its decision to expel the British ambassador. 
  The Foreign Office gave Sudan'a fundamentalist Islamic 
government a deadline of Tuesday January 4 to think again. 
  As the already strained relations between the two countries 
worsened, the Sudanese charges d'affaires in London, Abdul 
Rahman Bakhit [name as received], was summoned to the Foreign 
Office to explain the "totally unjustified expulsion." 
  He left after a 35-minute meeting with Sir Michael Burton, 
the assistant under-secretary covering the Middle East, Near 
East and North Africa. 
  Officials said he had been given a strong rebuke and was 
told 
that his explanation for the expulsion of envoy Peter Streams 
was "wholly inadequate." 
  Mr. Bakhit had said one of the reasons for the expulsion was 
Mr. Streams' persistent contacts with opposition leaders in the 
southern rebel-held area of Sudan. 
  The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. George Carey, is currently 
on a high-profile visit to Christians in southern Sudan. 
  Foreign Office officials said the visit had merely brought 
to 
a head a simmering situation between Britain and Sudan. 
  In a strongly worded statement after the meeting, the 
Foreign 
Office said Sir Michael had underlined Britain's "profound 
dissatisfaction and regret" at the "unjustifiable" decision to 
expel the ambassador. 
  Mr. Bakhit had told Sir Michael that Mr. Streams was seen as 
an "obstruction to attempts to improve bilateral relationships." 
His contact with opposition figures was also criticised. 
  Sir Michael dismissed these explanations as "wholly 
inadequate" and asked Mr. Bakhit to convey this message to his 
government together with the request to "immediately reconsider" 
the expulsion if it valued its relationship with the UK. 
  The Foreign Office said Mr. Streams was a highly respected 
ambassador who had reported back to it about human rights abuses 
in Sudan. A spokesman said: "We consider our ambassadors have a 
duty to report a wide range of political views." 
  He added: "We value our relationship with the Sudanese 
government but we want to see progress in finding a just 
solution to the current war in the south." 
  Asked if Britain was considering retaliation such as 
expelling Sudan representatives in London, the spokesman said: 
"It is clearly one of the options, but we do have to await the 
response of the Sudanese government." 
  Sir David Steel, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs 
spokesman, warned against Britain adopting a "tit-for-tat 
attitude" in the row with Sudan. 
  "If you want to get to grips with the real problem, which is 
the application of Islamic fundamentalism to the rule of the 
state, you don't help dialogue by breaking off relations," he 
told Radio 4's "The World at One."

<F P=106> [By London PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Text] Loyalist paramilitaries have refused to call off 
their terrorist campaign in Northern Ireland. After considering 
the Downing Street peace declaration, the Ulster Freedom 
Fighters [UFF] said they retained the right to "respond 
militarily" in 1994. 
  The outlawed organisation -- the UDA's [Ulster Defence 
Association] military wing and the largest of the Protestant 
paramilitary groups -- said it was difficult to give a 
comprehensive and final response to the deal, but added that 
they viewed it sceptically. 
  A statement late last night said: "It is widely agreed that 
the declaration, despite its grand claims regarding consent 
freely given, is part of a wider agenda and once again ignores 
the reality that the status of Northern Ireland within the 
United Kingdom was substantially changed with the imposition of 
the Anglo-Irish diktat." 
  The statement claimed the Government had abdicated its 
responsibilities to protect Northern Ireland and its citizens. 
  In a final warning, the UFF statement added: "So long as 
pan-nationalist terror and political coercion continues, we 
retain the right to respond militarily in 1994."

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>
  [Text] Britain is on the road to more jobs and prosperity 
and "it is time to put the pessimists in their box," the Prime 
Minister said in an upbeat New Year message today. 
  John Major, in a wide-ranging letter to the chairmen of 
constituency Conservative parties, also underlined the 
Government's determination to crack down on crime, to reform 
education and to bring peace to Northern Ireland. 
  He insisted that the Tories remained the only party of low 
taxation and vowed that criminals would be made to pay for their 
crimes. 
  He also denounced those with "fashionable attitudes" about 
education which were light years away from common sense. 
  On the economy, he said: "As we start the New Year we can 
look forward with far greater confidence to a strengthening 
recovery -- and to the steady growth in jobs and prosperity that 
will come with it. 
  "After a difficult period for many people, we now have a 
tremendous opportunity before us. We are seeing 
stronger-than-expected growth combined with lower-than-expected 
inflation. 
  "It is time for us to be more confident as a country. To put 
the pessimists in their box. And to look at the opportunities 
before us and how to take them." 
  He added: "The plain fact is that we are leading Europe out 
of recession and we must build on the advantages that gives us. 
  "I want to build our recovery on sound foundations. I want a 
recovery that lasts." 
  He said the Government had to bring the books back into 
balance and although it had to raise revenue it had not put up 
income tax rates. 
  "The Conservative Party remains the party of the lowest 
possible tax and the only party whose instinct is to cut tax and 
leave money with individuals and families and not take it for 
the state. 
  "We raise taxes only when we have to. They (opposition 
parties) raise taxes whenever they want to." 
  The Prime Minister said there would be tough new measures 
against crime and legislation to return to traditional teaching 
methods. 
  "Never before has such a comprehensive effort been launched 
to ensure that we prevent crime, that we catch criminals and 
that the guilty are convicted and punished." 
  He added: "Our intention is to ensure that crime won't pay 
-- 
but criminals will." 
  Mr Major said children had to learn at school the basic 
skills they would need in later life. 
  As well as lessons to read and write and do sums, "they have 
to learn self-respect, respect for others and respect for 
authority." 
  "Every child at school should be taught good discipline and 
good self-discipline. Good order brings good learning," said Mr 
Major. 
  "Orderly classrooms, clear timetables, regular tests, 
homework, team sport and uniforms -- all these have a part to 
play in giving a sense of purpose and self-discipline to pupils. 
  "I do not believe such ideas are old-fashioned. I believe 
they are essential -- and so do millions of parents." 
  He stressed that children had to learn the difference 
between 
right and wrong. "If children are brought up in a moral vacuum, 
can it be any surprise if they later go off the rails? 
  "If we spend more time making excuses rather than 
apportioning blame, is it any wonder if young people can no 
longer tell right from wrong, but see everything through a kind 
of haze?" 
  He said many of the attitudes that took root in the 1960's 
and 1970's were very tolerant. "I admire tolerance...but if 
taken too far it does destroy standards. I believe there is a 
danger of that. 
  "Many fashionable attitudes are light years away from the 
common sense instincts of the British people -- and those we now 
have to challenge. 
  "And with our campaign to go Back to Basics, that is what we 
will be doing -- in our schools, criminal justice system, our 
welfare system and in the field of social work." 
  On Northern Ireland, Mr Major repeated that so long as the 
majority wanted to remain within the UK they had a rock-solid 
constitutional guarantee that they could do so. 
  "We also sent a clear message to the men of violence -- `If 
you lay down your arms -- and prove you mean it -- then the way 
will begin to open for Sinn Fein to come to the negotiating 
table.' 
  "We have thrown down the gauntlet of peace. So now the onus 
is on Sinn Fein to pick it up. There is no excuse and no 
justification for them not to choose the path to democracy." 
  The Prime Minister added: "I do not know whether the coming 
year will bring peace in Northern Ireland. But I hope and pray 
it does." 
  He claimed that in local government Labour and Liberal 
Democrat councils were getting away with monumental waste and 
incompetence, and said this year's elections to the European 
Parliament were especially important. 
  "We must send a signal that we want to carry on with the 
kind 
of agenda in Europe that Britain has been pushing. 
  "After June 9, I want to see more Conservative MEPs 
representing Britain's interests in the European Parliament. 
That is why we will fight these European elections harder than 
we ever have before."

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Einar Koch; </F>
place and date not given: "Kinkel -- Why I Would Meet With the 
Russian Hitler"] 
  [Text] [Koch] What is your greatest concern for 1994? 
  [Kinkel] My greatest concern continues to be the terrible 
killing, raping, and pointless devastation in former Yugoslavia. 
And, among numerous other conflicts in this world, I am worried 
by the areas of conflict in the former Soviet Union. 
  [Koch] Can you still get a good night's sleep when you think 
of the Russian fascist Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Kinkel] The way Zhirinovskiy behaves and makes comments 
leaves me with an unpleasant feeling. His behavior toward our 
consular official in Sofia is not acceptable. But we cannot 
ignore the fact that, judging by the number of people who voted 
for him, he evidently has support in Russia. He must be dealt 
with on a political level. This is primarily the task of the 
reformist forces in Russia, which we are still counting on. 
Just isolating him does not help. 
  My decision not to let Zhirinovskiy enter Germany for an 
18-day propaganda tour was necessary and correct. This, 
however, does not rule out a different decision in the future 
once a real political debate with Zhirinovskiy has been secured. 
I personally would not shy away from a discussion with him. 
  [Koch] The situation in Somalia is getting more and more 
dangerous. Should we not withdraw our troops as quickly as 
possible? 
  [Kinkel] We must not steal away from responsibility 
prematurely because of some isolated incidents. We have 
promised the United Nations that we will stay until 31 March. 
We will stand by our decision. In the future, we will have to 
carefully check whether, when, and how we are going to take part 
in such UN missions. The UN mission, and our mission, did not 
go terribly well. We will have to learn our lessons from that. 
But our troops have done an excellent humanitarian job. 
  [Koch] Are you afraid that the FDP [Free Democratic Party 
of Germany] might go under in the 1994 elections? 
  [Kinkel] No. I am convinced that we will stand our ground 
successfully. It must be our aim to achieve the best possible 
result in the Bundestag elections so that we will again be 
needed for forming a government. 
  [Koch] Do you know yet by whom? 
  [Kinkel] I am against coalition statements at the wrong 
time. We will decide before each of the 18 elections whether we 
will make such a statement, when we will do it, and what we are 
going to say. What happens after the Bundestag election is up to 
the voters. 
  [Koch] Will Mrs. Hamm-Bruecher remain the FDP's candidate 
for president? 
  [Kinkel] We nominated Mrs. Hamm-Bruecher as FDP candidate 
with an overwhelming majority. She is not a pawn who can be 
exchanged at will.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- In the view of Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl, Germany has made much progress on its way to internal 
unity in the three years since unification. However, people 
still need to show "care, patience, and understanding for each 
other's life and experiences" in their dealings with one 
another, Kohl said in his New Year address broadcast by Deutsche 
Welle. After all, over 40 years of division has "left deep 
marks." 
  The chancellor warned against any form of national 
arrogance. 
In Germany, love of the fatherland and an open-minded way of 
thinking must never again go separate ways, he said. This is 
the lesson the Germans must learn from their history. Kohl 
added: "Those who fan the flames of xenophobia cannot claim to 
be German patriots." 
  The chancellor once again voiced his support for the process 
of European unification. The future of the Germans in peace and 
freedom will always be closely linked with this. Kohl 
emphasized: "The unification of Europe is a fateful matter for a 
united Germany." He also affirmed Germany's willingness to make 
its contribution to safeguarding peace and stability in the 
world. In future Germany wants to "participate without 
restrictions in the peacekeeping and peacemaking measures of the 
United Nations. 
  Kohl added that, despite economic problems and the need to 
consolidate the budget, Germany accepts its responsibility 
toward the developing countries. Here the emphasis would be 
more on the poorer developing countries and states "that are 
making serious efforts to introduce political and economic 
reform, and which above all respect human rights." 
  The deep changes in Russia are also a great challenge, the 
chancellor stressed. Despite all concern and the necessary 
vigilance with regard to the strong result for extremist forces 
in the Russian parliamentary elections, there is no reason to 
change the policy of supporting the reform process in the 
country.

<F P=106> [Article by Chancellor Kohl: "The Structural Problems </F>
Require a Major Stocktaking by the Economy and Society"] 
  [Text] In the course of this outgoing year we have laid a 
solid foundation for the work to be done next year and for 
preserving and improving our country's future opportunities. In 
the fourth year since regaining unity, Germany is faced with 
great challenges. It is these challenges to which I want to 
dedicate all my power. Our central task for the coming year 
will be to secure existing jobs and to create new ones. For 
this reason, we must do everything we can to overcome the 
present recession and to change outdated structures -- wherever 
this is necessary. 
  Later than most other countries, we felt the full impact of 
worldwide recession in 1993. At the end of the year, however, 
economic figures are encouraging again. In the second and third 
quarters, GNP in the old laender increased slightly. The 
Bundesbank has voiced expectations that "the bottom of recession 
seems to have been reached, if not passed." Experience shows 
that even after an upswing has started, it will take some time 
for its positive effects to be felt in the labor market. 
  And what is more, like many other countries, we are not just 
faced with "normal" recession. Structural problems have been 
building up in the economy and in society for some time. A 
major stocktaking is required of the economy and society if we 
want to maintain our favorable position in the international 
competition for business locations. High growth rates and more 
than 3 million new jobs created over the last few years may have 
induced many sectors not to make the necessary adjustments to 
changing competition structures. This has brought about a need 
to act, which is now increasingly being felt. This means: 
Waiting for an economic upswing is not enough. 
  In early September, the Federal Government, therefore, 
passed 
its report on how to secure Germany as a business location. It 
pointed out the priorities and areas where there is a concrete 
need for action. We need new approaches in matters of wage 
costs, working hours, education, research, and technology. 
Public reaction to the report has been encouraging. Industry 
and society will have to rethink. It has become very clear that 
this is necessary. Now we need to follow up the correct 
diagnosis by a suitable therapy. All groups of society will 
have to contribute their share in this. 
  The framework conditions for employment are mainly created 
by 
the wage agreement partners. They have the power to give 
employment and jobs priority over everything else. By 
introducing flexible working hours, machine operating times can 
be extended and more part-time jobs can be created. Like other 
industrial countries, we must finally manage to increase the 
number of part-time jobs offered. Opinion polls indicate that 
the demand for part-time jobs is much higher than the supply. 
All over Germany, almost 2.5 million full-time employees would 
prefer to work part-time. By establishing new and flexible 
employment models, an enormous potential of additional jobs 
could be opened up. 
  It is the Federal Government's central task to secure the 
basis for growth and employment by continuing its consolidation 
policy. Next year, by enforcing cuts amounting to double-digit 
billion German mark [DM] figures, we will be 5 percent below the 
estimated budget. These are excellent preconditions for a 
further decrease in interest rates, a stable currency, and an 
uninterrupted flow of foreign capital into our country. As far 
as the inflation rate goes, we are back to a three before the 
decimal point. 
  The Federal Government also took action in several other 
important areas. Let me just mention two examples: The new law 
on work times, which has been presented to the Bundestag for 
debate, enables wage round parties and their partners to have 
new, more flexible working hours and longer machine-operating 
hours. The law on securing Germany as a business location cuts 
taxes on companies' profits and thus encourages industry to make 
investments in order to create new jobs. With these measures we 
have now achieved the lowest such taxes since the FRG was 
established. 
  These markedly improved framework conditions will now have 
to 
be made use of quickly by authorities and industry, employers 
and trade unions, with the aim of creating additional jobs. We 
will intensify the necessary talks with the relevant groups, 
establishing what each of them can and must do to secure 
existing jobs and create new jobs in order to cut unemployment. 
  Beside securing existing jobs and creating new ones, the 
completion of Germany's internal unity will be our central task. 
The year 1993 saw great progress in this respect. According to 
the Bundesbank, there is an increasing upward trend being felt 
in eastern Germany. It increasingly includes east German 
industry, which is going through a particularly difficult 
process of adjustments. 
  In spite of recession in the west, the dynamics of 
investment 
in the east continues. Public per capita investment in eastern 
Germany was 137 percent of the west German rate in 1993, 
corporate investments were at 109 percent. This shows clearly 
that the catching-up process in the new laender has gained 
momentum. We are also making good progress in housing. At some 
75,000, the number of building permits granted in 1993 was more 
than double the 1992 figure. 
  What is particularly pleasing is that job cuts seem to have 
largely come to a halt in 1993. Meanwhile, the number of new 
jobs being created equals the number of old, unprofitable ones 
being cut in other areas. Thus, unemployment in eastern Germany 
went down in November, while it increased in western Germany for 
seasonal and economic reasons. 
  In our active labor policy, we have spent well over DM100 
billion since 1991 on social adjustments for the people in 
eastern Germany. Last year, we could thus help 1.7 million 
people who would otherwise have lost their jobs. 
  We increased pensions in the new laender quite fast. In 
mid-1990, pensions in eastern Germany were between DM470 and 
DM602. From 1 January 1994, a citizen who worked for 45 years 
and had an average income will get more than DM1,400 in pension 
payments. Thus, pensions have increased from one-third to some 
75 percent of West German standards. In 1993, we were once 
again able to offer a sufficient education and training program 
for the young generation in the new laender. Our training 
initiative provided more than 10,000 training facilities other 
than in companies. 
  These are a number of successes, but we have no reason to 
lean back complacently because of these successes. In the 
coming year we will have to do everything we can to make new 
investors and their capital and markets find their way to the 
new laender. In 1994, public budgets, led by the federal 
budget, will continue to support the catching-up process of the 
new laender, with transfers amounting to triple-digit billion 
mark sums. 
  Our economy very much depends on exports -- and this 
includes 
jobs all over Germany. That is why we have consistently 
supplemented structural reforms in our own country by our 
efforts to help liberalize world trade and advance European 
integration. 
  The GATT agreement signed in mid-December is the most 
comprehensive liberalization package of the past decades. This 
great success will particularly stimulate the German economy and 
employment. 
  The political unification of Europe will determine our 
future 
in peace and liberty. As the country with the highest number of 
neighbors in Europe, we Germans have a vital interest in 
preventing a relapse into the power rivalries of former times, 
into the selfishness of national states, and into changing 
coalitions. The political keynote created by Konrad Adenauer, 
who said that German unity and European unification are two 
sides of the same coin, is still valid. 
  At the beginning of November, the Maastricht Treaty came 
into 
force. Frankfurt am Main will become the headquarters of the 
European Monetary Institute, and of the European Central Bank at 
a later date. This is a convincing sign of confidence in our 
policy of stability, and it encourages us to continue our course 
with determination. 
  In the second half of 1994, Germany will take on the 
presidency of the European Union. We will use this period to 
speed up the process of European unification. I can see four 
areas where we will have to concentrate our efforts in this 
process: 
  1. Joint steps toward securing Europe as a business location 
and to ensure growth and employment in the Union, as was already 
emphasized by the European Council in December; 
  2. The application of the principle of subsidiarity, which 
will be a regular topic at European Council meetings in future, 
thanks to my efforts; 
  3. The implementation of the first plan of action to 
increase cooperation in internal and legal policy, in particular 
the establishing of the European police authority Europol; 
  4. The expansion of a joint foreign and security policy. 
  During the next few years we will be faced with the great 
tasks of completing German unity, advancing European 
integration, and of preparing the reunited Germany for a future 
in a world that has changed profoundly. I have no doubt that we 
will successfully tackle these problems.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Kurt Kister: "Clinton's Astonishing Comeback"] </F>
  [Text] On 20 January 1993, Bill Clinton swore his oath of 
office. One month afterwards, renowned commentators declared 
the administration to be a premature birth without any marked 
prospects for survival. Already, during the first week, the 
newly installed President had caused a storm with his 
ill-considered attempt to lift the ban against homosexuals in 
the U.S. Army. Then one blow followed after the other: 
Candidates for important offices were rejected; strong words on 
Haiti and Bosnia during the election campaign were not followed 
by the promised deeds; the new team in the White House was 
extremely clumsy. The man, whom almost two-thirds of all 
Americans trusted -- even though only 43 percent had voted for 
him -- seemed to flounder like a leaking ship. 
  How times change! Today Bill Clinton is a President who has 
managed to achieve the most important thing within 12 months: 
America feels better again. Hardly any other master in the 
White House after 1945 has caused as many things to move in as 
many fields as Clinton. In this he is similar to -- and this 
makes conservatives complain -- Ronald Reagan, the great 
changer. And even more: He is popular. After Clinton's 
popularity rates rose and fell like a roller-coaster, they have 
now almost reached the level of 20 January again. About 60 
percent attest that he is doing good work. One-fifth even 
declare Clinton to be the person they admire most -- far ahead 
of family members or other authorities. 
  What are the successes? First of all, there is the economy. 
For 1994, a growth rate like the one in 1988 is predicted, 
which is better than for a long time. Prices are stable, the 
people have confidence in their future and spend more money, on 
consumer goods and investments. At Christmas, business 
purchases with credit cards rose by 25 percent -- an unambiguous 
sign that the people incur debts, because they are confident 
that they will be able to pay them. Because confidence is 
higher and interest rates are still low, more Americans are 
buying houses and cars. This creates satisfaction and 
stimulates economic development. 
  Critics claim that all this is a success Clinton has been 
given for free; the economy would have recovered with or without 
Clinton. The opposite cannot be proved, but it is a fact that 
the economic climate has clearly improved since the narrow vote 
in favor of Clinton's budget and has not deteriorated as the 
Republicans predicted pessimistically. Another important sign 
is that the annual budget deficit will go down. While, in 1992, 
Bush's economists predicted a deficit of about $300 billion for 
1994, now it seems that the deficit will go down to about $200 
billion in 1994. This is due to the recovery of the economy, 
but also to Clinton's thrift measures. Bill Clinton does what 
Reagan and Bush only promised: The deficit really goes down. 
The debts and the economy were the most important topics of the 
election campaign. Clinton has not disappointed his voters. 
  This range of topics also includes the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, NAFTA, and the world trade agreement GATT. 
With great skill, Clinton brought together a coalition of 
Republicans and Democrats, who pushed the controversial NAFTA 
treaty through Congress. Even though the president had to 
primarily struggle against his own party, he turned out to be a 
politician with leadership power, who enforces principles, if 
necessary also against his friends. Regarding the GATT 
conclusion, the Americans under Clinton and chief negotiator 
Kantor also acted skillfully and, in the end, correctly. A 
pleasant side effect of the NAFTA affair was that the charlatan 
Ross Perot was deflated -- above all by Al Gore, the most 
influential vice president of the recent past. 
  There are still a number of other things, for instance a new 
weapons law, which Bush and Reagan always blocked; a security 
package, which will bring, among other things, 100,000 
additional policemen to the streets of the cities; a law that 
permits young people to work their university loans off through 
some kind of alternative national service. And the Clintons, 
with First Lady Hillary at the head, have started the struggle 
for a general health insurance. If this struggle were to show 
success in 1994, this could become a piece of reform that can be 
compared only with the introduction of compulsory social 
insurance more than 50 years ago. 
  And what about foreign policy? Everyone knows the traps in 
Somalia, Haiti, North Korea, Bosnia, and Russia. Clinton's men 
sometimes stumbled, also because they were so inexperienced in 
international matters. However, the team is consolidating 
itself. The change in the Pentagon is one sign of that; Strobe 
Talbott's appointment as Warren Christopher's deputy is another. 
Europe must get used to the fact that this administration no 
longer claims superiority in all issues, that it defines 
national interest more narrowly and is, therefore, more careful 
with interventions -- political and military ones. One must 
never forget: Bill Clinton has been elected because he is 
supposed to reestablish America's trust in itself. This is the 
yardstick by which the President and his voters measure success 
or failure.

  [Excerpts] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl has 
promised to back the Armed Forces in the dispute over the 
equipping and functions of the Bundeswehr. [passage omitted] 
Kohl announced on the private Berlin channel Hundert,6 [as 
received] today that the Bundeswehr would continue to receive 
the means necessary to fulfill its functions. While it could 
not be excepted from savings measures, its efficiency could not 
be jeopardized in the process, he said. Kohl described 
proposals to reduce further or even do away with the Bundeswehr 
as "foolish." "Those who look attentively at the world know 
that the security situation is not improving," the chancellor 
said. In this context he mentioned the events in the Balkans

<F P=106> [Report signed "vp": "Civilian Air Traffic Control Office </F>
Takes Over Control of Airspace in the East"] 
  [Excerpt] Berlin -- The withdrawal of Russian troops, 
including the Air Force, from the new laender, is taking place 
faster than expected. AS of 1 January, the civilian air traffic 
control office will be fully responsible for controlling the 
airspace over east Germany. Its modernization will involve 
millions of marks. 
  Since the 16th Air Force unit was transferred recently to 
somewhere near Moscow, only two fighter aircraft units and one 
fighter bomber unit, which are deployed at the airports of 
Damgarten near Rostock, of Wittstock, and Templin, will remain 
on the territory of the former German Democratic Republic [GDR]. 
These units will probably also be transferred to Russia by June 
next year. The flight formations include Russian military 
helicopters that are operating at the bases of Mahwinkel south 
of Stendhal and of Oranienburg. 
  Before the collapse of the communist regime, the Soviet 
Armed 
Force and the National People's Army (NVA) used 35 military 
airports. Approximately 6,500 military flights took place every 
day over the territory of the former GDR. One year ago, the 
Russian air fleet was reduced to 400 combat aircraft and 450 
helicopters that still operated from 14 airports and carried out 
1,000 flights daily. Currently, there are 250 flights per week 
by the approximately 120 jets, and about 100 flights by the 90 
helicopters. 
  Of the 35 military airports, the Bundeswehr wants to use a 
maximum of five. The MiG-29, taken over from the NVA, will be 
stationed in Laage near Rostock, and a unit of Phantom fighters 
will be transferred from Hersfeld to Laage. A total of 45 
planes will be deployed in Laage for the control of the air 
space. There are plans -- but no decision has been made -- to 
station a transport unit in Holzdorf south of Jueterborg that is 
to be removed from Wuensdorf near Hanover. The Bundeswehr has 
helicopter airports in Cottbus and Basepohl near Neubrandenburg, 
and the Navy has concentrated its helicopters in Parow near 
Stralsund. 
  As a result of the withdrawal of the Russian Air Force, the 
Airspace Coordination Office of the Bundeswehr has been 
considerably reduced. When the military air traffic control in 
Germany is integrated into the German Civilian Air Control GmbH 
on 1 January, the military air controllers of the Bundeswehr 
will be given leave and will work for the German Civilian Air 
Control GmbH. At present, the military air controllers who 
control the airspace in the new laender are sitting next to the 
civilian ones at Tempelhof Airport. The Airspace Coordination 
Office of the Bundeswehr will then be dissolved. 
  A new air control system for Berlin and the new laender is 
currently being built; it will be based at Tempelhof Airport. 
This involves 150 million German marks. At the beginning of the 
winter timetable in autumn 1994, the new system is to start 
operating. The German Civilian Air Control GmbH will then be 
able to offer new routings, new approaching methods, new 
overflight possibilities, shorter routes, fewer delays, more 
capacities, and shorter flying times in its sphere. The new 
system will be responsible for the entire air traffic in the new 
laender and for the landings and departures at the airports of 
Leipzig, Dresden, and Erfurt. 
  In the offices above the large check-in hall at Tempelhof 
Airport, which comprise about 900 square meters and which have 
so far been used by the U.S. Air Force for observing the 
European air and radio traffic, work stations for 74 air 
controllers will be created. At the same time, the control 
towers in Tegel, Tempelhof, and Schoenefeld will be equipped 
with new instruments, and additional radar and navigation 
instruments will be installed to ensure a three-fold radar 
control. New flight routes make it possible to intensify the 
east-west and the north-south traffic over Berlin. 
  With the opening of the new control center, the transition 
period will end that started with the restoration of Germany's 
full sovereignty on 3 October 1990. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- At the end of 1993, three 
years after the Russian Western Group (WGT) began to withdraw 
troops from Germany, there were only 30,000 soldiers of the 
former Eastern victorious power left in eastern Germany. That 
is less than 10 percent of the 337,800 troops stationed here at 
the beginning of 1991. 
  Major General Hartmut Foertsch, the Federal Government 
official in charge of the withdrawal and head of the German 
liaison command for the WGT, told DDP/ADN in an interview that 
the former First Strategic Echelon of the Soviet Army and the 
Warsaw Pact was withdrawing from Germany "according to plan."

<F P=106> [Editorial by Lothar Ruehl: "A Step Toward NATO"] </F>
  [Text] The prospect of Central Europe's association with 
the Atlantic security area is opening up on the horizon of the 
NATO summit early in 1994. Has a "window of favorable 
opportunities" been opened -- as was the case in 1989 for 
Germany's unification -- which could be closed again under the 
pressure of internal developments in Russia? Or are stable 
conditions emerging that could guarantee for Russia's western 
neighbors independence in secure borders? 
  Boris Yeltsin suggested to the NATO states in October a 
common security guarantee in "partnership" for the former USSR 
allies as an alternative to their "selective admission" to the 
alliance. But security partnership between NATO and the Russian 
Federation is only one side of the problem to create stability 
and security in the East. The other side is the relationship of 
NATO with the countries that do not want to return to the 
dangerous insecurity of an "interim Europe" (1919-39). 
  The consequence must not be -- as Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev warned -- "a new cordon sanitaire" to isolate Russia, 
with a relapse into "bloc mentality." Vaclav Havel has adopted 
a counterposition that is shared by Lech Walesa. Responding to 
the thesis of Russian Intelligence Chief Primakov, who has said 
that Russia would be threatened by "an advance of NATO's 
military might to the Russian borders," Havel said that NATO's 
coming closer to Russia's border would not mean that "an enemy 
is approaching, but a sphere of democracy and stability." 
  The NATO Council will have to draft a strategy to create a 
firm relationship of at least four East Central European states 
with NATO and connect these with a more comprehensive peace 
partnership that would include Russia. Without these two 
connections -- that of East Central Europe with the Atlantic 
security area and that of Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic states, 
and southeastern Europe in a pan-European framework with NATO -- 
it will not be possible to set up a "security architecture" on 
solid ground. 
  The NATO defense ministers have formulated the principles 
for 
the North Atlantic Council in this sense in four main points. 
In this respect, the German concept that was expounded by 
Volker Ruehe as the spokesman for the European group has been 
generally accepted: 
  1. The enlargement of NATO must be seen as a political 
principle in a process and must be opened up as a prospect, 
without individual countries being mentioned as applicants, and 
without a timeframe being set up. 
  2. The concept of Partnership for Peace is interpreted as a 
useful first step but not as a substitute for subsequent 
admission to NATO. 
  3. Russia will not be given the right of veto against the 
admission of other European states to NATO or the Western 
European Union [WEU]. Any consideration for legitimate Russian 
security interests must be brought into line with the legitimate 
security requirements of Russia's western neighbors. 
  4. Solving the problem through the association of Poland, 
Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia with the WEU can only 
be a temporary arrangement and interim step toward subsequent 
NATO membership; it can be no substitute. Such an association 
cannot be as close as that of the NATO members with the WEU, 
which take part in common defense and are members of NATO's 
military structures. 
  Moreover, an enlargement of the WEU would increase its 
political importance outside NATO, instead of inside NATO as a 
"European pillar" of the alliance. Should NATO refuse to open 
up to the countries in the East, they will urge membership 
within the WEU. The result would be an increasing 
differentiation between NATO and the WEU, which now form a 
closed alliance system. To the extent that countries would be 
admitted to the WEU because NATO would remain closed to them, 
both parts of the Western alliance would develop and move away 
from each other. To the extent that the WEU would assume 
functions for "broader security" in East Europe and take over 
functions to "preserve peace" in Europe in crises by military 
means, whereas NATO would remain passively in reserve, the 
Atlantic alliance would lose in importance for European security 
-- and the reason for the United States to get involved in the 
defense of Western Europe would decrease as well. NATO cannot 
split up into two treaty areas -- a security area of common 
defense, and an area for security policy consultations -- 
without jeopardizing its unity. 
  Thus, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher demanded at 
the NATO Council meeting on 2 December regarding the summit 
statement to be adopted on 11 January 1994: "We should signal 
that we are considering an evolutionary enlargement. Our most 
important task will be to say how the alliance will be enlarged 
to the East." He added: "It is true that Partnership for Peace 
is an important step in itself, but it can also be a key act for 
NATO membership."

  [Text] Oberndorf (DDP/ADN) -- The Baden-Wuerttemberg arms 
factory Heckler und Koch denied a report in the London daily 
INDEPENDENT that the firm allegedly supplied rifles to Serbia in 
1992 despite the UN arms embargo. Company spokeswoman Andrea 
Franke stated today in Oberndorf that Heckler und Koch only 
exported hunting rifles to former Yugoslavia with the necessary 
approval in the early 1980's. This would not come under the 
arms embargo, she said. 
  According to the London paper, the Serbian authorities have 
confirmed that the arms factory supplied G3 weapons to Belgrade. 
The spokeswoman stressed that the company could not understand 
how these weapons, which come under the embargo, had come to be 
in former Yugoslavia. The newspaper's information is "untrue." 
Heckler und Kohl had "at no time" supplied arms to the war zone. 
  The British arms manufacturer Royal Ordnance, which has 
belonged to British Aerospace since 1987, bought the 
Baden-Wuerttemberg factory in 1991. According to the paper, 
there were extensive contacts between the two firms before this 
time, however. The paper said that the British arms company 
acted as a kind of "mediator" and helped to export arms to the 
former GDR. The weapons were first transported from Oberndorf 
to London and from there shipped to Rostock. Heckler und Koch 
weapons have also been found in Nicaragua. Heckler and Koch 
were able to circumvent German export laws through the contacts 
with Royal Ordnance, the INDEPENDENT said.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DDP/ADN) -- In the run-up to 
establishing the European Monetary Institute (EMI) in 
Frankfurt/Main on 11 January, Gerd Haller, state secretary at 
the Finance Ministry, underscored the political framework for 
the EMI's activity. Haller stressed today on Hesse Radio that 
"from a German viewpoint there is absolutely no question" that 
the Bundesbank's monetary policy "will be influenced in some 
way" via the EMI. The state secretary said that one essential 
function of the EMI will be to coordinate monetary policy 
between the member states in keeping with a policy of stability, 
without detriment to the autonomy of the member states. He 
stressed that the Bundesbank remains "entirely free" with regard 
to its monetary policy. Another function is the EMI's 
preparation of a common European currency for the third phase of 
monetary union, which will be realized in a few years' time. 
  Haller pointed out that the functions and competences of the 
EMI have been finally laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. "It 
goes without saying that we, and I believe the Bundesbank too, 
will not allow the Institute to go beyond the competences 
clearly outlined there," he stressed. 
  The state secretary expressed his lack of understanding for 
the stance otaken by Spain, Portugal, and Greece in wanting to 
exclude Austria, Sweden, Norway, and Finland -- the prospective 
newcomers to the European Union -- from the development of 
monetary union. "We cannot accept this demand from the German 
point of view." 
  It is important for Germany that monetary union is achieved. 
Open markets without monetary borders bring many advantages, 
said Haller, pointing out that many German jobs are dependent on 
exports.

<F P=106> [Report signed "for": "Rexrodt Expects New Problems in 1994 </F>
as a Result of Increase in Unemployment"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free 
Democratic Party of Germany) views halting the reduction of jobs 
and promoting the creation of new employment as his major tasks 
in 1994. In an interim report on the government's activities to 
ensure Germany's attractiveness as an economic base, published 
on Tuesday [28 December], Rexrodt expressed confidence that the 
process of recovery will continue and intensify next year. 
However, a rise in unemployment and "considerable employment 
problems" are to be expected. 
  It became increasingly clear at the end of the year that the 
economy has bottomed out, the minister stressed when he 
presented the report. A growth of 0.5 to 1 percent is possible 
in west Germany next year, and a growth of 7.5 percent is 
possible in east Germany. Yet employment will certainly drop in 
the old laender. Even once the recession is overcome, a 
relatively high level of unemployment is to be expected, in 
particular because of the structural problems. 
  Germany's economic policy will concentrate on these problems 
in 1994. Profitable new jobs be created in Germany only by 
overcoming the structural difficulties. An efficient labor 
market policy continues to be absolutely necessary. It must 
accompany the "tremendous structural changes" in the new laender 
and ease the impact of the economic stagnation on the western 
labor market. Rexrodt vehemently rejected initiatives to shorten 
working hours. Efforts to solve the employment problem by 
redistributing the existing work are the "wrong economic 
concept." 
  The program of action to fight structural unemployment, 
adopted by the cabinet in September, will be given "absolute 
priority" in the next few years. The Federal Government alone 
will implement about 80 measures in this legislative period. 
One-third of the work has already been completed. Substantial 
progress has been achieved in numerous spheres. To create a 
broad social basis for further measures designed to ensure 
Germany's attractiveness as an economic location, Rexrodt plans 
to organize a "location forum" in Bonn on 8 and 9 February to 
"overcome the prevailing thinking in terms of old rights and 
group interests." 
  Hans Peter Stihl, president of the Federation of German 
Chambers of Industry and Commerce, strongly criticized the 
initiatives that the Federal Government has taken so far. He 
demanded "clearer signals of the world economy" for next year. 
The super election year must not become a "year of economic 
rhetorics but a year of deeds." If the government's report on 
efforts to ensure Germany's attractiveness as an industrial 
location remains pure theory, the enterprises will not receive 
stimuli and become frustrated. A reversal of the current 
economic trend will only take place if the readiness for 
investments increases in the economy. However, so far there can 
be no talk of a reversal. The government must not shy away from 
"very painful cutbacks," particularly in the sphere of social 
benefits. 
  The German Association of Savings Banks has rejected general 
economic pessimism. The opportunities for a recovery in the 
middle of 1994 have improved, but the recovery will not be very 
strong. It is decisive for Germany to become internationally 
more competitive again as far as costs and products are 
concerned. Over the short term, a moderate wage policy is also 
necessary. A policy aimed at ensuring the level of real wages 
in 1994 would certainly endanger jobs in the industry and have a 
negative impact on investments at home, the association stressed.

<F P=106> [Report signed "rwue": "Issing: The Tanker Sets Course"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt, 28 December -- Bundesbank Directorate 
member and chief economist Professor Otmar Issing said in an 
interview with this newspaper that everything indicates that 
next year we will take a large step forward toward reducing the 
rate of inflation. In the meantime, a two will appear before 
the decimal point in the current rate. Such a favorable figure 
will, however, not be the rule. 
  The Bundesbank's inflation projections are based on the 
assumption that the oil price will not increase considerably. 
Nothing indicates at this point that it will. In addition to 
the oil price, the exchange rate constitutes another short-term 
factor of uncertainty. If no problems emerge here, further 
progress on the inflation front is likely, because wage policy 
in particular is currently moving in the right direction, says 
the Bundesbank chief economist. 
  Issing compared the German national economy with a large 
unwieldy tanker that needs a lot of time to change course. In 
1991, the tanker moved in the totally wrong direction. With 
business and industry booming, the problems that were known at 
that time were not reflected in the pay settlements. As a 
result of German unity, the labor-capital ratio has dramatically 
changed in favor of the factor of capital. Acting against 
economic realities will, in particular, be punished with higher 
unemployment. In 1992, the corrections made were also 
inadequate. Meanwhile, the groups involved in the economic 
process have recognized the symptoms of our times. Corrections 
are being made everywhere. So the tanker has set course. The 
upcoming pay negotiations for civil servants will have a 
signalling effect. 
<H5>  Additional Wage Costs! </H5>
  In view of the costs involved of approximately 80 percent, 
one should not speak about ancillary wage costs but about 
additional wage costs, said Issing. The Bundesbank already uses 
this more accurate term in its monthly reports. Given the high 
additional costs, nothing can be expected over the short term. 
On the contrary, in addition to an increase in old age pension 
contributions, there is a possibility of nursing care insurance. 
All sides concerned must be deeply aware that the introduction 
of the nursing care insurance means that the end of the pole has 
been reached for this decade. Regarding burdens through 
additional wage costs, the other direction must be pursued again. 
<H5>  Stabilizing Services </H5>
  According to Issing, the cycle has probably reached the 
nadir. The service sector is increasingly gaining in importance 
as a stabilizing factor. In certain industrial branches, 
however, the picture is still very gloomy. In interpreting the 
current economic data, one should not exaggerate. In many 
cases, a number of positive signals are interspersed with 
negative ones. For instance, retail trade sales declined in 
October. Export orders increased, whereas inland orders 
decreased. Above all, the German labor market will show a 
downturn for quite a while. 
  The Bundesbank will continue to keep to its 
potential-oriented money-supply policy, which has an implicitly 
stabilizing effect. With a weak economic cycle, a policy that is 
oriented toward the growth of the potential will always lead to 
a good money supply. However, when capacities are fully used, 
the lack of money will have a decelerating effect -- especially 
on the price level. The Bundesbank assumes that high investment 
activities in eastern Germany will continue in 1994. This will 
also clearly increase the potential of the eastern federal 
laender. The Bundesbank is taking the new money supply target 
for 1994 seriously. Even though it expected to miss the target, 
it also took the planned money supply target for 1993 seriously, 
said Issing. Regarding individual interest policy measures, the 
considerable credit expansion has always made caution advisable. 
The Bundesbank's money supply policy has above all proved 
successful in difficult times. With a decrease from clearly over 
7 percent to 6.8 percent in October, it seemed that M3 was 
moving along the right track. However, the November result, with 
a plus of 7.2 percent on an annual basis, was a flash in the pan. 
<H5>  Revival of Savings Bank Books </H5>
  Among all the factors influencing M3, credit expansion, 
which 
has been unusually high for a recession, plays the most 
important role. This credit expansion is above all attributable 
to subsidized credits for eastern Germany and credits for 
housing construction. In addition, the development of savings 
deposits with a three-month term of notice has played a major 
part since the summer. Because savings certificates are 
virtually dead, owing to the interest yield tax, savings bank 
books have become attractive again. Banks have an interest in 
keeping savers, above all with a view to Principle II of the 
Credit Law. This is being done through savings deposits on 
which bonuses are granted. 
<H5>  Eastern Europe Increases Circulation of Cash </H5>
  The development of the circulation of cash corresponded to 
Bundesbank estimates until the summer. Subsequently, it 
increased steeply, showing a monthly rate of over 15 percent. 
Very many things indicate that this is attributable to an 
increased use of the German mark in Central and Eastern Europe. 
Presumably the fact that the new German mark notes are more 
forgery-proof than the dollar also plays a role. This increase 
in the circulation of cash could distort the short-term result; 
over the long term, the effect distorts little, because contrary 
to the previous indicator -- the Bundesbank money supply -- the 
share of the circulation of cash in M3 is rather small. 
<H5>  Keeping To M3 </H5>
  Without intervention in the European Monetary System [EMS], 
there was a swing from October to November of 40 billion German 
marks [DM] in the net foreign position. In this respect, it 
could have been of importance that national, private, and public 
institutions (not the Federal Government) built credit stocks 
[Vorratskredite], parked them in the Euro market, and 
repatriated them in November. This example shows the close 
substitute relationship between Euro deposits and M3 in the 
traditional delimitation. However, the Bundesbank notes that M3 
expanded is inferior to M3. This is, however, a point where 
every money supply delimitation has become more sensitive. 
<H5>  Breach in the System </H5>
  Because the Federal Government is no longer obliged to 
deposit funds with the Bundesbank, there will be a new situation 
regarding the M3 system next year. Since the federal assets, 
which so far have not formed part of the money supply, will now 
be invested in the money market, there will be a basic effect of 
half a percentage point with M3. Statistically, it can be 
easily coped with. However, M3 monthly rates could be influenced 
by the Federal Government's way of acting. The question above 
all is what the Federal Government will, in the future, be doing 
with its cash funds. The Bundesbank will watch M3 in its 
traditional delimitation and M3 including Federal Government 
assets. Many factors make it advisable to keep federal assets 
out of M3. The Bundesbank will deal with this problem in its 
monthly report of January. Issing said that this is a technical 
rather than a monetary policy problem.

  [Text] Paris, Dec 30 (AFP) -- Two Iranians wanted by the 
Swiss authorities for the murder of an Iranian opposition leader 
have been expelled to Iran "for reasons of national interest", 
the prime minister's office said here late Thursday [30 
December]. 
  Mohsen Sharif Esfahani, 37, and Ahmad Taheri, 32, were 
expelled Wednesday, said the office of French Premier Edouard 
Balladur. 
  The pair were suspected of involvement in the April 1990 
murder near Geneva of Kazem Rajavi, brother of Mas'ud Rajavi, 
leader of the People's Mujahidin, an armed group opposed to the 
Iranian authorities.

  [Text] Switzerland has reacted strongly to the French 
decision to deport two Iranians to Iran. Berne has said that it 
was very surprised and that it regretted the French decision. 
The two men are suspected by the Swiss authorities of having 
assassinated Kazem Rajavi, Iranian opposition figure and brother 
of the leader of the People's Mujahidin. Behzad Naziri, 
spokesman of this movement, has also protested to the French 
authorities and spoke to (Olivier Dalage): 
  [Begin Naziri recording] Above all, we would like to 
register 
a strong protest, which was in fact addressed by Mr. Mas'ud 
Rajavi, leader of the Iranian resistance, to the French Foreign 
Ministry, for not handing over the murderers of his brother, 
Professor Kazem Rajavi, to the Swiss authorities, and sending 
them back to Iran. This is a very great concession to the 
mullahs in power in Iran. The Swiss magistrate investigating the 
murder of Mr. Kazem Rajavi, representative of the Iranian 
resistance at the United Nations, was seeking 13 terrorists who 
had been dispatched by Iran. Out of these 13, these two were in 
prison in France. This decision is a flagrant violation of the 
decision of the French courts, which had decided to approve the 
extradition, and of the Swiss courts, which had requested the 
extradition of these murderers to bring them to trial. [end 
recording] 
  Former Iranian President Bani Sadr has also reacted. He has 
expressed his shock and indignation at the decision. He accused 
Interior Minister Charles Pasqua of being, I quote, hand in hand 
with the Iranian mullahs.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with French European Affairs Minister </F>
Alain Lamassoure by correspondent Albert du Roy; from the "Hour 
of Truth" program -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Du Roy] Mr. Lamassoure, I am 
afraid that you might find my question unpleasant rather than 
intelligent. I would like to speak on the theme of the Iranians 
[deported to Iran by France]. You said that this was a matter 
of national interest. National interest is not far from reason 
of state, and the experience we have of this around the world 
and in history shows that reason of state is rarely legitimate. 
My question is: On such an affair, how long can one carry on 
without giving a substantial explanation? 
  [Lamassoure] We shall see how things turn out. Where the 
fight against international terrorism is concerned, there are 
times when it is preferable to keep silent. Believe me, Albert 
du Roy, everyone will understand. 
  [du Roy] So this is a matter of international terrorism. 
Please reassure us that it has nothing to do with economic 
interests. 
  [Lamassoure] No, absolutely not. It is matter of national 
interest. 
  [du Roy] A last very simple question on this subject: I 
suppose that The Interior Minister Pasqua is happy with the 
Government's decision? 
  [Lamassoure] The decision was made by the relevant 
authorities. Each played his role within the framework of the 
institutions of the Fifth Republic. 
  [du Roy] So we are no longer trying to terrorize the 
terrorists? 
  [Lamassoure] We are fighting against terrorism 
energetically. 
  [du Roy] Another theme I would like to speak about is 
Russia. 
[passage omitted] In the program of Mr. Zhirinovsky, who has 
emerged as the great winner of the Russian elections, there are 
elements which are clearly imperialistic, even warlike, and 
there are racist elements. If democracy were to bring him to 
power, would French aid continue? 
  [Lamassoure] Two things: First, Mr. Zhirinovsky is not the 
great winner of the last Russian elections. [passage omitted] 
Second, it is quite clear that we cannot tolerate the kind of 
comments that Mr. Zhirinovsky has been making. 
  [du Roy] What if he asks to come to France? 
  [Lamassoure] If he continues to make these kind of comments, 
I do not see how we could welcome him in France. In particular, 
the kind of comments he made about Bulgaria, about President 
Zhelev, which are offensive, about the Romanian people, about 
the Baltic states, Finland, Turkey, and other countries, are 
totally unacceptable. I would like to tell the representatives 
of Romania, of Bulgaria, and of the Baltic states that we 
consider their security as our security, and that we will be 
very careful to ensure that these countries may enjoy the same 
security guarantees as do all the other countries of Europe. 
  [du Roy] One last question on this: Should those countries 
of 
eastern Europe who so wish be allowed into NATO? 
  [Lamassoure] I do not think that this would be a good 
solution. The Atlantic Alliance was set up during the cold war 
to protect us against the Soviet threat and the Warsaw Pact. 
The Soviet threat no longer exists, the Warsaw Pact no longer 
exists. The Atlantic Alliance remains. We still need it. We 
can understand the security concerns of some countries of 
central and eastern Europe, but an alliance has to face a threat 
or an enemy. If you were to extend it to half of them, to 
central Europe but not to Eastern Europe, then those who are 
excluded will, at best, feel that we are not interested in their 
security, and at worse that we consider them enemies. If we 
were to extend it to the whole of central and eastern Europe, 
but not to Russia, then imagine the reaction in Moscow, whoever 
is in power in Moscow. Also, if we open it up to Russia as far 
as Vladivostok, then it is no longer an alliance but a security 
system. 
  What we are saying in France is that what Europe needs is 
not 
an extension of the Atlantic Alliance but a security system in 
which alliances have their role to play. There will be a NATO 
summit on 10 January. The Americans have proposed to these 
countries what they call a partnership for peace. Let us give 
particular importance to this partnership for peace. What we 
are suggesting -- what we call the Balladur initiative, the 
proposal for a conference on stability made by Mr. Balladur and 
accepted by the 12 -- is that all the countries in central and 
eastern Europe who have minority problems, cross-border minority 
problems, who are concerned, should gather around a table to 
find specific solutions to these problems. The day they find 
those solutions, then we will give a European and international 
guarantee to the solutions they themselves have found. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Paris, Dec 31 (AFP) -- Socialist President Francois 
Mitterrand called for a new social pact to help the weakest 
members of society in his new year's message to the people of 
France Friday [31 December]. 
  Referring to the country's unemployment level -- 3.3 million 
or 12 percent of the active population -- he said there could be 
"no healthy economy without social cohesion." 
  It was "intolerable to stand by while powerful companies get 
rich, which is good in itself, while the workers and those 
ensuring the success can be thrown out of work at any moment," 
he said. 
  In a speech broadcast on national radio and television, he 
called for French workers and labour unions to join the 
government in establishing the "basis of a new social contract 
for work" as soon as possible. 
  He lamented that 1993 had led to Western countries "to live 
in a system whose logic is increasingly untenable for the 
weakest." There was no guarantee that "economic revival which we 
are being told about will spark a decline in unemployment," he 
said. 
  In particular he said the "peoples of the east" were being 
given cause "to doubt the benefits of liberty" by the economic 
hardship they were having to suffer. 
  In this regard he lamented the continuing unrest and 
tensions 
in former eastern bloc countries. "1993 will leave us with 
images of blood and death, with Sarajevo as the symbol of 
marytred people," he said. 
  On a more positive note, he said the past year had also seen 
"peace in Cambodia, the end of apartheid in South Africa, talks 
opened between Israel and the Palestinians," and "for us, the 
birth of the European Union."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on interview with Budget Minister </F>
Nicolas Sarkozy; place and date not given: "Government: Mr. 
Sarkozy Mentions Possibility of a `Social VAT'"] 
  [Text] Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy explains in an 
interview published by PARIS MATCH (dated 6 January) that the 
two priorities for the beginning of 1994 are the balancing of 
Social Security accounts and halting the increase in 
unemployment. Explaining, on the first subject, that the 
government's "firm intention" is to "avoid any increase in the 
general social contribution," Mr. Sarkozy said: "Hospitals take 
up 49 percent of health insurance spending and have too many 
underused beds. We will have to act accordingly." 
  The budget minister also discussed "social VAT" both as a 
possible solution to the problem of funding social security and 
as an incentive to job creation. Expressing the view that it 
"could be an interesting solution," he nonetheless added: "VAT 
is a tax on the consumer. We must be careful not to slow down 
the beginning of a return to growth!" Finally, he asked "how 
can we be sure that in exchange for this huge reduction in 
contributions the majority of enterprises will start hiring."

  [Text] Bari, Italy, Jan 2 (AFP) -- A new political party, 
the Italian Democratic Monarchist Party (PDIM), announced its 
formation Sunday [2 January], pledging to return Italy to a 
monarchy nearly half a century after it became a republic. 
  The party's national executive said in a statement issued in 
this southern city that it would take part in legislative 
elections due this year, and would work towards the election of 
a monarchist president by the people. 
  The party however refused to pledge allegiance to Victor 
Emmanuel of Savoy, the direct descendent of Italy's last king, 
Umberto II, saying they only recognized the former's cousin 
Amedee, Duke of Aoste. The party's leaders described themselves 
as Savoy's loyalists. 
  Italy became a republic on June 10, 1946 after a referendum. 
The vote ended the reign of the House of Savoy, whose kings had 
ruled over Piedmont for nine centuries and as kings of Italy 
from 1861.

  [Text] The protocol on establishing a coalition government 
between the Democratic Party [DP] and the Republican Turkish 
Party [RTP] was signed today. The cabinet is expected to be 
submitted to the president tomorrow. The government protocol 
was signed by DP leader Hakki Atun and RTP leader Ozker Ozgur at 
the Republican Assembly at 1530 today. Atun and Ozgur held a 
joint news conference prior to the signing ceremony and gave 
information on the protocol. 
  In a statement, Atun said that with the protocol, which was 
prepared through great sacrifice and effort and with the full 
accord of both sides, a new era is launched. He added that in 
this new era the protocol will constitute a sound foundation 
enabling the government to realize a democratic, open, and 
honest administration in line with the people's expectations. 
He further expressed the belief that they will be able to 
maintain a long-term coalition with such a foundation. Atun 
noted that every effort will be exerted for the government to be 
successful within the framework of the protocol and that 
effective work will be carried out for the happiness and 
prosperity of the people. He stated that exposing 
irregularities, which have caused concern among the political 
parties and the people, will be one of the government's 
priorities, adding that the new government will make sure that 
the state serves the people in an effective and affectionate 
manner. Atun said that they are determined to defend the Cyprus 
cause in cooperation with Turkey and the interests of the people. 
  Ozgur said that the two parties by signing the protocol -- 
prepared after having embarked on the path to bring democracy, 
social justice, and an atmosphere of mutual respect and 
tolerance -- are announcing to the public that they are ready to 
assume their duties. Ozgur added that [words indistinct] they 
are promising a just system, an open administration, and a [word 
indistinct] atmosphere [passage indistinct]. 
  The Prime Ministry went to the DP in the DP-RPT coalition 
government. The distribution of the ministries is as follows: 
DP: Prime Ministry; Foreign Affairs and Defense Ministry; 
Economy and Finance Ministry; Public Works and Transportation 
Ministry; Youth, Sports and Environment Ministry. RTP: State 
Ministry and Deputy Prime Ministry; National Education and 
Culture Ministry; Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Energy 
Ministry; Health Ministry; Labor and Social Security Ministry. 
  The coalition protocol stresses that the two parties have 
determined that it is their duty and obligation to wage a joint 
struggle to solve the problems facing the Turkish Cypriot 
people. The section of the protocol dealing with the fundamental 
principles notes that the two parties [words indistinct] will 
help each other and that they will work [words indistinct]. 
  The section dealing with the Cyprus issue notes that the 
two parties will fulfill the duties that befall them within the 
coalition government in a bid to solve the Cyprus problem in a 
manner acceptable to both sides. The protocol states that the 
coalition government supports the intercommunal talks to be held 
between the two communities under equal political status within 
the framework of the goodwill mission of the UN secretary 
general with the aim of reaching a just and lasting peace. It 
further draws attention to the importance of holding the talks 
under free and equal conditions. The protocol notes that the 
talks will be conducted within the framework of the 1977 and 
1979 high-level agreements and the principles adopted by the 
leadership of the two communities. It goes on to express the 
belief that it will be more suitable and beneficial to hold the 
talks in Cyprus. The protocol adds that the solution to be 
reached at the intercommunal talks will be implemented after 
having been submitted to the free will of the two peoples 
through a referendum and having been approved by them. 
  The protocol stresses that the solution to be reached will 
aim at securing the peaceful and tranquil coexistence of the two 
communities side by side without returning to the pre-1974 
conditions. The protocol states that the important issue 
regarding territorial adjustments is that there be sufficient 
land in the hands of the Turkish Cypriots in accordance with the 
criteria envisaged in the 1977 agreement. It continues: 
Approaches that will force our people to resettle cannot be 
accepted. It adds that the agreement to be reached will be 
based on the equal political status of the two peoples and the 
joint sovereignty of two equal peoples and that the authorities 
granted to the two separate administrations will be based on a 
sovereignty similar to the Swiss model. 
  The protocol notes that the bicommunal and bizonal structure 
will continue to enjoy the effective and actual guarantees of 
Turkey, the motherland. It further stresses that one community 
will not have any sovereignty, administrative, or other rights 
over the other community, and adds: The joint administration 
will be based on the equality of the two sides. A consensus 
will be required in the decision making process. The 
characteristics of the two communities will be reflected in 
every level of the joint administration, including the system of 
a rotational presidency. 
  The protocol maintains that the coalition government 
believes 
it is beneficial for the leaders of the two communities to hold 
contacts within the process of the intercommunal talks in a bid 
to achieve intercommunal rapprochement and to increase mutual 
trust. It adds that the president will continue his position as 
negotiator. The protocol further stresses that in addition to 
the president, the foreign minister and the deputy prime 
minister will also be participating in the talks and that the 
Republican Assembly will be informed continually on the 
intercommunal talks process. 
  The section under democratization notes that the 1976 
election and referendum bill will be democratized. It adds that 
the Bayrak Radio and Television [BRT] administration will also 
be democratized and autonomy will be secured in line with the 
BRT law, that the establishment of private radios and television 
channels will be made possible and that the necessary 
arrangements will be made to secure the sound and extensive 
participation of civil servants in political life. 
  According to the protocol, the necessary arrangements will 
be 
made to attach the Police Directorate General to the Interior 
Ministry in a bid to equip the ministry with a police force. 
The protocol states that the Housing Ministry has been removed 
from the framework of a ministry in a bid to solve the housing 
problem in a just and lasting manner as soon as possible, adding 
that the housing issue will be made autonomous and that 
extensive work will be carried out to [words indistinct]. The 
protocol goes on to state that those who have not submitted 
their applications on time for adequate housing compensation 
will be granted the right to apply. 
  The section dealing with labor and social security issues 
says that a transition will be made to the [word indistinct] 
social security system. Pointing out that the minimum wage will 
be regulated in accordance with the prevailing conditions 
enabling the worker and his family to maintain a humane 
existence, the protocol adds that democratic [word indistinct] 
will be secured in establishing the minimum wage. The protocol 
continues: Determining the minimum wage three times a year will 
be among the goals of the coalition government. 
  The section dealing with economic and financial policy 
stresses that work will be carried out to subject the state 
revenues and expenditures to the [words indistinct] system in a 
bid to protect the economy against inflation and the high cost 
of living. The protocol notes that the value added tax will be 
implemented on condition that it be called the consumer tax, 
that customs be reduced, that basic foodstuff is exempt from it, 
and that income and corporate taxes are reduced. 
  The protocol further states that an agreement has been 
reached on giving priority to the following issues: BRT; the 
position of an ombudsman; property declaration; duties that do 
not befit a deputy; the Supreme Council of Public Accounts; the 
administration of political subdivisions; state tenders; 
associations; the enactment of labor laws; and the 
reorganization of the current labor rules and regulations. The 
protocol goes on to state that efforts will be made to develop 
agriculture and that a citrus law will be enacted. 
  The section dealing with the working method of the cabinet 
states that the cabinet's agenda will be determined by the prime 
minister after having sought the views of the coalition party 
leader. According to the protocol, in the absence of the prime 
minister the deputy prime minister will be acting prime 
minister. The protocol concludes by saying that in the absence 
of a minister, an acting minister will be appointed from among 
the ministers of the same party.

  [Text] The New Year's messages by the president and 
political leaders were dominated by the hope that the new year, 
which will arrive in a few hours, will be the beginning of the 
exit from the problems that the country and the whole world face. 
  In his New Year's message, President Konstandinos Karamanlis 
stresses that it is about time that we all realize our mistakes 
and search, with compromising procedures, for the national 
policy which will get us out of the current impasse. Referring 
to the situation in the Balkans, the president stresses that the 
imprudent intervention of elements outside the Balkans is added 
to the innate political and economic problems of the region. 
The president notes that with their groundless and 
inconsistent initiatives, these outside elements aggravate the 
disputes among the peoples in the Balkans. The president said 
that an example of the above is the continuing drama of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the indirect encouragement of Skopje's 
provocations against our country. In this unstable and 
inconsistent world, the president notes, our country should live 
and prosper. The president concluded: I believe that despite 
the difficulties we are called upon to face, we will make the 
new year the beginning of our country's exit from its current 
impasse. 
  In his New Year's message, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou 
notes the broad crisis that marked 1993 at the national, 
economic and social level by taking the country to the verge of 
collapse. He stresses that this trend toward destruction was 
interrupted with the election on 10 October and the triumph of 
the Panhellenic Socialist Party. The prime minister notes that 
for the Greek people, 1994 could be a year of greater hope and 
feeling of security because today we have firm bases for 
recovery, progress and development. The government and I, Prime 
Minister Papandreou adds, are optimistic that with 
responsibility, maturity and wisdom, with will, determination 
and continuous dialogue with the social forums and the people, 
we will proceed with the national reconstruction and productive 
direction.

  [Text] Responding to yesterday's statement by Ferhat 
Ataman, acting spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry, on 
the eastern Aegean islands, particularly Limnos, Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Konstandinos Bikas said: With this new, 
unfounded, and provocative statement, the acting spokesman for 
the Turkish Foreign Ministry continues to cultivate a climate of 
tension. He added: The Greek Government has repeatedly declared 
that it is seeking an improvement in relations between the two 
countries, but something like this presupposes respect for 
international law and the avoidance of provocations by Turkey. 
The invoking of international treaties by Turkey only allows us 
to recall the numerous violations it has committed, which peaked 
with the military invasion of Cyprus and the ongoing occupation 
of 40 percent of the island by Turkish troops. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman also noted: We should also 
recall the decline of the Greek minority in Istanbul, Imroz 
[Cokceada], and Tenedos [Bozcaada]. Regarding the more specific 
points in Mr. Ataman's statement, we note the following: The 
demilitarization of Limnos, Dardanelles Straits [Canakkale 
Bogazi], Imroz, and Tenedos was abolished by the Montreux Treaty 
of 1936. Moreover, it is recalled that, at that time, Turkey 
agreed--both verbally and in writing--to abolishing the 
demilitarization of Limnos and Samothraki. Mr. Bikas added: 
Greece's sovereignty in the eastern Aegean islands and the 
Dodecanese is absolute and does not depend on any prerequisite 
or conventional commitment. 
  Referring to the measures adopted for the defense of the 
islands, the Foreign Ministry spokesman reiterated that these 
measures are in accordance with Article 50 of the UN Charter and 
that this was done because of Turkish provocation, as well as 
Turkey's invasion and occupation of Cyprus.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Home Front Support Needed in Brussels"] </F>
  [Text] The phase that was considered right from the start 
to be the most difficult of all, the negotiations on the status 
of our farm sector in the European Union (EU), is just now 
beginning in Finland's negotiations with the EU. Finland's 
negotiating tactic has been to waste as little gunpowder as 
possible on the easier issues so that there would be enough of a 
charge left to defend interests of national importance to us in 
the farm sector and rural policy. 
  This in itself also problematic negotiating tactic and the 
order in which issues are being dealt with seem to have produced 
the false impression on some people that Finland's negotiations 
are progressing too well and that we are not defending our 
interests in Brussels as determinedly as the other countries 
engaged in negotiations. But then they forget that for Sweden, 
for example, agriculture is not a particularly problematic 
negotiating issue. Sweden is probably closer to the conclusion 
of negotiations than Finland, even though superficially this 
does not yet seem to be the case. 
  The starting shot for the negotiations on agriculture will, 
in a manner of speaking, be fired tomorrow, when the EU 
Commission for the first time officially assumes a position on 
Finland's goals for its farm sector. According to preliminary 
reports on the preparations being made by EU officials that have 
leaked out, the Commission is adopting a very negative position 
on our goals for agriculture, especially the transitional 
periods and a regional subsidies for South Finland's farmers. 
  Since the Commission's position is to be made public very 
soon, the wisest thing for politicians to do would be to wait 
for it, not to go ahead and jump to all sorts of conclusions on 
the basis of reports and conjectures that are still inaccurate 
anyway. Unfortunately, many politicians, from the foreign 
minister to the presidential candidates, have hastened to make 
rash statements about one another and Finland's prospects in the 
negotiations. A broad consensus seems to be in jeopardy just 
when it is most sorely, in fact really needed for the first time. 
  Hardly anyone assumes that Finland's grandiose goals for 
agriculture could be accepted as they stand. They are certainly 
acceptable as a starting point for negotiations. The status of 
agriculture affects national interests that are felt to be 
important. This will by no means be a pushover for Finland. In a 
speech he delivered in Strasbourg last week, President Mauno 
Koivisto uncompromisingly nailed down interests of vital 
importance to Finland. 
  According to Koivisto, the transitional periods and the EC's 
present forms of support alone are not enough for Finland. The 
Community must also adapt the goals of its own agriculture 
policy to the special conditions prevailing in Finland, not just 
the opposite. This means, for example, new forms of support 
within the compass of which there will also be room for South 
Finland's grain farmers. It is impossible to agree to equating 
them with Central European farmers. Presumably, this will also 
be understood in Brussels. It would be even better understood if 
we were a bit more patient on the home front until the final 
positions are settled on.

<F P=106> [Article by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland: "The </F>
Security Picture"] 
  [Text] New generations of Norwegians are growing up to a 
more unclear security picture than that of their parents' 
generation who had their worldview shaped by the Cold War. 
Today it is fortunately not the case that Norway is facing an 
obvious threat to its security. At the same time Norwegians are 
for the first time taking part in UN operations for peace in 
Europe. A few hours' travel from Norway a brutal war is raging 
in a country which has been close to the hearts of Norwegians 
and which is now being torn to pieces by antagonisms and 
violence. The Yugoslavia crisis is a reminder that peace cannot 
be taken for granted. And while Bosnians, Croats, and Serbs 
approach the festival of Christmas under a tragic sky, 
developments in Europe lead one's thoughts in the direction of 
past times' harrowing events on our continent. The map of Europe 
has changed in the course of just a few years. New states of 
which we had scarcely been aware are now striving to take root 
in the security policy landscape. For four decades we knew what 
we were organized against by virtue of our membership of NATO. 
Today the threats have no clear face or thrust. 
  The elections to the new national assembly in Russia were a 
reminder of the difficulties involved in transforming a 
totalitarian superpower into a democracy based on sharing and 
devolving power, both political and economic. Since the breakup 
of the Soviet Union there has been broad agreement in the West 
that the danger of an armed Russian attack on West European 
territory is now extremely small. The West has no clear 
opponent. The threats which terrorized Europe during Berlin 
crises, the invasion of Hungary, and the Czechoslovakia crisis 
in 1968 are gone. What we are now facing are less defined 
dangers and uncertainties. The rise of nationalist movements in 
the former Soviet Union has been mentioned most often as a 
source of uncertainty which could have repercussions for 
security policy. 
  The sensational election result for the nationalist forces 
in 
Russia has sent shock waves through the West. Parallels have 
been drawn with the Nazis' successes in Germany in the thirties. 
There is every indication that the Russian voters were 
attracted by a mood and by promises of simple solutions, of a 
rapid improvement in their difficult material circumstances. 
The nationalists' vociferous foreign policy line has probably 
not been of decisive importance for the election result. But 
there is a danger that the recreation of Soviet power could be a 
political plus and be used as a symbol of a different and 
prouder future than that which characterizes everyday life in 
Russia today. 
  The election shows that it is too simple to view 
developments 
in Russia as a smooth process characterized by progress toward a 
society more like our own. We were prepared for the possibility 
that there might be setbacks. But in the total picture we must 
not overlook the fact that the election itself was carried 
through in a way of which Russia can be proud. A new 
constitution was adopted which clarifies the power relationships 
between the national assembly, the government, and the 
president, and from January the president will have to deal with 
a national assembly with democratic legitimacy. It will now be 
possible to replace the battle we saw between Yeltsin and the 
former Supreme Soviet with normal everyday politics in russia. 
  At the same time as the new Russian State Duma meets for the 
first time in January, NATO's heads of state and government will 
meet for a summit in Brussels. This will be President Clinton's 
first meeting with NATO's heads of state and government and many 
people are looking forward to hearing his view of transatlantic 
ties and NATO's future mission. 
  There is every reason to expect that the President will 
confirm that the United States will have a military presence in 
Europe in the future too, although with a smaller number of 
troops than during the Cold War. NATO's contingency planning is 
also being reshaped. Whereas in the past NATO was directed 
toward preventing a large-scale attack, planning is nowadays 
directed more toward crisis and conflict management on a smaller 
scale. 
  There is much interest in how NATO will approach the former 
members of the Warsaw Pact and the new states in the former 
Soviet Union. Full NATO membership is a desire that several 
countries have expressed. As well as representing a security 
guarantee, NATO membership would make an important contribution 
to the strengthening of the national identity of many countries. 
So far the West has been unwilling to rule out NATO membership 
for these countries, but there are conflicting views on how 
rapidly such membership should come about. 
  NATO membership has been seen as the end of a process rather 
than as a beginning. To underline that the cooperation in the 
NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council], in which former 
dictatorships are now members alongside the NATO nations, ought 
now to be able to develop into even closer cooperation, an offer 
to these countries of "Partnership for Peace" agreements is 
being worked on. Here countries which so wish will be given an 
invitation to enter into significant security agreements with 
NATO. 
  In recent years in Europe the EC and the Western European 
Union have become increasingly important in the security 
context. For 30 years the United States has been arguing that 
Europe must shoulder a larger part of the responsibility for its 
own security. On the European side this determination is now 
being expressed more strongly than previously. While the United 
Sates can be counted on as a guarantor against Soviet attack, 
the Yugoslavia crisis and the new dangers in other countries are 
now showing that NATO's security guarantees are not enough. 
When NATO was formed, no one paid any attention at all to the 
thought that inside the Soviet-dominated bloc civil wars or 
unrest could arise with the concomitant danger that they could 
spread to the countries of the West. Developments show that 
military cooperation alone -- as in the NATO alliance -- is not 
able to predict and prevent the growth of unrest and 
hostilities. As a result the nonmilitary sides of security 
policy have become more important. In particular, the EC's 
economic and political role is constantly growing in security 
policy importance. 
  The year we are leaving behind us shows that we are living 
in 
a period of transition in which institutions which were created 
for a different age must form part of the response to challenges 
of the new age. Since Germany and France came together after 
the war, the EC has had an effect in the field of security 
policy for 35 years without any great fuss being made. In the 
years to come, we will see greater demands being made on EC 
cooperation from the security policy angle. The new NATO will 
always be the guarantee that we will have a defense against 
attack. But it will become increasingly clear that NATO cannot 
contribute that type of economic cooperation which will make 
crises, revolts, and wars things of the past.

  Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov, on an official 
visit to Turkey, held a meeting with General Dogan Gures, chief 
of the General Staff. Pointing out that there existed an 
agreement on military training between Azerbaijan and Turkey, 
Gasanov added that he will hold meetings on this issue. 
  The guest minister later departed Turkey. Seeing the guest 
minister off, Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said that Azerbaijan 
was entering 1994 hurt and with problems. Cetin said: 
  [Begin Cetin recording] If the Armenian forces think they 
will hold on to the territories they occupied by force, they are 
wrong. We hope they will withdraw from the territories they 
have occupied. If they do not withdraw peacefully then one day 
they will have to leave those territories under other 
conditions. It is impossible that they will hold on to 
Azerbaijani territory they occupied by force in violation of all 
international regulations. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Part three of a three-part report on the Cyprus problem by </F>
Irfan Ulku: "Cyprus Between Crescent and Cross"] 
  [Text] Following the elections, Rauf Denktas is now getting 
ready for the umpteenth round of relentless fighting which has 
been going on in the diplomatic arena between the Crescent and 
the Cross and which is to resume in Washington and New York. 
And he is making his preparations for a round whose winner has 
virtually been declared with Clinton's assertion that "Cyprus is 
my personal problem." 
  Therefore, our question to the president was related to 
this. 
<H5>  First the People Must Accept </H5>
  [Ulku] The developments and in particular the reports and 
commentaries in the Greek Cypriot and U.S. press indicate that 
the United States will put Turkey in a highly difficult 
situation in the aftermath of the elections. What sort of a 
path do you want to follow in view of this? 
  [Denktas] I am also in contact with the Americans and asking 
them: There is a fundamental principle. Any agreement will be 
submitted to a referendum on both sides; that is, it will be 
subject to the will of the people. Will you use force to make 
us accept an agreement rejected by the people? "Never," they 
reply. The Americans have the mistaken impression that the 
package, called the "set of ideas," placed before us is 
acceptable to the people, but that we have not been telling the 
truth to the people. I am saying that we could only go to the 
people if we reach the conclusion that an agreement acceptable 
to the people could be concluded. Internal turmoil will ensue 
if, without such a conviction, we affix our signature to an 
agreement unacceptable to the people. Hence, on the basis of 
this, Turkey could easily put up the following defense: "I 
might try to make the Turkish Cypriots endorse an agreement 
acceptable to them, but I cannot force them to endorse an 
agreement unacceptable to them. " Turkey could make this 
defense, and is already doing it. 
  [Ulku] Do you see any hint of retreat or concession on 
Cyprus 
problem since the 60's and 70's on the part of Turkey? 
  [Denktas] No, I do not. Turkey is continuing to execute the 
necessary maneuver to prove that it has the goodwill and favors 
peace, and that the Turkish people in Cyprus too have rights and 
a just cause. Because the TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern 
Cyprus] is a state officially recognized by Turkey, it [TRNC] 
will not be subject to the diplomatic erosion that existed 
before our declaration of the TRNC, and therefore Turkey will 
support us with greater ease. 
<H5>  "Papandreou's New Policy Is in Our Favor" </H5>
  [Ulku] It appears that the Papandreou government in Greece 
is 
pursuing a "hawkish" policy on Cyprus problem. Where, in your 
view, will this policy end? Could the attacks of the Greek 
Cypriot soldiers resume after so many years? 
  [Denktas] I think that for Papandreou to pursue this policy 
is to our favor. It justifies our position. This policy 
confirms that he does not want an agreement between us and the 
Greek Cypriots. I think that if they take further steps in this 
direction, our being on the right will be understood more 
easily. I consider their initiative to attack as madness, but 
then, these are people who have committed madness before. 
  [Ulku] My last question will be a bit personal. To what do 
you link the persistence of the "Denktas equals Cyprus" formula 
that has been around for such long years despite every criticism 
against your person? Have you ever contemplated this issue? 
  [Denktas] I think I link it to the fact that the people have 
seen that I have always defended what the people want, that I 
have not deceived the people, and that I followed a line aimed 
at gaining the people's trust. This is only natural. Had this 
not been so, we would not have been able to remain here for 
long. However, what saddens me most is that those who say "The 
Cyprus problem equals Denktash," or those who look at this issue 
from this angle have also concluded that "If Denktas wants to, 
he can make concessions and this problem will be settled." This 
is very wrong. This is because my very existence here is linked 
to the art of assessing my people's sincere desire within a 
reasonable framework and defend it. Even Denktas cannot do 
what people do not want. Even Denktas cannot make the 
concession unacceptable to the people. It will be beneficial if 
this is known to all.

  [Text] The Turkoman Unity Party in Iraq [TUPI] has claimed 
that 2.5 million Turkomans have been abandoned to live at the 
mercy of the sense of fairness of Saddam's administration and of 
the Kurdish government in northern Iraq, and they called on 
Hammer Force to protect the Turkoman people. In a written 
statement made in the Turkish Cypriot side of Nicosia yesterday, 
TUPI leader Ahmet Gunes claimed that the media of the world have 
neglected and overlooked the existence of Turkoman people in 
Iraq. He said: "We expect the public in Turkey and the media 
organs in the world to be more sensitive on the matter and to 
help us remove the Saddam administration's oppression and 
pressure." 
  Recalling that the Hammer Force protects the Kurds in 
northern Iraq, including those who live in areas below the 36th 
parallel, Gunes lamented that all the Turkoman people, including 
those who live in al-Mawsil and other areas to the north of the 
36th parallel, have been ignored. He said: "The Turkomans in 
Iraq urge the Turkish Government and the entire world to have 
all the Turkoman people, including those in al-Mawsil Province, 
protected. We also urge them to help us create an opportunity 
for ourselves to live like human beings and maintain our 
political identity."

<F P=106> [First part of a two-part interview with President Suleyman </F>
Demirel by Ilnur Cevik and Ismet Imset in Ankara on 21 December] 
  [Text] Ismet G. Imset: Mr. President, you had a statement 
related to the military trials procedure, and this is the item 
on Turkey's agenda now. Especially when you were being elected 
prime minister and when you were in government, you were talking 
continuously of a vocal Turkey, of a transparent Turkey. There 
was the Paris Charter and international human rights on Turkey's 
agenda then, but it appears now that the priorities of Turkey 
have changed in a very serious way. You also have a speech 
which is in nature supporting the trial of civilians in military 
courts. Is there a change of opinion on these issues? 
  President Suleyman Demirel: How mistakenly you understand 
the issue. Of course, you have the right to understand some 
things in the way you like, but to understand this issue in this 
way is very wrong. What I said is this: Turkey is a 
constitutional state. A constitutional state is not a state you 
can create out of your mind every morning. It is a state which 
has been created and linked to principles. These principles are 
approved by the people. A constitutional state is also a 
democratic state. And democracy has no certain model. It is 
made up of rules, concepts and institutions. Of course, we 
cannot think of a substandard democracy. The issue is something 
in which certain rules are protected. Democracy is an 
institution which respects, creates and lives human rights, 
which guarantees the rights with regard to humans. These are 
all written in the Declaration of Human Rights. 
  There is talk of a judicial state, this is also within 
democracy. A judicial state is this: A person cannot be held 
responsible for a crime he has not committed. And if someone is 
being held as a suspect related to a crime, he is innocent until 
a decision is passed that he is guilty. A person cannot be 
forced into proving his own guilt. This is something to be done 
by he who is alleging the crime. 
  There are laws in Turkey. Yes, these laws may be in 
violation of the Constitution as well. Your Constitution may 
not fit as much as you like with the principles of democracy. 
Until you can fit your Constitution to democratic principles 
and until you can fit your laws to the Constitution, you will 
have to abide by them. If you don't, there will be chaos in the 
country. You will act according to them. For instance, what 
will you do? If you insult military service, this will fall 
under Turkish Penal Code Article 155. In other words, insulting 
military service is a crime. That is the law. Now, if such a 
crime has been committed, what will be done? The Military Penal 
Code says the Chief of Staff court has jurisdiction over such 
cases. Now you cannot accept that insulting military service is 
a requirement of democracy. If you do, you will find no one 
supporting you. This is a state. Can a state be without 
soldiers? Can a state allow its soldiers to be insulted? The 
military administration is different than the soldier. Soldiers 
are the most important element of a country. We don't mean 
militarism, we mean soldiers, soldiers. No one would allow his 
state to be insulted, and no state would allow its soldiers to 
be insulted. No state would allow holy things to be insulted. 
  According to our laws, you cannot insult the prophet or 
religion. It is not possible to accept that such (insults) are 
democracy. It is chaos. 
  You may say this: In such a case, the case should be heard 
not by a military court but by a civilian court. You can also 
struggle for this. It's okay. But since today's law is like 
this, you will have to abide by it. If it is at military 
courts, there is the issue of military judges. Military justice 
in Turkey is a part of the Constitution, and it is clear which 
issues military justice has jurisdiction over. Military judges 
do not receive directives from the chief of staff or commanders. 
In the past we confronted military judges on many occasions and 
they acted with conscience. I, as head of the state, am in a 
position to evaluate all institutions of the state. What I say 
is this: Don't be afraid of military judges, they don't act 
according to orders, they act according to whatever justice 
requires. This is the issue: Come and if you don't want such 
issues to go to military court, say it is enough for them to go 
to civilian courts and I will also support this. 
  This is why I say that what I have said was misunderstood. 
Is there any mistake in my views? 
  Imset: But there is one thing: According to military 
judge Sever, who made a statement reported by the ANATOLIA NEWS 
AGENCY, no military prosecutor can open an investigation on his 
own and to do so, he must receive orders from a supreme 
authority within the hierarchical chain. This is how the recent 
investigation was launched. In other words, it happened after 
direct orders from the chief of staff commander. 
  Demirel: Just stop there. I want to say this. The justice 
minister can tell civilian prosecutors to investigate certain 
cases. The justice minister cannot, however, say anything to the 
judge. Do you know what a prosecutor is? A prosecutor is the 
cog between the state and court. It is the duty of 
administrators to tell the prosecutor to do his duty if he is 
not doing his duty. But it is not the duty of administrators to 
tell the judge what to do. 
  Imset: I was talking in a more general perspective. We all 
know the era in which you were banned from politics, and the 
promises you made when you were being elected and after you came 
to power as prime minister. We often now refer to the books 
containing your remarks for a more open Turkey, a more civilian 
country. But in the past three months alone there have been 
cases launched with regard to around 60 crimes of opinion. 
People are being investigated for writing books or articles. 
You were a political leader then with many goals and you are 
now the president. It appears to us that the priorities have 
seriously changed, that we are moving towards an authoritarian 
rule but there is a civilian administration as window dressing. 
  Demirel: This is so wrong, I am surprised at how you reached 
these conclusions. I return to this: Turkey has laws, and 
until they are changed you will abide by them. And, in these 
laws, there are a lot of things which I don't like and I don't 
want or agree with. I am against many articles of this 
Constitution including temporary Article 15. But until these 
change I have to abide with them. But there is something else 
in Turkey: Are the ways to seek one's rights not completely 
open in Turkey? They are. And, you may not agree with crimes 
which the laws regard as a crime. But if the law sees them as a 
crime today, there is nothing else you can do. There have been 
changes in the Turkish Penal Code, which appeared as the CMUK 
(Judicial Trial Procedures Law). In Parliament there is a legal 
reform. There is a press law. There are many things. Whatever 
we have said, these have been put into writing and placed in 
front of Parliament. It has been two years since we said these. 
For six months of these two years, I have been here (the 
presidency). Where in the world have democratic reforms been 
carried out and completed in one and a half years? I believe 
the criticism that Turkey could not adapt itself to the Paris 
Charter is a bit merciless. 
  Ilnur Cevik: But, sir, there is something else. We see that 
Turkey has not even been able to catch up with the developments 
in East Europe. 
  Demirel: Come on now, these are empty words, Ilnur. What 
couldn't it catch up with? Don't put down Turkey that much. 
Just go and see Poland. In Poland someone steals even the 
embassy's car which has flags on it. Just go and see Poland. 
What couldn't Turkey catch up with? There is no one on its 
streets, don't give so much credit to East Europe. You cannot 
get anywhere by putting down Turkey every day. 
  Cevik: You accept that the democracy in Turkey is not a 
substandard democracy? 
  Demirel: Let me tell you the reasons. Is there an elected 
Parliament in Turkey? 
  Cevik: Yes 
  Demirel: Is the Parliament bench open? 
  Cevik: Yes. 
  Demirel: Is there a free judiciary in Turkey. 
  Cevik: Yes. 
  Demirel: There is, there is. Of course, there is. Then, is 
there a free press in Turkey? 
  Cevik: err, yes. 
  Demirel: Don't do that. You are insulting everyone from 
morning to night! You are insulting everyone, everyone! 
Including even the state. Is there? Yes, there is. Don't 
shake your head. There is. 
  Cevik: Well you say there is... but we don't see it. 
  Demirel: How can't you see it? You live in it. Is there 
anyone who interferes in your newspaper? Is there anyone who 
says anything for writing this. 
  Cevik: But we don't insult anyone. 
  Demirel: There are those who do. Does anyone interfere with 
them? Or does anyone say anything for writing this way or the 
other? No. 
  Cevik: There is, selectively. 
  Demirel: No there isn't. 
  Imset: The last OZGUR GUNDEM incident can be shown as an 
example. Whatever it writes -- and we have greatly opposed what 
it has written -- there have been serious illegalities in the 
case against OZGUR GUNDEM. This is, of course, in the nature of 
a warning. I don't know where in the world the chief of staff 
calls all owners and editors of newspapers, projects articles on 
the walls and says don't write things like this? Or teaches 
journalists how they should write their stories? 
  Demirel: Whoever calls you, don't go... If you go, don't 
write what they are saying. No one is saying anything to you. 
Don't go and don't write what they are doing. 
  The OZGUR GUNDEM case, on the other hand, is not such a 
simple incident. Yesterday, I asked the Istanbul governor for 
information on OZGUR GUNDEM. If this place is a newspaper, can 
a newspaper have the right to assist an organization which is 
carrying out murders in Turkey, sabotage in Turkey? It has 
nothing to do with journalism. This is the claim. The claim of 
the administration, of the governor and the security center as 
well as the prosecutor. What is this? A judiciary state. What 
would someone facing an accusation do? He would go and defend 
himself. 
  Imset: And, of course sir, the questions we are reflecting 
here are not only the views we share but also the questions 
which have surfaced from embassies, mainly Western embassies, we 
have spoken to. I believe you too will be receiving reports on 
these from your own security offices. The first is that in the 
coming two months, there will be certain campaigns with the aim 
of cornering Turkey on human rights. Campaigns in America, in 
France and elsewhere. In a way, our questions aim at learning 
where Turkey is. 
  Demirel: But you will do great injustice to Turkey. In 
other words, ambassadors based in Turkey may say this or that. 
But Turkey has its own administration. Turkey is not connected 
to them. I am not asking you why you are asking these 
questions. But everyone must speak correctly. Tell me what 
aspects of democracy exist in other countries which do not exist 
in Turkey. Be it England or France, what is there which does 
not exist in Turkey? This is what I would ask those 
ambassadors. There is nothing there which does not exist here. 
The state's governors have their doors open wide, the judges, 
the prosecutors, Parliament have their doors open wide. All 
doors for complaints are open. All ways to seek rights are 
open. What else should the state do? 
  What is the part which is not liked about Turkey? It is a 
judiciary state. What else should we do? We have neither 
turned back on democratization nor from our promises. (Demirel 
takes out a list of PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] massacres). 
Give this list to those who are looking for human rights. On 
June 13, 1993, a group of 150-200 bandits attacked military 
units in Silopi and six infantry soldiers were killed. Two 
officers and 11 soldiers were wounded. On June 29, about 
400-500 bandits attacked the Siirt Pervariz, Igneli gendarmerie 
station. One petty officer and 11 soldiers were martyred. On 
July 2, 1993, a group of bandits attacked the Mardin Dargecit 
Celik station, and in the clash, one sergeant and 15 soldiers 
were martyred. They are also human beings. Should this happen? 
No one is doing anything to these people. Look, I will confront 
the world with this piece of paper. 
  Imset: But Mr. President, in that case it means that no 
matter what is said by military and political circles about 
measures being taken against terrorism, there is a backlash to 
Turkey's anti-terrorism policy, doesn't it? 
  Demirel: Don't you have anything to say against these 
people? Those who carry out the attacks. 
  Imset: Yes sir. We continuously condemn such attacks. 
  Demirel: You condemn them but you don't say anything to 
those who are carrying them out. I mean, these attacks don't 
concern you too much. These are not what you are looking for. 
What you are looking for is something abstract: Let there be 
democracy in Turkey. There is democracy in Turkey! I tell you, 
whatever exists in France exists in Turkey. You take an 
isolated case and without going into the isolated case, you 
start dressing it up! 
  Imset: Now, I've got some figures. In 1992, in 12 months, 
the number of armed incidents was 1,920 and the number of 
civilians killed was 618. In a period of 10 months in 1993 
during which announcements were made that the backbone of the 
PKK had been broken, there were 3,900 incidents and 1,200 
civilians killed. There is an increase of exactly 100 percent. 
  Demirel: What does this prove? 
  Imset: That's exactly what I wanted to ask sir. Where does 
our policy stand against terrorism? What has Turkey achieved 
against terrorism? Where is our success? 
  Demirel: (Showing a map of "greater Kurdistan.") It is here. 
This is the state they want to create. For this they have come 
and taken hold of the mountains of Turkey. These are the 
mountains. In this piece of land, the state wants to throw them 
out. And, between the bandits and state the struggle is 
continuing and so many people are dying. What are you 
questioning here? 
  Imset: Exactly the style of struggle sir. For instance, the 
Lice incidents... 
  Demirel: My dear brother, what should the state do? Should 
the state say here this is your land and stop the struggle? 
  Imset: When we take the Lice incident as an example, and you 
would remember what happened in Sirnak in August 1992. Now we 
are reconstructing Lice because the PKK carried out a brief 
attack and security forces later opened fire on Lice--according 
to the people and a parliamentary commission--and Lice was 
pulled to the ground. Now it is natural for the people to side 
with the terrorists. This is our own point of argument, and we 
are not saying the state should sit at the same table with the 
bandits or terrorists. If, for instance, there are villages or 
hamlets which have to be depopulated for the sake of security, 
the people should be compensated and shown where they should go. 
Or else, they end up on the mountains and/or join the militia 
in the cities. And, this is not what we say. This is what we 
are told by the commanders and police directors in the region. 
  Demirel: Instead of telling you this they should tell it to 
their superior officers. 
  Cevik: They cannot tell their superiors sir. Or, even if 
they do, it doesn't reach you. 
  Demirel: Could this happen. What does that mean? Are you 
more important than the state that the information does not 
reach us? We have all information here. 
  Cevik: Does this kind of information reach you? 
  Demirel: Most of this information is wrong. What you are 
hearing is wrong. Where did the state pull Lice to the ground? 
They shot the state's general in Lice. The soldiers were under 
fire from all directions. What should the soldiers do? They 
were under fire from all fronts. Your picture does not contain 
this side. In other words, should we allow the state's soldier 
to be fired upon from all sides? 
  I created Lice. An earthquake pulled it to the ground and I 
made it. Again I have said go and repair the damaged parts. 
What should the state do? This is what I don't understand. 
  The state's general is fired upon but you do nothing. When 
three houses are struck in Lice you portray this as 
anti-democratic or reason for the people to go on their side. 
But a general is martyred and you don't even feel for him. 
  Imset: Sir, we are especially sorry for the killing of 
someone like Bahtiyar pasha, who took a moderate view with 
regard to the issue. We are even more sorry that pashas and 
other people who have moderate views on the problem are dying. 
  Demirel: Do you and Ilnur know about this incident in Turkey 
while no one else does? 
  Imset: But we write and we get information... 
  Cevik: In the past three years or so, the Southeastern 
problem has turned into a Southeastern and Eastern problem. 
Unfortunately, the PKK has also become effective in the Eastern 
provinces as well. What do you think of this? 
  Demirel: Personally, I do not believe in anything like this. 
There is nothing like the Eastern problem. There is the 
Southeastern problem and in 10 provinces of the Southeast there 
are incidents. The state, as a constitutional solution, has 
declared emergency rule in this region and is keeping it in 
practice. The state exists in every corner of this land. In 
every corner. And, 160,000 soldiers, police and gendarmerie are 
here to clean these bandits out of this part of Turkey and to 
put justice and a normal regime in force. 
  Cevik: Under these circumstances, of course elections in 
March will easily be held in the Southeast because security will 
be maintained. 
  Demirel: Yes, there is security in the Southeast today. 
There is security everywhere. Does the state not have a 
prosecutor in Beytussebap? It does. The region you are talking 
about is not a liberated zone. Is the state not in Cukurca? It 
is. 
  Cevik: We are not saying the region is liberated zone. 
  Demirel: You sound like it. Say it or not, I'm saying it's 
not a liberated zone. How could it be that the Southeastern 
problem became an Eastern and Southeastern problem in three 
years? If it had been, the state would have declared emergency 
law in Kars, Erzurum, Igdir and Agri. There are many incidents 
here. This is a bandit incident. The Turkish Republic is doing 
what any state faced with such problems would do. Yes, your 
other question. 
  Cevik: Sir, since the elections can also be held, it means 
there is no problem in the Southeast... 
  Demirel: There is a problem in the Southeast. A problem of 
bandits. And the state is trying to overcome this. 
  Imset: Sir, could you please clarify the bandit problem for 
us. For instance, the chief of staff refers to a limited civil 
war, the national intelligence talks about a limited uprising. 
We are getting various theories from various levels of the 
state. Because we are working on this issue, we have also the 
chance of seeing some reports and commenting on them. 
  How do we separate banditry from the others? As far as I'm 
aware, banditry is cited in the Turkish Constitution as reason 
to declare martial law in Turkey. Is there a link between the 
two? In other words are the soldiers, or rather the 
hard-liners, especially using this word to later implement the 
Constitution. [as published] Official figures say the bandits 
number some 10,000 and Ahmet Corekci pasha has a statement that 
there are 375,000 sympathizers. When we put all of these 
together, how do you describe banditry, terrorism and uprising? 
  Demirel: We describe it this way: On July 18, 1993 a group 
of people--let's call them people, not bandits--who came to the 
Islam district Sundurlu field in Bahcesaray, Van, massacred 24 
citizens and wounded one citizen. What are these? These are 
bandits. 
  Imset: What I mean is that we use the word banditry but we 
are faced with an organized "enemy." 
  Demirel: On July 7, people who attacked military units in 
Catak killed eight soldiers and four village guards. This is 
banditry. Leave theory and everything aside. If such activities 
are being carried out, the Turkish Constitution says that in the 
case of spreading violence and public order being hindered in an 
important way, emergency law will be declared. 
  What else should there be? So much has happened in a year. 
The name of this is violence. There is nothing like a civilian 
solution or military solution here. Could it be that a 
country's constitution has covered everything but the security 
of its people and borders? 
  Imset: Thus comes emergency law and the second step is 
martial law... 
  Demirel: The second step is martial law and the third is 
full mobilization. 
  Imset: This is what concerns us. A position in which we 
cannot avoid all of these steps. 
  Demirel: But this is the state. The state has put these as 
measures. If the conditions continue like this and if the state 
cannot resolve this issue with emergency rule--which it will-- 
martial law will come and the other conditions will come as well.
