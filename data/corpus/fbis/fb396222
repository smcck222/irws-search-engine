<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by Ulrich </F>
Rosenbaum; place and date not given: "Scharping: There Will Be 
No Cooperation With SED Successor Party"] 
  [Text] [Rosenbaum] In Lower Saxony, you have just opened 
the election campaign for the super election year. Will it be a 
year of punches and jabs? 
  [Scharping] No. The Social Democrats are interested in 
advocating their factual positions and in seeking a 
confrontation with the government when it arises from the 
factual positions. 
  [Rosenbaum] What are the main topics? 
  [Scharping] Combating unemployment, new economic growth that 
is compatible with the environment, modernizing the economy, 
relieving labor of the costs that have nothing to do with 
employees, reconstructing the east -- this is the business of 
the community as a whole -- the housing shortage, and 
eliminating other social injustices. 
  [Rosenbaum] In view of the new threats from the East -- 
keyword Zhirinovskiy -- might the voters not finally prefer to 
leave the present Federal Government in office? 
  [Scharping] Why? The Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] is currently the only party that can present a consistent 
foreign policy concept, which is completely in the tradition of 
the foreign policies of Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt. The 
key words are European integration, development of a new 
Ostpolitik that also has economic and employment policy 
prospects, and, now as before, close friendly relations with the 
United States of America. In the field of European integration, 
the chancellor's basic policies are supported by the SPD. But 
he is becoming increasingly lonely in his own party. By the 
way, however, I cannot imagine that the Bundestag elections will 
be very strongly influenced by foreign politics. U.S. President 
Bush, who was voted out of office shortly afterward, also 
indulged in this illusion. 
  [Rosenbaum] The CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union] has now agreed on Roman Herzog as 
candidate for the president's office. Do you still proceed on 
the assumption that the majority of the Free Democratic Party of 
Germany [FDP] electors will vote for Rau? 
  [Scharping] I proceed on the assumption that in the Federal 
Assembly there are, independent of party membership, enough 
autonomous women and men who will make their decision for 
Germany's best benefit. And the best for this office is clearly 
Johannes Rau. 
  [Rosenbaum] Are you pleased that the FDP has postponed a 
statement on a coalition to September and will possibly not make 
one at all? 
  [Scharping] At any rate, this shows that the coalition is no 
longer internally consistent and the FDP is thinking. However, 
my concern for the partners in the coalition is limited and the 
FDP has to make its decision itself. I will watch this with 
interest. 
  [Rosenbaum] What about the secret agreement with Joschka 
Fischer that a Red-Green coalition is to be formed? 
  [Scharping] Journalists never report things that are 
incorrect. At most, they sometimes make mistakes. As far as 
this matter is concerned, I am interested in gaining voters for 
the SPD from all other parties. 
  [Rosenbaum] The CDU/CSU called on you to clearly dissociate 
yourself from the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]. What 
about it? 
  [Scharping] There will be no cooperation between the SPD and 
the PDS. For the Social Democrats, the PDS is not just a normal 
political opponent, but the direct successor organization of the 
Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED], from which we totally 
dissociated ourselves. By the way, the reproach from the ranks 
of the CDU/CSU is an absurd reversal of the situation. In 
eastern Germany there are several examples of the CDU hoisting 
PDS people into public office and, on the other hand, availing 
itself of the PDS support to deny public office to the Social 
Democratic winners of the Brandenburg election to the advantage 
of members of the old bloc parties and old friendships between 
the CDU and the PDS. If the exhortations addressed to the 
Social Democrats are to be even slightly credible, the CDU would 
have to expel people who make common cause with the PDS. 
  [Rosenbaum] These days its own past is, once again, catching 
up with the SPD. I mean the accusations against Wehner [former 
chairman of the SPD Bundestag Group]. You could simply say: 
Why should this affect me? All that happened long before my 
time.... 
  [Scharping] I specifically do not say this. Someone who 
bears responsibility for a party does not dissociate himself 
from the history of this party. I do not see any reason at all 
to rewrite history in any way. Herbert Wehner intensively 
advocated the growing together of the Germans, decent 
humanitarian conditions, and concrete help. This is of lasting 
value. The historians are to examine the rest. However, it is 
not a topical political question. 
  [Rosenbaum] The parties have come to an agreement on the 
question of the move of the capital. Will there be peace now 
and will the decision in the major round be final? 
  [Scharping] Yes. I am personally satisfied with the result, 
as far as the German Bundestag and compensation for the Bonn 
region are concerned. However, I add the following: From my 
point of view, the Federal Government can move earlier. It will 
take a relatively long time and it absolutely has to be 
connected both with the question of costs and the modernization 
of the government work itself. 
  [Rosenbaum] If you were chancellor, would you raise these 
questions anew? 
  [Scharping] Yes, then I would be able to do so because all 
these are questions whose organization is controlled by the 
Federal Government and the chancellor.

<F P=106> ["hen."-initialed report: "Government Intends To Become </F>
Active on the Labor Market Before the Election"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- In view of growing unemployment, the Federal 
Government is planning to extend the existing instruments in 
terms of labor policy in the course of the year. Hence, 
subsidies to wage costs should be paid in the old laender, too; 
people receiving unemployment benefits should be used for 
seasonal work; and private labor exchanges should be licensed 
throughout the federal territory. This has been established by 
an "Action Program for More Growth and Employment," worked out 
under the auspices of Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt. It is 
to be presented to the Bundestag coalition groups on Tuesday [18 
January]. 
  The program, previously announced by the federal economics 
minister, was worked out by Rexrodt with Ministers Waigel and 
Bluem as well as Schaeuble and Solms, the heads of the CDU/CSU 
[Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] and FDP 
[Free Democratic Party] Bundestag groups. It should be 
presented by Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl shortly, following 
discussions in the Bundestag groups and the cabinet. It 
essentially consists of elements from the Rexrodt paper on 
securing Germany as an economic center and of proposals included 
in the CDU economic program that the CDU Executive Committee 
adopted last weekend. As early as last Friday, Rexrodt hinted 
about certain points of the program, such as the continuation of 
the policy of easing the tax burden and a number of initiatives 
to simplify the tax system. Moreover, an equity capital relief 
program should be reintroduced to promote medium-sized 
enterprises in the old laender, the establishment of innovative 
enterprises and master craftsmen courses should be promoted 
through low interest loans, and the transition from unemployment 
to self-employment should be subsidized by six months of 
bridging money. 
  To improve and expand the set of instruments of labor market 
policy, the paper proposes to permit the conversion of 
unemployment benefits into wage subsidies also in regions of the 
old laender that are particularly badly hit by structural 
crises. This measure is intended to expire at the end of 1996. 
It is limited to one year in each individual case, and should 
be based on special rates that must not exceed 80 percent of the 
income for comparable work under applicable wage agreements. 
Moreover, the amount of income that can be subsidized is 
limited to 4,323 German marks [DM] per month in the old and 
DM3,348 in the new laender. The spheres of employment mentioned 
are environmental improvement, social services, and youth work. 
Further proposals in this connection include: 1. a nationwide 
offer of joint tasks for those receiving unemployment benefits; 
2. increased use of persons on unemployment benefits for 
seasonal jobs; 3. labor exchanges that are half-state and half- 
privately run, but also such offices that are purely privately 
run; and 4. the extension of the Employment Promotion Law, which 
will expire in 1995, and which, among other things, provides for 
time-limited labor contracts for another five years. Further 
plans include an efficient fight against illegal employment and 
illegal work. Employers with a proven record of illegal 
employment of foreigners should be excluded from public tenders 
in the future. 
  Further Bonn action program projects, some of which are 
listed as medium-term measures, include the abolition of the Law 
Governing Discounts and the allowance regulation, a demand 
Rexrodt raised some time ago, and an amendment of the law on 
budget principles to increase the use of privatization 
potentials at the level of laender and communities. By the end 
of March 1994, the Federal Government will come up with a final 
decision on a concept for financing the planned Hamburg-Berlin 
Transrapid high-speed train connection. To ease the tense 
situation in the construction of social housing, the authors of 
the action program refer to the 1994 law on promoting housing 
construction.

<F P=106> ["tl"-signed report: "Election Programs Concentrate on </F>
Economic, Financial Issues"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The political parties represented in the 
Bundestag are increasingly focusing on economic and financial 
policy issues. Rudolf Scharping, chairman of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], said in Bonn on 17 January 
that the determination with which the SPD has concentrated on 
the great economic and social issues is decisive for the party's 
"successful course." This includes an economic policy forum on 
the modernization of Germany's economic base, at which the SPD 
will discuss its government program with entrepreneurs later 
this month. 
  Prior to the Federal Government's 17 January meeting on 
additional spending cuts of DM7.5 billion, Scharping doubted 
that the planned new borrowing could be limited to DM70 billion. 
Scharping said Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel's 
(Christian Social Union -- CSU) budget "borders on a 
falsification of the balance sheet." 
  There were differences of opinion on the budget policy 
within 
the Free Democratic Party [FDP]. According to party chairman 
Klaus Kinkel, the government will not survive 1994 without a 
supplementary budget. This was rejected by Federal Economics 
Minister Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) as "adventurous speculation." At 
the ministers' meeting, Kinkel rejected additional spending cuts 
in the defense and educational sectors. He said the Bundeswehr 
was not the nation's reserve cash box. Following talks with 
scientific organizations, Kinkel stressed the importance of 
biotechnology for Germany as an investment center. The 
Christian Democratic Union presented its economic program on 17 
January. It is supposed to show ways out of the economic crisis 
over the medium term and was approved by the party's leading 
bodies at a closed meeting in Windhagen near Bonn last weekend 
[15-16 January].

<F P=106> [Michael J. Inacker report: "Will 20,000 Fewer Conscripts </F>
Be Called Up Than Originally Planned"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The Bundeswehr must expect further drastic 
cuts totaling at least 1 to 1.2 billion German marks [DM] in the 
current fiscal year. Thus, it becomes questionable whether its 
serviceability can be maintained to the originally planned 
degree. 
  According to WELT AM SONNTAG, the new cutbacks, higher than 
the Bundeswehr leadership expected, are part of a necessary 
austerity package that the government and the coalition want to 
use to cover a budget deficit of DM5 billion. On Monday [17 
January], Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic 
Union) and other ministers affected by the austerity measures 
are to meet with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The Bundestag group 
leaderships will discuss the required cutbacks on Tuesday, and 
the Budget Committee on Wednesday. 
  The leadership of the Defense Ministry and the defense 
politicians of the government coalition intend to absorb the 
latest cuts largely within the existing structures and with a 
planned Bundeswehr strength of 370,000 men, and not carry out 
fundamental changes concerning the Bundeswehr planning over the 
next few years. 
  Through cutbacks in training, exercises, and Armed Forces 
maintenance, and by "waiting for the election year to pass," 
further reductions in investments and modernization are to be 
forestalled, an officer pointed out. According to the latest 
calculations, the share of investments in the defense budget 
will drop to 21.9 percent in 1994 (in 1989, before the collapse 
of the socialist camp, it was 32.4 percent). 
  Defense Ministry officials hope that these are the last 
cuts, 
and that the Bundeswehr will have a budget of DM47.5 billion at 
its disposal from 1995, as agreed between Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl, Finance Minister Theo Waigel, and Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe in June 1993. Only if these promises are kept are the 
additional cutbacks acceptable, officials pointed out. 
  The following measures are expected: 
  -- 50 percent reduction of the funds for training and 
exercises. Thus, the costs for railway transports and the 
transfer of an army division will be lowered from the planned 
DM5 million to 2.5 million. In the main armed forces divisions, 
exercises at the unit level (battalion, brigade, division) will 
be drastically reduced. For the first time, the cuts also affect 
exercises of the crisis reaction brigades. 
  -- Expense allowances of soldiers for stays at training 
areas 
("bush money") will partly be reduced by 20 percent. For some 
divisions, this will mean DM1.5 million instead of DM2.5 million. 
  -- Duty training of reservists will be reduced. 
  -- Funds for material maintenance -- that is repair or 
replacement of wornout equipment -- will be reduced by 15 
percent. 
  -- The annual flying hours of air force pilots will be 
reduced from 180 (as demanded by NATO) to 150. 
  -- Construction and infrastructure projects will be reduced. 
Thus, the planned transfer of the officer's college from Hanover 
to Dresden might be postponed. 
  -- To "save money quickly," about 10,000 to 20,000 fewer 
conscripts are to be called up throughout 1994. This measure 
will be particularly effective in the second half of the year 
and means that over 100 companies will not be complete or will 
have to remain idle for three months. However, this entails 
problems concerning the recruitment of young officers. 
  Within the Armed Forces, the expected cuts have been 
described as "disastrous for the motivation" of the young 
soldiers and conscripts in particular. On this basis, it will 
no longer be possible to achieve training goals (above all, 
"combined arms combat") in many areas. 
  For Paul Breuer, the defense spokesman of the Bundestag 
group 
of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union, this 
"additional defense budget contribution to balancing the federal 
budget is unavoidable." However, the austerity measures do not 
require a new Bundeswehr structure. "Amid great difficulties, 
it might be possible to save DM1 billion in 1994 that might 
relieve the budget considerably." 
  Breuer cited "quicker decisions on applications for early 
retirement among civilian personnel" as possible fields where 
money can be saved. He mentioned a "possible amount of DM250 
million." Moreover, rationalization measures in the spheres of 
supply, material maintenance, and operation should be moved 
forward. Also, money will be released as a result of the end of 
the Somalia mission on 31 March. 
  According to the planning guideline issued by Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe in fall last year, the Bundeswehr is 
again, to a greater extent, to be considered an entity. In 
fact, the division into rapid reaction and main defense armed 
forces remains, but the development of a two-class army should 
be prevented. 
  After experts favored lighter forces transportable by air, 
mechanized armored units are to be given priority again because 
of UN experiences in Bosnia and Somalia and the increased army 
awareness of its task to defend the country. There are plans to 
upgrade the combat effectiveness of 225 "Leopard II" and of 
another 600 armored personnel carriers of the army to "Marder 
A3." On Ruehe's orders, it is to be determined whether 
approximately 160 multipurpose support helicopters (UHU) should 
be procured instead of the planned 75. There are also plans to 
buy the jeep-like light reconnaissance vehicle "Zobel" for 
crisis reaction and UN tasks. 
  The personal equipment of the soldiers is also to be 
improved. The new combat uniforms, the new helmets, and the 
fragmentation protection vests are to be supplied more quickly. 
The obsolete G-3 rifle is to be replaced with a more modern and 
lighter weapon with a smaller caliber (5.56 mm). 
  For the Navy, eight new frigates and four U-212 submarines 
are still planned -- in the interest of the German weapons 
industry.

by Rolf Kleine; place and date not given: "Lafontaine -- Lower 
Wage Earners Should Pay Less Taxes"] 
  [Text] [Kleine] Finance Minister Theo Waigel wants to cut 
the budget by 5 billion marks this year. Will this be enough? 
  [Lafontaine] No. The government's monetary policy is 
careless 
and unjust. Public debts are exploding and the costs are just 
passed on to the little people. 
  [Kleine] What do you suggest? 
  [Lafontaine] The worrying increase in public debts has to be 
stopped. This is a precondition for overcoming mass 
unemployment. 
  [Kleine] More specific? 
  [Lafontaine] For the Social Democratic Party of Germany, 
investment and jobs are a priority. The budget cannot be 
restored without taking unpopular decisions. 
  It is necessary to cut superfluous tax subsidies, as well as 
personnel costs and defense expenditures. 
  It is also necessary to fight industrial crime, subsidy 
fraud, and illegal work and take firm measures against the 
misuse of social benefits. 
  [Kleine] No further tax increases? 
  [Lafontaine] For people earning average incomes, the 
breaking point has long been reached. This is why we want to 
lower taxes on wages and salaries so that the tax burden on low 
and medium incomes gets back to tolerable proportions. 
  In order to strengthen companies' investment capacity and to 
lower the unjust gap, higher taxes on high private incomes and 
property are, however, an absolute must. 
  Yet, the tax burden on industry must not get any higher. 
This is a concept that is also accepted by industry.

<F P=106> ["ub."-signed report: "Extremely Inhumane Deportation </F>
Practice"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The Free Democratic Party [FDP] has sounded 
the alarm regarding the treatment of war and civil war refugees. 
Interior Affairs spokesman Burkhard Hirsch said in Bonn it was 
an "unworthy situation" that, because of financial differences 
between the Federal Government and the land governments, these 
people are not given the status promised to them by law and thus 
the right of temporary residence. The respective provision in 
the Foreigners' Law was not applied, because granting residence 
permission required agreement between the Federal Government and 
the land governments. The "miserable" fate of many refugees 
hardly appeared to play a role. This led to civil war refugees 
such as the Kosovo Albanians being deported back to be doomed. 
  The parliamentary initiative Hirsch announced to solve the 
problem is backed by Federal Commissioner for Foreigners 
Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen (FDP). Deputy Ulrich Irmer and 
Federal Executive Board member Guido Westerwelle also joined the 
initiative. Irmer said the treatment of civil war refugees in 
Germany also caused foreign-political harm, because words did 
not match deeds, and this burdened Germany's credibility. 
  Hirsch said that according to the German law, civil war 
refugees are not entitled to asylum. However, since these 
people were not given the special status promised, they often 
applied for an asylum procedure without any chance of success. 
Therefore, they could also be deported. In addition, it also 
meant that people who worked and had a place to stay burdened 
the public welfare system against their will. According to the 
FDP politician, the conflict between the Federal Government and 
the land governments over the distribution of costs and quotas 
prevents the granting of special status under Section 32a of the 
Foreigners' Law. Hirsch demanded that Federal Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl now meet with the minister presidents. 
  For example, the untenable situation led to the deportation 
of young Kosovo Albanians who had escaped military service in 
the Serbian Army, said Hirsch, Irmer, and Westerwelle. It was 
known that in the Serbian Army, they were mistreated, often 
tortured, and picked for extremely dangerous missions. The 
German deportation practice was not only profoundly inhuman, but 
also contradicted the spirit of the arms embargo against Serbia, 
because Germany even supplied the Serbian aggressors with 
soldiers. 
  Hirsch said the federal interior minister had failed to 
renew 
a halt to extradition, with the argument that there was no 
agreement among the federal laender. This was intolerable, 
since no information had been given as to which countries 
pursued the extradition of refugees. The interpretation of the 
legal provisions contradicted their spirit, said Hirsch.

<F P=106> [Josef Joffe: "Washington as `Mother of All Brokers'"] </F>
  [Text] Henry Kissinger, the architect of the 
"disentanglement agreement" of 1974, would probably have advised 
Bill Clinton against the Geneva meeting with Hafiz al-Asad, 
citing too big a risk for the U.S. President and too much honor 
for the Syrian counterpart. It cost the former U.S. secretary 
of state many sleepless nights (and an even bigger belly) after 
the Yom Kippur war to achieve the disengagement of the Israeli 
and Syrian troops on the Golan Heights. Kissinger had to shuttle 
seemingly endlessly between Damascus and Jerusalem. He had to 
fight for every centimeter in order to wrest the signature from 
the two enemies. 
  Clinton now planned to write history in a single afternoon. 
That he honored the Syrian president by spending five and a 
half hours with him was no direct gain for peace but, for the 
time being, only for Al-Asad, whose country is still on the 
State Department's list of terrorist states. It will not be 
easy to figure out what result was achieved. Al-Asad wraps 
himself in ambiguous silence. What he allegedly said the world 
only gets to know from U.S. sources. 
  Al-Asad himself made the following statement: If Jerusalem 
"has sufficient courage to react to this kind of peace, a new 
era of security and stability will emerge in which normal, 
peaceful relations will exist among all." The U.S. diplomacy 
described this immediately as a success, because the word 
"normal" is the magic formula for which Israel has been waiting 
for such a long time. 
  As is common practice in Middle East diplomacy, Israel's 
first reaction was demonstrative reservation. They want to know 
what "normality" means, and whether Al-Asad can define the term 
himself. So far, only Clinton has said that it means open 
borders, diplomatic relations, and free trade. Those who know 
the rules of the game may assume that Al-Asad will only provide 
more information once Israel takes another step. One week ago, 
the head of government, Rabin, sent an equally cryptic signal: 
"So far I have only mentioned a withdrawal from the Golan -- 
and not from the entire Golan." No changes are planned in this 
respect, he added. "Yet when the question arises, we must 
discuss it." 
  During the weekend -- if talks are resumed -- the Israelis 
and Syrians should tell each other in Washington what they 
really mean. At best, these talks will produce a verbal minuet: 
"If normalization, then withdrawal in principle" (in Hebrew) 
and "if withdrawal, then normalization in principle" (in 
Arabic). In practice, this will probably take a decade: 
Alternately a little withdrawal, a little normalization. 
  Clinton wants to accelerate this procedure by offering U.S. 
peace troops for the Golan. If Congress should approve that, 
Clinton would personally become the broker and guarantor of 
peace. This risk is even higher than the reverence he paid to 
Al-Asad in Geneva.

<F P=106> [Jacques Amalric commentary: "Europe After Clinton"] </F>
  [Text] Officially, all of President Clinton's European 
interlocutors are satisfied: The Twelve, who heard the White 
House chief praise the European Union and recognize its separate 
identity in the security and defense sphere; the NATO members; 
and, above all, the Alliance bureaucracy, which heaved a sigh of 
relief when Bill Clinton reaffirmed that he would keep a minimum 
of 100,000 men on the Old Continent and confirmed that the 
Europeans could "borrow" the organization's logistics for 
missions in which the United States did not wish to participate; 
the Central and East European countries, which certainly did not 
secure integration into NATO but who were assured that the 
security of their states "is important for the security of the 
United States;" and finally Boris Yeltsin, who was once again 
accepted as the only Russian interlocutor for the United States 
and whose claims to the former Soviet Republics have not been 
thwarted. 
  That makes a large number of people, not counting saxophone 
lovers, who are beginning to find the presidential tone a little 
thin. Perhaps too many people. And everybody is already 
wondering: Who will pay for the U.S. President's ulterior 
motives or errors of analysis? 
  President Clinton's behavior on the Bosnian issue has not 
allayed these fears; quite the reverse. Despite the efforts 
made, particularly by France, for the United States to become 
involved, Bill Clinton turned a deaf ear; there is no question 
of Washington intervening in the crisis or encouraging the 
Muslims to accept the peace plan laboriously drawn up by the 
Europeans. All the information we have suggests the opposite: 
U.S. services are not refraining from secretly arming the 
Muslim forces which have launched a counteroffensive. The 
Bosnian crisis does not jeopardize American interests. The 
Europeans, who last year rejected the American proposals for 
attacking some Serbian positions and lifting the embargo on arms 
for Bosnia, will therefore have to extricate themselves from the 
mess. 
  Although things are even less clear, the Twelve must expect 
more unpleasant surprises as regards the Central or East 
European countries, toward which they have shown far too much 
indifference: There will be growing American pressure to make 
the European Union bear more of the burden and be less reluctant 
to open its borders to the products of these fragile 
democracies. The United States will be in a good position in 
this sphere and will find interested listeners in Warsaw, 
Prague, or Budapest when it explains that the strengthening of 
the reemerging democracies depends more on economic development 
than on entry into a military alliance which might only whip up 
Russian hegemonistic tendencies. 
  Neoisolationism and the defense on all fronts of American 
economic and commercial interests are the two axes of the 
foreign policy pursued by the former governor of Arkansas, who 
is still heeding the opinion polls that tirelessly tell him this 
is the desire of U.S. public opinion. One, two, or three trips 
to Europe will not be enough to alter this fact, unless there is 
a Russian disaster. Averting such a disaster was the main aim 
of Bill Clinton's visit. Officially, the U.S. President is 
working for the integration of a democratic Russia in Europe. 
In practice, it is as if he was prepared to make do with a 
democracy that is more superficial than real, and with accepting 
the legitimacy of a Russian sphere of influence coinciding 
(aside from Ukraine and the three Baltic Republics at present) 
with the borders of the former Soviet Union. Moreover, there is 
nothing to say that Boris Yeltsin, who knows his country better 
than the American strategists, is particularly interested in his 
country's hypothetical integration into Europe. On the other 
hand, he seems infinitely more interested in maintaining 
Russia's role as a nuclear superpower. Hence the importance he 
attaches to the agreement on the denuclearization of Ukraine, 
even if it has little chance of being approved by the Kiev 
Parliament: He will have shown his "goodwill," whereas the 
Ukrainian deputies will have confirmed their irresponsibility. 
  Europe is no more certain of its destiny after Bill 
Clinton's 
visit than it was before. 
  But it can no longer put forward false excuses or cherish 
illusions: It knows, because it has been told, that it can only 
rely on its own forces and its own will.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Russia Without Mr. Gaydar"] </F>
  [Text] By promising, on taking his leave from Boris 
Yeltsin, to "pray for the success of the reforms" in Russia, 
Bill Clinton was taking a dangerous gamble. A few hours later, 
in fact, we learned of the resignation of Yegor Gaydar, the very 
symbol of that reform policy. 
  This departure by the former prime minister may seem 
logical. 
Yegor Gaydar, who, with Boris Yeltsin, was the main loser in the 
12 December parliamentary elections, is merely acting on the 
defeat of his party, Russia's Choice, which despite considerable 
resources and unconditional support from television, was clearly 
overtaken by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. This election highlighted 
one of the main handicaps of Yegor Gaydar and his friends: 
Their inability to show they understand the fate and concerns 
of their compatriots. 
  Although he does not refer to this in his resignation letter 
-- he preferred to "go out" on two stronger themes, and 
especially the very costly construction of a new parliament 
building -- Yegor Gaydar, and the whole liberal wing of the 
government, were seriously weakened by the December election. 
His influence within the executive was reduced accordingly. 
What the government will lose in talent and international 
reputation -- rightly or wrongly, Mr. Gaydar was regarded as the 
guarantor of reforms with regard to the Western governments and 
the international financial institutions -- it could perhaps 
gain in cohesion. 
  [Prime Minister] Viktor Chernomyrdin's previous "team" was 
characterized by a plethora of staff and serious disagreements 
among the ministers. What could the advocates of 
ultraliberalism and the supporters of the "status quo" do 
together other than what they have done for two years -- namely, 
implement a seesawing economic policy that in many cases 
succeeded in combining the injustices of rampant liberalism and 
the cumbersome aspects of a persistent collectivism? 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin's hour seems to have come. Chosen by 
Boris Yeltsin in December 1992, but from the list put forward by 
the Supreme Soviet deputies to replace Yegor Gaydar, this 
representative of big industry is particularly in favor with the 
president since his declared loyalty during the "White House" 
insurrection last October. The prime minister will henceforth 
have a free hand to implement the "centrist" policy he 
advocates. This team, smaller and more homogeneous, will 
nonetheless have to define and impose this mythical third path 
which aspires to be both reformist and social.

<F P=106> [Article by Corinne Moutout: "Alain Juppe on Official Visit </F>
to Johannesburg"] 
  [Text] After a stopover in Cairo, Alain Juppe arrived in 
Johannesburg yesterday evening on an official three-day visit -- 
the first French foreign minister to do so in 18 years. Long 
awaited by current South African leaders, this visit should 
render official the "normalization" of relations between the two 
countries after a decade of open hostility. 
  With just four months to go to the first multiracial, 
general 
elections, Edouard Balladur's government is seeking to give 
greater emphasis to "French support for the current process of 
transition," a communique from Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] 
indicated. The visit by the foreign minister therefore marks 
his "confidence in the South Africa of tomorrow and in its will 
to give new impetus to bilateral relations," the communique 
added. 
  Edouard Balladur showed his interest in the development of 
democracy in South Africa with a private visit a few months 
before last year's legislative elections. For the future prime 
minister of a government of the right, it was primarily a 
question of renewing contact with the ANC [African National 
Congress], which had previously maintained "exclusive" relations 
with the Socialist government. Spearheading a Western crusade 
against the apartheid regime, in 1985 Laurent Fabius 
unilaterally imposed economic sanctions against South Africa, a 
decision that ranked France clearly alongside the ANC while 
concurrently benefiting its principal competitors -- Great 
Britain and Germany, which did not follow its lead. 
  Following in the footsteps of Edouard Balladur, Alain Juppe 
-- who will meet President Frederik de Klerk; ANC President 
Nelson Mandela; and Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the leader of the Zulu 
Inkatha Party -- must complete this rebalancing, which is 
essential to new French policy in Africa. In fact, France has 
been trying for several months now to secure "fruitful 
partnership relations" with South Africa, the most advanced 
country in Africa and the continent's future center of 
development. There is a need to find additional outlets for 
French companies which, despite some spectacular deals (such as 
selling seven A-320 Airbuses and doubling investments (3 
billion francs) in three years), have little chance of making up 
for lost ground on the South African market.

<F P=106> [Article signed O.B.: "Le Pen Tells His Party's National </F>
Council that Mr. Mitterrand Cannot Fail To Call Anticipated 
Parliamentary Election"] 
  [Text] Less than three weeks before the party's national 
conference, scheduled for 4 to 6 February in Port-Marly 
(Yvelines), the FN [National Front]'s national council met in 
Paris on Saturday 15 January. At the end of the meeting, [FN 
President] Jean-Marie Le Pen made a long speech in which, among 
other things, he asked for the resignation of National Education 
Minister Francois Bayrou. As for the Falloux Act, he charged 
the government with yielding to demonstrators' pressure. 
  Stating that his party is nearing "the time of a decisive 
battle," the extreme-right leader reviewed the various elections 
scheduled until the end of 1995, starting with the district 
election in March, for which he was to begin on Monday 17 
January a tour which will take him to every department of 
metropolitan France. Le Pen will not run in this election, but 
he will head the FN list for the European election in June and 
will, for the third time, run in the presidential election. 
"There is still some hope of seeing Francois Mitterrand seek a 
third term of office", Le Pen said, adding that he suspected the 
head of state of working toward creating the conditions for him 
"to die surrounded with the splendor of the republic." 
  Le Pen said he was convinced that Mr. Mitterrand would 
dissolve the National Assembly before the presidential election. 
"I would be surprised if the president of the Republic did not 
use this weapon in order to considerably cut down the current 
majority," to which he gave the following "warning": "Should 
government impotence become the norm (...), it is clear that 
nature, which abhors a vacuum, will bring forth new forms of 
political action." 
  Le Pen, who has become more strident in his criticisms of 
Mr. 
Balladur -- whom he accuses of worsening France's standing on 
all counts -- considers that "French people must be quite 
disappointed with the centrist policies of the UDF [Union for 
French Democracy] and RPR [Rally for the Republic]." We shall 
do everything we can to take advantage of the historic 
opportunity we are being given," warned the extreme-right 
leader, stating that "the solutions advocated by the National 
Front" are "the sole alternative" leading to "the vast power 
changeover" he has been waiting for.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Francois Roche: "Dissatisfaction Spreading </F>
Among Employers"] 
  [Text] Since last March, the government and the employers 
have been living with a misunderstanding. Edouard Balladur came 
to power planning to deregulate the economy and reduce the 
burden of compulsory contributions, but he has had to bow to the 
fact that the economic problems were more serious than expected. 
He has not been able to avoid falling into a quarrel that has 
been going on in France for more than 10 years: After granting 
a number of cost reductions to enterprises, the government says 
it expects a resumption in hiring. That has not happened. 
  Since last week, the misunderstanding has grown even worse, 
relating both to conditions that could be imposed on the 
reimbursement of VAT and the incentive regulation to create jobs 
in a number of service activities. This policy, which is, to 
say the least, voluntary, has the gift of annoying enterprise 
chiefs. Of course, the CNPF [National Council of French 
Employers] is taking care not to show its disappointment too 
abruptly, but dissatisfaction is growing in the ranks. 
  What are the employers saying in private? First, that the 
government seems to have run out of imagination in the sphere of 
economic policy, without having obtained any notable result. 
Domestic demand is still lifeless. And yet its recovery is the 
vital precondition for a resumption in investment and 
employment. "We cannot see any driving force likely to revive 
the economic machinery rapidly," the CNPF economists say. 
  The second main criticism the employers are making of the 
government is linked with the state's spending rate: It is 
tending to increase. "The size of the noncommercial economy in 
France is becoming untenable," the boss of a large private 
industrial group said. Without a reduction in contributions, 
there is no reduction in the cost of labor, and hence there is a 
need to resort to job cuts to remain in world competition. This 
is the scenario large French employers say they are 
"experiencing." 
  "The economy is no longer in a position to tolerate social 
security contributions, which continue to increase by 6 to 7 
percent each year, whereas resources are increasing by 1 to 2 
percent," the latest CNPF bulletin states. 
  There is, therefore, a risk of the government losing 
credibility in employers' circles. The electoral consequences 
of this would be nonexistent or almost nonexistent. However, 10 
months after being carried to power by this country's economic 
leaders, this is certainly not something Edouard Balladur 
expected.

<F P=106> [Guido Passalacqua report: "Rooting for Italy Weds League"] </F>
  [Text] Milan -- A day of shameless, extreme denials -- 
including even denials of obvious facts -- was followed late in 
the evening by an admission, in the best tradition of 
old-fashioned politics. This is what happened with the meeting 
in Brescia between People's Party leaders Mino Martinazzoli and 
Roberto Formigoni and the League's Lower House floor leader, 
Roberto Maroni, the great architect of the liberal-democratic 
alignment. The meeting was supposed to be top secret and could 
perhaps have marked a politicoelectoral turning point, but 
instead saw no change in its participants' starting positions. 
Basically, this means that Martinazzoli remains unwilling to 
establish electoral agreements with the League. 
  The three politicians' desire for secrecy was undermined by 
an unknown citizen of Brescia who informed an ANSA correspondent 
about Maroni and Formigoni arriving at Martinazzoli's office, 
thus nullifying all the precautions and denials. The meeting 
was organized by Formigoni, who had been bombarding Maroni's 
telephone answering machine with messages since Friday [14 
January]: His aim was to find a point of agreement between the 
League and the former Christian Democrats, albeit only on the 
principle of not competing in the electoral constituencies. 
  In the event, after over an hour's discussions, the three 
parted without any shift from their starting positions. After a 
series of "no comments," Maroni admitted: "There is nothing 
doing; they are going their own way." Then in an official 
statement he said: "My impression is that there is no scope for 
joint action." He added: "I listened to Martinazzoli's 
arguments, his `yeses' and `noes' to the entry of the People's 
Party [PPI] or of what remains of it in the alignment that is 
taking shape, and I acknowledged a situation of basic 
irreconcilability between our positions." 
  In practice, this was the final admission of the 
impossibility of an agreement with Martinazzoli's former 
Christian Democratic Party [DC]. Shortly before that a 
statement emanating from circles close to the People's Party 
Secretariat confirmed the outcome of the meeting. 
Martinazzoli's adviser, Rocco Buttiglione, commented: "The 
center has already been established between [Pact for Italy 
leader] Segni and Martinazzoli," in practice excluding the 
League from a key role in the future alliance. The only ones 
who interpreted the Brescia meeting positively were the 
neocentrists, who have their bags packed and are ready to set 
off for an accord with the League and who judged the failure of 
the meeting in Brescia a good thing. 
  But Maroni's hectic morning did not stop in Brescia, in 
Martinazzoli's legal practice on via Gramsci. After his private 
meeting with the secretary of the PPI-DC, he set off back down 
the highway and by 1330 was at Silvio Berlusconi's villa at 
Arcore. This was another political meeting, this time more 
productive. Over lunch Berlusconi, Maroni, and the organizers 
of Rooting for Italy discussed everything. Starting with a 
stocktaking of the political situation. Maroni explained the 
situation regarding relations with the Catholics and Segni 
following the meeting with Martinazzoli, then they broached the 
main issues on the agenda -- drawing up lists of candidates and 
examining the constituencies. Names of a number of figures from 
the entertainment and sports world have already been mentioned. 
The crucial issue of whether or not Berlusconi will stand as a 
candidate was also broached. For the present it seems that 
Fininvest's president has not yet decided and that he is waiting 
to see more clearly how the situation evolves. Meanwhile, an 
agreement has apparently been reached on the League and Rooting 
for Italy presenting single candidates in the various 
constituencies under the same symbol. 
  Yesterday's two political meetings strengthened the League's 
grip. On the one hand, the League members saw specific 
confirmation of what they have been saying over and over for 
days and what they confirmed with the decisions adopted by the 
Federal Council session at the end of last week -- that is, that 
there is no scope for maneuver with Martinazzoli, despite the 
fact that some people portray the secretary of the former DC as 
willing to come to an agreement with the League. On the other 
hand, however, stronger relations are being established with 
Berlusconi, who is now the League's special partner. Maroni is 
already listing the components of the alignment: "The 
neocentrists will be there if they separate from the DC; Rooting 
for Italy, if it enters the arena; the liberalistic Center 
Union; the European federalists, if they so decide; and the 
nonconfessional components of the Pact, if they do not follow 
Segni in his suicidal agreement with Martinazzoli. And, last, 
something new -- a left-wing grouping that is not following the 
communists: Rete and Communist Renaissance. But not the 
Socialists; they will have to sit this one out." 
  In the middle, between [League leader] Bossi and 
Martinazzoli, sits Mario Segni. The League and Berlusconi are 
pulling him one way, and Martinazzoli, the other. The League is 
hoping to win over the referendum leader, but is not counting on 
it too much. The signs are that, as the League put it, he is 
"bound by a double chain to Martinazzoli," but in the confused 
scenario of the center there are plenty of conflicting signs. 
Having established an agreement with Berlusconi, and pending a 
decision from the neocentrists, who should be arriving very 
soon, having settled their business with Martinazzoli, the 
League is now pondering the real question: What will Mario 
Segni do? 
  The League and Berlusconi are willing to grant him the role 
of prime minister, as proposed by the liberal-democrats, but are 
pressing for Segni to make up his mind quickly. Meanwhile they 
are working from the sides. Sunday [16 January] Maroni invited 
Segni to a meeting, and yesterday the referendum leader replied 
in an interview: "I am ready to engage in an exchange of views 
with Bossi, especially after the abandonment of the League's 
extremist stance on the three Italies. The exchange of views 
with the League," Segni said, "must take place on the program 
presented by the Pact for Italy Saturday." As for Berlusconi, 
Segni said again: "He must be careful not to fragment the 
center." Maroni replied from Milan: "We have sought a meeting 
with Segni, but we have not yet received an invitation. The 
political timetable is determined by the new electoral law. 
There are only two or three days. Then if he does not want to 
meet with us, we will go ahead without him." Indeed, there is 
talk of a meeting between Segni, Bossi, and Maroni already 
scheduled for Wednesday or Thursday, at the latest.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Social Movement Secretary Gianfranco </F>
Fini by Federico Guiglia in Rome; date not given: "Fini: `We 
Are Free-Marketeers And Democrats'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- They asked him to break with the past and he 
replied that fascism was an experiment "definitively consigned 
to history." Now, however, Gianfranco Fini, secretary and the 
"ferryman" of the MSI [Italian Social Movement] toward the 
National Alliance, is taking another step. On the very eve of 
the two assizes that, just a few days apart, will lead to the 
birth of the "Alliance" and will restore the MSI, Fini disclosed 
to IL GIORNALE: "The National Alliance will be the 
confederation of several players and not just an electoral 
cartel. What must unite the MSI and the Alliance is a strong 
awareness of values. Let me explain: The full acceptance of 
democracy as a system as well as a method, faith in the free 
market, labor as a player in the economy, and the nation as a 
focus for synthesis and solidarity. The aim is clear: We must 
avoid Italy falling into the clutches of [Democratic Party of 
the Left, PDS, Secretary] Achille Occhetto." 
  [Guiglia] Is the "democratic" turnaround a strategic move or 
is it merely propaganda to be able to participate in the 
"moderate pole?" 
  [Fini] There is an electoral and political bargaining table 
on the Left where Communist Renaissance Chairman Cossutta and 
Republican La Malfa are about to sit down with Occhetto from the 
PDS. On the other hand, the Italian people must know that we 
are now back to square one, since a similar and opposing 
alignment is needed -- but there is none. Italians must also 
know that it is not the fault of the Right if the moderates are 
split. The person responsible for that is called Mario Segni, 
the leader of the national rebirth "hesitaters," and the one 
who deceives the electorate by maintaining that he wants to be 
different from Occhetto but refusing to have anything to do with 
us. PDS man D'Alema is right -- deals are done with those who 
have the votes: the MSI in the center and south and in the 
border regions, and the League in the north. Segni is not an 
alternative to the PDS but is the whitewashed savior of 
[Christian Democratic Party, DC, Secretary Mino] Martinazzoli 
and Rosy Bindi of the new People's Party that is not yet born 
but which is already suffering from its fatal attraction to the 
PDS. 
  [Guiglia] How can you speak of the "free market" when you 
are 
accused of representing a "statist" party? 
  [Fini] Here there are at least two major misunderstandings 
to 
clear up. The National Alliance will not be statist, just as 
the MSI does not want to be statist. Believing in the state 
means caring for its weakest members and giving those regions in 
difficulty the conditions enabling them to develop themselves. 
National solidarity -- and even the pope has said this -- is 
exactly the opposite of patron-and-client welfarism and of the 
choices of real socialism implemented by those who have been in 
power for many years. The other major deception is called 
federalism. In Italy we need strong decentralization which does 
not, however, distance citizens but brings them closer to their 
-- today inefficient -- state. Presidentialism is the freeway 
of the Second Republic. 
  [Guiglia] Do you accept the definition of you as a 
"liberal-democrat?" 
  [Fini] Labels do not make any difference. Now even 
Zhirinovskiy considers himself to be a liberal-democrat, only to 
ally himself with the neo-Nazis in half of Europe. I simply 
feel myself to be a nationalist in the modern and Western sense 
of the word. I reject any kind of chauvinism or imperialism. I 
love my country as much as I love freedom. 
  [Guiglia] Be honest: Do you really think that with the PDS 
in the government we will see Cossacks coming to drink at the 
fountains of Saint Peter's? 
  [Fini] There will, of course, be no return to the events of 
1948. However, that is not a good reason to accept that the 
legitimate heirs of communism should take control thanks to a 
new electoral system that may give them the majority of seats in 
Parliament, even though they will certainly not win the majority 
of the Italian people's vote. To carry out the operation we 
need to find someone like Segni, ready to gather the consensus 
of the moderates and then become prime minister and head of a 
coalition of the People's Party, the PDS, and the Democratic 
Alliance. Naturally this would be under the banner of a 
precondition -- the requirement of nonetheless having to form a 
government of guarantee because of a uninominal electoral model 
that did not include the direct election of the prime minister 
or of the president of the republic which we repeatedly urged. 
  [Guiglia] To be together, everyone must give something up. 
The League no longer speaks of federalism. What will be the 
National Alliance's "step back?" 
  [Fini] Certain hypocritical moderates have applauded [League 
Secretary Umberto] Bossi who was one day waving the flag of 
federalism and the next day was happy with regionalism. They 
are the same people who now are trying to say no to the National 
Alliance, even knowing full well that if we won tomorrow we 
would not be forcing anyone to put on the black shirts again. 
The reality is that Bossi is just putting on a show, whereas 
the National Alliance is a true change of direction. Give 
something up? We will give up the presumption that Segni has 
not given up: believing that we can win on our own. 
  [Guiglia] Who should be the moderates' candidate for the 
Palazzo Chigi [government seat]? 
  [Fini] Certainly not Bossi, who is not at all popular in the 
center and south and seriously losing his popularity in the 
north. 
  [Guiglia] Is [Fininvest chairman Silvio] Berlusconi a 
colleague or an opponent to be fought? 
  [Fini] Berlusconi is an important interlocutor who, unlike 
Segni, is clear and straightforward. The one we have to beat is 
Occhetto.

  [Text] The "Popular Party" was formed at the Sturzo 
Institute today, 75 years after the appeal [made by Christian 
Democratic Party, DC, founder Father Sturzo] to the "free and 
strong." [Education Minister Rosa Russo] Iervolino, [DC Chamber 
of Deputies spokesman Gerardo] Bianco, and [DC Deputy Gabriele] 
De Rosa were alongside [DC Secretary Mino] Martinazzoli. Among 
those invited were Giovanni Spadolini and Giorgio Napolitano, 
the speakers of the two chambers of parliament, as well as 
members of the old DC, including Amintore Fanfani, Paolo Emilio 
Taviani, Emilio Colombo and Ciriaco De Mita. Shortly before, 
Martinazzoli had alluded to the absence of the centrist faction. 
He said the Italian Popular Party was being born "without some 
friends who, for reasons I am not politically able to decipher, 
have decided not to participate in this undertaking. This makes 
me bitter, but this defection can in no way convince me to give 
up ideas I believe to be right even as far as the outlook is 
concerned."

<F P=106> [J.R. Ventosa report: "Garcia Vargas Says Society Was </F>
Reconciled With Its Armed Forces in 1993"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas 
stated yesterday in his speech to the king on the occasion of 
Armed Forces Day that 1993 "was the year of Spanish society's 
reconciliation with its Armed Forces," thanks to the blue 
helmets' conduct in Bosnia-Herzegovina, "although all units have 
also contributed to this." 
  Garcia Vargas spelled out in his speech the measures adopted 
by the Defense Ministry during the past year in order to make 
progress in the process of reorganization and modernization of 
the Spanish Armed Forces, and set out some of the worrying 
realities of the international situation, which is in a period 
of change "in which uncertainties abound." 
  Thus, he referred to the "hotbeds of tension caused by 
intolerant and aggressive nationalist movements," which make 
"more necessary than ever" UN efforts to help pacify them. 
Referring to the Spanish military participation under the UN 
flag in those international conflicts -- particularly that in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina -- he said that "our troops' self-sacrificing 
work is alleviating suffering, saving thousands of lives, and 
gaining distinction which causes us all to owe a debt of 
gratitude." 
<H5>  European Security </H5>
  The defense minister also spoke of the security aspect of 
the 
process of European building, announcing Spain's support for the 
U.S. "Partnership for Peace" initiative, which will help bring 
four Central European countries closer to the Atlantic alliance; 
a matter which will be discussed at the coming NATO summit, to 
be held in Brussels next week. 
  Nevertheless, and still regarding NATO as a "factor of 
security throughout the continent," Garcia Vargas said that the 
political union "should assume greater prominence through the 
Western European Union [WEU] in its dual manifestation as the 
European pillar of the alliance and the [European] Union's 
security structure." 
  On this point, he stated that the Spanish contribution to 
this new European defense identity will take shape in the coming 
incorporation of Spanish units into the European Army Corps and 
in participation in the future air-sea force currently being 
planned by the WEU. 
  In the domestic sphere, Garcia Vargas emphasized the 
budgetary problems experienced by the Armed Forces in 1993, 
which have necessitated revising all their equipment programs. 
After giving an account of the main arms projects for this 
year, announcing others which will be approved in 1994 -- the 
investments program bill and the military service regulations, 
and emphasizing the importance of the latest to enter into force 
-- the personnel law and the recruitment regulations, the 
minister announced that the government will approve "soon" the 
joint plan for the reorganization of the three services, 
including, among others, the Army's "Lodestar Plan" ["Plan 
Norte"]. 
  Garcia Vargas called for "the understanding of territorial 
bodies throughout Spain" for this important joint plan, which 
will entail a new stage of winding up units, bases, and military 
installations, with less geographical dispersal throughout Spain. 
  The final part of his speech was in fact devoted to Spanish 
society's rapprochement with the Armed Forces, manifested in the 
offer by many draftee servicemen to take part voluntarily in 
international peacekeeping missions "and in Spanish military 
personnel's cooperation in humanitarian tasks with young people 
in civilian organizations." 
  On this point, the minister took the opportunity to 
criticize 
"a section of our young people who maintain an aloof stance 
toward the Armed Forces." "Their demurring stance," he said, 
"is aimed at a now superseded stereotype of the Armed Forces 
which bears little relation to reality." Although the defense 
minister maintained that "it cannot be expected" that 
"preconceived ideas and social attitudes will pass away 
quickly," he showed himself convinced that this current of 
insubordination existing in Spain "will also be surmounted."

<F P=106> [Julio Riquelme report: "People's Party Sets Election in </F>
Fall of 1995"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The People's Party national leadership 
has centered its political strategy on the certainty that Felipe 
Gonzalez will call a general election in the fall of 1995, with 
October as the month most likely to witness this new appointment 
with the polls, according to what prominent leaders with offices 
on Genova Street have told this newspaper. 
  According to the same sources, this conviction is based on 
the fact that the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] has 
only two choices when it comes to attempting to win a new term 
in power, in view of the fact that the current government has 
shown itself in just six months' existence to be "incapable of 
facing up to its minimum responsibilities." These choices would 
be to hold the general election before the successive timetable 
of municipal and European elections -- both of which are 
scheduled for this year -- or else to postpone it "in order not 
to acknowledge this government's failure so obviously by 
dissolving it after less than a year's existence," according to 
People's Party leadership members. 
<H5>  Madrid Test </H5>
  The People's Party strategists see this second option as 
more 
feasible, so the general election would be held when the echoes 
of the autonomous community elections are still ringing in 
political offices. In this connection, particular importance is 
attached to the results in the Madrid community. 
  "Leguina will not be running, because he himself has said 
so, 
and it is for him to say," Alberto Ruiz Gallardon, People's 
Party spokesman in the Senate, recently assured this newspaper. 
In the People's Party leadership's opinion, the candidates for 
the succession to the current Madrid premier are Jose 
Barrionuevo and, to a lesser extent, Juan Barranco. Barrionuevo 
worries the People's Party because he is regarded as "a worthy 
man with an image, and very popular in Madrid." This is not the 
case with Barranco, "who is always playing a double game" -- 
referring to his "calculated" fence-sitting between the 
renewalists and Guerraists -- "in order not to miss any boat," 
according to the sources. 
  The People's Party believes that the next autonomous 
community elections are its big chance to govern the Madrid 
community as an essential step toward reaching the Moncloa 
Palace, "in view of the showcase status which Madrid has in the 
rest of the state." 
  Not to win the 51 seats giving an absolute majority in the 
Madrid Assembly would be deemed a major failure by the People's 
Party, and Ruiz Gallardon himself acknowledged to YA that "if I 
do not win a majority, then it will be time to say good-bye." 
  The People's Party takes it for granted that the capital's 
city council is assured, although the PSOE will seek a `poster' 
candidate with an image to compete with Alvarez del Manzano. In 
this case, Genova Street's greatest fear is that the PSOE will 
opt for Fernando Moran, who is credited with "sufficient pulling 
power" to threaten the municipal majority. 
<H5>  European Elections </H5>
  As a first step in the People's Party strategy for tackling 
the general election, the debate centers on whether the European 
elections, scheduled for 12 June, should be tackled as a 
"primary" or a "special" election, prone to surprises and 
"exotic, Ruiz Mateos-style" candidacies, according to People's 
Party leadership members. 
For the present, the view that Jose Maria Aznar should openly 
support Abel Matutes' candidacy for Strasbourg seems to be that 
of the majority, because a victory in Europe -- which the 
European People's Party deems more than feasible -- would be a 
good starting point at the national level. 
  Another basic factor which will mark the People's Party 
strategy for the hypothetical date of October 1995 -- apart from 
the evolution of the crisis -- will be the outcome of the 33d 
PSOE Congress, which will reflect -- according to the People's 
Party leaders consulted -- the party's true correlation of 
forces, and which therefore will make it possible to guess which 
candidates the Socialist Party will put forward in the election 
and especially whether it will continue to set aside its 
internal differences in order to present an image of unity for 
the polls. 
<H5>  CiU Would Remain Key Factor </H5>
  The People's Party team of election strategists -- a team in 
which Deputy Secretary General Mariano Rajoy has emerged as the 
strong man (he will direct the People's Party campaign for the 
European elections) -- do not trust Felipe Gonzalez' signs of 
approaching retirement. "He is always giving signs, but never 
acts," YA was told by the People's Party leadership. 
Nevertheless, if Gonzalez did not run for the premiership in 
1995, the People's Party believes that this would smooth much of 
its way toward being the party with most votes. 
  However, the strategists themselves take it for granted that 
this victory will be very far from securing an absolute 
majority, so the nationalist parties, and specifically 
Convergence and Union [CiU], would remain a key factor for the 
stability of the legislative term. People's Party leaders 
flatly reject the possibility of a "Greek-style pact" with the 
United Left, and take it for granted that "the PSOE will not 
wish to burn itself out with us." 
  Relations between CiU and the People's Party are "terrible," 
it is asserted in the People's Party. However, there is a 
conviction that, if the situation arose, it could have Catalan 
support. "Roca would justify himself by saying that he was 
helping us for the country's good, and in the meantime he would 
continue to work for Catalonia," the sources state. "But he 
should be clear," they add, "that we will not be as soft as the 
PSOE."

<F P=106> [Article by Teijo Valtanen: "Finland Has Invested More in </F>
Research Than Average EU Level; High-Tech Exports Have Increased 
Faster Than Imports"] 
  [Text] Data presented by the Statistics Center on Friday 
[19 November] paint a favorable picture of the Finnish research 
and development activities situation. In the Statistics Center 
comparison, Finland's investment in research narrowly exceeds 
the average level for the European Union. Still, in Germany and 
Sweden, for example, a clearly larger percentage of the gross 
national product (GNP) than in Finland has been invested in 
research. 
  About 10.4 billion markkas, which is about 1 percent more 
than in 1991, was used for research and development activities 
in Finland last year. 
  Research and development's share of the GNP rose from 2.1 
percent to 2.2 percent. This relative change is in large part 
due to the decrease in the GNP, but, on the other hand, it shows 
that research activities have not declined at the same rate as 
production. 
  Dependent on research activities, the Finnish high-tech 
industry exported 13.5 billion markkas worth of products last 
year. There were 2.7 billion markkas more in foreign high-tech 
imports than exports. 
  In accordance with the OECD definition, production in which 
research and development expenses are in excess of 4 percent of 
sales volume is considered to be high tech in the Statistic 
Center's calculations. 
  High-tech products accounted for 12.6 percent of Finland's 
exports last year, which was 1.6 percentage points more than in 
1991. 
  The most important high-tech exports were communications 
equipment, electrical appliances, and ADP equipment. The 
technology products most frequently imported by Finland were ADP 
equipment and chemicals. 
<H5>  Drugs and Communications Tops in Technology Products </H5>
  According to a study conducted by Markku Virtaharju and 
Mikael Akerblom for the Statistics Center, high-tech development 
in Finland has focused especially on the drug industry and the 
manufacture of communications equipment. These industries 
clearly stand out above the others if the so-called intensity of 
the R&amp;D--that is, the ratio of expenditures for research and 
development to the value of production--is used as a yardstick. 
  The industries differ from one another like night and day as 
concerns research and development activities. The communications 
equipment manufacturing industry, which received the highest 
rating for R&amp;D intensity, a parameter used in the Statistics 
Center comparison, was 236 times higher than the publishing 
industry, which received the lowest rating. 
  In terms of general technology levels, the highest-level 
industries are manufacturers of instruments, computers, and 
electrical appliances, in addition to drugs and communications 
equipment. The ratio of direct and indirect investments in 
technology to production value was used as a yardstick of the 
technology level in the study. 
  Like investment in research, according to the Statistics 
Center study, technology as a whole is at its lowest level in 
the production of foodstuffs, textiles, and wood products, as 
well as in the publishing industry. The order corresponding to 
the technological levels of the industries remained in the main 
the same throughout the 1980's. 
<H5>  Finlandia Interface Lives Product Development </H5>
  According to production chief Karl Lahtinen, Finlandia 
Interface, which manufactures electrical equipment, puts well 
over 10 percent of its sales volume, which will come to about 58 
million markkas this year, into product development. 
  In the Statistic Center's classification, the industry, 
represented by the company, comes under the heading of 
industrial electrical equipment, which in Finland includes 
mostly industries that invest in research and development 
activities. 
  The sales volume of the company, which develops and produces 
power sources, that is, certain kinds of electrical transformers 
suitable for various kinds of equipment manufactured by client 
firms, has quintupled over the past eight years. Over the past 
two years its sales volume has nearly doubled, in part thanks to 
the devaluation of the markka. 
  According to Lahtinen, the development effort has paid off. 
They have not had to increase sales volume with [bargain] sales, 
but the company's profit margin has also increased. 
  Along with its increased sales, the company has added to the 
number of its employees, but not nearly proportionately to the 
increase in sales volume. Lahtinen believes that the future of 
Finnish industry is largely dependent on high tech, but it will 
not become the savior of the employment situation, at least not 
quickly. 
  According to Lahtinen, aside from being developed to be 
technologically better, their products are also being developed 
in such a way that they can be produced with increasingly less 
labor.

<F P=106> [Article by Pentti Laitinen: "Elimination of EU Tariffs Will </F>
Stiffen Newspaper Competition; Forest Industry: GATT Agreement 
More Important Than Tariffs"] 
  [Text] According to a report published in Geneva on 
Wednesday [8 December], the European Union (EU) and the United 
States have reached agreement on a sector solution regarding 
wood-processing products in the round of GATT talks. According 
to the agreement, the so-called Quad countries (the EU, the 
United States, Canada, and Japan) will eliminate duties on paper 
and wood products within 10 years. 
  According to the preliminary reports, the sector solution 
includes the elimination of tariffs on paper products over a 
transitional period of 10 years. Tariffs will be reduced 50 
percent during the first five years. The parties to the 
agreement can, however, separately decide on a timetable for the 
first phase. 
  Claes von Ungern-Sternberg, the manager of Forest Industry, 
Ltd., thinks that the elimination of tariffs will stiffen the 
competition in Europe, but that changes in currency exchange 
rates are at the present time of considerably greater importance 
to Finnish firms' competitiveness than how high tariffs are. 
Finland's paper exports to the EU countries have been duty free 
since the quota period that ended in 1984. The big paper 
producers, the United States and Canada, pay from 4 to 9 percent 
in tariffs on their exports to the EU. 
  The elimination of tariffs will automatically raise an 
exporter's coverages by about 1 clearance percent. Von 
Ungern-Sternberg does not think that this will trigger price 
competition, "although that would be possible in principle." 
  From the standpoint of Finland's forest industry, North 
American producers' competitiveness will improve primarily as 
concerns newsprint. The latter accounts for nearly 80 percent of 
Canada's paper exports to the EU countries. Within 10 years the 
elimination of tariffs will mean a saving in costs of over 300 
million markkas to these producers. 
<H5>  United Will Lose Its Relative Advantage </H5>
  As for us Finns, over a 10-year period we will benefit to 
the 
tune of about 50 million markkas from our exports to North 
America and Japan. Chiefly magazine paper is exported from 
Finland. The new, duty-free importing into Europe's markets will 
primarily affect those Finnish manufacturers who are big 
producers of newsprint in Finland and in Europe. Typical of 
these is United Paper Mills. 
  So far, European publishers have had their way in that North 
American producers have had a 600,000-ton, duty-free quota on EU 
markets, a quota that they have been able to increase through 
individual decisions. According to manager von Ungern-Sternberg, 
this quota will evidently be eliminated and that will, as far as 
they are concerned, make it easier for the Canadians to gain 
access to Europe. "From the industry's standpoint, the creation 
of an integrated GATT is more important than tariffs, which have 
already been substantially lowered for years now. Nowadays those 
competitive factors involving environmental issues or monetary 
policy are more essential than tariffs," he said. 
  "For the EU countries, the paper industry has always meant 
cheap trade goods since there are no European forest nations at 
the negotiating table. Autos, electronics, textiles, wines, and 
agricultural products carry substantially more weight in the 
EU's trade policy," von Ungern-Sternberg said.

<F P=106> [Article by Unto Hamalainen: "Persons Influential in Foreign </F>
Policy Fall Into Two Groups: Politicians Stick to Neutrality, 
Government Officials Support Alignment"] 
  [Text] Those who wield the most influence on Finland's 
foreign policy are divided into two schools of thought with 
regard to how Finland's foreign and security policies should be 
handled in future. 
  In the opinion of the political decisionmakers--members of 
the Eduskunta and ministers--Finland should follow a foreign 
policy line of cautious neutrality, one that adheres to 
nonalignment. Politically, supporters of this approach are found 
in the left and in the center. 
  In the opinion of high-ranking officials responsible for 
foreign policy and international relations in the ministries, 
Finland should try to align itself. 
<H5>  Two Schools </H5>
  According to the hopes of the officials, Finland should move 
closer to the European Union (EU) and the NATO defense alliance. 
  The managers of the big export companies are in sympathy 
with 
the officials' views. 
  The difference in point of view comes out in an opinion poll 
commissioned by the Foreign Policy Institute, which was 
published on Wednesday [15 December]. Dr. Weijo Pitkanen, an 
institute researcher and political scientist, conducted the 
poll. The Finnish and Russian Peoples' Friendship Society funded 
the poll. 
  Pitkanen refers to the first-mentioned school as the 
"neutrality school" and the second one as the "alignment school." 
  Conducted by the Finnish Gallup Company, 214 influential 
people responded to the poll. The questions were sent to 
representatives of the church, the political parties, the big 
export companies, the Armed Forces, and the news media, in 
addition to the politicians and government officials. The 
president of the Republic did not participate in the poll. 
  Pitkanen described the respondents as "Finland's foreign 
policy elite." All of the respondents either directly or 
indirectly influence the making of foreign policy decisions. 
<H5>  Officials Changed Views </H5>
  Pitkanen saw in the results of the poll a noticeable change 
to the old way of handling foreign policy in the days of the 
Paasikivi-Kekkonen line. Specifically, in past years officials 
saw to it that Finland adhered closely to a policy of 
neutrality, while politicians were willing to be flexible, as 
necessary. 
  The Armed Forces and the church are trying to walk a 
tightrope between the two schools of thought. The Armed Forces 
support EU membership, but, as supporters of an independent 
defense, the military entertain doubts about NATO membership. 
  The news media's position is inconsistent. According to the 
poll, the media are hesitant about EU membership, but there is 
support for NATO membership among them. 
  A certain indecisiveness is reflected in the results of the 
poll. The "secure," bipolar system has disintegrated, and a new 
system of cooperation that gives the impression that it will 
endure has not yet been found. The respondents are pleased with 
the disappearance of the old system. 
  In agreement with the official line, nine out of 10 
respondents declared that the bases for Finland's foreign and 
security policies are an independent defense and action within 
the framework of the CSCE. 
  They expressed the hope that the CSCE would be developed 
into 
a new, pan-European security system, but they do not have very 
great faith that it will. 
  Only a fifth of the respondents felt that the CSCE is an 
effective guarantor of the stable evolution of Europe. They had 
even less faith in the United Nations. 
<H5>  Confidence in EU and NATO </H5>
  On the other hand, they had great confidence in the EU and 
the NATO defense alliance. Three out of four respondents felt 
that NATO is an effective guarantor of the stable evolution of 
Europe, and two out of three respondents felt that the EU is. 
  Eight out of 10 respondents felt that membership in the EU 
is 
desirable. They took a more cautious view of membership in NATO: 
The percentages of those in favor of membership in it and those 
opposed to it were even. 
  Membership in the EU was felt to be especially desirable by 
42 percent, while only 14 percent felt that way about membership 
in NATO. 
<H5>  Russia Feared </H5>
  Their attitudes toward Russia were also split. On the one 
hand, they hoped that Russia would participate in European 
cooperation and, on the other, they expressed suspicion and fear 
of it. Russia was not viewed as a military threat, but primarily 
a civil threat. 
  They felt that Russia's environmental problems, the increase 
in professional crime, its economic difficulties, and the rise 
in big brother nationalism are the biggest threats. 
  Two out of three respondents thought that "the threat posed 
to Finland by the situation in Russia is growing." 
  The poll was conducted in the fall, in part before Rutskoy's 
and Khasbulatov's attempted coup, but clearly before the Russian 
elections. 
  The respondents were asked for their opinion as to how 
Finland should prepare for the Russian threat. 
  The influential respondents' indecisiveness shines through 
their responses: Over half of them reject the view that Finland 
should apply for membership in NATO because of Russia and over 
half of them are also in favor of traditional neutrality. 
<H5>  Karelia Not Wanted </H5>
  The return of Karelia did not receive very much support in 
the poll. Only a small percentage of the respondents stated that 
they support the submission of an official proposal to Russia 
that negotiations on the return of Karelia be initiated. 
  Some sympathy for negotiations on Karelia is to be found in 
the church and the Armed Forces. 
  The influential respondents' optimism was also assessed in 
the poll. In Weijo Pitkanen's opinion, most of the respondents 
are pessimistic [about the future]. Only the members of the 
Eduskunta and the ministers were categorized by Pitkanen as 
being "optimistic."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Patients Quite Satisfied With Care"] </F>
  [Text] If the patient survey of randomly selected consumers 
of health care services undertaken by Finland's Consumer 
Association and Finland's Patient Association in 
October-November is to be believed, Finns are quite satisfied 
with the health care they receive. 
  Fully 84 percent of the 1,043 individuals who answered the 
questionnaire were either satisfied or very satisfied with their 
care, and even slightly more felt that doctors, nurses, and 
other personnel treated them well or very well. Patients in the 
private health care sector believed they were better treated 
than those in the public sector did. 
  Very few patients had much comment upon the professional 
skills of the medical personnel. Even so, it appeared that they 
placed greater confidence in doctors and other health care 
workers in the private sector than in the public sector. 
  Nor did patients complain about the information they 
received. Over 80 percent believed that they had received 
adequate information from doctors and nurses. The general 
opinion seemed to be that nurses were a little better than 
doctors in giving out information expected of them. And once 
again, the new survey showed a slightly better percentage for 
the private sector than for the public sector. 
  And yet, the large majority felt that health care services 
should be financed entirely (24 percent) or partially (72 
percent) through taxes. Only 23 percent of those queried felt 
that health care was expensive or very expensive. Should more 
health care services be subject to fees, the consensus was that 
families with children should receive special access to care. 
  The survey was undertaken in eight areas: Bjorneborg, 
Helsinki, Jakobstad, Joensuu, Jyvaskyla, Rovaniemi, Salo, and 
Tammerfors. Unfortunately, local results were not yet available 
when the Consumer Association announced the results yesterday. 
  The survey left many unanswered questions. It will likely be 
repeated next year in order to get a better idea of the 
recession's effect on health care standards. 
  For example, in Jakobstad, the questionnaire was divided 
between Jakobstad's hospital and Ostanlid's hospital. 
  "We do not know whether the patients were actually satisfied 
at Ostanlid, which is threatened with closure, or whether they 
gave the care there very high marks in order to show that they 
wished to keep the hospital," said Karl-Gustav Sodergard, 
chairman of Finland's Patient Association. 
  The patients' message to the policymakers overwhelmingly 
concerned the standard of care. The unanimous opinion: Do not 
cut costs to the extent that the quality of care will suffer.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Norwegian Prime Minister Gro </F>
Harlem Brundtland by Egil Knudsen; place and not given] 
  [Text] "Norway does not want to say `no' to future NATO 
membership for the countries of Eastern Europe, but is offering 
a process toward ever increasing cooperation. Today 
`Partnership for Peace' is the best response, because it does 
not also create uncertainty in other countries." 
  This is Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland's summing up of 
the situation on the eve of Monday's and Tuesday's important 
NATO summit in Brussels where she will head the Norwegian 
delegation. Several former Warsaw Pact (WP) countries want rapid 
membership of NATO and many people are calling the meeting the 
organization's most important meeting for years. 
  The prime minister agrees with this description: "The 
previous summit in Rome a couple of years ago was also 
important. It decided NATO's position after the fall of the 
Wall. Now developments have moved on with new challenges which 
need constructive responses. The meeting is therefore of 
crucial importance." 
  [Knudsen] Why is Norway negative toward the possibility of 
the former East bloc countries becoming members? 
  [Harlem Brundtland] I think that it is wrong to put the 
question in those terms. For a long time there have been talks 
among all the NATO nations and there have been gradual 
developments. After the last summit the NACC (North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council) was the concrete response for increased 
cooperation between NATO countries and the former WP countries. 
Now we are building further on our experiences and are entering 
into even closer cooperation. Norway wants openness, in future 
developments too. 
  [Knudsen] So former East bloc countries could become members 
in the longer term? 
  [Harlem Brundtland] Yes, that is possible. We are offering 
a process toward ever increasing cooperation. 
  [Knudsen] Would new members and an extension of NATO's 
borders toward the East have a destabilizing effect in the 
present situation? 
  [Harlem Brundtland] Yes, membership for a few selected 
countries would be a less satisfactory solution. The new 
proposal for cooperation, "Partnership for Peace," is a concrete 
and good response. Nor will such a response create uncertainty 
in other countries. [Harlem Brundtland ends] 
  The prime minister stressed that this response is flexible 
and adapted to individual countries: "NATO is offering similar 
bilateral agreements with interested countries, and also 
additional agreements for each individual country adapted to its 
cooperation needs." 
  [Knudsen] Could Russia also join "Partnership for Peace?" 
  [Harlem Brundtland] Russia will also receive an invitation. 
We are not creating divisions, but are aiming at developments 
involving democratic controls over and structures for the 
military forces. 
  [Knudsen] What will NATO's main future role be in this 
scenario? 
  [Harlem Brundtland] NATO will continue to build on what was 
contained in the original 1949 package: Looking after the 
territorial integrity of member nations. Now that we are 
extending cooperation to the east, we must not throw out the 
baby with the bath water. The responsibility NATO has had must 
continue to exist; new cooperation with other states is 
something additional. 
  [Knudsen] But NATO's traditional enemy image no longer 
applies? 
  [Harlem Brundtland] That is correct, but nor do we have any 
guarantee that we could not be attack by other countries. We 
still need mutually committed cooperation. 
  [Knudsen] The United States is scaling down in Europe. Will 
not the Western European Union assume a larger part of the 
burden? 
  [Harlem Brundtland] The Western European Union will be given 
the additional role of NATO's European pillar. But this will 
not mean that the original role underlying NATO will disappear. 
[Harlem Brundtland ends] 
  Gro Harlem Brundtland also stressed that the government has 
broad support in the Storting for its future NATO course.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Among Friends for Peace"] </F>
  [Text] From passivity Bill Clinton has moved to swift 
action. After the summit in Brussels the talks in Prague with 
central European leaders were a relaxation prior to the contacts 
in Moscow with Boris Yeltsin and other Russian leaders. But 
what can the U.S. President achieve in the nervy beginning of 
Russia's new "parliamentary" phase, and what sort of security 
solutions are he and other NATO leaders actually offering Europe? 
  One would like to see key players being able to achieve 
great 
things. Take the newly launched Partnership for Peace (PFP), 
for example. Of course it would mean a great deal if a number 
of central European states did not simply feel disappointed, but 
actually saw an opportunity to begin to make a practical 
contribution in a far-reaching security arrangement. 
  And take Clinton's belief that his meeting with Yeltsin will 
strengthen Russian democracy and developments toward a market 
economy or his conviction that he has solved the problem of 
Ukraine's nuclear arms. If only it were so simple. 
  Or take the Brussels summit's decision to sharpen up the 
bombing threat against Bosnia's Serbs, if they continue to defy 
the United Nations. If only these Serbs, the strongest side in 
war-torn Bosnia, were to finally say to themselves that this 
time NATO is in earnest about its warning. Then the UN 
peacekeeping forces could at least perform some of their 
humanitarian mission among people who are under threat from the 
horrors of a second winter of war. 
  However, in reality NATO is restating its previous, never 
tested readiness to intervene using aircraft, if General 
Secretary Butrus-Ghali at the request of the UN commanders on 
the ground orders the first armed action. But as a result of 
losses among French soldiers French President Mitterrand has 
finally been forced to back a seemingly new purposefulness. 
NATO is also making a direct linkage not only (at Clinton's 
request) to the lifting of the Serbs' strangulation of Sarajevo, 
but also to demands for a change of guard in besieged Srebrenica 
and the opening of the airport at Tuzla to Hercules aircraft 
with necessary supplies for a suffering civilian population. 
  Tuzla's role in this context is of direct significance for 
Sweden. According to the warning that has just been repeated in 
Brussels, NATO aircraft could be deployed where the Nordic 
battalion has its headquarters in direct combat against Bosnian 
Serbs. We can ponder what this could mean for the Nordic 
troops' activities on the ground, but NATO's attitude 
illuminates as if by lightning the potential importance of the 
PFP offer. 
  NATO's plans, whose aim is to hold back outside countries' 
wishes for full membership, opens up what are perhaps completely 
new cooperation possibilities that have never been on the agenda 
before as far as Sweden is concerned. 
  In its diffuseness PFP clearly does not go far toward giving 
central Europeans a feeling of increased national security. But 
through joint exercises, maneuvers, consultations, and liaison 
officers a country like Sweden would have an insight into and be 
involved in the planning of peace operations that are of 
importance to the security of the whole of Europe. 
  The Bildt government's reaction has been one of welcome, and 
the Social Democratic Party suddenly seems to see PFP as 
something operationally better than a role in the consultative 
NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council], of which it was until 
recently a keen supporter. The idea is that the PFP will be 
tailor-made for each country, and Sweden must of course take a 
closer look at the possibilities -- particularly in the light of 
the fact that today the Nordic battalion is already under a UN 
military command which has in practice been set up by NATO. 
  But we have to realize that the prospects now opening up 
will 
not necessarily lead to a totally harmonious front against 
disturbers of the peace embracing both the United States and 
Russia. 
  Russian ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's comment on 
NATO's bombing warning was that Mitterrand is mad. This is the 
same Zhirinovskiy who, after his unfortunately success in the 
elections in December, is preparing to try to dominate the 
Russian parliament's second chamber, the Duma. 
  It is good that Boris Yeltsin is sticking to the new 
constitution which in principle increases his independence of 
the popularly elected assembly. But the president clearly 
thinks it unwise to go against Russian nationalism, which could 
just as well be called imperialism or revanchism. Government 
head Viktor Chernomyrdin reiterated to the Duma on Tuesday that 
the pace of reform will be slowed down; we do not know what 
scope for maneuver overwintering Russian reformist ministers 
will have. 
  Today's Russia is in all its misery a great power which is 
threatening its little neighbor, Latvia, with a "very tough 
reaction." Not an easy partner for Bill Clinton.

  [Text] The Cypriot Government believes that British Foreign 
Minister Douglas Hurd will exert his influence to break the 
Turkish intransigence on the Cyprus issue during his visit to 
Ankara the day after tomorrow. 
  Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said today that the 
British foreign minister will not only refer to the 
confidence-building measures, but will also stress that the 
status quo in Cyprus is unacceptable and cannot continue.

  [Text] The United States and Britain have permanent 
relations and contacts with the so-called Turkish "embassy" in 
the occupied areas, and have maintained consular offices there 
for many years. The U.S. and British diplomatic missions 
appointed to Cyprus have developed relations with the illegal 
regime and Ankara's spokesman in a form that directly recognizes 
the pseudostate and legalizes the invasion. 
  After Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate 
special representative on Cyprus, British High Commissioner 
David Dain, and U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher had separate 
meetings with Tugay Ulucevik, Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy 
under secretary, at the Turkish "embassy" building, government 
spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis yesterday revealed: On 29 October 
(Turkish National Day) every year, U.S. and British diplomats 
participate in a reception hosted by the Turkish "ambassador." 
  Kasoulidhis confirmed that these two countries maintain 
consular offices in the occupied areas. (Britain's office is on 
Shakespeare Street in occupied Nicosia and the U.S. office is in 
Kyrenia). According to reliable information, Turkish Cypriots 
work in these offices under U.S. and British diplomats. The 
same reports say that the U.S. and British diplomats often 
violate the Cypriot Government's rule and stay in the occupied 
areas for over 24 hours. (One diplomat recently stayed in the 
occupied areas for three days) 
  The Cypriot Government knows the identities of the diplomats 
visiting the occupied areas. Asked, the spokesman said the 
government would not control the movements of diplomats who 
cross to the occupied areas at the Ledra Palace Hotel. He added 
that no action has been taken or demarches made with regard to 
these incidents. The spokesman said the foreign minister will 
talk to the U.S. and British ambassadors about their meeting 
with Ulucevik and refer to their relations with the Turkish 
"ambassador." He will also ask Feissel to explain. 
  Asked about the meetings, Kasoulidhis said that despite 
these 
countries repeatedly stressing that they do not afford the 
occupation any status, we cannot consider meetings in the 
occupied areas with representatives of the occupation force as 
an acceptable policy. 
  Kasoulidhis was quick to explain the reasons persuading 
Dain, 
Boucher, and Feissel to meet Ulucevik. He stressed: "These 
meetings obviously aimed to exert influence with Ankara at a 
time when Ulucevik would be communicating with the Turkish 
Cypriot leadership to formulate the Turkish position on the 
confidence-building measures. These and other actions highlight 
Turkey's responsibility for the ongoing deadlock and for future 
developments." 
  Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis yesterday had a working 
luncheon with Feissel. He is expected to meet the U.S. and 
British ambassadors in the next few days. 
  DIKO [Democratic Party] issued a statement saying that the 
foreign diplomats and UN representatives' meetings with 
Ulucevik, at the very least, show contempt and a lack of respect 
for the legal Cypriot Government.

  [Text] Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis has said it is 
ridiculous for the Turks to believe Greece has aggressive plans 
because its defense doctrine is well known. Arsenis' comment 
came in response to Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's 
statement about Greek threats not enabling Turkey to 
demilitarize its western shores. The minister described Turkish 
verbal aggression as an awkward effort to attract international 
attention. He added there has been no increase in the number of 
airspace violations, which remain at the same level. He said 
Turkish planes are immediately intercepted. 
  On Saturday [22 January] the defense minister will meet 
Cypriot President Glavkos Kliridhis in Thessaloniki to discuss 
the joint Greek-Cypriot defense area.

  [Excerpt] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said if 
Skopje shows the goodwill Greece expects, the government could 
reexamine its veto on the state's accession to the CSCE. 
  [Begin Venizelos recording] If Skopje demonstrates the 
goodwill Greece has repeatedly sought--and still does, because 
this is an obligation derived from international law--then the 
Greek Government could reexamine the veto on Skopje joining the 
CSCE. [end recording] 
  Venizelos added that Greece is ready for talks with Skopje 
within the UN framework, but on the basis determined by the 
government. Commenting on remarks Alternate Foreign Minister 
Theodhoros Pangalos made on Skopje yesterday, Venizelos stressed 
that as Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said, he and Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias are handling the issue. 
  The spokesman stressed that the issue is being raised on 
many 
levels, and recalled that it was recently raised on the highest 
possible level, the NATO summit. He said the prime minister had 
the opportunity to utilize one advantage of the European Union 
Presidency. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Greek Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis said the 
old danger from the East and the new situation in the Balkans 
require Greece to restructure its defense doctrine to 
effectively defend the country from old and new dangers. 
  In an address at the Larisa headquarters, Arsenis discussed 
immediately implementing the new program. He said it would soon 
change the structure and meaning of national defense. Arsenis 
said: At the very most, the goal is to create Armed Forces that 
will be well prepared for war and will be ruled with meritocracy.

<F P=106> [Article by N. Khasapopoulos: "Turkish Trap on NATO </F>
Commands"] 
  [Excerpts] A maneuver by Ankara is creating a crisis in our 
relations with NATO, creating at this time unpredictable 
political and military repercussions. 
  The issue of establishing the commands has caused tension in 
Greek relations with NATO, following a well-planned Turkish 
trap, which everyone involved (that is, the new armed forces 
leadership, but also the minister of national defense) is now 
attempting to defuse through various initiatives. 
  The situation that was created is quite difficult for the 
Greek Government, since the initiative at this time belongs 
exclusively to Turkey, which, in a spectacular and sudden policy 
change, has refused to accept the establishment of commands in 
Greece, to which it had initially agreed. Greece has already 
committed its first mistake: during the last meeting of the 
Alliance's defense ministers, it did not bring up the issue of 
the commands' establishment, acting on the advice of NATO 
Secretary General Woerner. 
  Why Greece listened to Mr Woerner's request and failed to 
bring up the issue of the commands at the defense ministers' 
meeting, when our minister left Athens for Brussels with the 
intention of tabling this vital issue on a priority basis has 
not yet been explained. What is certain is that, with the 
Turkish veto on the establishment of the Greek commands and the 
Greek veto on the establishment of all commands (including those 
in Italy), new tension has emerged in Greece-NATO relations. 
[passage omitted] 
  Minister of Defense Yerasimos Arsenis is now preparing to 
give battle to keep the commands in Greece and to avoid the 
Turkish traps set almost daily at alliance headquarters. Such a 
trap already exists, with Italy as the main actor. 
  The Italians never understood why they suddenly lost the 
commands because of Greco-Turkish differences, given that the 
outcome of the Greek veto was the operational blockage of all 
five commands located in various areas of Italy. With the 
encouragement of the Turks and of higher NATO officials, the 
Italians are already pressuring the Greek Government to lift the 
veto on Italy and maintain it only against Turkey. 
  At first glance, such a move by the Greek Government seems 
natural, since there are no military differences between Italy 
and Greece. However, is this really so? Athens knows very well 
(as affirmed by political sources) that by lifting the veto on 
the establishment of all the commands of NATO's southern flank, 
it loses its most important bargaining chip, as well as the only 
issue that would enable it to exert pressure to achieve the 
conditions it hopes for to reinforce its defenses.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The 31 December left-of-center Athens 
daily TA NEA reports that Russian "supernationalist" Vladimir 
Zhirinovsky was given permission by Deputy Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Yiorgos Papandreou to enter the country and visit 
Salonica for a few hours. This is surprising, the newspaper 
suggests, given Zhirinovsky's statements during his visit to 
Sofia, when he advised Bulgaria to extend by annexing Greek 
Thraki and Skopje. TA NEA also blames government spokesman 
Evangelos Venizelos, who "induced the newspaper into error" by 
characterizing the news of Zhirinovsky's Salonica visit, which 
surfaced in the Italian newspaper LA STAMPA, as a "journalistic 
mishap." TA NEA cites Greek diplomatic sources as saying that a 
more serious problem would have ensued had the Greek side 
refused to allow Zhirinovsky into the country, given that he was 
a big winner in the recent Russian elections. 
  According to the 3 January TA NEA, the Greek Government is 
preparing a demarche to the "Russian side" to protest 
Zhirinovsky's remarks on Thraki, while Yiorgos Papandreou is 
claiming that the Russian's Salonica stay was a "transit, not 
official, visit." TA NEA quotes Papandreou as saying in an 
interview on the SKY radio station that "the issue at that time 
was not substantive and was faced as such." Papandreou also 
maintained that Zhirinovsky's Sofia remarks were made after the 
Russian's departure from Greece. The deputy minister further 
argued that the Greek Government decided to downgrade the visit 
because it thought the incident was not serious .

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The Panhellenic Socialist Movement 
(PASOK) government's course in the past two and a half months is 
a target of bipartisan criticism in the Greek press. 
  Writing in the 30 December Athens center-left daily 
ELEVTHEROTIPIA, Nikos Kiaos blames Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou for lacking a central policy, despite claims during 
his electoral campaign that PASOK was ready to govern and, 
hence, possessed solutions for the problems he inherited. 
Initiatives in the domestic field, according to Kiaos, have 
lacked the needed essential coordination. Measures have been 
taken "helter-skelter," resulting in the submission of only a 
few bills to the Chamber of Deputies. While low-key tones and 
consensual solutions were stressed in the first few weeks of 
government, in a departure from past acrimonious politics, 
governmental initiatives have indicated a return to "partisan 
patriotism" at times worse than the former New Democracy (ND) 
Government's excesses, Kiaos contends. While this occurred in 
the field of public transportation and in the armed forces 
appointments, the economy is the sector where the lack of a 
specific program has become most apparent, he notes. The 
government had announced a dialogue with the various social 
classes, setting the middle of January for the implementation of 
the measures to be adopted. Kiaos believes the deadline will 
pass without significant results, for the interlocutors of a 
"weak and unstable" government remain inflexible. Foreign 
policy is another sector that is deeply affected. The Skopje 
problem remains unresolved and Greece is taking over the EU 
[European Union] presidency at a time when relations with its 
partners are "particularly poor." Kiaos' proof of the lack of 
coordination is that Papandreou neglected to meet with either 
the minister of foreign affairs or his deputy before they 
traveled to Brussels on 20 December, where the former was to 
deal with the Bosnian situation and the latter participated in 
the meeting of EC foreign ministers. While the government has 
only been in place for a brief time, this short period has been 
sufficient to give an indication of its future, unsatisfactory 
course, Kiaos concludes. 
  The lack of governmental coordination is discussed in an 
article in the 24 December right-of-center Athens daily 
ELEVTHEROS TIPOS. The article focuses on the disagreement 
between Minister of National Economy Yiorgos Yennimatas, who 
advocates an "immediate and drastic" cut in interest rates, and 
Bank of Greece Governor Yiannis Boutos, who "categorically" 
opposes such a move, arguing that Yennimatas' positions "do not 
take into account the real economic situation." The article 
also stresses the personal side of the disagreement, pointing 
out that the two officials are on "different wave lengths" 
within PASOK and that Yennimatas was displeased with Boutos' 
appointment at the helm of the Bank of Greece. Furthermore, it 
contends that Yennimatas is being "undermined" by other party 
"heirs apparent," as well as certain--unnamed--close Papandreou 
aides intent on his replacement. Finally, the article cites Bank 
of Greece sources as stating that Yennimatas is under pressure 
from a number of state-owned bank governors to lower the 
interest on government bonds to allow them to reduce interest on 
deposits, and hence on loans to commercial and private entities, 
with a view to increasing their own profit margins.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The pressure groups now taking shape in 
the opposition New Democracy (ND) are the subject of commentary 
in the Greek press. 
  According to Bambis Papapanayiotis in the 25-26 December 
center-left Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA, newly elected ND leader 
Miltiadhis Evert is presently faced with "pressure groups" 
within his party, each "pushing in a different direction." 
Background maneuvering focuses on Evert's dilemma of either 
practicing a low-key, constructive opposition vis-a-vis the 
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government, or following 
a hardline policy that may lead to serious confrontation. At 
this time, Papapanayiotis contends, Evert is trying to maintain 
an "acrobatic" equilibrium between the two versions, and is 
called upon to deal with: 
  -- Pressure from the group still faithful to former Prime 
Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis--now in difficult straits 
because of the wiretapping affair during his watch. The group 
knows that the more conflicting the relationship with the 
government, the more protection will be accorded to Mitsotakis 
in case of legal entanglements, Papapanayiotis contends. Members 
of this group include ND luminaries such as Sotiris Kouvelas, 
Stefanos Manos, Vasilis Manginas, Dora Bakoyianni, Nikolaos 
Gelestathis, and Y. Dhimitrokallis. 
  -- Pressure from the "modernizers," who are Evert's "natural 
allies" but insist on an immediate break with the ND's 
"Mitsotakian past" to regain the party's lost traditional 
adherents. The group includes ND officials such as Yeoryios 
Souflias, Stavros Dhimas, S. Khatzigakis, and Athanasios 
Kanellopoulos, who, according to Papapanayiotis, "agonize" over 
losing "precious" time in the modernization effort. 
  -- Pressure from the advocates of a liberal, free market 
economy led by Andreas Andrianopoulos, who is requesting a 
clarification of the party's ideology and political goals. 
  -- Finally, pressure from those "generally dissatisfied," 
such as Mikhail Papakonstandinou, recently stripped of party 
attributes. 
  Within this "cacophony," Evert is attempting a balancing act 
that aims at "hard criticism for governmental handling of 
institutional matters or reprisals against ND members, but 
low-key, constructive opposition with proposals in the 
legislative field," Papapanayiotis concludes. 
  According to the 30 December left-of-center Athens daily TA 
NEA, Evert has resolved to ignore ND hardliners demanding an 
immediate confrontation with PASOK. He feels that his 
consensual policy and creative proposals will "sooner or later" 
be appreciated by the great majority of the electorate. His 
conviction stems from the results of recent polls showing that 
people are tired of "confrontation for the sake of 
confrontation," TA NEA notes.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, 
addressing a True Path Party assembly group meeting today, said 
U.S. President Bill Clinton's contacts regarding the Middle East 
constitute a significant development for world peace. She 
pointed out that PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorism and 
the Hezbollah issue were first raised during these talks. 
Ciller noted: 
  [Begin recording] This is what we have always advocated: If 
the borders in the Middle East budge in one way or another -- 
if, that is, Iraq's territorial integrity is threatened in any 
way -- this would endanger peace in the Middle East, which is 
considered an energy warehouse and which is extremely important 
for the world's productive and economic power. This, in turn, 
would immediately impose a liability on world peace, a question 
which concerns the West very closely. 
  The struggle against terrorism is not only supported by the 
Vienna summit and the statements issued by the United Nations; 
it is not merely discussed on the international arena within the 
framework of NATO; but, the fact that this struggle is an 
extremely important issue for the stability of the Middle East 
has also been revealed. In addition to the Israeli-Palestinian 
issue and the request for this peace to be embraced by Syria as 
well, the importance of the struggle against the PKK and the 
need to act in cooperation against these terrorist organizations 
in the Middle East were stressed for the first time during the 
meeting between Mr. Clinton and Mr. al-Asad. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Column by Ertugrul Ozkok: "Message to Saddam: Talk With </F>
Kurds"] 
  [Excerpts] The talks that have been held with the Iraqi 
delegation in Ankara did not focus only on the question of the 
oil in the pipeline between Turkey and Iraq. The question of 
northern Iraq was also discussed, as we mentioned that it would 
in our column last week. The Turkish side brought up the 
matter. The Turkish delegation headed by Ozdem Sanberk, under 
secretary of the Turkish Foreign Ministry, outlined Turkey's 
position on the matter and said that "tension continues to exist 
in northern Iraq." 
<H5>  Let Them Come To Hold Talks </H5>
  "We support Iraq's territorial integrity. We want the 
situation in northern Iraq to be resolved within that framework. 
However, you should first disclose that Iraq will comply with 
the UN resolutions." 
  That was Turkey's general approach. The Turkish delegation 
also conveyed a direct message to Baghdad, which Ankara has 
wished to do for a long time: "Hold talks with the Kurdish 
leaders in northern Iraq and resolve that problem among 
yourselves." 
  Apparently, the Iraqi delegation was prepared for that 
message. The Iraqi officials said: "You have always said that 
you support Iraq's territorial integrity. However, you have 
allowed the Hammer Force, which is opposed to Iraq's territorial 
integrity, to remain in your country." 
  That brought Turkey's problem into the light. However, 
Turkey's initiative was based on its conviction that the Hammer 
Force will not remain in the region indefinitely. 
  Regarding Turkey's message to Baghdad that it should hold 
talks with the Kurds in northern Iraq, the Iraqi officials 
failed to respond by saying that they "agree to hold talks" with 
them. They merely said "we can hold talks with them if they 
wish to do so." 
  Obviously, Democratic Party of Kurdistan Leader Mas'ud 
Barzani and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Leader Jalal Talabani 
will not be satisfied with that reply. It can be easily assumed 
that Barzani and Talabani, who are pressed by the United States 
"not to hold talks with Baghdad," will be dissatisfied with the 
Iraqi official's unwilling compliance and refuse to hold talks 
with them. 
<H5>  BOTAS Cannot Resolve the Problem by Itself </H5>
  A certain amount of progress was made on the question of the 
withdrawal of the oil in the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline. The 
matter was also discussed with BOTAS [Pipelines and Petroleum 
Transport Corporation] officials yesterday. However, the 
problem cannot be resolved through the talks that will be held 
between Turkey and Iraq. The letter U.S. Assistant Secretary of 
State Oxman wrote before he left Ankara in December 1993 
explained the matter in detail. Turkey can withdraw the oil 
that belongs to it. However, each and every step after that 
will be subject to UN approval. In short, Turkey has to discuss 
the matter with the UN officials and Washington, regardless of 
the two-day talks the Turkish officials held with the Iraqi 
delegation in Ankara. Apparently, the matter has a political 
aspect that goes beyond the BOTAS officials' authority. 
[passage omitted] 
<H5>  Fayda Talks Have Been Cut </H5>
  It seems that Ankara's anxiety on matters related to 
northern 
Iraq is gradually increasing. However, the Foreign Ministry 
circles have not admitted that state of affairs. Interesting 
developments are taking place in that region. Undesirable 
incidents may take place at any time. For example: The 
Turkish, U.S., British, French, and Iraqi officers met to 
exchange views and information after the Gulf War once a week. 
The meetings were held in an Iraqi military garrison in Fayda, 
a district center that is 30 km from Turkey's border. They 
maintained their talks even in the tense atmosphere after the 
war. The weekly meetings have been cut since the clashes in 
1993 because the Iraqi officers failed to attend them. 
  The meaning of that state of affairs is obvious. The 
mechanism for mutual agreement and exchange of information to 
obstruct serious clashes in the region does not exist anymore.

<H5>  Turkey's Guarantee </H5>
  To what extent can the Kurds in northern Iraq trust Saddam 
Husayn even if they conclude an agreement with Baghdad? They 
reached several agreements in the past but they were all 
violated. Considering the psychological situation in the region, 
the question of a "guarantor country" will definitely be placed 
on the agenda after a possible agreement on northern Iraq. An 
effective mechanism will be required in the region when the 
Hammer Force withdraws from Turkey. Obviously, Turkey will have 
to decide the policy it will adopt. Either a mechanism similar 
to the Hammer Force will have to be established or Turkey will 
have to act as an effective guarantor country in the region. 
Does that matter not concern NATO, which has very little to do 
at the present time?

  [Text] Azerbaijan made a surprise decision to postpone the 
summit of the heads of state of six Turkic republics, scheduled 
to be held in Baku on 21 and 22 January. It was learned that 
the uneasiness felt by Russia over a Turkic summit was the 
reason for the postponement. 
  Besides, it is being claimed that Uzbekistan and 
Turkmenistan 
wanted the summit to be postponed to avoid giving the impression 
that the summit is a front against Armenia. Whereas, the 
Azerbaijani Government stated that the summit was postponed to 
allow for better preparations for it. 
  The second summit of the Turkic republics -- the first was 
held in Turkey in 1992 -- would have been held in Baku at the 
end of 1993. However, Geydar Aliyev postponed the summit until 
January. Ankara was surprised by Aliyev's decision to postpone 
it for a second time.

<F P=106> [Interview with Douglas Hurd, British secretary of state for </F>
foreign and commonwealth affairs, by satellite from his London 
office by Mehmet Ali Birand on the "Crossfire" program -- live, 
in English with superimposed Turkish translation] 
  [Text] [Birand] Now, sir, there are a number of reports 
circulating in the Turkish press that you have given the green 
light for an independent Kurdish state. Is this true? 
  [Hurd] We do not believe that an independent Kurdish state 
is possible. 
  [Birand] Let us move on to the PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] problem. What is your government's position on the 
PKK? 
  [Hurd] We are against the violation of laws. The London 
metropolitan police units have established a special unit to 
deal with PKK crimes. We are very familiar what it takes to 
fight terrorism. We, therefore, will not allow any acts of 
terror and violence within our borders. 
  [Birand] But you are not banning the PKK? 
  [Hurd] Our laws do not permit such a measure. This alone 
cannot be effective. The important thing is the effective 
enforcement of the laws. 
  [Birand] You and your prime minister, John Major, met with 
the Turkish Prime Minister in Brussels. Did she promise you 
that she would be solving the Cyprus problem? Your prime 
minister, addressing the British parliament, said that she did 
make such a promise. Is this true? 
  [Hurd] Mrs. Ciller said that she very much wants progress on 
the Cyprus issue. The two prime ministers share the same views 
on the issue. We, the British, believe that this problem has 
lasted for too long and that it will become more dangerous with 
time. Now we are faced with an opportunity. The UN secretary 
general is exerting efforts toward development. He is waiting 
for a reply, a result. The Turkish government is standing by 
these efforts. There is a Turkish Cypriot community and elected 
officials in Northern Cyprus. I hope that they will be in favor 
of a development as well. I hope that they will establish 
cooperation with the officials in Nicosia. Now is the right 
time. If we miss this opportunity then I am concerned for the 
future. 
  [Birand] Now, you are going to be in Ankara on Wednesday [19 
January] be the main topic of the talks? 
  [Hurd] Yes this is true, I am looking forward to this visit. 
I want to listen to the views of my Turkish colleague, the 
Turkish prime minister. I would like to hear about Turkey's 
view on the situation in the world and the Caucasus and 
Turkish-European relations. This is very important. I am 
personally most interested in the development of these 
relations. I hope that Turkey's position within the European 
Community will progress. We will probably discuss the issues 
concerning Cyprus and Iraq. We have a very long agenda. I am 
looking forward to it. Turkey has a very significant part in 
British foreign policy. 
  [Birand] Mr. Minister, I thank you. I will be very happy to 
see you in Ankara. I thank you again.

  [Text] Anatoliy Tikhonov, Russian deputy minister for fuel 
and energy, has said Russia can supply Turkey's natural gas 
needs up to the year 2050. 
  Tikhonov made a statement at Istanbul Ataturk Airport before 
departing at the end of his visit to Turkey. He said Russia 
annually supplies Turkey with 5.5 billion cubic meters of 
natural gas, adding that this amount will be increased by 2.5 
billion cubic meters beginning in 1996. Pointing out that his 
visit has been very beneficial, Tikhonov said a protocol has 
been signed on cooperation in the fields of oil, natural gas, 
and coal. He concluded by saying that the conditions are 
conducive for further cooperation between the Turkish and 
Russian energy complexes.

natural gas from Turkmenistan to Western Europe. An agreement 
will be signed on our participation in the committee, he said. 
  Also, talks are under way to increase the 6 billion cubic

  [Text] Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos 
arrived in Strasbourg this evening to present the [European 
Union] Greek presidency program at the European Parliament 
plenary session. 
  European Parliament President Egon Klepsch and the political 
group leaders today disapproved of the international press 
attacks against the Greek presidency when it assumed its term of 
office. Our Strasbourg correspondent Nikolaos Belos has the 
following report: 
  [Begin Belos recording] European Parliament President Egon 
Klepsch and the political group leaders in Strasbourg 
disapproved of the international press attacks against the Greek 
presidency when it assumed office. The issue was raised for 
discussion by Mr. Klepsch at the European Parliament presidium. 
He said that the criticism was condemnable and that he does not 
accept prejudging the failure of a presidency before it even 
begins. Mr. Klepsch added, following the discussions he had a 
few days ago with representatives of the Greek Government in 
Athens, that he believes that the presidency gives priority to 
cooperation with the European Parliament and the other bodies of 
the European Union. 
  Jean-Pierre Cot, leader of the socialist group in the 
European Parliament, described the Greek presidency as solid and 
experienced and called the international press articles on the 
alleged negative character of the Greek presidency impolite. 
Referring to the Greek presidency's priorities, Mr. Cot 
described them as correct because they cover economic and social 
aspects of the European Union as they were determined within the 
framework of the white paper. Mr. Cot also referred to the 
European Union's foreign policy, which the presidency will 
promote, and stressed that from his contacts in Athens with 
leading members of the Greek presidency he has viewed the 
experience and knowledge the Greek Government has on Balkan 
issues. In conclusion, the socialist group leader expressed the 
conviction that the Greek presidency aims at insuring peace and 
security in the Balkans. 
  Participating in the discussion on the Greek side were the 
two European Parliament vice presidents, Paraskevas Avyerinos of 
PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] and Yeorgyios 
Anastasopoulos of New Democracy. They both stressed that the 
international press attacks were not only against the government 
but also against the Greek people. At the same time, they also 
dealt a blow to the European Union institutions. 
  European Commission President Jacques Delors also criticized 
the international press attacks against the Greek presidency 
during his visit to Athens. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Ruediger Moniac report: "Reserved Seat on World Security </F>
Council?"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The debate on the reform and enlargement of 
the World Security Council, which has also been eagerly expected 
in Bonn, will start today at the United Nations in New York. A 
UN committee will be set up for this purpose. As desired by FRG 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of 
Germany), German diplomats are supposed to do intensive work in 
this body. They are instructed by the Federal Government to do 
everything over the short- and medium-term to secure a permanent 
seat on the Security Council, the highest UN executive body. 
According to the mandate of the past 48th General Assembly, the 
committee, in which all 184 UN member states can participate, is 
to meet once a week until the beginning of the 49th General 
Assembly in the autumn, and then it is to present a report that 
"will describe first possible outlines of scenarios for an 
enlargement of the council." According to diplomatic circles in 
Bonn, there is every indication that the United Nations will 
resolve its enlargement in 1995, its 50th anniversary. "Thus, 
the train of reform for the Security Council has been started. 
If Germany misses it, the next will presumably only be started 
again in 50 years," a diplomat emphasized to DIE WELT. 
  In a draft accepted by Kinkel for the work of German 
diplomats in New York, it is expected that Germany will have to 
assume "more political, military, and financial burdens within 
the framework of the international community in the future" -- 
independently of whether Germany is a permanent Security Council 
member. Therefore, it is in Germany's interest "also to be able 
to make decisions" in the "most exclusive club" of the most 
important international organization. After the United States 
and Japan, Bonn is the third largest UN contributor, with 9 
percent. Among the five permanent council members, it was the 
United States that applied in writing for the admission of Japan 
and Germany. France and Great Britain, which complete the 
quintet, in addition to the PRC and Russia, stated that they are 
not prepared for a reduction of their powers if the council is 
enlarged. 
  The work of the new UN committee primarily concentrates on 
the question of how the 129 Third World countries can be 
represented if the council is enlarged. Their opinion is 
important because two-thirds of all UN members have to agree to 
an enlargement.

<F P=106> [Antonello Caporale report: "Segni Ready To Accept Bossi's </F>
Embrace"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Perhaps the roses will bloom once more and 
the marriage will take place properly. [Pact for Italy leader] 
Mariotto Segni and [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi 
will meet and will probably say "I do." The path has been set 
out, and fate has determined this final test. As long as it 
means that he can block the way to the left-wing forces, as long 
as it means that he can defeat "statism" and -- why not? -- 
"centralism," Segni is about to accept Bossi's embrace, to sign 
the pact. 
  The pact was announced the very day of the television 
appearance by the leader of the moderate front opposite 
[Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary] Achille Occhetto, 
the leader of the alignment to be defeated. There will be an 
electoral agreement with the League, Segni told his men at his 
headquarters on Largo del Nazareno: In order to ensure victory 
we need to win over the North. Without the League, it will be a 
futile struggle. So.... But his trials cannot be said to be 
over: He still has to persuade [Christian Democratic Party, DC, 
Secretary] Martinazzoli to sign the armistice and, above all, to 
convince Berlusconi that his television venture is better, much 
better, than his electoral one. Rooting for Italy is fine -- but 
without Silvio Berlusconi. 
  On the last day of the First Republic Mario Segni explained 
to Carlo Azeglio Ciampi what he wants to achieve, and with whom. 
A liberal-democratic alignment in which there is a place for 
the League, too. Speaking in the Lower House, he said: "There 
seem to be two opposing lines within the League. One advocates 
adhering to the old destructive proposal, while the other 
advocates focusing on the struggle against statism. Whoever is 
concerned about Italy's future hopes that the latter line will 
prevail. It is up to the League to choose clearly and 
definitely whether to remain entrenched in the destructive 
position or to contribute constructively to Italy's progress." 
  There is no need to ask; the decision has been made. Indeed, 
the time is almost up for the League. The tough-guy approach 
has failed, and what is needed now is "reason" and "balance." 
Bossi said: "If Segni has something to tell us, he knows where 
to find us; if the potential is there, it will show itself and 
we will see it in the coming days. We are certainly not 
yielding the initiative to him: We have been making openings 
since before the end of the year. There has been no response. 
Of course, we command the votes in the North...." In any case, 
according to Bossi, the League is the "cornerstone of a 
liberal-democratic alignment. Segni has no votes. More than 
anything, he is a point of neutralization, the center of the 
compass, a potentially useful image." He paused for breath, 
then continued: "There is still time for an agreement; there 
will be time until the day before the lists are presented. 
Segni only has to call my secretary's office." That was a 
small lie. Segni has already called him. Bossi admitted: 
"Within a matter of hours, some of my closest aides will be 
meeting with Segni or his trusted representatives. What is 
certain is that we have already made an official commitment to 
meet." 
  Additional proof that this is precisely the case, that is, 
that the time is ripe, is provided by remarks made by 
representatives of the Pact. The Republican, Guglielmo 
Castagnetti, explained: "We consider relations with the League 
crucial, because we believe that all the liberal-democratic 
forces must unite." 
  The enemy can only be defeated through unity: "If the 
moderates stand divided into two or three lists, clearly a 
defeat becomes inevitable." In any case, according to [Pact 
member] Alberto Michelini, "on programs, there is an almost 
perfect identity of views between us and the League. 
Furthermore, once the conditions of Italy's unity, solidarity, 
and the strengthening of local government have been accepted, 
there are no more problems." 
  Yesterday evening Mario Segni was a guest on Telemontecarlo. 
Corrado Augias set him against Achille Occhetto. Segni's attack 
on the progressive leader focused on his favorite topic -- state 
control. He cited figures, names, amendments, and parliamentary 
documents. Segni was very well prepared. Augias stopped him 
and asked: Will you be the leader of a government thanks to 
votes won by the League? "There must be a political agreement; 
I would rather lose the elections and remain consistent." Only 
with the MSI [Italian Social Movement] is there no chance. "We 
have no dealings with the MSI." The ball was back in Occhetto's 
court, and this time the issue was Communist Renaissance. What 
did he have to say about it? "Our only preconditions have to do 
with matters of policy, not ideology. It is not to be assumed 
that the government accord that we put forward will embrace all 
the forces with which we have an electoral agreement." 
  The duel continued. What about Berlusconi? "He is the enemy 
of the genuine liberal-democratic forces," Occhetto said 
provocatively. Segni renewed his advice to Berlusconi -- It is 
better for him not to allow himself to be dragged into electoral 
contests: "I still hope that he will not enter the arena." 
His lavish praise for [former IL GIORNALE editor] Montanelli 
-- "an example of courage and extraordinary consistency" -- 
revealed his continuing coolness toward Berlusconi.

<F P=106> ["Politics on a Thursday" article by Prime Minister Poul </F>
Nyrup Rasmussen: "NATO Must Contribute to the Construction of 
Peace and Stability"] 
  [Text] There are a lot of summits. If one is to believe 
the declarations that come from them, most of them are historic. 
But viewed in a wider context, probably only very few are 
worthy of the description. 
  I am convinced that the NATO summit on 10 and 11 January 
1994 
is one of these summits. 
  We have not only set in motion the work to update NATO to 
fit 
in with the new world. This work has in fact been going on for 
some time. But this summit has begun a process which could 
change NATO fundamentally. 
  This is true in more than one respect. I would like to 
concentrate on a central aspect here -- relations with the 
countries of central and Eastern Europe, particularly the Baltic 
countries. The change has come about as a result of this 
summit's adoption of Partnership for Peace. We have adopted a 
comprehensive and ambitious program for concrete security policy 
and military cooperation throughout Europe. 
  This is something new and very different. 
  In the past NATO was the Western defense organization 
against 
what we saw as an overwhelming threat from the East. That 
threat has gone. The countries of Eastern Europe have won their 
freedom. The Soviet empire has collapsed into ruins. From these 
ruins there has arisen a new Russia which has just held the 
first democratic elections since the revolution in 1917, even 
though these elections have brought with them repulsive 
nationalist tendencies as a result of the election of 
Zhirinovskiy. This is something we must pay attention to and we 
must support the positive democratic forces. 
  It has long been clear that if NATO were to survive we would 
have to change the organization so that it fits the new 
conditions in the world. Not in such a way that we would 
abandon the collective security guarantee. Not in such a way 
that we would water down the Western community of values. But 
in such a way that we would be opening the doors to the new. 
  That is what we have now done. 
  Partnership for Peace is the tool. Within its framework we 
will this year enter into a number of concrete cooperation 
agreements with Eastern European countries. There will be joint 
maneuvers in the field of peacekeeping. There will be direct 
contacts between military staffs. Liaison offices for these 
countries will be set up at NATO headquarters. There are many 
other elements. All in all comprehensive cooperation tailored 
to meet the needs of each individual country participating. 
  All will receive the same offers, but the actual concrete 
form cooperation takes will vary. The countries closest to us 
will want more ambitious cooperation programs. And they will 
get them. 
  We say expressly in the declaration from the summit that we 
welcome an enlargement of NATO as part of this development over 
time. 
  This is new, decisively new. Partnership for Peace is not, 
as some have claimed, a self-satisfied alliance's refusal to 
accept new members. On the contrary Partnership for Peace is a 
preparation to do so. 
  In this connection I think that it was Denmark's simple duty 
to stress that the Baltic countries must be given special 
support. They are three neighbors on the other side of the 
Baltic Sea who have as yet scarcely had time to build up their 
own military capacity. But they have decided to set up a joint 
peacekeeping battalion. This fits in well with Partnership for 
Peace. We want to help them with this battalion, in part by 
helping with the training of their personnel. 
  But, the critics say, why do we not simply admit all from 
Eastern Europe and get it over with? We will not do so, because 
everything must happen at the right time. Security is too 
important to experiment with. And if we did so we would create 
more problems than we would be solving. Russia must not be 
isolated. Russia must also form part of the new pattern of 
cooperation. On the other hand Russia must not have a right of 
veto. 
  Let me add one more thing: Partnership for Peace includes 
access for partner nations to political consultations with NATO 
if they feel that their security is threatened. This is a very 
important step. It reflects what the United States recently 
expressed very clearly: The security of those states which lie 
between Western Europe and Russia also affects our security. 
And above all: We must not create new walls -- out of fear and 
enemy images -- after the fall of the old wall, but new 
stability and peace-building. 
  I am convinced that Partnership will prove to be 
epoch-making.

  [Text] The Cypriot Government has welcomed Belgian Foreign 
Minister Willy Claes' statement, which says that if there is no 
clear indication of a Cyprus solution by January 1995, the 
negotiations for Cyprus' accession to the European Union [EU] 
will begin immediately. Speaking to the Cyprus Broadcasting 
Corporation, Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis described this 
position as very positive. Claes made his remarks during a 
meeting of the Council of Europe's Political Committee, which he 
chairs. Claes also made it clear that the EU observer to the 
Cyprus issue negotiations will report directly to EU Commission 
President Jacques Delors.

  [Text] Following Clinton's warning to Syrian leader Hafiz 
al-Asad on PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorism, attention 
has now been riveted on possible measures Damascus has taken 
against the PKK and Apo [PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan]. 
  It was learned that as a first step in this context, Syria 
has forced Apo to leave Damascus and that the PKK leader is in 
the Lebanese capital, Beirut. 
  [Begin unidentified reporter recording] It is a known fact 
that Syria does not want to lose its PKK trump card against 
Turkey. However, Hafiz al-Asad, who wants to integrate with the 
West and who openly expressed this intention to Clinton, is 
expected to further hem in on Apo. According to available 
information, Syria took its first step on this issue recently 
and forced PKK leader Apo to leave for the Lebanese capital of 
Beirut. Apo currently is being kept under control in Beirut. 
  Considering Syria's influence on Lebanon, however, it 
appears 
that al-Asad will not give up its Apo and PKK trump cards, at 
least until he gets Turkey's consent for an agreement on river 
water. 
  Sending Apo off to Beirut is perceived by Ankara as an 
indication of goodwill from the Damascus government. However, 
Ankara believes Damascus has to take more positive steps. 
Ankara is now getting ready to launch a diplomatic offensive in 
Washington to further pressure Damascus on the PKK and Apo.

  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- The Ifo Institute for Economic 
Research believes that a recovery is in sight following the 
sharp downturn in investments in German industry. "There are 
increasing signs that the rapid decline in industrial 
investments is coming to an end," the Munich-based institute 
writes in its latest analysis. 
  In the more probable event of a clear acceleration in the 
export sector and further more pronounced interest rate 
reductions, a real increase of 3 percent (following minus 3 
percent in 1993) in plant investment could be expected in 1994. 
If, however, the pressures of the domestic economic situation 
were to increase, a further slight decline of 1 per cent was 
possible. 
  In either case the negative development in investment 
expenditure in industry was likely to continue, in the more 
favourable scenario by minus 6 per cent, in the unfavourable one 
by minus 11 per cent (following the minus 12 per cent calculated 
for 1993). In 1992 investment expenditure in industry was DM127 
billion and DM721 billion for all economic sectors. Investment 
in the former east German states continues to rise, whereby the 
mining, energy and services sectors as well as -- in the 
medium-term -- transportation predominate. 
  Investment in the former east Germany increased by around 15 
per cent despite the recession in 1993. In broad sectors of the 
west German economy, however, the downturn in investment was 
much more pronounced than even in the most unfavourable 
scenario, for example in trade, transport, in industry and also 
in agriculture, according to the Ifo. In the medium-term, the 
high investment level of the early 1990's could be regained in 
1996 at the earliest. In the purchase of capital goods, data 
processing equipment and office machinery are likely to remain 
key areas of growth until 1998. 
  The Ifo Institute warned against hoping for overly large 
economic impulses from the GATT agreement on the liberalization 
of world trade, reached in mid-December 1993. A definitive 
assessment of the outcome was not yet possible. The agreement 
was basically positive, although only a partial success had been 
achieved in some areas. Failure had only been prevented by 
excluding some areas or giving compensation. To describe the 
agreement as a "huge" or "mega economic programme" was certainly 
an exaggeration, the Ifo Institute writes. 
  It should be borne in mind that the liberalisation would 
begin in early 1995 at the earliest and would be completed 
gradually in five or more stages. "At least some economic 
impulses can peter out as a result. In addition, it cannot be 
assumed that the tendency to solve structural problems through 
protectionist measures no longer existed." Sanctions were still 
not envisaged. The main reasons for the prolonged nature of the 
GATT negotiations -- the great conflict of interests between 
industrialized and developing countries in some areas and the 
large number of negotiating partners -- continued to exist and 
would continue in future to make multilateral liberalization 
steps more difficult. The discussion on a GATT with several 
speeds could therefore remain topical.

<F P=106> [Interview with Werner Girke, former administrator of the </F>
foreign assets of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, by 
Dieter Krause in Berlin; date not given: "Search for Millions"] 
  [Text] [Krause] You were in Moscow last week when the 
premises of your company, TVO [Fiduciary Management and 
Organization Company], in Berlin and your apartment were 
searched. Did you meet Zhirinovskiy there? 
  [Girke] No. I do not even know where Zhirinovskiy is based 
in Moscow. I was there purely for business reasons. 
  [Krause] The search of your office and apartment was 
intended mainly to produce documents concerning the whereabouts 
of 4 million German marks [DM], which you are said to have used 
for private purposes. 
  [Girke] Nothing has been taken away illegally. Even the 
Trust Agency knows that. Due to my knowledge of former assets 
of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, I have recovered some 
DM63 million for the Trust Agency since spring 1991. 
  [Krause] How much has been transferred to Trust Agency 
accounts? 
  [Girke] A total of DM53 million so far. Another DM6 million 
are on their way, so this leaves those DM4 million. 
  [Krause] What about them? 
  [Girke] These are the commissions to which I am entitled. 
The Trust Agency received the corresponding claims and bills 
one year ago. 
  [Krause] Where are the DM4 million now? In Russia? 
  [Girke] No. The money I took to Russia this time was 
invested in a food service project. 
  [Krause] Behind which stands Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Girke] My Russian business partner is in no way connected 
with that gentleman. 
  [Krause] Did you give any money to Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Girke] Not a single mark. 
  [Krause] Why did you invite him to Berlin? 
  [Girke] He asked me. Shortly before Christmas, my partner 
Werner Neumann and I happened to meet Zhirinovskiy in Austria. 
  [Krause] Was it also a coincidence that one of 
Zhirinovskiy's staffers worked in your company for six weeks 
last summer? 
  [Girke] I was not aware of that connection at the time. 
  [Krause] So, you are only interested in business relations 
with Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Girke] Yes, that is what I would be interested in.

Support in Event of.... Air Strikes"] 
  [Text] Rome, 10 Jan (ANSA) -- Italy stands ready to provide 
logistical support in the event of an air strike on Bosnia, 
Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri said in a radio interview to be 
aired Tuesday morning [11 January] but excerpts of which were 
released here tonight. 
  With reference to the ongoing NATO summit in Brussels, 
Fabbri 
said that the Atlantic Alliance must be ready to intervene 
energetically in Bosnia if called upon to do so, however he 
noted that the final decision rests with the United Nations. 
  The defense minister voiced satisfaction with the fact that 
the Bosnian question was being debated at the summit and 
recalled that NATO has on several occasions stressed it was 
willing to intervene with air strikes to protect humanitarian 
convoys and to break the Serbian stranglehold on Sarajevo. 
  In any case, there is no contingency plan to send Italian 
soldiers to Bosnia as the United Nations rightfully insists that 
the participation of troops from neighboring nations is 
undesirable, Fabbri added.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "NATO: Ciampi and Clinton on G-7; </F>
Andreatta on CSCE"] 
  [Text] Rome, 10 Jan (ANSA) -- The coming Naples summit of 
the Group of Seven [G-7] of the world's leading industrial 
nations must be an occasion to demonstrate with concrete facts 
the spirit with which the West wants to carry forward its 
relations with Russia, according to Italian Premier Carlo 
Azeglio Ciampi who took up the theme again with United States 
President Bill Clinton this evening during a brief encounter on 
the sidelines of the NATO summit underway here. 
  According to Ciampi, the dialogue with Russia must be 
constructive. This dialogue must see the West committed to 
spurring Moscow to carry on with its reforms, while at the same 
time aiding Russia to overcome this difficult and lengthy 
transition period, Ciampi said. 
  During his speech to the summit, Ciampi said that giving 
greater political emphasis to the coming G-7 summit meant making 
a valid contribution to a dialogue for even greater 
rapprochement between Russia and the West. 
  Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta Monday [10 
January] also stressed the need for a tie-in between NATO and 
the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, stating 
that CSCE peacekeeping missions, above all in Asia and in the 
republics of the former Soviet Union, cannot help but draw on 
Russian national interest which must, however, be 
internationalized, not an instrument of an imperialistic policy. 
  While on the subject of peace-keeping, Andreatta said that 
the experience in Somalia and Bosnia has suggested that the use 
of military units is not always the most suitable instrument for 
operations having a large humanitarian content. There is a need 
to find crowd control measures which are not lethal in nature, 
he said. 
  Italy has also called for greater and more analytical ground 
observations so as to better identify those responsible for 
truce-breaking.

<F P=106> [Article by Flavia Amabile: "Even Divorced Persons Are in </F>
the Tax Collector's Sights"] 
  [Text] The year-end tax decree takes effect. Gallo 
extends the audits to nightclubs and multinationals. Dentists 
and clinics will be checked more closely. 
  Rome--A new year, new tasks. The strategy--enacted four days 
ago by the government--that provides for tax increases totaling 
almost 7 trillion lire took effect yesterday. And even though 
the echo of these new measures is still reverberating, further 
measures are already being rumored. Last week it was the Bank of 
Italy speaking of the need for new measures, and in fact the 
government itself--in its master decree--laid the foundations 
for the next increases. 
<H5>  Tobacco Products </H5>
  We accordingly discover that the increase in the price of 
cigarettes has merely been postponed, because on or before 30 
April of each year until 1996, a readjustment of the prices on 
goods sold by the government monopoly will be triggered. With 
the readjustment of certain fixed-sum taxes, the Treasury 
expects in this way to obtain 1.7 trillion lire in increased 
revenues--500 billion for 1994 and 600 billion for each of the 
two subsequent years. 
<H5>  Audits </H5>
  In addition to being a year of taxes, 1994 will also be--if 
the government and the finance minister have their way--a year 
of audits. The GAZZETTA UFFICIALE has published the operational 
antitax evader plan that identifies the categories toward which 
the Finance Guards will primarily direct their attention. They 
are: dentists; doctors who operate in private clinics; companies 
that are involved in mergers; mutual funds; branches of 
multinational companies; public works contractors; sports clubs; 
night clubs [preceding two words in English]; janitorial service 
companies; hotels; beneficiaries of funds for earthquake 
victims; and divorced persons who fail to declare the alimony 
they receive--to name only a few. 
<H5>  Gasoline </H5>
  Everyone who took a trip yesterday found that prices had 
changed at the gasoline pumps and at the toll booths on 
superhighways. The increase was 70 lire for super gasoline and 
50 lire for unleaded, and 4 percent for the tolls. 
<H5>  Alcoholic Beverages </H5>
  Alcoholic beverages will be more expensive in 1994. A 
three-liter bottle of whisky, cognac, or similar product will 
cost an additional 250 lire. 
<H5>  Luxury Goods </H5>

  The surtax on sales of high-powered automobiles and 
motorcycles will remain in effect during all of 1994. At 
registration time, therefore, the surtax paid will be 5 million 
lire for gasoline-powered automobiles of from 21 to 23 
horsepower; 8 million for those of from 24 to 26 horsepower; 10 
million for those of from 27 to 30 horsepower; and 12 million 
for automobiles of more than 30 horsepower. 
  In the case of motorcycles, the increase will be 600,000 
lire 
for motorcycles from 10 to 12 horsepower, and 2 million for 
those of more than 12 horsepower. In the case of used 
automobiles and motorcycles the tax is reduced by 10 percent for 
each year subsequent to the initial registration up to a maximum 
reduction of 50 percent. 
<H5>  Tax Accounting </H5>
  This measure also took effect yesterday. It will enable 
employers and self-employed workers to pay their taxes and 
receive credit for their payments to the Internal Revenue 
Service. Until 31 March--during the start-up phase--the banks 
may limit themselves to accepting such proxy deposits only for 
VAT [value-added tax] payments. The government has accordingly 
established a ceiling on requests for refunds: 40 million lire 
for 1994, 60 million for 1995, and 80 million for 1996. 
Companies with fewer than 100 employees will be exempt from 
having to furnish assistance in the collection of taxes. 
<H5>  Taxation of Capital Gains [preceding two words in English] </H5>
  These measures are contained in the bill to reform the 
capital gains taxes that the Parliament is unlikely to have time 
to pass. In any case--according to the Ciampi 
administration--inheritances and capital gains are not included 
in the IRPEF [personal income tax]. The tax deducted from 
profits will range from 10 percent to 25 percent, while it will 
remain at 12.5 percent on the BOTS [Treasury bills]. The 
taxation on profits from the sale of stock would be based on the 
amounts that brokers would withhold anonymously from the balance 
between profits and losses. A flat 2.5 percent will be deducted 
from dividends. 
<H5>  Value-Added Tax </H5>
  The times of payment were changed as of yesterday. From the 
time of registration, the tax is withheld as of the date of the 
operation. In this way, the state will recover 2.51 trillion 
lire, obviously only for the following year, inasmuch as this is 
an advance payment of the sums owed. 
  Products subject to the 12 percent VAT cost 1 percent more 
as 
of yesterday. The tax on airline tickets, footwear, clothing, 
meat extracts and gravies, corn flakes [preceding two words in 
English], ornamental plants, cork, musical instruments for use 
in teaching, spiny lobsters, European lobsters, oysters, compact 
disks, tapes, videocassettes, soap, wines from fresh grapes, and 
rough lumber. 
  A further increase to 9 percent from 4 percent was 
established for the sale of real estate, and the VAT on luxury 
hotels was increased to 13 percent from 9 percent. 
  Trade between Italy and the Republic of San Marino was also 
made subject to the VAT. 
<H5>  Bank Stamp Tax </H5>
  Stamps on bank checks and deposit receipts, and the 500-lire 
stamp on credit card purchases, will be eliminated as of this 
year, but provision is made for an increase in the tax on 
monthly statements of account (to 2,750 lire from 2,000 lire). 
<H5>  Rural Residences </H5>
  The tax concessions for the purposes of the IRPEF [personal 
income tax] will be eliminated for real estate that is 
classified as rural for tax purposes but that does not have the 
characteristics of rural property. A partial exemption, however, 
has also been granted for tax obligations incurred in the past. 
<H5>  Lottery and Soccer Pools </H5>
  These are the government's latest methods devised by the 
government to recover, in 1994, as much as 1.1 trillion lire. 
They concern the "scratch and win" lottery (you scratch the 
little square and get an immediate response) and Totogol, a 
puzzle involving the number of goals scored in eight games of 
the soccer championship.

<F P=106> [Article by Giacomo Ferrari: "What Will 1994 Be Like? A </F>
So-So Year"] 
  [Text] A Makno poll reveals a pessimistic prospect: 
People are consuming less and saving less, and the fear of 
inflation persists. 
  Almost 60 percent of the Italians have no confidence in 
the political and economic future. They are willing to make 
sacrifices, providing everybody pays their taxes and the welfare 
state works. 
  One Italian in five, however, does not agree. He does not 
want to make any more sacrifices, even if they are aimed at an 
"effective improvement" in the Italian economic situation. The 
others would perhaps be willing to accept them, but only under 
precise conditions (see the accompanying tables). For 
example--and this represents the great majority--provided the 
welfare state is preserved, if not actually strengthened. Or 
else (and this is another numerous category), only on the 
assumption that everybody pays their taxes. 
  A generally pessimistic outlook emerges from the poll Makno 
conducted last month [i.e., November] with a significant sample 
of citizens throughout Italy. And it can be summed up in a kind 
of brief indication: In answer to the question concerning the 
near future of the "economic, political, and social situation" 
of Italian families, 55.9 percent of those interviewed replied 
they had no confidence, while only 29.3 percent is optimistic, 
and there is a very high number of those who are undecided (14.8 
percent). 
  This situation is reflected in the assumptions about future 
actions. The poll was based on 1,022 telephone interviews. (The 
sample was selected on the basis of scientific criteria, taking 
into account geographic areas, demographically significant 
economic classes, sex, age, and academic diplomas.) Actually, 
the poll also investigates possible destinations of private 
savings. And here there are many surprises. 
  For example, one is struck by the very high percentage of 
those who believe that in 1994 (to be exact, the question 
concerned the next six months) they will be unable to save even 
one lira because "all their income will be absorbed by everyday 
expenses." No less than 43 citizens out of 100 stated that of 
necessity "they were not savers." However, it should be pointed 
out that the same question posed in the past (that is, "What did 
your family invest in the last six months?) provided even worse 
responses, since 47 percent of those questioned then were found 
to be nonsavers. 
  But who is it that manages to save despite everything? What 
does that person expect to do in the first half of the new year? 
In this situation, the bank wins by far. In fact, 15.7 percent 
of those interviewed said they will leave their money in their 
checking account and 8.8 percent opted for their bank savings 
book. (Probably also included in this category are certificates 
of deposit, natural offspring of the old bank books). Despite 
the great battage [publicity campaign] over 
privatizations and new job placements, the number of those 
putting their money in the stock market is practically 
nonexistent while the number of those very faithful to 
government financial instruments is surprisingly low: Only 8.4 
percent say they want to buy treasury bills, treasury 
certificates, and multiyear treasury bonds. 
  Then there is the chapter on consumption. The year of 
economic and institutional crisis has also changed Italians' 
habits. And while official data refer to an inflation under 
control, the people, on the other hand, have the feeling that 
prices are continuing to rise. There are a few differences 
within the social classes. For example, women are more 
pessimistic than men. And the elderly believe that prices are 
rising much more than young people do. 
  Finally, concerning past conduct, in the south they spent 
more for food and clothing; in the north; for housing; and in 
the center, for transport.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "NATO: Summit Ends With No Movement </F>
on Bosnia"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 11 January (ANSA) -- The NATO summit ended 
here today without reaching agreement on new wording for a 
threatened air strike on Serb forces that might achieve the 
re-opening of the airport at Tuzla or free access for United 
Nations forces to the Muslim enclave at Srebrenica, diplomatic 
sources said. 
  The summit's final communique restricted itself to inviting 
the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] command in Bosnia to 
"urgently draw up plans to ensure the rotation of the UN forces 
at Srebrenica and to examine how to reopen the airport at 
Tuzla," without referring to military action that NATO might 
undertake to achieve these goals. 
  The document reiterated last August's reference to air 
strikes that may be undertaken by NATO -- at the request of UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali -- to prevent the 
"strangulation" of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo and the other 
Muslim safe areas in the former Yugoslav republic. 
  Reports from Sarajevo said Serb bombardments had ceased this 
morning after the newly raised NATO threat of air strikes in 
Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Article signed JMK, PLS: "Two-Day NATO Summit Over"; as </F>
released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 11 Jan (BELGA) -- On Tuesday [11 January], 
at the end of the two-day summit meeting of the heads of state 
and government at NATO headquarters in Evere, NATO Secretary 
General Manfred Woerner said his impression regarding the 
situation in Bosnia is that "clear determination was shown at 
the summit not to allow the present situation to drag on." The 
civil war in the former Yugoslav Republic was not on the agenda 
at the NATO summit, but was "comprehensively and thoroughly 
treated on Monday evening during a dinner, and on Tuesday 
morning," said Woerner. 
  NATO is reiterating its support for UN mediation and for a 
solution at the negotiating table, said Woerner, who continued 
by saying that NATO is prepared to carry out air strikes in 
order to support the UNPROFOR troops in Bosnia and Sarajevo, and 
to protect the Muslim enclaves. 
  There are two kinds of air strikes, said Woerner: those 
aimed at protecting UNPROFOR troops, and air strikes like those 
NATO approved in August 1993. He emphasized that air strikes 
will only take place if there is a consensus among the countries 
belonging to the North Atlantic [Cooperation] Council, and 
provided that UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is in 
agreement. When asked whether the NATO countries have reached 
agreement on this, the secretary general answered that "the 
situation on the ground needs to be assessed, and the safety of 
the UN ground troops must be borne in mind." 
  NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner called the Brussels 
summit "a historic turning point." The reform of NATO has taken 
a great step forward. "We are now on track for the 21st 
century," said Woerner. 
  Fresh assignments have been outlined clearly, and this was 
done in a "highly constructive atmosphere among all 16 NATO 
countries." A renewed, more mature relationship is growing up 
between North America and Europe, claimed Woerner, who said that 
"everyone was impressed by the strong leadership of the U.S. 
President." 
  The principle of expanding NATO was approved, and the 
countries of East Europe were invited to work with NATO within 
the framework of Partnership for Peace agreements. 
  Finally, a more flexible structure will be created for 
crisis 
management and peace assignments, and NATO will develop its 
strategy vis-a-vis the proliferation of nuclear weapons and 
weapons of mass destruction. 
  Admittedly, there is still some discord in NATO about 
carrying out air strikes in Bosnia, since some countries have 
NATO troops there while others do not. However, the readiness 
to carry out such strikes is greater now than it was in August, 
since the ground troops increasingly are being exposed to 
danger, said U.S. President Bill Clinton at the end of the 
meeting. 
  The allies are unanimous in their support for a text on 
Bosnia in the final declaration of the NATO summit, Clinton 
said. In it, the NATO countries reaffirm their readiness to 
carry out air strikes under the authority of the UN Security 
Council in order to prevent Sarajevo and other threatened areas 
from ending up in a stranglehold. In addition, the allies are 
assigning the UN military on the ground the task of drawing up 
plans for relieving the UN contingent that is blocked inside 
Srebrenica, and for reopening Tuzla Airport for humanitarian 
aid. In this context, the UN commanders can ask NATO to carry 
out air strikes, said the U.S. President. He also said the NATO 
countries had agreed that tougher rhetoric can only be used if 
it is translated into action. According to Clinton, air strikes 
now depend first on how the Bosnian Serbs behave, and second on 
what the UN commanders in Bosnia request. 
  The President was "pleased" that the Partnership for Peace 
initiative proposed by the United States was approved "at this 
historic meeting, my first NATO meeting." "General Powell will 
immediately contact the military" in those East European 
countries interested in the Partnership with a view to preparing 
future forms of cooperation, such as military exercises. 
  Clinton also said he was pleased with the stronger role 
which 
the Western European Union -- the defense component of the 
European Union -- will play in the alliance from now on. 
However, in his view NATO remains the most important defense 
alliance, and he therefore thanked Secretary General Manfred 
Woerner for his strong leadership.

  [Text] Mainz (DPA) -- NATO Secretary General Manfred 
Woerner has said that the alliance is aiming for a "strategic 
alliance" with Russia. In an interview with ZDF today, Woerner 
said "what we want is a greater Europe, if you will, a lasting 
Euro-Atlantic community with the Russians so that they do not 
have the feeling of being excluded or even encircled." 
  Woerner defended the concept of Partnership for Peace with 
the countries of Central and East Europe that was approved at 
the NATO summit in Brussels, and pointed out that consultations 
were envisaged in the event of a crisis. Even though there were 
no security guarantees for these countries as yet, this did not 
mean "that we will stand idly by if they are attacked." 
  As for NATO's attitude to the Bosnia conflict, Woerner said, 
with regard to possible air strikes in Bosnia, the alliance 
depended on the approval of the United Nations. The opinion of 
UN troops on the ground also had to be heard. However, he had 
the impression that there was "much greater determination" in 
the alliance: "Things cannot stay the way they are."

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- German Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe thinks the NATO summit in Brussels was a "great success." 
In an article for BILD (Wednesday [12 January] edition) Ruehe 
writes that the alliance has opened "clear prospects of 
accession" for the neighbors in East Europe. The minister goes 
on to say: "On the way toward this, Partnership for Peace makes 
closer cooperation possible without shutting anyone out. It is 
in the interest of our country that democracy and prosperity, 
NATO, and the European Union should not end at Germany's eastern 
borders. The eastward expansion of NATO means more stability 
for the whole of Europe." 
  Ruehe emphasizes: "America has once again affirmed its 
commitment to security in Europe in an impressive way. The 
alliance has decided on the steps necessary for its reform. 
America recognizes the European Union as an independent partner 
within the alliance." The article was prereleased in an edited

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "NATO: Ciampi To Summit on </F>
Partnerships, Mediterranean"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 10 Jan (ANSA) -- Italian Premier Carlo 
Azeglio Ciampi today hailed the U.S.-sponsored Partnership for 
Peace with East Europe -- adopted by the NATO summit this 
afternoon -- highlighting how they could be both reinforced by 
the Anglo-Italian initiative to bring former Warsaw Pact 
countries closer to the European Union, and counterbalanced by a 
similar commitment to the Mediterranean area's security. 
  Addressing the opening session of the summit, Ciampi praised 
the "appropriate and timely" nature of the Partnerships for 
Peace initiative, but also stressed Italy's concern that it be 
accompanied by efforts to bring East European countries closer 
to the political and common security dimensions of the 
Maastricht Treaty. 
  In this process, he said, it was imperative not to isolate 
but to involve Russia in "an ever closer dialogue" with the 
West, while responding to the security and stability needs of 
East Europe -- needs that can be met not only via the 
Partnership but also through closer ties with the EU [European 
Union], he said. 
  In the other chief concern of his speech, Ciampi said "the 
time has come for the Atlantic Alliance to contribute more 
directly and systematically to the achievement of conditions of 
security and stability in the Mediterranean." 
  Italy was thus proposing, he said, the creation of a 
high-level study group -- initially non-governmental -- of NATO 
and Mediterranean countries to lay the groundwork for a future 
regional security arrangement. Ciampi urged that these ideas, 
"which regard an area of vital interest, not only for Italy," 
should receive "understanding and support" from all NATO 
partners. 
  On transatlantic relations -- in which he called for 
outstanding trade disputes to be settled in a spirit of 
"cooperation and solidarity" -- Ciampi stressed that the 
strengthening of pan-European security and defence structure 
will not weaken but reinforce the Atlantic Alliance. But the 
crucial element in the present phase, he reiterated, is NATO's 
ties with East Europe and with Russia in particular. The 
success of the Atlantic Alliance, he said "will depend largely 
on our ability to extend co-operation with the new democracies 
of Central and East Europe, responding to their needs for 
stability and security." The "uncertain" political situation in 
Russia, he said, had increased "feelings of insecurity" in East 
Europe, prompting desires for NATO membership. This situation 
called for "prudence and clear-sightedness," he said, rather 
than "premature alarm." 
  No one can predict how the Russian situation will evolve, he 
went on: It will depend "partly on us" to avert the rise of 
nationalism and instability. But East European countries must 
also work to prevent the occurrence "of what they and all of us 
fear," he said. 
  "In other words, the best way to prevent instability and a 
new imperialism in Russia is to try to help Moscow rid itself of 
its old complex of isolation and encirclement." 
  Thus, dialogue with Russia must be increased as much as 
possible -- but "Russia must also understand that rash moves 
towards its neighbours would be seen as a return to the 
ambitions of old, and would call into question the entire 
philosophy that inspires our present attitude." 
  He added that a significant contribution to these efforts 
would also come from the increased political importance that 
will be given to future meetings of the Group of Seven most 
industrialised nations. 
  Ciampi ended his speech by speaking of another "important 
task" facing NATO: a new role in peacekeeping operations under 
the aegis of the United Nations or the Conference for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe. He voiced Italy's proposal for 
looking at the possibility of creating an international 
monitoring system that might use advanced technologies to 
quickly inform the international community of the violation of 
human rights, cease-fires, and other accords. 
  Another Italian idea Ciampi aired is the the use of 
nonlethal 
weapons for peacekeeping missions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "USA and EU Have Common Desire To </F>
Build on Uruguay Round Agreement"; as released by Brussels 
TEXTLINE database] 
  [Text] Talks between the U.S. representative for trade 
matters, Mickey Kantor, and three European Commissioners 
highlighted the common desire of the EC and the United States to: 
  (a) Reinforce and expand as much as possible the results of 
the Uruguay Round by the time of the signature of the agreements; 
  (b) Go further in the organization and liberalization of 
international trade. 
  After meeting Sir Leon Brittan, Mr. Kantor held talks with 
Mr. Bangemann and Mr. Vanni d'Archirafi. Below is an overview 
of the results of the three meetings. Sir Leon Brittan and 
Mickey Kantor discussed: 

  -  The procedures to be implemented 
by the two parties for the Geneva agreements to be signed by 
mid-April as scheduled. On the Community side, the European 
Parliament will be consulted (although it cannot, obviously, 
modify the content of the agreements); 
  -  The efforts to be made to 
improve the results achieved, especially with regard to market 
access. The European Commission and the U.S. Administration 
believe a meeting of the "quadrilateral" (EC/United 
States/Japan/Canada) appropriate before 15 February as well as 
contacts with certain Asian countries; 
  -  The situation in some 
specific sectors (maritime services, financial services); 
  -  The 
situation concerning public procurement. The GATT agreement 
covers the contracts concluded by the central authorities. The 
EC attaches great importance to further progress by the United 
States in liberalization at the level of the States of the 
Union; 
  -  The subsequent efforts to go beyond the results of the 
Uruguay Round. The World Trade Organization (WTO) will not only 
have to implement Uruguay Round agreements and manage the new 
system to settle differences and the mechanism for examining 
trade policies, but it should also develop new working programs 
on trade/environment and trade/competition problems. The EC and 
the United States are in agreement about the importance and 
urgency of these developments. Mr. Kantor also discussed the 
aspect of "working conditions and standards" which the EC is 
examining. The two interlocutors also brought up the subject of 
aluminium. A third multilateral meeting (after those in Moscow 
and Washington) between the main producer countries and main 
importers will take place next week in Brussels. 
  Mr. Bangemann and Mr. Kantor 
discussed: 

  -  Telecommunications. Mr. Kantor confirmed that 
the central government was pressuring the states of the Union to 
free access to their public contracts. As for standardization, 
a few problems exist on copyright and European standards; Mr. 
Bangemann will go into more depth on these matters with his 
American interlocutors when he visits the United States in 
spring; 
  -  Shipbuilding. Mr. Bangemann and Mr. Kantor agreed that 
the negotiations had to be concluded urgently in the framework 
of the OECD on aid and trade; 
  -  Aluminium. The multilateral 
approach is considered by far preferable to unilateral 
restrictions. That is why both the EC and the United States 
would like successful talks next week in Brussels between the 
main producers (including Russia) and importers. Mr. Vanni 
d'Archirafi and Mr. Kantor examined; 
  -  Financial services. The 
significance of the result of the Uruguay Round (involving the 
inclusion of financial services in the GATT rules, through the 
General Agreement on Trade in Services, GATS) has perhaps not 
yet been understood by the business world; an effort to clarify 
this seems appropriate. The fact remains that the agreement 
must be completed and improved; 
  -  Public procurement. The 
Commissioner reaffirmed the importance that the EC attaches to 
the application by the United States of the commitments of the 
memorandum of understanding of May concerning the extension of 
liberalization to levels other than the level of central 
administration (federal).

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Council Presidency -- Several Greek </F>
Ministers Give an Idea of their Priorities"; as released by 
Brussels TEXTLINE database] 
  [Text] Revealed at the end of December, the main priorities 
of the Council Presidency, assumed by Greece since 1 January, 
were set out by different Greek Ministers in the Papandreou 
Government on the occasion of a visit by a small group of 
European journalists to Athens. Messr. Moraitis (agriculture), 
Pangalos (deputy foreign minister, who will chair the General 
Affairs Councils), Simitis (industry, trade, technology and 
research), Romeos (secretary of state for the national economy), 
Papantoniou (deputy minister for the national economy), Boutos 
(governor of the bank of Greece), as well as Mrs. Melina 
Mercouri (culture) and Mrs. Papazoi (secretary of state for the 
environment, town and country planning and public works) 
stressed the following elements: 
  1) General Affairs. Mr. Theodoros Pangalos spoke of the 
following dossiers: 
  i) Community anti-racist policy: "It is very difficult to 
legislate against" the phenomenon of racism and the far-right; 
  ii) Committee of the regions: The one country behind, 
Portugal, has told Athens that the Portuguese delegation within 
this body would be "ready by next week," which will enable the 
Committee to hold its first meeting in January (but not, as 
planned, 15 January); 
  iii) Partnership in Europe: Refusing to speak out on the 
American plan which Mr. Clinton will be presenting to NATO, Mr. 
Pangalos said that there had not yet been a debate on the 
possible accession of Hungary and Poland to the Western European 
Union. On two occasions, he will have contacts at different 
levels in Hungary, and said that it was necessary to "think 
along the lines of a variable geometry"; 
  iv) Cyprus: The need to apply pressure on Turkey (which 
"decides the Turkish Cypriot policy" whereas the majority of 
people who voted in this part of the island "are settlers") 
"remains as true as ever"; 
  v) Former Yugoslavia: "The Community must not always let 
itself be led into an action that leads to nothing," says Mr. 
Pangalos, who will "soon" be meeting Merrs. Owen and Stoltenberg 
in Geneva. And he stated: "There are limits to the European 
commitment" if there are no positive responses on the part of 
those engaged in the conflict; 
  2) Agriculture. Georges Moraitis said that his meeting on 
Wednesday (at the meeting between the Greek Government and the 
Commission) with Commissioner Steichen had essentially concerned 
coordinating the necessary actions to tackle six problems. 
  i) Enlargement. It is up to the General Affairs Council to 
conduct negotiations with the four candidate countries, but the 
Agriculture Ministers cannot be left out of aspects that concern 
them. Mr. Moraitis says that personally he believed that formal 
consultation of the Agricultural Council would be a "good 
initiative to avoid problems." For the time being, Athens is, 
however, only thinking about bilateral discussions at 
ministerial level, even should the Presidency try to make things 
work so that the Agricultural Council "can give its opinion"; 
  ii) Setting agricultural prices and connected measures for 
1994-1995. The Commission will submit its proposal "toward the 
end of January" and the debate begun at ministerial level at the 
21/22 February Council; 
  iii) Follow-up to the elaboration of the final texts of 
GATT. While the experts finalize the text of the Uruguay Round, 
it will be up to the Agriculture Council to assure its 
compatibility with the revised CAP; 
  iv) The revision of the common organisation of markets in 
the following sectors: 
  \ a) wine (the Commission's final proposal toward the 
mid-February and debate in Council from March onwards); 
  b) fats, fruits and vegetables (Commission proposal in 
April, according to Mr. Steichen); 
  c) sugar (the Twelve have more time in this sector, the 
current regulation having been prolonged and not needing 
replacing before 1995); 
  v) The modification of the regulation relating to the 
control by member states of measures funded by the EAGGF 
[European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund] (Commission 
proposal in February and beginning of ministerial discussions in 
March); 
  vi) Relations between the EU [European Union] and East 
Europe in agriculture, the Commission's proposals being expected 
"toward the middle of the presidency." Asked about the 
possibility of the EU deciding to reduce the controls by the 
Twelve on agricultural exports from these countries, Georges 
Moraitis said that this question (which is the subject of a 
current study) would be "raised"; but it is "too early to say 
what measures will be taken," the aim only being to "reestablish 
a relationship which would allow for wider cooperation" with 
these countries. At its own initiative, the Greek presidency 
will also grant priority to two other dossiers, these are: 
  a) Promoting discussion on inter-professional 
organisations. For Mr. Moraitis, there are today farmers 
organisations and production cooperatives: it would be "very 
useful to have mixed organisations too," which would "facilitate 
the final decision at Community level for each product"; 
  b) Employment of the new farmers and, through this, 
questions of means of succession in farming. As the agricultural 
population is ageing, "we must ease the integration of the 
young" (which in particular poses the problem of the 
transmission of quotas). According to Mr. Moraitis, the 
Commissioner showed "great interest" in this question which, as 
that of the inter-professional organisations, will be at the 
centre of the 16/17 May informal meeting. 
  3. Ecofin. According to Georges Papantoniou, three 
categories 
of subjects will be studied by the Finance Ministers, these are. 
  i) Materialization of the white paper, the presidency being 
resolved to take "all the initiatives required to promote it as 
soon as possible" from three angles: 
  a) the policy of employment (in collaboration with the 
Ministers for Employment); 
  b) improving the competitiveness of SMEs, subject for 
which it has been agreed with Commissioner Vanni d'Archirafi 
that the Internal Market Council would deal with on two 
occasions on the basis of an action programme to be presented by 
the Commission; 
  c) the realisation of the trans-European networks, Ecofin 
having the "responsibility for financing them." 
  ii) the realisation of macro-economic policy, the Ecofin 
Council having to discuss the Commission's annual report during 
the Greek presidency and, in June, the major economic policy 
guidelines (to be adopted at the Corfu Summit). The Twelve will 
also learn of the convergence programmes for Denmark, Greece, 
Ireland and Portugal. As for the 2nd phase of European Monetary 
Union [EMU], Mr. Papantoniou said that he would soon visit to 
the president of the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt. 
Speaking personally, he said that Mr. Lamfalussy would not be 
called on to attend every Ecofin Council session, but rather be 
invited "from time to time." As for the nature of the activities 
to hand over to the European Monetary Institute [EMI] (narrow 
definition or management of the common reserves), the Deputy 
Minister for that National Economy said that Athens supported 
full implementation of Maastricht, but that there were two other 
parameters to take into account: 
  a) The first phase of EMU had not been a success, having 
been characterized by a great "relaxing of the rules of monetary 
cooperation" following the crisis of the European Monetary 
System [EMS], which would make it "illogical to be particularly 
ambitious for the second phase"; 
  b) that fact that a member state regarded as premature 
handing over the powers of monetary authority to the EMI, 
considering that this "presupposed much too greater 
convergence." Whence, the Greek presidency notes that "it is not 
realistic to expect EMI to work immediately like a Central Bank 
embryo." As for the 3rd phase of EMU, Mr. Papantoniou firmly 
denied being ready to open the debate in order for the 
Maastricht criteria to be relaxed. But Yannis Boutos said that, 
personally, he feared a situation arising which would force one 
to reconsider the criteria for convergence. As for the EMS, 
Georges Papantoniou said it was "premature" and "of not much 
use" to study its reinforcement under the Greek presidency, the 
priority having to go to "considerable promoting cohesion before 
thinking about reconstructing the previous EMS"; 
  iii) Strengthening relations with East Europe, especially 
in the light of choices to be made in the trans-European 
networks.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP 94/16: "Mr. Vanni d'Archirafi in </F>
Spain To Prepare the Trademark Office"] 
  [Text] Mr. Vanni d'Archirafi [commissioner for 
institutional matters and internal market] met the Spanish 
Industry Minister Juan Manuel Eguiagaray in Madrid on 10 January 
to examine issues concerning the establishment of the 
[trademark] office that will be located in Alicante. They 
agreed that the organizational work should be speeded up in view 
of the official opening. In this respect, the Spanish 
Government will provide the offices until a new building be 
built. While awaiting the meeting of the management committee 
and of the budget committee -- the two management bodies of the 
office, which will open in the second half of March -- the 
initial staffing for this year will be limited to 20 
individuals. This figure could rise to 50 next year and reach 
220 to 260 when the office is fully operational. 
  Given the numerous preparatory tasks for setting up of the 
office, it is estimated that the first application for a 
Community trademark can only be made at the office 18 to 24 
months after the regulations have come into force. 
  The Council adopted the regulations at its 20 December 1993 
meeting, 13 years after the first proposal on Community 
trademarks was made. 
  An important step has been made on the way to the full 
materialization of the internal market. For the first time, a 
new title of industrial property on a European scale has been 
created. This title, which will be good for 10 years and will 
be renewable, will be delivered by the office established by the 
regulations, the headquarters of which will be in Alicante, 
Spain.

<F P=106> [Article by Stephen Goodwin under the "Inside Parliament" </F>
rubric: "Major Exercises Very Considerable Caution"] 
  [Excerpt] John Major yesterday refused to extend the 
commitment of British troops to help with humanitarian aid in 
Bosnia. Reporting to the Commons on the NATO summit, the Prime 
Minister parried repeated demands for air strikes, maintaining 
he had the political will to order an attack if commanders near 
at hand deemed it wise. 
  Displaying his customary contempt for the interventionist 
approach of Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, and 
agreeing with Tory backbenchers who urged caution, Mr Major said 
it was easy to say "all you have to do is unleash an aircraft or 
two and all is well." 
  "It may well not be a wise policy. It may be necessary at 
some stage, but it is a policy that should be entered into with 
very considerable caution." 
  The 16 NATO leaders reaffirmed a readiness to carry out air 
strikes to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo. They 
threatened force to break the Serb siege of Srebrenica--so that 
a contingent of Dutch troops can relieve the Canadians--and to 
open Tuzla airport for aid flights. 
  Mr Major made plain a growing impatience with the warring 
factions. Co-operation with Serb, Croat and Muslim commanders 
on the ground was "very patchy indeed," he said. "There is 
great frustration building up amongst governments, particularly 
who have troops on the ground, at what does seem to be a 
complete double standard, with the participants saying they want 
peace in Geneva and acting in a fashion which denies every 
single word they utter in the peace negotiations." 
  John Smith, the Labour leader, said it was "intolerable" 
that 
a defenceless population in Sarajevo should be shelled so 
relentlessly. "Repeated declarations which are not followed 
through risk undermining the credibility of NATO and the UN 
operation and strengthen the hands of the those who have become 
adept at defying the wishes of the international community." 
  Mr Smith urged the Prime Minister to put an end to 
suggestions that British forces might be withdrawn from Bosnia 
when the winter was over. "Don't we need a commitment to 
increase ground forces, as requested by the UN to make a greater 
effort to bring some peace to Bosnia?" 
  But Mr Major replied: "We have committed ourselves to assist 
with humanitarian aid. I have to say that is not a commitment I 
am at this stage prepared to extend until I am certain of the 
security of the British troops working for the UN there." 
  Mr Ashdown said the Prime Minister had been warned on many 
occasions that the "bottom-line credibility" of the UN was at 
risk on Bosnia and cited President Clinton's words: "If we 
cannot show the determination to deliver our promises, then 
don't make promises." 
  Biting back, Mr Major said that unlike Mr Ashdown, he had 
been careful about making promises. He has shifted and 
manoeuvered through this whole operation from everything to 
all-out war to apparently "pulling out immediately." Labour MP 
Andrew Faulds, decried the "mumblings and bumblings" of Douglas 
Hurd and other EU [European Union] foreign ministers and asked 
if Mr Major personally had the will to take military action. 
  "Yes, every head of government had the will," the Prime 
Minister replied. "What we need to be sure of is that it is 
wise to do so." Practical decisions on air strikes were best 
made not by politicians but by commanders near at hand -- and on 
the sanction of the UN secretary general. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Ghost at NATO's Feast"] </F>
  [Text] "What really matters is Bosnia," said a senior 
Clinton administration official quoted in the FINANCIAL TIMES 
last September, discussing prospects for the NATO summit which 
opens in Brussels today. If by January 10 NATO was "there, and 
doing something," the summit would be a success. But if 
Sarajevo had "gone down the tubes" it would be a failure. 
  January 10 is here, and NATO is not "there." At least, it is 
no more there than it was in September. The headquarters unit 
provided by NATO for the UN Protection Force (Unprofor) is still 
there, but the force is no more able than it was four months ago 
to protect the civilian population of Sarajevo and other towns 
from Serb shelling, which continued cynically through the 
Christmas "truce," if anything at greater intensity than before. 
In August NATO threatened air strikes if the "strangulation" of 
Sarajevo continued. It persists but there have been no air 
strikes. 
  The UN commander in Bosnia, General Francis Briquemont -- a 
representative of NATO's host nation -- has just resigned, 
"exhausted" after six months in the job and publicly deploring 
the "fantastic gap" between UN Security Council resolutions, 
"the will to execute those resolutions and the means available 
to commanders in the field." The resolutions in question 
authorise the use of "all necessary means" to ensure that relief 
supplies reach their destination. Yet tanks intended for the 
protection of UN troops trying to reopen the airport at Tuzla, 
so that relief supplies can be flown in, are stranded at a base 
in Serbia because Bosnian Serb leaders (against whose forces the 
protection is required) are allowed to block their passage; and 
the Serbian government extracts payment from the UN for allowing 
supplies through, to offset the effect of sanctions which the UN 
has itself imposed. 
<H5>  Peace Agreement </H5>
  When the U.S. official spoke in September of NATO being 
"there, and doing something," she alluded to the plan for a NATO 
force including 25,000 U.S. troops, to supervise the 
implementation of a peace agreement between the three Bosnian 
parties. Today not only does a peace agreement seem further off 
than ever, but no one any longer believes, after the retreat 
from Somalia and Haiti, that U.S. troops would be sent to Bosnia 
even if a peace agreement were reached. 
  In short, while Sarajevo may not quite yet have disappeared 
"down the tubes," in other respects conditions in Bosnia are 
precisely those required for the NATO summit to be a failure. 
Nor can NATO get away with blaming the UN for this state of 
affairs. The same governments call the tune in both 
organisations. 
<H5>  Military Muscle </H5>
  Only NATO could provide the political and military muscle 
for 
the UN to enforce its resolutions in Bosnia, and it has 
conspicuously failed to do so. No wonder, then, that Central 
European governments lack confidence in it. No wonder they 
interpret the proposed Partnerships for Peace, not as a bold 
strategy for gradually expanding NATO's zone of peace but as a 
fudge, designed to avoid any risk of confrontation between NATO 
and Russia. 
  Indeed who can expect that NATO would stand up to Russia if 
it lacks the courage to stand up to Serbia and Croatia? Who can 
be surprised, when Serbia is allowed to get away with ignoring 
frontiers and forcibly moving populations in the name of ethnic 
solidarity, that Russian leaders from Boris Yeltsin downwards 
increasingly invoke the same principle in dealing with other ex- 
Soviet republics, and seem increasingly disposed to defend the 
involvement of Russian military units in conflicts beyond 
Russian borders as a contribution to "stability" or even 
"peacekeeping?" 
  Of course, Russia is not Serbia and Yeltsin is not 
Milosevic. 
There is still a chance that Russia under Mr Yeltsin's 
leadership will remain democratic and friendly to the West. 
NATO leaders do not want to jeopardise that chance, and 
recognise that any Russian regime will be concerned with the 
stability of Russia's neighbours, particularly those with large 
ethnic Russian populations. But that does not mean they should 
encourage anyone in Russia to think that such interests can be 
asserted legitimately or with impunity by military force. 
Further passivity in Bosnia is all too liable to have that 
effect.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Bombs Over Bosnia?"] </F>
  [Text] Bombing the Serbs is back on the international 
agenda -- but is it more than words? And should it be? The 
history of this proposal does not inspire much confidence. The 
threat of aerial action against Serb forces in Bosnia may have 
toned down some of their more extreme actions and could possibly 
have a similar effect again. But the tactical wisdom of 
actually doing it has never been argued through. On the last 
occasion the proposal was aired, it seemed more a substitute for 
serious steps to end the war than a commitment to take them, and 
soon got mired in transatlantic bickering. It has now 
resurfaced at the NATO summit in an equally unconvincing way. 
  Last summer the idea was energetically pushed from 
Washington 
against a chorus of European doubts, particularly from Britain 
and France as the two NATO powers with most forces in the field. 
This time the initiative has come, rather oddly from France 
(supported by Belgium), while Washington plays the reluctant 
role. Mr Clinton no longer has the domestic political space in 
which to play heroes on foreign fields and has enough anyhow on 
his external menu. In Europe there is even less commitment to 
intervene actively in Bosnia than before. All the nudges and 
hints these days (particularly from British ministers) point 
instead towards eventual disengagement. Yet the devastation of 
Serb guns in the streets of Sarajevo still has the power to 
shock, and it would look particularly bad if the NATO summit had 
nothing to say. 
  NATO had already agreed in August, after a couple of months 
of haggling with Washington, to undertake air strikes -- if need 
be, and with the prior approval of the UN Secretary-General. 
The Security Council has long authorised all necessary means to 
protect the "safe areas" and ensure the flow of humanitarian 
aid. On paper, therefore, no new decision is required. There 
is no shortage of issues over which an air strike, if thought 
likely to be effective, might be launched. The airfield at 
Tuzla remains obstinately closed, mocking the UN's attempts to 
provide minimum humanitarian supplies. Mr Clinton had a point 
yesterday when he taxed his European allies with lack of 
credibility -- though since the last abortive effort he has 
switched off too. 
  Like so much else in the Bosnian crisis, it might have been 
well if it had been done quickly. By now, when the 
international community has conceded the division of Bosnia more 
or less on Serb terms, air strikes would be an unpredictable 
diversion. They would also be irrelevant to the growing 
Muslim-Croat conflict, and they are opposed by nearly all UN 
workers and soldiers in Bosnia. More effective policing of the 
no-fly-zone is a less provocative policy (which might help 
re-open Tuzla). But, truly, the Bosnians need real help -- more 
aid, more peacekeepers, more political commitment -- on the 
ground rather than in the air.

<F P=106> [Article by Martin Woollacott: "An Illusory Game of Building </F>
Blocs for East and West"] 
  [Text] Shades from the past have haunted the meeting of the 
North Atlantic nations in Brussels. There are curious 
similarities between now and the years after the second world 
war when Russia and the West were not yet adversaries and the 
fate of East Europe was still unclear. The ghosts of the 
statesmen who failed to head off the cold war, and who then 
created and extended the alliance--of Bevin and Eden, of Truman 
and Dulles, of Eisenhower and Adenauer-- seem to hover behind 
today's leaders in the group photographs with which every 
summit, like a school reunion, begins and ends. 
  We can imagine their expressions as far from benign for, in 
spite of appearances, the present NATO leaders have agreed 
nothing in Brussels that adds to the security of North America, 
of Europe, or of the states of the former Soviet Union. Of the 
four "achievements" associated with the meeting, three--the 
Partnership for Peace proposals, the agreements on strengthening 
the European side of the alliance and on flexible task forces, 
and the deal on Ukrainian nuclear weapons--were put together in 
advance and one, the resolution on possible air strikes in 
Bosnia, was cobbled together on the spot. None of the four 
could be described as worthless, yet there is a lack of 
substance, a sense that the real objective has been to avoid the 
issues concerned rather than to tackle them, that must give deep 
cause for concern. 
  The conjunction of the Ukraine deal and the Partnership 
proposals is particularly ironic. Ever since the Soviet Union 
broke up, it has been an eminently worthwhile object of American 
policy to persuade all the successor states except Russia to 
give up their nuclear weapons. If the Ukraine deal is not upset 
by local extremists that has now been achieved. For President 
Clinton, it must have seemed like a piece of perfect political 
geometry--the kind that works from every angle. It would please 
the European members of NATO because it gets rid of a heap of 
nuclear weapons on the continent's doorstep. It would please 
Americans, because some of the weapons are still targeted on 
them, a fact which Clinton emphasised, even though he knows that 
the only conceivable targets for Ukrainian nuclear weapons are 
now in Russia. And it would please the Russians, because a 
Ukraine without nuclear weapons is likely to be more open, to 
put it mildly, to Russian influence than one which retains them. 
  Yet in the light of the Partnership for Peace proposals what 
does that mean? In effect the two taken together consign the 
Ukraine, and by extension most or all states of the former 
Soviet Union, to a Russian bloc while not in any certain way 
gathering in the East Europeans to the West. This is the 
problem with the argument for a cautious NATO and European Union 
approach to the East Europeans. It ignores the fact that 
rightly or wrongly there already is a Russian bloc, a Russian 
sphere, wanted by the Russians and already conceded by the 
Americans, and that the question is what is in it and what is 
not. If NATO can only bring itself to offer the Poles, 
Hungarians and Czechs a vague right of future entry, we can be 
sure that the Baltic states, the Ukraine and Belaurus will never 
enter the organisation as full members. That is probably right, 
practical, and even proper. But it shows that there already is 
a line of demarcation between the states on the "Russian" side 
and those on the "European" side; and it underlines the fact 
that we have unwisely left the status of the East Europeans 
unclear as between the two. 
  Neither the so-called strengthening of the West European 
"pillar" nor the flexibility that the proposals on joint task 
forces appears to offer are what they seem. The first registers 
the fact of American troop withdrawals and represents a success 
in the long French campaign to diminish American influence in 
Europe. That is a campaign which the French have waged for so 
long during years when it was impossible of achievement that 
now, when it perhaps can be achieved, they have long ceased to 
examine whether the objective is either worthwhile or realistic. 
  Flexibility, meanwhile, simply means arrangements for 
European members of NATO to do things without the Americans. 
But the whole strength of NATO in the past was that, exemptions 
for France and one or two smaller members aside, it always did 
things together. Doing things together in fact became its main 
purpose. Sometimes the things were illogical or trivial or even 
dangerous, but that was less important than the fact that they 
were done. To end this often painful tradition of unanimous 
action is not an achievement but a defeat. 
  Which brings us to the Balkans. Can it be that something 
finally, is about to be done, by NATO, working together, in 
Bosnia? Unhappily, the threat of air strikes which was revived 
in Brussels is not a policy or even part of a policy. It is the 
product, again, of the French determination to display 
leadership in Europe, and to satisfy a French public opinion 
which has lately become more interventionist. The British have 
joined in for tactical reasons. Both countries are 
contemplating an eventual withdrawal and a display of firmness 
now might make that both a little safer and a little less 
undignified. The chances are that the threat will make the 
Serbs more co-operative in both Srebrenica and Tuzla, and may 
also reduce the firing on Sarajevo. If not, there might even be 
a strike or two to produce the same effect. Such benefits are 
not to be sneezed at, but air strikes would only be genuinely 
worthwhile if they were part of a larger intervention, now an 
exceedingly remote possibility. 
  NATO was never just an alliance against the Soviet Union. It 
represented an internationalisation of military force in the 
industrialised world, wrapping armed forces together in a web of 
common purposes, common action, and common weaponry in such a 
way that they could never fight one another again and in such a 
way that most of them, with the exception of the United States, 
were incapable of fighting anybody outside the alliance on their 
own any more. It is for these reasons that it was and is worth 
preserving. 
  Such assets do not come down to us in logical ways--as an 
expression of European separateness, as the French would like, 
or as an instrument of Russian and American partnership, as 
Moscow perhaps thought in the days when it too spoke of NATO 
membership. They come down to us in the package in which they 
have been bundled by history. All the more reason to worry when 
that package, in spite of superficial successes, threatens to 
unravel.

<F P=106> [Article signed FDS: "`Politicians Have Themselves To Blame </F>
for Their Bad Image'--Prime Minister Wants To Make `Restoring 
Order' A Priority"] 
  [Text] "The fact that politicians have such a bad image is 
partly their own fault. If they want to reinstate politics and 
win back their credibility, then they must first restore order 
themselves. Let us make this a priority for the coming months." 
  Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, speaking yesterday at a CVP 
[Christian People's Party] New Year's reception in Ingelmunster, 
was referring tacitly but unmistakeably to the present 
atmosphere of scandal in parliament, following on from the 
Agusta case. "In the past, and far too frequently even today, 
all sorts of questions where wrongly settled on a 
party-political basis," he said. "They went from telephone 
connections through appointments to government contracts. This 
gave birth to the totally incorrect image that anything can be 
arranged on a party-political basis." 
  It was an analysis of the antipolitical atmosphere currently 
overshadowing parliament that amounted to the following 
diagnosis: it is your own fault. "Politics must become far more 
humble," he said. "Politics neither can nor should pull 
everything toward it and want to decide everything. And in 
those matters that must be settled politically, a partisan 
approach must be excluded as far as possible, especially when 
the practical functioning of government is involved. To this 
end, decision-making procedures in a range of fields must be 
made legally and administratively objective. Obvious examples 
are recruitment and appointments in the civil service and 
magistracy. Fortunately, important steps recently have been 
taken in the right direction, but we must go farther." 
  The prime minister then broached the theme of `rendering 
services.' "The mediatory role often expected of politicians by 
the population must be made increasingly official by appointing 
ombudsman positions," he said. "That is what has happened in 
state-owned companies. That is also the purpose of the 
government's draft bill to set up a general ombudsman position. 
Greater autonomy and responsibility must also be given to the 
departments concerned in awarding government contracts. The 
principle of seeking the best price-quality ratio must be made 
more general." 
  "The practice of (indirect) economic compensation, which has 
cost us a lot of money but resulted in little, must also be 
stopped," he said. "The legislation on government contracts 
must be changed in this sense." This comment can be applied 
without modification to the Agusta case, where alleged 
compensation was decisive, with far-reaching consequences. 
  The prime minister continued his thoughts in that direction, 
still without mentioning Agusta by name. "The financing of the 
political parties also continued for too long in a grey shadowy 
area which poses many questions," he said. "There is a need for 
clarity and transparency. The laws on the limitation of 
electoral campaigns and the financing of the political parties 
are steps in the right direction. However, they must be 
tightened up." 
  There was a third recommendation which flows directly from 
the Agusta affair, namely the abuse of parliamentary immunity. 
"The parliamentary status gives rise to misunderstanding and 
even suspicion," Dehaene said. "Does parliamentary immunity 
really still belong to our time? In fact, the status offers no 
protection, but the contrary: Now MP's are judged twice." Once 
during the debate on lifting their immunity, and a second time 
if prosecution actually takes place. "The financial, social and 
fiscal status must also be clarified," Dehaene said. "There is 
no need for privileges or such things, but a proper social and 
financial status allowing MP's to work well, a status that also 
makes the position attractive again." 
  "The St. Michael's agreement contains important elements of 
political renewal," Dehaene said, briefly interrupting his 
invisible Agusta thread at Ingelmunster, but soon picking it up 
again. "The renewal is too slow. We must go fasterr. Let us 
make that a priority for the coming months. But then it is 
necessary that clarity be quickly established in a number of 
areas. That is in the interest not only of those involved, but 
politics as a whole." That presupposes, the prime minister 
concluded, that "all instances respect the rules." This was 
understood as veiled criticism of the very regular breaches of 
confidentiality in the Agusta affair investigations. "Democracy 
is a delicate plant that must be nourished carefully," he said.

<F P=106> [Article signed W.A.: "Coeme Accuses Aerospatiale of </F>
Improper Practices -- Spitaels Reduces Pressure on Government"] 
  [Text] "Many lobbies were active in the purchase of the 
Army helicopters, but the decision was made properly. I know 
nothing of unlawful payments," Deputy Prime Minister Guy Coeme 
(PS) [French-speaking Socialist Party] said in his defense 
yesterday. Coeme also accused the French manufacturer 
Aerospatiale of having made improper proposals. Meanwhile, 
Walloon Minister President Guy Spitaels has said he did not want 
to harm either Dehaene or Claes. With this, the danger to the 
government appears to have receded. 
  Coeme spoke to the press yesterday after he had presented 
his 
document defending himself to the special parliamentary 
committee. Coeme said that, at the time of the negotiations on 
the helicopter purchase, he had warned against the "lobbyists 
who are swarming around the contract like vultures." Some 
people had never forgotten those words, Coeme said yesterday. 
  The minister also strongly attacked the French. Just one 
month after the decision to buy Agusta, rumors appeared in the 
French press about bribe payments. When the problem of the 
helicopters' excessive weight emerged, these rumors resurfaced. 
Coeme said, at that time, he had been approached by two 
Aerospatiale representatives who asked that the contract be 
broken. They exercised "very strong pressure," Coeme said, but 
he provided no further details. However, he was prepared to 
give additional explanations on the matter to public prosecutors. 
  In the meantime, the special parliamentary committee has 
decided to hear investigating magistrate Ancia and Coeme next 
week. Further investigations may be demanded by a councillor of 
the Supreme Court on the basis of these interrogations. 
  The Senate Judicial Affairs Committee is to give its verdict 
today on the partial lifting of the parliamentary immunity of 
regional ministers Guy Spitaels and Guy Mathot. 
  Both regional ministers oppose the move. They argue that the 
partial lifting of their immunity would make them look guilty in 
the eyes of public opinion. However, Spitaels and Mathot are 
prepared to answer Ancia's questions. Nevertheless, a majority 
of the committee will probably vote for lifting the immunity. 
In any case, the PSC [French-speaking Social-Christian Party] 
announced yesterday that it would vote for their immunity to be 
lifted. It is worth noting also that a number of PS members 
favor the lifting of immunity as well. Minister Jean-Maurice 
Dehousse and MP Jose Happart have already made comments to this 
effect. 
  In the meantime, the danger of a government crisis seems to 
have receded. The cabinet of Walloon Prime Minister Guy 
Spitaels denied yesterday that in his document the minister 
president had wanted to involve Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene 
and Foreign Minister Willy Claes in the case. The cabinet 
pointed out that the names of Dehaene and Claes were quoted by a 
witness whose testimony was formally denied by another witness. 
These comments were included in the defense to prove that the 
evidence of some people was totally unfounded.

<F P=106> [Article by Filip Verhoest: "Three Generals Admit Dumping"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Three high-ranking Belgian army officers have 
admitted to an inspector from the High Committee of Inspection 
that the offer from Agusta should have been rejected due to 
dumping. Their statements are included in the report by 
Commissioner Jean-Pierre Lachapelle, appended to the 
parliament's Ancia file. At the request of the Liege examining 
magistrate, Veronique Ancia, the inspector also scrutinized the 
contracting procedures. He concluded that they amount to a case 
of unfair competition. 
  Following an inspection at Agusta, inspectors from the High 
Committee of Inspection concluded that the Italians sold their 
helicopter at 12 percent under the cost price. According to the 
inspectors, a twin-engined helicopter was supplied for the price 
of a single-engined helicopter, constituting "a sale at a loss." 
The company refused to offer any explanation for this 
"abnormally low price." 
  "On the basis of the legislation regarding public contracts 
and the comments of Professor Flamme (the same expert which 
Deputy Prime Minister Guy Coeme called to his defense), this was 
sufficient reason to refuse the Agusta offer," writes inspector 
Lachapelle of the High Committee. He confronted three 
high-ranking army officers with this conclusion. They openly 
agreed with him. 
  "According to the law, a contract may not be awarded in such 
circumstances," declared General Major Jacobs on December 1992. 
"I did not know it, but Agusta's offer should have been 
rejected on the grounds that the price was abnormally low," said 
General Major Fournier on 8 December 1992. 
<H5>  Control </H5>
  From Inspector Lachapelle's report, it also appears that the 
Finance Inspectorate could not subject the contracting file to a 
thorough financial control. Inspector De Caesemaerker had just 
24 hours in order to give an "urgent advice." [passage omitted] 
  There was no question of a budgetary control. "In agreement 
with the minister," the assistant private secretary to the 
national Defense Minister Guy Coeme -- Jean-Louis Mazy -- 
decided to sidestep budgetary control. Such control is, 
however, obligatory by the terms of the ministerial decision of 
13 March 1986. The head of the department responsible for the 
budget control protested against this maneuver. 
  According to Mazy, budget control was scrapped "in order not 
to unnecessary delay the procedures." Nothing of the question, 
says inspector Lachapelle of the High Committee: "The real 
reason is that a delay in the procedure would have obliged the 
authorities to take account of the latest offers from 
Aerospatiale (Agusta's French competitor)." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- Francis Briquemont, commander in 
chief of the UN troops stationed in the war zone [in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina], has strongly criticized the West's position 
toward the war in Bosnia. In an interview with the news 
magazine DER SPIEGEL, the Belgian general said he is tired of 
listening to NATO's threats of air strikes on Serb positions. 
Air strikes cannot solve the problems of the surrounded and 
besieged towns and cities like Sarajevo. Permanent threats will 
not make the warring parties more willing to make peace. The 
West lacks a clear strategy. Too many opinions are being 
expressed, too many resolutions passed, but not enough funds are 
being made available to implement the political objectives. 
  The general, who will give up the supreme command of the UN 
troops in former Yugoslavia earlier than scheduled, said the 
Blue Helmets will therefore "soon be unable to continue to 
provide humanitarian aid." Unless a peace plan is agreed 
quickly, the Blue Helmet mission as a whole will need to be 
questioned. Briquemont said literally: "It is an illusion to 
believe that the UN troops can continue to provide humanitarian 
aid indefinitely when shots continue to be fired at the same 
time." 
  The article was prereleased in an edited version.

<F P=106> [Article signed VDV: "Briquemont Says Improved Arming of </F>
Muslims Means Strategy of Tension"] 
  [Text] Brussels/Sarajevo, 18 Jan (Belga) -- In a radio 
interview with BRTN [Belgian Dutch-speaking Radio and 
Television] from the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, General Francis 
Briquemont, the Belgian commander of the UN troops in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, said that in his opinion the parties in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina were following a "strategy of tension," with 
the peace talks, which are to resume today in Geneva, as main 
objective. He described the situation in Sarajevo on Tuesday 
[18 January] morning as "relatively calm" and "far more peaceful 
than during the Christmas cease-fire." 
  The general said that the Bosnian Muslim army was at present 
far better equipped and armed and the Bosnian commander in chief 
was convinced that the Bosnian Muslims can win the war. The 
representative of the Bosnian president Izetbegovic also spoke 
to this effect. 
  When questioned whether statements from Brussels or Geneva 
about the latest of the innumerable cease-fires meant bad news 
for the warring parties on the ground, Briquemont answered that 
"the army generals do not always follow the politicians' orders" 
and, after the Christmas cease-fire agreed in Brussels, the 
commander in chief of the Muslim army assumed that the Muslims 
should continue the struggle. Briquemont called last week's 
"offensive" by Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo "a sort of 
provocation." 
  The general explained the growing self-confidence of the 
Muslim troops by better arms and organization, the replacement 
of several commanders and "the embargo, which is difficult to 
monitor." The general said he could not indicate the origin of 
the improved arms, but on the ground he had observed that the 
Muslims were indeed better armed at present and therefore, 
rightly or not, refused a cease-fire. 
  Briquemont called the intention of the Bosnian Serbs to cut 
off the road from Sarajevo to the industrial town of Tuzla part 
of this "strategy of tension." "All parties attack where they 
are strongest and the Serbs are clearly worried about the 
possible reopening of Tuzla airport, where they are consequently 
increasing the pressure. On the other hand in besieged Sarajevo, 
the Serbs are for example not thinking of attacking the town 
because they do not have the infantry to do so, while Muslim 
troops are attacking Vitez to cut the centers of resistance 
there in two," the general said, illustrating the strategy. 
  As for his criticisms about working resources, more 
specifically troops, the general repeated that it was impossible 
to apply UN resolution 836 on the protection of safe areas on 
the ground. "So many UN resolutions do not help," he said. 
"Thousands of soldiers are lacking." Briquemont referred to 
Gorazde (where only a few UN observers remain), Zepa and 
Srebenica (one company) and Tuzla, where one battalion 
("insufficient") is operational.

  [Text] The European Union is following with concern 
developments in the situation in the Congo, particularly in the 
increasing frequency of confrontations in the capital and the 
weakening of the process established by the Libreville Agreement 
of 4 August 1993. 
  The European Union would remind the Congolese parties 
concerned that it was asked to participate in implementation of 
the agreement, inter alia by making magistrates available to the 
Congo for the arbitration board. The board's careful and 
independent work cannot be called into question and the European 
Union would find it impossible to understand any contesting of 
its decisions. 
  The European Union urges all Congolese political forces to 
respect the provisions of the Libreville Agreement and seek a 
political solution to the crisis through dialogue.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "First Meeting of Joint Committee </F>
Deemed Success;" as released by Brussels TEXTLINE database] 
  [Text] "An exemplary meeting that holds promise for the 
future," were the words used by Nikolaus van der Pas, Chairman 
(on behalf of the European Union) of the Joint Committee of the 
European Economic Area (EEA), during the first half of 1994, to 
sum up the first meeting on Tuesday [11 January] of this body 
responsible for ensuring the administrative management of the 
EEA which came into force on 1 January 1994. This meeting 
essentially focused on the procedures for ensuring application 
of the treaty, in particular from the standpoint of the 
timetable for settling difficulties related to the "interim 
package" -- which Mr. Van der Pas said should enter into force 
"very quickly" --and pending matters (including plant health 
measures and transport, along with certain technical matters). 
Both parties also agreed to "integrate" the legislation adopted 
by the Community in coming weeks. The Community representatives 
at this meeting also informed the European Free Trade 
Association [EFTA] countries of the EC's interpretation of the 
EC "acquis" concerning the alcohol monopolies in the 
Scandinavian countries. This point of view was spelled out to 
two applicant countries, recalled Mr. Van der Pas, adding that, 
from Brussels' point of view, this interpretation was applicable 
within the EEA from 1 January. According to the Commission, 
responsibility for ensuring compliance with this approach is 
incumbent upon EEA monitoring authorities (the EC reserving the 
right to "sound the alarm"). It will be recalled that Norway 
has issued comments on its interpretation of the Community 
acquis in this area which, according to Finland's Ambassador 
Antti Stali, who chairs the EFTA party, point out that its 
amended legislation on the monopoly respects the agreement on 
the EEA.

central bank, as vice-president and adopted various provisions 
related to the EMI organizational framework and functioning. In 
contrast, no decision was taken on the building that will house 
the Institute (and later the European Central Bank) on a 
permanent basis. At the conclusion of the meeting, Mr. 
Lamfalussy reviewed a number of aspects concerning the work of 
the EMI and European Monetary Union [EMU] in general, as follows: 
  - election of Mr. Doyle. Mr. Lamfalussy said he was happy to 
announce this appointment because Mr. Doyle is a "heavyweight" 
who enjoys a far-reaching reputation among professionals. The 
EMI president underscored Ireland's remarkable macro-economic 
results in recent years, "due in large measure to monetary 
management of the country," before going on to stress the 
"absolutely substantial" role played by Mr. Doyle in this 
context. As Ireland remains a relatively poor country, it also 
is particularly sensitive in various areas; 
  - EMI offices. The two buildings mentioned most often 
(namely, Posseidon-Haus and Messeturm) "are not the only ones" 
in the running. "I am still receiving and reviewing other 
proposals and I do not think a final decision can be taken 
before the next Council meeting." Mr. Lamfalussy will try to 
submit a proposal at this next meeting. This delay is related 
to the EMI's very specific needs as it is a "foreign 
institution" with extremely frequent meetings. The final choice 
will also have to take account of concerns to limit the costs of 
the operation as much as possible. This first meeting was held 
in Frankfurt for purely symbolic reasons, "to show the entire 
world that we respect the choice of Frankfurt," said Mr. 
Lamfalussy. He then said this location close to the Bundesbank 
would in no way change the Institute's relations with German 
monetary authorities. "I will not accept a greater Bundesbank 
influence on our work due to the fact that I will be in 
Frankfurt than I would if I were on a mountaintop elsewhere," he 
commented; 
  - transitional period. A period of "probably six months" was 
agreed, during which the work of the Committee of Governors of 
central banks will continue as in the past (this committee 
ceased to exist with the start of the second stage of EMU) 
pending the recruitment of appropriate personnel. Recruitment 
is expected to be concluded next summer and should coincide with 
the EMI's move into its definitive location in Frankfurt. Until 
then, the main staff members the EMI inherited from the former 
Committee of Governors will continue working under Mr. 
Lamfalussy's command in Basel, where meetings of the EMI Council 
will also take place during the transitional period. 
"Obviously, once the decision on the building has been taken, 
we will transfer more staff members to Frankfurt with a view to 
preparing the Institute's move," he added; 
  - decisions of an organizational nature. These concern 
fixing the pay of six EMI "key officials" (who will have a grade 
equivalent to director at the European Commission), making it 
possible to hire the appropriate individuals for these key 
posts. These include the director general (a post for which Mr. 
Lamfalussy intends to propose a candidate at the next Council 
meeting), and five heads of departments for the following 
sectors: economic and statistics unit, secretariat general, 
administrative service, information systems and financial unit 
(essentially responsible for managing the monetary reserves of 
the national banks wishing to deposit them with the EMI). At 
the end of 1994, the EMI is expected to have around 140 
employees, a number that could rise to 250 once it is fully 
operational. Answering questions, Mr. Lamfalussy added the 
following information: 
  - the single currency from 1997 "seems an unrealistic 
perspective for the moment" (he declined to make any projections 
about achieving this objective in 1999). Meanwhile, the EMI 
president can nevertheless imagine other sorts of arrangements 
between member states, such as those concluded in August 1993 
between Germany and the Netherlands to maintain a stable link 
between the Deutsche mark and the guilder; 
  - asked about Mr. Delors' recent statement that the first 
stage of EMU was a failure and that study should begin on how to 
boost the second stage, possibly by giving the EMI greater 
responsibilities, Mr. Lamfalussy voiced some reluctance 
regarding an expansion of the EMI's powers even before he has 
begun to work on the basis of existing prerogatives. Moreover, 
he added, unquestionable progress (though still "too slow") has 
been made in the last five years in several areas aiming at 
improving convergence between the member states (to curb 
inflation, in particular) and several currencies have moved 
closer in recent months to the initial fluctuation bands of the 
EMS, which proves that an attitude of "common interest" is 
developing and is promising for the future; 
  - despite the difficulties currently facing the EMS, the 
single currency objective will one day become a reality because 
"with the extremely high degree of economic integration in 
Europe, I cannot imagine that it could eventually function 
correctly without a single currency." For now, it is still 
premature to say what states will take this step, when and under 
what circumstances, "but I am absolutely convinced that the 
process will lead to this specific objective;" 
  - outside of France, which during the negotiation of 
Maastricht raised the possibility of depositing currency 
reserves with the EMI (as provided in the protocol of the EMI 
statutes, annexed to the Treaty of Maastricht), up to now no 
central bank has requested the Institute to manage its monetary 
reserves, said Mr. Lamfalussy. This is due to "practical 
reasons," in his view, because it is a highly specialized task 
that must be carried out with great caution and which 
necessitates a "major technological investment." The EMI will 
be prepared to set in place such capacity "as soon as we have 
the impression there is a real demand along these lines".

<F P=106> [EC Document No. IP/94/14: "Regional Policies: ECU14.2 </F>
Million for Military Conversion Programs -- Konver Programs -- 
in Germany"] 
  [Text] On a proposal from the commissioner responsible for 
regional policies, Mr. Bruce Millan, the Commission has approved 
Konver programs for nine German laender financed under the 
European Regional Development Fund [ERDF]. The programs will 
promote measures to convert regions and businesses affected by 
the rundown in defense-related activities in Baden-Wuerttemberg, 
Berlin, Brandenburg, Hesse, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland, 
Schleswig- Holstein, Saxony and Thuringia. The ERDF is to 
contribute ECU14.2 million and total costs, including German 
part-financing, amount to ECU46.8 million. 
  The programs cover the following priorities: 
  - Consulting services and assistance in the conversion of 
defense production to civil production, in particular for small 
and medium-sized businesses; 
  - innovation promotion and technology transfer measures -- 
planning and development concepts; 
  - restoration of land previously used for military purposes. 
  The projects include: environmental redevelopment and change 
of the designated use of the Altes Lager in Jueterbog so that a 
polytechnic college can be built (Brandenburg), waste disposal 
measures on an area previously used by Western units of the CIS 
armed forces on the Ravensbrueck concentration camp memorial 
site (Brandenburg), the construction of a software center in 
Marburg (Hesse) and the construction of an industry and service 
sector park on the site of the former Holtzendorff barracks in 
Kaiserslautern (Rhineland-Palatinate). Commenting on the 
decision, Mr. Millan said the German Konver programs meant that 
the initiative had now reached the practical implementation 
stage in all member states, and that as a result of the good 
cooperation between the Commission and the national authorities 
concerned it had been possible to adopt the decisions in an 
extremely short time.

<F P=106> [Steve Crawshaw report: "Euro-Army Set To Advance From </F>
Words to Deeds"] 
  [Text] Muellheim -- If you see a German soldier in the 
little town of Muellheim, in south-western Germany, you may--if 
you are an expert spotter of national military uniforms--notice 
that something is not quite right. If you see a French soldier 
in Muellheim, likewise. Both soldiers will be incorrectly 
dressed, according to national norms. And yet, the sartorial 
oddities indirectly represent what enthusiasts believe could 
become an important pillar of a future European defence policy. 
  Muellheim, in what is known as 
Dreilaendereck--Three-Countries-Corner, where France, Germany 
and Switzerland meet--contained a French garrison, as part of 
the Allied troop presence, until German unity in 1990. Now the 
barracks provide a home for the Franco-German brigade, where the 
two nations work together, on a daily basis, under alternating 
French and German command. The Franco-German brigade, in turn, 
is part of the newly-inaugurated Eurocorps, whose commanders 
hope that it could be the shape of things to come. 
  Blending the visual differences between the two armies has 
been just one of the tasks facing brigade commanders. It was 
agreed, for example, that Germans in Eurocorps should wear the 
dark-blue French beret; but the French, in the spirit of 
Euro-compromise, were told to wear their berets on the left 
(Germanstyle) instead of on the right. (There is no single 
Eurocorps uniform, "for the moment"). More seriously, there is 
the question of how to standardise equipment. 
  Language is a challenge, too: the 4,500 members of the 
Franco-German brigade are all supposed to speak each other's 
languages. Thus, in theory, a French soldier addresses his 
German colleagues in German, while the Germans reply in French. 
This counsel of perfection soon breaks down. Thus, at the 
guard-post in Muellheim, a German conscript admits that he 
always speaks German with his French colleagues, since his 
French is too poor. At Eurocorps headquarters in Strasbourg, 
across the border from Muellheim, a German soldier greets the 
visitor's excusez moi request for directions with a sheepish "I 
am sorry, do you speak German?" 
  Already, Eurocorps is growing beyond its Franco-German 
embryo. Belgium has signed up--though it caused some 
consternation when the country's Defence Minister announced that 
Flemish should be an official Eurocorps language (under a 
complicated compromise, documents above a certain level will 
probably be translated into Flemish, but Flemish will be ignored 
in daily use). In Strasbourg, Belgians, French and Germans now 
work side by side, under a single command. 
  Now the Spanish are ready to join: two liaison officers are 
in the Eurocorps headquarters, and Spain's formal participation 
is expected this year. Already, there are five flags on 
Eurocorps desks: the four participating countries, plus the 
gold-star Euro-flag. There have been expressions of interest 
from further afield, too. Poland, which had the door shut in 
its face by NATO this week, has asked if it might be allowed to 
join the Eurocorps family (answer: don't call us, we'll call 
you). 
  Gradually, the Eurocorps is moving from rhetoric to reality. 
As of this month, Eurocorps commanders say that it is ready to 
take on humanitarian missions. From July, it will officially be 
ready for military missions. By 1995, it is due to have 40,000 
men at its disposal. 
  Not all, however, are impressed. Britain regards Eurocorps 
as mere Franco-German hot air, and has been keen, instead, to 
sell the idea of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), under 
British command and within existing NATO structures. One 
difference between the two bodies is that the US plays an 
important role in ARRC, but not in Eurocorps. The Eurocorps 
commander, General Helmut Willmann, argues: "I am convinced 
that ARRC has an important role within NATO--but the Eurocorps 
is also necessary. The Eurocorps can react when the Americans 
don't want to be involved. That's the most important thing." 
He insists: "Eurocorps doesn't weaken NATO--it strengthens 
NATO." 
  Crucially, Eurocorps--dreamed up by Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
and President Francois Mitterrand in 1991--has what General 
Willmann calls "a political dimension, which goes beyond the 
framework of NATO". It is answerable to the West European 
Union--which is, in turn, the would-be defence arm of the 
European Union. Colonel Daniel Bruss, of the Franco-German 
brigade, argues that Britain, by being so unenthusiastic, is out 
of step with developments: "Britain doesn't want to take part 
in Eurocorps. But Britain is part of Europe, too." 
  There are still arguments over how the corps might be used, 
let alone how big it might eventually become. Some suggest that 
a co-ordinated European mission might have been appropriate in 
Somalia, if Eurocorps had been working last year. Bosnia, too, 
is the kind of conflict where, in theory, Eurocorps could play a 
role. Here, however, an old problem involving Germany arises, 
hampering much military planning. The Bonn government has, 
because of Germany's own history, ruled out the use of German 
troops in former Yugoslavia. Indeed, German politicians are 
still arguing over whether German soldiers should be allowed to 
take part even in humanitarian actions abroad--let alone whether 
they should be allowed to shoot. In the understated words of 
one German officer in Muellheim: "The French have less hang-ups 
about the armed forces than we Germans do." 
  The British argue, not very sotto voce, that the Eurocorps 
uses up much money that would be better spent elsewhere in NATO. 
Defenders of Eurocorps insist, however, that its time will yet 
come. General Willmann says: "We're creating an instrument of 
joint European security and defence policy... I'm absolutely 
confident that we will achieve our goal."

Committee stressed that these countries:

<F P=106> [Report by Owen Bowcott and David Sharrock in Belfast: </F>
"Peace Statement Not Enough, Says Adams"] 
  [Text] The president of Sinn Fein, Gerry Adams, yesterday 
gave the strongest indication to date that the Downing Street 
declaration was not enough for the IRA to give up violence and 
allow his organisation to enter the mainstream political process. 
  In statements that amount to a rejection of the joint 
British 
and Irish declaration as it stands, Mr Adams made clear that 
without clarification there could be no end to the IRA campaign. 
  "Up to now I do not have any political package with which to 
approach the IRA," he said. "It is clearly the responsibility 
of the two governments to produce such a package. 
  "They cannot, however, argue that they have a basis for 
peace 
unless they can produce and explain what it is. I will not 
mislead the IRA neither will I mislead others about the IRA. 
  "The London government demands an IRA surrender as a 
precondition to dialogue with Sinn Fein. Yet for over three 
years the government was involved in contact and dialogue 
without such preconditions." 
  But his demand, repeated yesterday, for immediate and 
unconditional dialogue with the British and Irish governments on 
the declaration was rebuffed by the Prime Minister. 
  John Major told the Commons: "The joint declaration is not 
in any way an invitation for renegotiation. The only acceptable 
response from Mr Adams is for him to call for an end to IRA 
violence. The only question that needs to be asked is of Mr 
Adams: will he stop the violence and enter the democratic 
process or not?" 
  Reports in Dublin yesterday that Irish government officials 
are to meet senior Sinn Fein members were dismissed by the 
foreign affairs minister, Dick Spring. "There has been no 
change in government policy in relation to negotiations or 
direct contact with organization which are engaged in or support 
violence," he said. 
  In a lengthy statement, Mr Adams set out for the first time 
the differences between the Downing Street document and the 
Hume/Adams agreement--the result of months of talks between 
himself and John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and 
Labour Party, which preceded the London-Dublin talks that 
resulted in the declaration. 
  His claims will be a direct challenge to Mr Hume, who has 
backed both agreements and implied that the gap between them is 
marginal. 
  Mr Adams said that his and Mr Hume's proposals, agreed in 
September, were known to both governments. They contained a 
basic set of principles: 
  1. The Irish people as a whole have the right to 
selfdetermination. 
  2. An internal settlement is not a solution. 
  3. Unionists cannot have a veto over British policy. 
  4. The consent and allegiance of Unionists is crucial to any 
agreement. 
  5. The British government must join the persuaders (to such 
an end).

<F P=106> [David Owen report: "Those Other Ulster Talks Are on Again"] </F>
  [Text] With the UK-Irish peace initiative stalled, the 
delicate talks process aimed at securing an internal political 
settlement in Northern Ireland is poised to re-emerge from the 
shadows to which it has been consigned since November. 
  The talks, co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern 
Ireland minister, and involving Ulster's four main 
constitutional parties, have inevitably fallen out of the 
spotlight while it seemed the Downing Street declaration might 
persuade the IRA to renounce violence. 
  But now that the government has concluded that the odds are 
against an early end to the 25-year republican campaign -- 
clearing the way for Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to 
enter the political process -- this order of priorities is about 
to change. 
  This was signalled last week when Mr Ancram began a new 
round 
of bilateral meetings, seeing a delegation from the largest 
party in the province, the Ulster Unionists. 
  Yesterday he saw senior Alliance party members. Next week he 
is due to meet the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and 
Labour party [SDLP]. 
  The message to republican leaders is clear. Their hesitancy 
over the joint declaration will not be allowed to delay efforts 
to piece together a political settlement. After yesterday's 
meeting Dr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, added 
his voice to those calling for the government not to wait for 
Sinn Fein. 
  Those familiar with the talks say the focus of the 
minister's 
efforts is to pin down an agenda that would permit participants 
to move on from the current time-consuming bilateral format -- 
disparaged by some as "blind-date politics" to round-table 
discussions. 
  It will not be easy. Ministers have said in the past that a 
resumption of round-table talks would be counter-productive 
until agreement is achievable. An earlier round-table talks 
process broke up without success in 1992. 
  The hardline Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not 
return to the talks process, bilateral or otherwise, until the 
meetings between Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry 
Adams, the Sinn Fein president, end. 
  Sinn Fein, as might be expected, is scathing about the 
exercise's prospects of success. Mr Tom Hartley, the party's 
national chairman, says: "I don't think the dynamic for change 
can be found any more in those sorts of talks." 
  Mr Ancram is thought to have identified a certain amount of 
common ground on structures for devolved government in the 
province, including an 85-member Ulster assembly. But less 
headway has been made on "strand two" of the talks -- how to 
handle relations between the province and the Irish Republic. 
  Ulster Unionists are keen for efforts to be focused on 
setting this assembly up. But the SDLP is unlikely to consent 
to this without agreement on north/south relations, and on 
strand three -- relations between the two governments. 
  Mr Hume is said to have received assurances last week that 
the talks process would continue to embrace all three sets of 
relationships. But London is still waiting for a paper setting 
out Dublin's ideas on strands two and three which it requested 
last September.

<F P=106> [Article by Jonathan Steele: "Why Russia Is Resisting NATO"] </F>
  [Text] In the snowy darkness of the street outside his 
Moscow office, Andrey Kozyrev, Russia's Foreign Minister, was 
accosted by Russian television news this week and asked about 
American policy on the eve of President Clinton's trip to 
Moscow. "Too much NATO-centrism," he replied. 
  Coming from the man most closely identified with the 
prowestern thrust of the first two years of Russia's post-Soviet 
foreign policy, the remark was revealing. If Russia's most 
ardent "westernisers" are becoming more critical of the West, it 
is a significant shift. It may be tempting to see the new 
Moscow line as a reaction to the upsurge of Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, the far-right leader. But it has been evolving 
over a period of months, as Russia's military and political 
decisionmakers begin to recover from the shock of the Soviet 
Union's collapse and work out a new conception of their 
country's place in the world. If it is a reaction to anything, 
it is to what is seen as the West's disappointing attitude to 
Russia. 
  Gorbachev's perestroika was founded on the notion that if 
Russia changed its behaviour in eastern Europe and towards the 
West, the rest of the continent would adjust its negative image 
of Russia. As the successors to Gorbachev, the leaders of the 
new post-Soviet Russia went further. They hoped they would be 
welcomed into the western club with open arms, while also being 
recognised as a country with legitimate interests. 
  It did not happen. Even before Zhirinovskiy, Russia's 
efforts to withdraw from the Baltics in an orderly fashion were 
attacked in the West as foot-dragging, or even as a 
barely-disguised effort to hold on to imperial positions. Its 
exclusively diplomatic moves to defend the civil rights and 
linguistic interests of Russian settlers in the Baltics were 
criticised as interference. Its military moves in Tajikistan, 
even though they had the support of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States, were depicted as interventionism. 
  A strange dichotomy emerged in the West. Almost anything 
President Yeltsin did at home was applauded blindly. Almost 
anything he did outside Russia in areas of previous Soviet 
influence was condemned as the stirrings of imperialism. 
  It is not surprising that eastern Europeans should harbour 
ill-will towards Russia. They suffered under Stalinist 
occupation for more than 40 years. Polish suspicions go back 
for two centuries before that. Partly genuinely, but with a 
good deal of calculation, they have seized on the Zhirinovskiy 
card to try to drum their way into NATO. 
  Clinton has done well to resist their pressure, sensing that 
to move NATO's frontier eastward will incite Russian anxieties. 
As Kozyrev put it as long ago as last March: "We don't 
understand the discussions to the effect that NATO must give 
security guarantees to the countries of central Europe and in 
the long term accept them as members. How are these countries 
threatened and by whom?" 
  But Clinton is only partly guided by good reasons. As 
Kozyrev's "NATO-centric" comment implied, the West is still 
mesmerised by NATO's alleged achievements. The tag-line "the 
most successful alliance in history" does not survive close 
scrutiny, nor does its subtheme that nuclear deterrence was the 
key ingredient. 
  The West's monopoly of nuclear weapons, which Truman proudly 
announced to Stalin at Potsdam in 1945, did not stop the Soviet 
take-over of central Europe or roll back its annexation of the 
Baltic states. The formation of NATO four years later did 
nothing to prevent new assertions of Russian-inspired control in 
East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. 
  If Moscow did not move further westwards, it was not because 
of NATO but because the Kremlin by 1949 had no interest in 
further European conquest. By then the possessor of its own 
nuclear weapons, it was like all other nuclear powers since 
Nagasaki "self-deterred." 
  The very awesomeness of their destructive force has always 
restrained responsible leaders, as Eisenhower admitted in his 
memoirs over Korea and Nixon did over Vietnam. Brezhnev and 
Andropov were the same. 
  What makes Zhirinovskiy terrifying is that he breaks the 
mould for the first time. He sounds irresponsible enough to 
press the button. By the same token, however, traditional 
defences do not work. No amount of security guarantees by NATO 
can defend Poland, Hungary, or Lithuania from such a man. 
  The only defence is to prevent him coming to power. He must 
be deprived of any chance of turning his fragile 23 per cent 
vote into a majority. Not moving NATO's borders just west of 
St. Petersburg is one way to do that. Russians also have their 
paranoia, and the notion of the world's most powerful military 
machine, with the modernised bases and airfields which would 
inevitably go with it, planting itself in Poland and Slovakia, 
let alone inside the former Soviet Union, is not wanted by 
anyone in Russia. 
  The subtext of Kozyrev's crack at "NATO-centrism" is that 
western countries, as well as the states of central and eastern 
Europe, must abandon the "block [as published] mentality." For 
a few months after he came to power, Yeltsin toyed with joining 
NATO. It was partly meant as a dramatic sign that this was a 
new and democratic Russia. But it was also a device for 
expanding NATO so enormously that it ceased to be NATO. 
  More recently, Russia has gone back to an old Gorbachev 
idea, the notion of merging NATO with the Conference on Security 
and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). As Kozyrev put it in his 
brief TV interview this week: "Maybe Russia will join NATO. 
Maybe there will be another scenario. NATO will change into 
some kind of all-European system." Vyacheslav Kostikov, 
Yeltsin's spokesman, has made the same point. "The Russian 
President is concerned by the tendency to expand the block [as 
published] system. Encouraging it would contradict the declared 
intentions of building relations on principles of trust, 
partnership and equilibrium," he said. 
  The speed with which the Zhirinovskiy factor has been used 
in 
the West, and not just in central and eastern Europe, to whip up 
old nightmares about the Russian bear has upset many people in 
Moscow. Eastern Europe's emotions are understandable, though 
their recourse to old-fashioned remedies will not help. What 
matters more to Russians is what the major western leaders feel. 
  This is the umpteenth U.S.-Russian summit since the cold war 
wound down, but it is the first time that Moscow's 
decision-makers have not seen their American visitor as a man 
who could help them. In a funny way, the new attitude restores 
some of the status Russia lost when it ceased to be a 
superpower. The Russian elite will be happy if they can give 
this new and apparently more receptive American president 
something themselves. If Clinton leaves here having learnt 
something about Russian complexities and with the conviction 
that NATO should not expand geographically but re-think its 
entire rationale, Russians will treat his visit as a success.

<F P=106> [Article by Jonathan Eyal, director of studies at the Royal </F>
United Services Institute, London: "This Affair Will End in 
Tears"] 
  [Text] NATO, argued Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, 
this week, is not ready to expand into Eastern Europe, for to do 
so would entail excluding Russia and moving the dividing line of 
the continent to the river Vistula. And the Vistula, as Mr Hurd 
reminded his audience, is both a Polish and a Russian river. 
This argument shows how outdated is the Foreign Secretary's 
knowledge of East European geography: the last time the Vistula 
crossed Russian territory was before the First World War. 
  Yet there is a sense in which Mr Hurd is correct. The Soviet 
empire may have followed its Russian predecessor into oblivion, 
but it lives on in the minds of most Western leaders. And, as 
Bill Clinton starts his summit in Moscow, the West's policy 
towards Russia remains nonsense, wrapped in hope, inside a great 
deal of pious talk. 
  This policy may not yet amount to outright appeasement of 
Russia: after all, appeasement in the Thirties was applied to 
existing dictators, while Western governments today are 
sustaining Boris Yeltsin precisely in order to prevent a 
dictator assuming power in the Kremlin. Nevertheless, in 
pursuing its love affair with the Russian president at all 
costs, the West has put in place all the elements for future 
appeasement. As in the Thirties, military preparedness is being 
reduced as the security risks are mounting. As then, a series of 
self-serving justifications shroud unpleasant realities. 
  "A constitutional democracy governs Russia," Mr Clinton 
declared on arriving in Brussels this week. Far from it: the 
West's hope today is that a strong constitution, hastily drafted 
by a cabal of Kremlin advisers and forced down the throats of 
ordinary Russians, will enable Mr Yeltsin to ignore the results 
of the parliamentary elections. This is a curious understanding 
of what democracy is all about, even if there is a good case for 
saying that, given the country's history, nothing better could 
have been expected. The aim at the moment, Western politicians 
argue, is to isolate Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the nationalist 
rabble-rouser, and this entails more, not less, support for Mr 
Yeltsin. 
  In an effort to deflect accusations that he is obsessed with 
supporting Yeltsin alone, Mr Clinton is meeting most of Russia's 
other political leaders in Moscow, including the Communists and 
the Agrarian party, their closest allies. Yet Mr Zhirinovskiy, 
leader of the biggest opposition party in the Russian 
parliament, is not on Mr Clinton's guest list. There is 
something strange about a "constitutional democracy" in which 
one of the biggest players is considered ineligible for dialogue 
with the West. 
  The West dismisses Mr Zhirinovskiy as an accident rather 
than 
a product of Russia's democracy. In the cliches so dear to the 
present U.S. administration, he is merely a "wake-up" call to 
Russia's democrats. Far from it: the feeling of national 
humiliation on which Mr Zhirinovskiy feeds is unlikely to 
disappear soon, almost regardless of what the West does. This 
is largely because the Soviet empire was not defeated in battle; 
it simply disintegrated, in circumstances that remain 
inexplicable to most ordinary Russians. To isolate Mr 
Zhirinovskiy, Mr Yeltsin must redefine Russian nationalism, 
while steering clear of its most chauvinist manifestations. 
This was never going to be easy, but Mr Yeltsin shows no 
inclination even to understand the problem, and the West has no 
interest in helping either. 
  Every Western government knows that Russia has been involved 
in fomenting many of the conflicts in former Soviet republics. 
Instead of confronting the problem, though, the West has 
pretended that nothing has happened. With a particularly bad 
sense of timing, Mr Hurd and Andrey Kozyrev, his Russian 
counterpart, published a joint article in British and Russian 
newspapers, ostensibly seeking to place Russian "peace-keeping" 
operations in the former empire within strict legal limits. 
Stripped of its niceties, the article carried two important 
messages: that there is a need for Russian intervention in 
neighbouring republics, and that the West is in no mood to do 
anything about it. The former empire has effectively been 
surrendered to Moscow without a whimper. 
  The West deludes itself if it believes that this will help 
Russian democracy. Allowing Russia to recreate its empire will 
doom any chance of economic reform. The recently concluded 
merger between the Russian and Belarus economies, for instance, 
makes a mockery of attempts to control inflation: at a stroke, 
the Russian budget deficit will increase by an amount similar to 
that of the immediate aid the Kremlin is negotiating with the 
International Monetary Fund. 
  Accepting Moscow's right to "defend" ethnic Russians 
everywhere is dangerous for all Europe. The Kremlin has never 
referred just to "ethnic Russians," but has always used the term 
"Russian speakers," a considerably larger category of people. 
More important, this "right" has wider implications. If Russia 
can defend its kinsmen everywhere, why should Hungary, for 
instance, be denied the right to defend Hungarians in Romania 
and Slovakia? Is Serbia's policy of uniting all Serbs under one 
state any different? 
  In practice, Mr Yeltsin is now competing with Mr 
Zhirinovskiy 
to see who is the better Russian nationalist, a competition from 
which the West has nothing to gain. But the very same Western 
governments that continue to claim that Mr Yeltsin is strong 
enough to push through economic reform, also assert that he is 
too weak to resist nationalist pressure at home. Logic, it 
seems, has drowned somewhere in the Vistula. 
  The contradictions go much deeper even than this. The West 
is keen to handle Russia as a equal partner, a surviving 
superpower. But the only claim Russia has to superpower status 
now is its military might -- precisely what the West wants to 
see reduced. And, far from treating Mr Yeltsin as a partner, 
the West has often subjected the Russian leader to petty 
pressures when its interests were perceived to be at stake. 
  While continuing to sell weapons all over the world, the 
West 
has forced Russia to slim down its arms exports, cancel a deal 
with India and accept a UN package of sanctions on Libya that 
was carefully designed to protect only Western economic 
interests. The result is a partnership that is perceived as 
servitude by the Russian military and large sections of the 
population. 
  In postponing NATO's eastward expansion, the West argues 
that 
it is accommodating Russia's historic fear of encirclement. 
This is nonsense on a grand scale. Apart from a sliver of land 
on the Baltic, Russia does not have borders with any East 
European state. Accepting Mr Yeltsin's protests assumes that the 
Russian president can speak for Ukraine and Belarus as well. It 
is also a disservice to Russia's future security needs. If the 
East Europeans are rebuffed in their efforts to join NATO, they 
will most probably seek to form local security alliances by 
drawing in Ukraine as well. 
  Such an inherently unstable situation is bound to implicate 
both Germany and Russia. Indeed, in a recent interview with a 
German newspaper, Mr Kozyrev hinted heavily that Moscow was 
considering precisely such a tie with Bonn with a view to 
handling Eastern Europe's future problems. Germany has not yet 
been tempted by such an offer, but if NATO cannot expand, the 
pressures on Bonn will grow. Dreams about a Russian-German axis 
are Europe's way to perdition. 
  The West tends to assume that if Russia turns nasty, it will 
be able to reverse policies forthwith and include Eastern Europe 
in its security structures. But if the argument against the 
expansion of NATO is its potential to annoy Russia, this surely 
will be more compelling if Moscow becomes more assertive. And, 
given that the West has ignored all the current threats from 
Moscow -- the refusal to withdraw from other republics, the 
unilateral cancellation of proposed military cuts and the 
admonitions to Eastern Europe -- at what point does it decide 
that Russia has turned "nasty" enough to warrant a response? 
  A policy based on the belief that nothing should be done to 
rattle Russia can lead only to appeasement: in political terms, 
the time to confront an aggressive Russia will come only when 
more of the independent countries fall into Moscow's sphere of 
influence. But it is the awareness of this that fuels 
instability in Eastern Europe. Instead of offering the media 
more photo-opportunities in Moscow, Bill Clinton would be well 
advised to take Douglas Hurd and other Western ministers on a 
cruise down the Vistula.

  [Excerpts] Bonn (DPA) -- A German supply aircraft was hit 
by a projectile today, the second such incident since the start 
of the UN airlift to Sarajevo. The German Defense Ministry 
confirmed that a projectile hit the wing of a Luftwaffe Transall 
as it was approaching to land in the Bosnian capital. The 
aircraft then immediately regained altitude and returned to 
Falconara in Italy. The crew were unhurt. 
  A ministry spokesman said the incident occurred at 1145. The 
Transall, with which the Luftwaffe is supporting UN aid flights 
between Falconara and Sarajevo, was been hit in the starboard 
wing near the engine. The five-man crew immediately turned 
around and landed safely back in Falconara shortly after 1300. 
[passage omitted] 
  The spokesman added that the UN airdrop has not been 
officially suspended. There will be no German aid flights for 
the next two days, however. A decision will be made on further 
German participation as soon as a replacement aircraft arrive in 
Falconara. 
  A German Transall first came under fire about a year ago, 
when a projectile tore off parts of a propeller and penetrated 
the fuselage. The aircraft's chief loader sustained serious 
shrapnel injuries.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Russian troops will complete their 
withdrawal from eastern Germany as agreed by the end of August, 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (FDP) and Colonel General Matvey 
Burlakov, commander in chief of the Western Group of Russian 
Forces in Germany, stressed in Bonn today. At the 11th session 
of the mixed German-Russian commission, Kinkel emphasized the 
organizational skills of the Russian Western Group of Forces and 
that the remaining 31,436 men would return home by August. A 
spokesman also said the problems described by Burlakov relating 
to the regional allocation and completion of the soldiers' 
accommodation in Russia, which is being financed by the German 
government, would in no way delay the withdrawal schedule.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Rhetorical Strikes"] </F>
  [Text] NATO's threats against the Bosnian Serbs have long 
failed to convince. Thus they have also failed, dismally, to 
deter. The leaders of NATO's states, in a communique issued in 
Brussels yesterday, reaffirmed their "readiness to carry out air 
strikes if necessary." Virtually identical to the one issued 
last August, it is hardly the mother of all threats. Its 
timorous scale and unimaginative contours mark once more the 
shabbiness of NATO's policy on Bosnia. 
  The problems of that ravaged state are many. Four command 
immediate attention: the Serb siege around Sarajevo, mounted 
from the hills that strangle it in their embrace; blockading in 
Srebrenica, a so-called safe haven, of Canadian United Nations 
troops; the closure of Tuzla airport to relief flights; and the 
continued, brazen breach of the "no-fly zone" by Serbs and 
Croats. Empty, unfocused threats are unlikely to force changes 
in Serb and Croat policy. They will only nourish the cosy sense 
of violent accomplishment that now prevails, especially in the 
Serb camp. 
  Any action taken now, however effective and committed, will 
be several thousand lives too late. That, however, should not 
excuse further pusillanimity. NATO must identify specific 
objectives, lay down crisp ultimatums, and deal firmly with 
failures to meet them. The Serbs must be given a week to 
"unlock" Tuzla airport. Humanitarian aid to thousands depends on 
access to its runways. A similar deadline should be imposed for 
the release of the Canadian contingent, to be relieved by its 
designated Dutch successors. Failure to meet these demands 
should earn the Serbs punitive air strikes. As for breaches of 
airspace in the "no-fly zone," the response must be swift. 
  Most pressing of all is the siege of Sarajevo, and the need 
to act there is the greatest. But the problems of that city did 
not begin yesterday, and NATO has squandered the many chances it 
had to intervene. Air strikes, while serving as effective 
responses to specific, and localised, examples of aggression, 
are not the answer. In fact, the mightiest minds now despair of 
ever finding a solution. 
  This frustration was evident in President Clinton's language 
on the matter at the NATO summit. "If you lack the 
determination to deliver what you have promised," he said "do 
not make promises." In the context, with all its expectations 
of diplomatic cuddling and kissing, this was a stinging rebuke 
to Europe's leaders. It is criticism that they richly deserve. 
Their threats to use force have degenerated to the level of 
pure rhetoric, of empty sabre-rattling, devoid of deterrent 
effect and credibility. The Serbs know this, as they pound 
Sarajevo daily, and mercilessly. The Croats know this, too. 
And, most damningly, the Bosnian government has long since lost 
hope. This explains, in part, its determination to gamble 
everything on renewed military offensives against the 
increasingly vulnerable Croats. It is tired of promises and 
expressions of solidarity. 
  Mr Clinton spoke his mind and he must be congratulated for 
that. If it means an end to vacuous rhetoric, then some good, 
and some truth, might be said to have emerged from the NATO 
summit.

<F P=106> [Article by Simon Jenkins: "Where Next for NATO?"] </F>
  [Text] Lift your eyes for a moment from "back to basics" 
at home. Consider "back to basics" abroad. "You are risking a 
third world war," said the Russian demagogue Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy of this week's NATO summit. Are we? If so, we 
should be told. The seeds of appeasement are sown in every 
vague communique. 
  President Clinton's exasperated speech in Brussels on Monday 
[10 January] was understandable. Stripped of diplomacy it said: 
you Europeans twitter on about collective security, yet you do 
nothing about Bosnia. You want us to give you guarantees of 
intervention when things go wrong, but you do nothing to keep 
them right. You are all over the shop. You want us to push the 
NATO border farther east. Then you want us to deter Russian 
neo-imperialism. Well too bad. We are more interested in Japan 
and China. We shall deal with Russia our way. You can comfort 
the small fry. 
  At this point, blood drains from Europe's cheeks. Douglas 
Hurd mutters that he might drop a little bomb on Bosnia to show 
his machismo. But beggars can't be choosers. The rock on which 
NATO rests is the old American willingness to fight anybody who 
threatens to tear Europe apart. The willingness was activated 
twice this century, against Germany. It was activated a third 
time when NATO was set up, to defend West Europe against Russia. 
It has now been requested by the former communist countries of 
East Europe against the same threat. As a Polish ambassador 
said on Monday, "We are lost in a grey zone. We have no allies, 
no guarantees." 
  Let us go back to an argument in Washington 45 years ago. 
It was between the drafters of the NATO treaty and the Senate 
foreign relations committee. It was blunt. Europe wanted the 
Americans to promise to go to war again if any NATO member was 
attacked. The American response was, "Er, um, perhaps, if..." 
Only Congress could declare war. Why not offer "measures" 
rather than "military action." The Europeans, led by the 
British ambassador, Sir Oliver Franks, said this was not good 
enough. A less than wholehearted commitment might satisfy the 
allies, but it would signal disastrous weakness to the Russians. 
NATO security should mean what it said, and say what it meant. 
  The outcome was the famous Franks-Acheson Article five of 
the 
NATO treaty. An attack on one member of NATO "shall be 
considered an armed attack against them all." In the event of 
such attack, each member will "forthwith" take action to resist 
it. This pledge was backed with American troops on the ground 
and with often hysterical American demonology of Russians. The 
American people had to accept the catastrophic implication of 
the pledge, even where there was no threat to American soil. At 
the formal signing of the NATO treaty, a marine band played "It 
ain't necessarily so." Yet who can doubt that article five did 
more than anything to keep the Cold War cool? 
  A year ago, the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrey Kozyrev, 
made what was treated as a satirical speech. He warned the West 
not to take Russian liberalism for granted. Just imagine, he 
said with a smile, if Boris Yeltsin were hamstrung by 
reactionaries in Parliament. Imagine a surge of Russian 
nationalism under a demagogue. Imagine a movement to push the 
Russian frontier back to that of the old Soviet Union and even 
beyond. Imagine a huge and disaffected Russian army summoned to 
support all Slavs against oppression. He said this in December 
1992. We laughed. 
  I wonder how history will see that speech, which has all but 
come true within 12 months. If I were a Lithuanian or a 
Ukrainian, a Pole or a Slovak, I would be more than jittery at 
the rise of Mr Zhirinovskiy and the ambivalence of the Russian 
generals. I would look urgently for a powerful ally. Hence the 
request to join NATO. 
  Some NATO members have sympathised. America has not. 
Washington's Realpolitik, led by the Deputy Secretary of State, 
Strobe Talbott, will do nothing that might undermine President 
Yeltsin. Any advance of the NATO guarantee near to, even up to, 
the Russian border would, we are told, strengthen opposition to 
Mr Yeltsin. More ominous, it would be dishonest. The American 
people would not accept their troops confronting a Russian 
Blitzkrieg through Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine or Moldova. They 
would not do so even if the tanks rolled on into Poland or 
Slovakia. Nothing has changed since 1956 or 1968. Americans 
might be upset, as they were over Afghanistan. But upset 
Americans do not stop tanks. 
  Military strategists are now realising that the 
unthinkability of nuclear weapons has made limited conventional 
war more plausible. Europeans are killing each other with 
bayonets and hand grenades. The deterrent is losing its bite. A 
battle to stop a Russian army advancing into the Baltics or 
Poland would at first be conventional and extremely messy. It 
would require huge numbers of soldiers with logistical support. 
It might ultimately require tactical nuclear deterrence. 
Without America, such conflict would be vulnerable to every 
20th-century horror: Russian victory, German expansion, the 
spread of Balkan atrocities, the rise of dictatorship, mass 
migration of refugees. 
  America is deaf to such alarmism. It is led by a neo- 
Orientalist president, a partly isolationist Congress and a 
pathological fear of military casualties overseas. Hence the 
formula put together in Washington to fob off the new 
applicants: a Partnership for Peace with no security guarantee. 
Hence the stalling ideas of new applicants "proving their 
democratic credentials," of NATO becoming a united services club 
for military co-operation and bonhomie, embracing even Russia. 
This is like saying to a sinking ship that it can have a 
lifeboat only if it makes it first to port. This is not the 
NATO that Lithuania wants to join. It want NATO's territorial 
guarantee at its shoulder now. 
  What is happening is a rerun of the old argument between 
Franks, Dean Acheson and the Senate in 1949. Then a young 
senator, Tom Connally, taunted the Europeans that their demand 
was to "Do anything you want to do, you need not worry; as soon 
as anything happens we will come over and fight your quarrel for 
you." The Europeans won that argument. They persuaded America 
that if it said yes to a NATO guarantee, Europe's quarrels would 
never come to a fight. Throughout the Cold War they were right. 
  Now we have a fight in the former Yugoslavia. Europe 
refuses, in my view rightly, to see Bosnia as a matter of 
collective security. It does not regard Serbia or Croatia as 
comparable to the threat that Russia might pose to democracy in 
East Europe. NATO might have a role as "moral mercenary" in 
what was Yugoslavia, but that has no bearing on its central 
role. America disagrees. It sees Bosnia as a real test of 
Europe's ability to act together to sort out a quarrel before 
running across the Atlantic to nanny. Hence the endless 
bickering about air strikes. 
  I am with Europe. Article five was a commitment by America 
to defend Western democracies (and some dictatorships) against 
external attack. Such was its success that the number of the 
democracies has increased. So why not increase the boundary of 
the commitment? The answer is that America's initial hesitancy 
about committing itself to a European conflict has revived at 
just the moment when such a conflict has once again become 
remotely conceivable. Washington shudders at the thought, as 
Britain shuddered in 1938. 
  So Russia must be appeased. Russians must not be subjected 
to further psychological bruising. This might be 
counterproductive. The grey zone countries may be vulnerable, 
but invasion has always been their fate. Ask Tolstoy. Ask 
Chamberlain. If war breaks out around Russia's borders, blame 
history. 
  Perhaps the Americans are right. Perhaps the Russian threat 
is not enough to risk inflaming the isolationism of Congress. 
Perhaps the moment when a new line needs to be drawn across 
Europe has not arrived, and we can comfort ourselves with 
Santayana's well-founded belief that in the depths of every 
American heart lies goodwill to the world. But in diplomacy, 
timing is all. Europe is bad at timing. So remember Mr 
Kozyrev's speech.

<F P=106> [Article by Peter Riddell: "Falling Over To Help Russia"] </F>
  [Text] A senior American official was asked recently why 
President Clinton's policy towards Europe appeared so confused. 
He replied that the administration had been undecided between a 
Russian-centred and a German-centred approach. Should 
Washington be more concerned about a revival of Russian 
nationalism or about binding Germany and Central Europe into 
West Europe? For the moment, Western fears about Russia have 
predominated. 
  The American-inspired Partnership for Peace, to be adopted 
by 
NATO leaders at their summit in Brussels, fudges the question of 
enlarging NATO to include Central European countries previously 
in the Warsaw Pact. The American priority is not to do anything 
which might undermine Boris Yeltsin, or which he says might 
undermine him. But the West could put at risk the gains from its 
victory in the Cold War. The liberation of the former Soviet 
satellites is the one big foreign policy success of the past 
decade. But NATO is now implicitly accepting that Moscow can 
retain a veto over the security arrangements not just of former 
Soviet republics but also of indisputably European states such 
as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia (generally 
known as the Visegrad Four). 
  President Clinton naturally denies any such intention. The 
President's speech in Brussels last night was full of 
reassurances that Europe, and its security, remains central to 
America's interests. But this is largely public relations 
blather to ensure that Mr Clinton's first visit to Europe as 
President is seen as a success. The leaders of the Visegrad 
countries have acquiesced in Partnership for Peace, but they 
have barely disguised their frustration. 
  The current Western caution is in marked contrast with the 
formation of NATO in 1948-49. The founders of the Atlantic 
alliance were acutely aware of the Soviet threat to West Europe 
and bold in resisting it. The spread of communism was contained 
and peace assured. Similarly, after the Berlin Wall came down 
in November 1989, the Bush administration showed greater 
negotiating skill than has generally been recognised. It 
sponsored the talks on the future of Germany which secured the 
support of the then Soviet Union for unification. America was 
also firm in resisting initial Soviet opposition to a united 
Germany being in NATO. 
  In both cases, there was a balance between recognising 
Moscow's power and advancing the interests of Americas allies. 
That balance is now absent. The Russia lobby is in the 
ascendant, particularly in the form of Strobe Talbott, Deputy 
Secretary of State designate and a close friend of Mr Clinton. 
As Robert Zoellick, architect of the Bush team's European 
initiatives, has argued, "there has been no strong 
counterbalancing force making the case for a European policy 
separate from Washington's Russian calculations." 
  Warren Christopher and Tony Lake, the White House national 
security adviser, initially favoured expanding NATO's 
membership. But in talks last October, just after the 
suppression of the Russian parliamentary opposition, Mr Talbott 
successfully argued against enlargement. This, he feared, would 
draw a line across Europe and might strengthen nationalist 
forces and critics of reform within Russia. Apart from Germany, 
other NATO members were cautious. Douglas Hurd expressed British 
worries to Mr Christopher in late September. The broad policy 
was therefore set before the Russian elections a month ago 
though Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's success has intensified the 
West's predicament. But the American approach risks a 
repetition of its familiar error of concentrating too much on an 
individual leader, whether Mikhail Gorbachev or, now, Mr Yeltsin. 
  No one, however, is urging immediate expansion. NATO only 
works as an integrated military alliance and the armed forces of 
former Warsaw Pact countries are in no position to join yet. 
There has to be a transitional period of growing co-operation, 
not least while these forces show they are under proper 
democratic control. Britain is also wary of extending security 
guarantees unless NATO is willing to implement them. 
  The flaw in Partnership for Peace is that it risks creating 
a 
vacuum by failing to lay down a timetable and guidelines for 
membership. It offers co-operation in planning, training and 
exercises to almost anyone interested, including both Russia and 
Ukraine, but it makes no commitments about who might be allowed 
to join NATO and when. In Mr Christopher's slippery phrase, 
candidates for membership are being given "an opportunity to 
self- differentiate." But the invitation is so broad as to be 
largely meaningless, like the all-embracing and, in practice, 
ineffective Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
  NATO will never be an open-ended club. The main new entrants 
for the foreseeable future are likely to be the Visegrad Four 
countries. Offering them explicit hope of membership, in 
parallel with their closer links with the European Union, would 
not only allay some of their security fears but should also 
strengthen the hand of internal pressures in favour of democracy 
and reform. That could be linked to a formal agreement to 
reassure Russia that it is not being isolated by a hostile West. 
  The danger at present is that insecurity and instability 
will 
be increased, not reduced. The proposed policy may not only 
make no difference to events within Russia--no Western 
initiatives really ever have--but it could also, yet again, let 
down the West's friends in Central Europe. A stable Germany and 
Central Europe are an attainable goal for America and its NATO 
allies. A democratic and free-market Russia is a dream beyond 
our influence. In seeking the latter NATO could jeopardise the 
former.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "NATO Faces Tough Challenge"] </F>
  [Text] Manfred Worner, secretary general of NATO, has 
enunciated four good reasons for the existence of the alliance: 
to project stability; to keep the United States committed to 
Europe; to provide a forum for co-operation; and to insure 
against any remaining military risks. 
  The question lurking behind today's summit in Brussels is 
whether NATO can perform any of these functions well enough. It 
has already proved unable to project stability in former 
Yugoslavia, and is shying away from doing so in Eastern Europe. 
The French, although more co-operative, are still not fully 
reconciled to the U.S. role in Europe. Co-operation is 
undermined by the above problems, among others. And the 
run-down of forces is proceeding towards a point at which the 
alliance may no longer be able to insure even its existing 
members against military risk. 
  Worse still, there are no easy answers. If NATO sticks with 
its present membership it leaves Central and East Europeans in 
the cold, inviting instability or Russian hegemony. If it 
invites in new members, it provides ammunition for the Russian 
military and appears to write off non-members, notably the 
Baltic states. If it stops the run-down of forces, it will also 
alarm Moscow. And if it pretends, as the French wish, that 
Europe can act independently of the U.S., it will condemn itself 
to discord and irrelevance. 
  The way out of these dilemmas chosen by President Clinton is 
Partnership for Peace, which offers the alliance's eastern 
neighbours military co-operation but no security guarantee. 
This is essentially a fudge to buy time, and time is necessary, 
largely because of uncertainty about which way Russia is 
heading. If the emergence of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy signals the 
inexorable approach of militant nationalism, NATO needs to 
polish its weapons and define exactly how far its commitments 
extend. But if it does this too eagerly and too soon, it will 
accelerate fulfillment of the prophecy. 
  The beginnings of an answer can be found by dusting off the 
Harmel Report adopted by NATO in 1967. This states that 
"military security and a policy of detente are not contradictory 
but complementary." In other words, meet the threat while 
trying to reduce it; prepare for the worst while working for the 
best. Translated for today it means not appeasing the Russians 
but working for maximum contact, dialogue, assistance, 
reassurance and access to the closed areas of their minds while 
not neglecting defence. This is the way to allay their fears, 
not by giving them a veto over Western security policy. Indeed, 
the worst favour the West can do for Russian democrats is to 
convey the impression that it is half-hearted in its commitment 
to the defence and expansion of democracy. Clinton, in his 
speech yesterday, seemed to acknowledge this. 
  East Europeans will be watching Brussels anxiously this week 
for signs that the superpowers are once again colluding in the 
division of Europe. It is important that their fears should not 
be confirmed.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Partners, And Peace"] </F>
  [Text] To Moscow from Brussels via Prague, President 
Clinton is busily saying the right things. The NATO summit 
sighs with relief at the message that the Atlantic Alliance is 
still vital to the security of the US. The Czechs and their 
neighbours are invited to come right in and join the new 
Partnership for Peace. The comforting word for the Russians 
(those of them who want to hear) is that they are wanted inside, 
not outside, Europe: there will be no new lines on the map to 
exclude them. None of this is startling news, but it is just 
what European leaders, rattled by Washington's intermittent 
attention, need to be told. Never mind the passionless monotone 
in which Mr Clinton delivered his new European manifesto under 
the tapestries in Brussels's City Hall. At least he actually 
said it. 
  Behind the flourishes of verbal intent the reality is rather 
harder to detect, though that is nothing new in the diplomatic 
business where symbolism weighs more than substance. The truth 
is that, in Europe's uncertain state of transition, the 
organisation can hardly pretend to offer any greater certainty. 
The US forces in Europe can no longer have the clear role 
assigned to them by its previous division. Mr Clinton, unlike 
his predecessors, is only too happy to endorse military 
co-operation, such as the proposed NATO joint task forces, 
between the European allies. It is a sign of changed times that 
Chancellor Kohl should express his gratitude for an attitude 
which really highlights the US's growing strategic detachment 
from Europe. Strengthening the European pillar of the alliance 
through the Western European Union, as promised in yesterday's 
communique, is now less rhetoric than the best way forward to a 
new autonomous identity. The suggestion of an expanded NATO 
peacekeeping role under the UN is positive too, although it will 
have to play a more convincing role than it has so far in 
Bosnia. The last-minute threat of air strikes to reopen Tuzla 
and ensure the rotation of troops to Srebrenica bears all the 
mark of diplomatic improvisation--and Britain's conversion to an 
idea it has steadfastly opposed is distinctly odd. 
  The show moves to Moscow where Mr Clinton's difficulties are 
considerably greater than they were in Brussels. His encounter 
with Mr Yeltsin can hardly be termed a "summit"--and not just 
because of the loss or erosion of superpower status. Such 
meetings are no longer a vantage point from which to survey the 
world, but just another mundane encounter. The only tangible 
achievement to tie up is the agreement on removing Ukraine's 
nuclear weapons, yet that is still subject to the parliament in 
Kiev. No longer adversaries, neither leader would however be 
wise to embrace the other too warmly. The US cannot remake 
Russia in its own image as West Germany has done -- at a high 
price -- with the East. A reasonable understanding between the 
two countries will no doubt help reassure the rest of Europe; 
but it is best secured on the basis of modest expectations.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Good Day for NATO and Europe"] </F>
  [Text] The NATO summit that ends today in Brussels has 
already yielded two outstanding results. The first -- uncertain 
though its fulfillment may be -- is the deal under which 
Ukraine's leadership has agreed to destroy the country's nuclear 
arsenal in exchange for $12 billion. The second is the much 
more positive than expected tone adopted by NATO leaders towards 
extending membership to former members of the Soviet bloc, 
notably Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
  The Ukrainian deal will be formally signed when Bill Clinton 
visits Moscow later this week. It involves some 1,200 nuclear 
warheads left on Ukrainian soil after the collapse of the Soviet 
Union. The American commitment to underwrite the destruction of 
this potential threat to world peace is welcome evidence of 
President Clinton's readiness to involve the United States 
directly in the affairs of East Europe. Not the least benefit 
of the deal will be to end Russia's fears of a hostile nuclear 
neighbour: the possibility, however remote, of a nuclear clash 
between Ukraine and Russia must rank high on any list of 
contemporary disaster scenarios. 
  The chief anxiety must now be that the agreement will be 
repudiated by Ukraine's nationalistic and heavily pro-nuclear 
parliament. At the very least, the deal will be hotly debated. 
Elections due in March could produce a yet more obstructive 
group of parliamentarians bent on retaining nuclear weapons as 
symbols of Ukraine's sovereignty. 
  Even more significant for the long-term security of Europe, 
if less tangible, was the nature of the language adopted towards 
NATO's enlargement to embrace former Warsaw Pact members. True, 
there is still no timetable for enlargement, no criteria and no 
formal naming of potential new members. All that is being 
offered is the halfway-house of the Partnership for Peace, an 
offer of military co-operation that is being extended to all and 
sundry, including Russia itself. But today's communique is 
expected to say that NATO "expects and welcomes" new members, 
the more positive of two alternative formulas; and British 
officials have been suggesting that a timetable for the 
accession of the most eligible countries -- Poland, Hungary and 
the Czech Republic -- could emerge this year. 
  Vital though it is to give those countries the sense of 
security that they need for the full flowering of democracy, 
there is force in the argument that to act now would risk 
inflaming nationalist sentiment in Russia -- hard on the 
electoral success of the extreme nationalist Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy and his so-called Liberal Democrats. 
  Only over the advisability of launching air strikes against 
the Bosnian Serb forces shelling Sarajevo did the alliance show 
its divisions. Those differences of opinion are understandable, 
given the potential dangers posed to the ground forces of NATO 
member states as well as to Bosnian civilians. Yet Western 
failure to stop the slaughter in Bosnia continues to challenge 
the logic of NATO's existence.

  [Text] Osnabrueck (DPA) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
rejected a "rash and half-baked numbers games" about the size of 
the Bundeswehr. Pointing to the situation in former Yugoslavia 
in an interview with the NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG (Tuesday [11 
January] edition), Kohl said peace and freedom could still not 
be had free of charge. For him, it is still decisive "that our 
armed forces are capable of meeting our alliance obligations, 
prepared for action, and equipped to modern standards, and that 
we retain conscription," Kohl said. 
  Kohl warned against setbacks to the process of reform in the 
states of the former Warsaw Pact, above all in Russia. This 
would have "unforeseeable consequences." So far, Germany has 
provided the lion's share of aid --amounting to 80 billion 
German marks -- to Russia and the states of the former Soviet 
Union (The interview was prereleased to DPA in edited form).

Minister Klaus Kinkel has said he seriously doubts the various 
sides' willingness for peace. During talks with the American UN 
Ambassador Madeleine Albright late last night, Kinkel said that 
we have to "seriously ask ourselves to what degree the

peace," the Foreign Ministry announced today. In this context, 
Kinkel referred to the Muslim offensive against areas to which 
the Croats are entitled.

  [Excerpts] Bonn (DPA) -- Mohamad Javad Larijani, former 
Iranian deputy foreign minister, will make efforts to bring 
about the release of German engineer Helmut Szimkus, who has 
been sentenced to death in Iran. 
  Larijani said this in talks with representatives of the 
German Government and parliament in Bonn. He is heading a small 
delegation of parliamentarians on a two-day visit to Bonn. 
Larijani is regarded as a close confidant of Iranian President 
'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani. In their talks with him, 
Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth and Foreign Ministry State 
Secretary Dieter Kastrup directly raised the issue of the 
existing plea for pardon and asked for support. 
  According to information available to DPA, the German 
Government now assumes that Szimkus, who is accused of spying 
for Iraq, will be pardoned in the spring. "Despite the 
difficulties, we are quite certain of this," a high-ranking 
government official told DPA. Under no circumstances is the 
Szimkus case "a matter for negotiation" in connection with the 
Mykonos trial in Berlin. [passage omitted] 
  The three members of the Iranian parliamentary delegation 
did 
not raise the issue of the Mykonos trial in their talks, which 
included a meeting late this afternoon with Bernd Schmidtbauer, 
state minister at the chancellor's office. This was confirmed 
by Christoph Matschke, chairman of the German-Iranian group of 
parliamentarians, which invited Larijani and his delegation to 
Germany. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Bonn (DPA) -- Helmut Szimkus, the German who has 
been sentenced to death in Iran, can hope for a pardon. The 
influential Iranian politician Mohamad Javad [Larijani] today 
referred to the right of the religious leader 'Ali Khamene'i to 
grant a pardon. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking to journalists this evening, Larijani said a pardon 
is part of Iranian law. The procedure prescribes a detailed 
examination of the case. Should Khamene'i use his right to 
grant a pardon in the Szimkus case, this would happen in three 
to four months at the earliest. 
  The Iranian politician stressed that he did not bring up the 
so-called "Mykonos trial" in Berlin. [passage omitted] 
  Larijani expressed his hope that, despite the difficulties, 
German-Iranian relations will continue to develop in a positive 
way and that a solution can be found for Iran's current problems 
in meeting its financial obligations. The German refusal to 
resume the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power station on 
the Persian Gulf, which was suspended 14 years ago, is a "very 
negative point," he said. 
  The politician also warned against further "politicizing" 
the 
death sentence (`Fatwa') Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeyni, the 
deceased leader of the revolution, issued against the writer 
Salman Rushdie. Rushdie has offended millions of Muslims with 
his book The Satanic Verses. "The more the case of 
Rushdie is politicized, the more it will stir the emotions of 
the Muslims," he said. 
  The politician also criticized the Israeli-Palestinian peace 
process, saying it is neither fair nor feasible. He said a 
large majority of Palestinians reject the Gaza-Jericho agreement.

met in Bonn on Friday [14 January] with Mohamad Javad Larijani, 
a leading Iranian politician. During the meeting, the fate of 
Helmut Szimkus, the German who is under sentence of death in 
Iran, was probably discussed. There have been growing 
indications over the last few days that as a result of pressure 
from the German Government, Szimkus, who was sentenced for 
spying for Iraq, can hope for a pardon. 
  Larijani, who belongs to Iran's Supreme Defense Council and 
plays a leading role in parliament in Tehran, ended a five-day 
visit to Germany on Friday. He headed a small delegation of 
Iranian parliamentarians that held talks concerning the 
development of German-Iranian relations with the government, the 
Bundestag, and companies. The meeting with Kinkel was not 
originally on their schedule.

  [Excerpts] Bonn (DPA) -- In a session behind closed doors 
in Windhagen near Bonn the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] 
executive today voted by a large majority in favour of 
nominating Roman Herzog as the candidate for the office of 
Federal President. According to participants in the meeting, 
Herzog received 34 votes in favour in the secret ballot. One 
member of the executive voted against and one abstained. The 
CSU [Christian Social Union] leadership had already expressed 
support for Herzog last weekend. [passage omitted] 
  FDP leader Klaus Kinkel said in an interview with `BILD AM 
SONNTAG' newspaper that only the CDU and CSU bodies had 
nominated their candidate. Roman Herzog was a respected man, 
but for the FDP the situation had not changed. "Our candidate is 
Hildegard Hamm- Bruecher." [passage omitted] 
  Chancellor Kohl told journalists after the meeting the CDU 
executive was convinced that Herzog was the right man for this 
important office in such a difficult time of transition in the 
fatherland. [passage omitted] 
  Herzog said he had told the CDU executive that he was 
willing 
to be nominated. The result of the secret ballot had greatly 
encouraged him. He would now have to wait for the joint 
proposal of the sister parties (CDU and CSU) before he accepted 
the nomination.

  [Excerpts] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- After three years of rising 
government grants and subsidies from western to eastern Germany, 
1994 will for the first time show a reduction in comparison with 
the previous year. In response to a query from DDP/ADN, the 
Finance Ministry revealed in Bonn on Thursday [13 January] that 
a total of 138 billion German marks [DM] was transferred to 
eastern Germany last year. In 1994, this sum will fall by DM5 
billion to DM133 billion net (DM175 billion gross). [passage 
omitted] 
  In 1991, DM107 billion net was made available for eastern 
Germany. In 1992, this sum rose to DM115 billion and was 
increased again last year by DM23 billion, according to official 
figures. That was the highest level of payments since German 
unification.

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- According to a report in WELT AM 
SONNTAG, the Bundeswehr must expect further drastic cuts 
totaling at least 1 to 1.2 billion German marks [DM] in the 
current fiscal year. The latest figure, which Bundeswehr 
leaders did not expect to be so high, was part of the savings 
package the government and coalition want to use to bridge a 
budget deficit of DM5 billion. 
  Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (CDU) and other ministers 
affected by the cuts will meet Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl on 
17 January. The Bundestag group leadership is to hold 
discussions on 18 January, and on 19 January the budget 
committee is to discuss the necessary cuts, the paper adds. 
  The Defense Ministry leadership and defense experts in the 
government coalition were planning to absorb most of the latest 
cuts within the existing structures and with a planned 
Bundeswehr size of 370,000 men. The Defense Ministry hoped that 
these would be the last cuts and that the Bundeswehr would have 
a budget of DM47.5 billion at its disposal from 1995, as agreed 
between the chancellor and the finance and defense ministers.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 19 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation ordered its military experts here Wednesday [19 
January] to work with the United Nations on final preparations 
for possible air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina, diplomats said. 
  But they added that any NATO military action, particularly 
bombing to break the Serb blockade of the mainly-Moslem towns of 
Srebrenica and Tuzla, still depended on a go-ahead from UN 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  NATO's political executive, the North Atlantic Council 
(NAC), 
met Wednesday to follow through a decision at last week's summit 
of the 16-nation alliance to prepare for bombing raids on Serb 
positions around Srebrenica and Tuzla. 
  Detailed plans for such raids were prepared by commanders of 
UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) last week and handed to 
Butrus-Ghali in Geneva on Monday. 
  They are now being studied by the UN's special 
representative 
in ex-Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, who must then submit his 
recommendations to the UN and subsequently to NATO. 
  A NATO spokesman said: "The council welcomed the close 
consultations established between NATO and the UN 
secretary-general, and his active and rapid response to the NATO 
(summit) declaration. 
  "The (NAC) meeting agreed that the next steps lie with the 
UN, although the alliance stands ready to provide whatever 
assistance it can," he said. 
  NATO sources said this meant that military experts of the 
alliance would work closely with Akashi on the bombing plans. 
  The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, added that 
Butrus-Ghali had accepted the "high political priority" of 
planning for NATO intervention and, if necessary, air strikes. 
  The NATO summiteers threatened last week to bomb Serbian 
positions if Serb forces continued to block the relief of 
Canadian peacekeepers at Srebrenica, and the re-opening of Tuzla 
airport which is needed for UN aid missions. 
  Butrus-Ghali has so far been reluctant to authorise the air 
strikes, fearing reprisals against UN forces in Bosnia and 
disagreements in the UN Security Council where Russia is against 
any escalation of the conflict. 
  One diplomat said NATO officials had been working for months 
on detailed plans for military intervention in Bosnia. 
  He said the plans could be put into operation almost 
immediately, pending only last-minute "fine-tuning" to bring 
them into line with specific UN requests. 
  In a related development, the Dutch Defence Ministry said 21 
soldiers are to leave Friday on a reconnaissance mission to 
determine prospects for sending a contingent of troops to 
replace the Canadian forces in Srebrenica. 
  A statement said the 10-day mission would determine when 
some 
1,100 personnel, including an air battalion, could be deployed 
to the eastern Bosnian enclave. 
  A first reconnaissance mission some weeks ago failed to 
produce the necessary information, and UN officials asked the 
Dutch Government to organise a second mission.

<F P=106> [Interview with Anton Buteyko, Ukrainian presidential </F>
adviser, by Francoise Delstanche in Brussels on 18 January: 
"Kiev Expresses its Faith in the Face of the Agreement on 
Denuclearization"] 
  [Text] Anton Buteyko believes that the West is focusing too 
much attention on nuclear affairs. Moderately optimistic about 
the nuclear agreement for the future since, according to him, 
the president has met Parliament's demands, Kravtchuk's adviser 
sees no progress being made on the dossier regarding the Black 
Sea fleet. 
  The tripartite agreement between the United States, Russia, 
and Ukraine, signed last Friday in Moscow, was saluted yesterday 
by the European Union as "an important contribution to 
international security and stability," albeit on condition that 
it be implemented rapidly, failing which any delay would be 
considered with great anxiety. 
  The practical implementation of the agreement effectively 
depends on backing the Ukrainian Parliament in Kiev. Not 
directly, but with respect to the conditions it imposed on the 
ratification of the Start I agreement on the reduction of 
strategic nuclear arms, and on the ratification of the treaty on 
nuclear nonproliferation, both of which Washington had laid down 
as preconditions. The Ukrainian leaders are proving relatively 
confident on these points, however. That is what Anton Buteyko 
explained to us yesterday in an interview given while passing 
through Brussels. However, he believes the West is focusing too 
much attention on the nuclear problem and forgetting that other 
elements are emerging as definitely just as important. 
Consequently, he argues, the development of equal relations with 
the European Union would contribute to the stability of the 
region. 
  Moreover, in his opinion, only Ukraine can check the 
pressure 
in Russia caused by new political forces like that of 
Zhirinovskiy. For, in his view, the renaissance of these fascist 
movements is a menace not only to Ukraine, but also to Europe as 
a whole. 
  [Delstanche] Do you think it will be easy to obtain the 
Ukrainian Parliament's support for the tripartite agreement on 
denuclearization? 
  [Buteyko] The agreement does not formally require 
ratification. On the other hand, when Parliament ratified the 
Start I treaty, it voiced a certain number of reservations, in 
particular concerning the security guarantee for Ukraine, and 
the provision of technological and financial assistance in the 
context of disarmament. In fact, it must be clear that when 
Start I was negotiated, all the arms to be destroyed had to be 
eliminated using the combined economic resources of the USSR as 
a whole, whereas now we would have to destroy them using our own 
resources. That, however, is impossible in view of the economic 
crisis ravaging our country. Furthermore, the destruction of 
this arsenal will benefit the Western nations at which the arms 
in question were aimed. Therefore, it is logical that they 
should contribute to that process, for we are contributing to 
their security. Then again, Parliament has asked for 
compensation for the material contained in the tactical and 
strategic arms handed over to Russia. 
  In addition, it must be remembered that the negotiations 
were 
launched at the initiative of Ukraine, but that neither the 
United States nor Russia took our interests into account. It 
was Parliament's decision regarding the Start I treaty that 
provided a positive impulse in the negotiations. All the more 
so since we also understood that it was impossible to resolve 
certain matters on a bilateral basis. 
  [Delstanche] So what is the next stage in the 
implementation of this agreement? 
  [Buteyko] The president could now come to the Parliament and 
explain that he has met the conditions laid down when Start I 
was ratified, and that this treaty can now take effect. It will 
then be up to Parliament to approve the president's arguments, 
or not. 
  We think Parliament will give us the green light, and we are 
going to work toward that. Admittedly, the approach of the 
March elections could lead some members of Parliament to exploit 
this to further their own personal interests, but despite all 
that I am continuing to hope that the "ayes" will have it. 
  [Delstanche] And do you imagine achieving this during the 
present legislative period, which will end next March? 
  [Buteyko] It is still our intention to achieve Parliament's 
backing, but if we do not, then we will be back in charge under 
the next Parliament. 
  [Delstanche] A debate flared up last September between Kiev 
and Moscow regarding an agreement on the sale of the Ukrainian 
share of the Black Sea fleet to Russia in return for the 
cancellation of the bilateral debt. What stage have the talks 
on this subject reached? 
  [Buteyko] At the end of the 3 September 1993 meeting, a 
joint 
press release stipulated that the two delegations had to draw up 
recommendations over the following months on all the decisions 
made within that context, while taking account of all the ideas 
expressed and the specific agreements already concluded at that 
meeting. Since then, there have been two rounds of talks, but 
the Russians intend to consider only their own proposals. 
  Meanwhile, we have said that Ukraine would agree to divide 
the fleet in two, but not the associated elements of 
infrastructure. The Russians can by all means pay for using 
those. 
  [Delstanche] And what about the bilateral debt? Is the fate 
of this debt still in abeyance? 
  [Buteyko] Everyone in the West forgets that in September 
1992 
the CIS heads of state agreed to share the property of the 
former USSR among the new states. Under the terms of this 
agreement, Ukraine should have received 16 percent of the assets 
of the old state as well as gold and diamond reserves. However, 
Moscow never implemented this agreement. If our energy debt is 
compared with the Russian failure to return these assets to 
Ukraine, then Russia is indebted to us, not the other way round. 
  Having said that, the tripartite agreement included the 
provision that compensation for the material contained in the 
arms will more or less cover the bilateral debt. The experts 
must now decide on the value of this material. 
  [Delstanche] There are some people in Ukraine who seem to 
think this agreement constitutes a victory for Russia above 
all.... 
  [Buteyko] This trilateral agreement opens the way for the 
destruction of the nuclear monster, and the whole world will 
gain from this. Even more specifically, however, it is Ukraine 
that insisted on continuing the negotiations on guarantees and 
compensation, and that is the reason things have now been 
resolved. 
  So you can judge who is the victor, which does not mean to 
say that Russia and the United States are also gaining from it. 
  [Delstanche] Can Ukraine have faith in the Russian 
commitments regarding its security? 
  [Buteyko] This aspect of the agreement still depends on the 
Ukrainian Parliament's ratification of the treaty on nuclear 
nonproliferation. If that is the case, however, then the two 
countries, the United States and Russia, undertake to respect 
the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine as well as 
the inviolability of its borders. This had never been 
recognized in the past in any document coming from Moscow. 
Admittedly, in the past, many agreements have not been 
implemented, but now the United States is a party to the 
agreement, which gives us cause to hope that it will be 
respected.

<F P=106> [Report by Andreas Unterberger: "Partnership For Peace -- </F>
Mock Contradicts Busek"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Contrary to Austrian People's Party 
[OeVP] Chairman Erhard Busek, Foreign Minister Alois Mock (OeVP) 
holds with Austria's keeping its distance from the "Partnership 
for Peace" concept. 
  In an interview with DIE PRESSE, Foreign Minister Mock 
backed 
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and Defense Minister Werner 
Fasslabend, who have both rejected Austria's participation in 
NATO's "Partnership for Peace." Vice Chancellor Busek, however, 
has repeatedly stressed in recent days that such a partnership 
would also be of interest to Austria. 
  Mock: "I do not see any specific need for action regarding 
Austria's direct cooperation." He added that Austria's 
pragmatic function as an observer on security policy problems 
was growing anyway. "In any case, prior to membership in the 
European Union, we cannot act as observers with NATO or the 
Western European Union." The foreign minister concluded: 
"First things first." 
  The minister also stressed that his opinion on such a 
partnership was "basically favorable," but he connects this 
above all with the "great importance it will have for the 
Central and Eastern European countries." To that extent, 
Partnership for Peace is also significant for Austria. 
  Vice Chancellor Busek reiterated to DIE PRESSE his desire 
for 
Austria to come closer to a partnership with NATO. He 
formulated his proposal more specifically: "The point is the 
flow of information. We should have a military officer 
permanently and officially accredited to NATO as an observer." 
Busek also hinted that he had pledges from NATO saying this 
would be possible.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend by Peter </F>
Pirker; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Pirker] As far as the timing and the priority of 
participation in Partnership for Peace with NATO are concerned, 
are you siding with the chancellor rather than your party 
chairman, who wants cooperation with NATO as early as now? 
  [Fasslabend] This would certainly be far too one-sided or an 
incorrect representation of a contrast that does not exist. The 
first priority of Austria's security policy is entering the 
European Union, integration within the joint security policy of 
the 12 states. Ranking second are integration and active 
participation in the Western European Union, whose importance 
will probably further increase in the future because the 
Europeans themselves will have to do more for their security in 
the future. Third, cooperation with NATO certainly is to be 
continued and developed. I have clearly expressed this. In the 
future, our relations with NATO will be as friendly and based on 
partnership as those with Sweden and France were in the past.

  [Excerpts] Yesterday morning three trucks from Trade for 
Aid, the Salzburg relief organization, set out for Split [in 
Croatia]. However, the transport of 20 tonnes of donated 
foodstuffs, medicine, and winter clothing was halted at the 
Slovene border. Trade for Aid was not able to pay the 137,000 
schillings Slovenia wanted for the 100-km passage. [passage

  The Salzburg relief organization had all the necessary 
documentation for the aid shipment to the refugee campaigns. 
International relief organizations such as the Red Cross or 
Caritas, and thus the Neighbor in Need campaign, are not 
affected by these Slovene charges.

<F P=106> [Pierre Lefevre commentary: "Anniversary Snubs for Bill </F>
Clinton"] 
  [Text] Today, Bill Clinton is celebrating his first 
anniversary at the White House, but he has recently received a 
series of snubs that are leading some to wonder increasingly 
about the credibility of his foreign policy. 
  Not least of these snubs was the one inflicted on him by 
Admiral Bobby Inman, the man chosen to succeed Les Aspin as 
Pentagon chief. The fact that the defense secretary, a man who 
is expected to keep his cool at all times, seems apparently 
incapable of surviving an editorial in the NEW YORK TIMES, is 
reason enough for concern at the way in which Mr. Clinton 
selects the members of his entourage. 
  Regarding Bosnia, at the NATO summit last week the U.S. 
President approved the threat of air strikes against the Serbs 
at Tuzla and Srebrenica, while personally emphasizing that no 
more threats should be made that were not followed up by action. 
Since then, Mr. Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, has 
openly mocked this position, UN representatives have rejected 
it, Moscow has implicitly vetoed it, and the U.S. head of the 
joint chiefs of staff has personally criticized it. No 
elementary consultations had taken place. Today, it is not just 
the White House, but also NATO, which is losing creditworthiness 
in that context. 
  The slaps in the face given by Moscow are hitting home even 
harder. The continuation of economic reforms there would appear 
to be largely compromised, but against the advice of the best 
observers and of the market itself, Mr. Clinton is continuing to 
play down the possible absence of Messrs. Gaydar and Fedorov in 
the next Russian Government, two men he openly supported last 
week in Moscow, whereas attempts are now being made to sweep 
them aside or demote them. The U.S. Administration, their 
attention trained on Mr. Yeltsin, manifestly failed to take into 
account the increasing power of Mr. Chernomyrdin, the 
conservative prime minister. 
  By the same token, three days after the U.S. President 
explicitly asked Russia to complete the withdrawal of its armies 
from Latvia and Estonia, the Russian foreign minister stated 
that the Baltic states belong within Russia's strategic zone of 
interest -- to the extent that the Latvian prime minister is 
wondering whether this position has been coordinated with the 
United States. And with the U.S. President having just left 
Moscow, Washington has been reduced to asking the Russians to 
explain themselves. Furthermore, no response is being made to 
the growing affirmation of the Kremlin's desire to recreate its 
sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union, and to retain a 
right to watch over affairs in Central Europe. 
  The fledgling democracies of Central Europe, limited to 
rallying behind a "partnership for peace" which favors 
consultation with Moscow and which everyone mistrusts, have in a 
few days -- and despite the hugs and kisses from Prague -- lost 
much of their faith in the support that the United States is 
capable of offering them. 
  This retrospective assessment of one year of foreign policy 
conveys a strong impression of thoughtlessness, of alienation 
from reality, of ignorance regarding the true situation 
regarding the balance of power, or -- in the case of Bosnia, 
Somalia, or Haiti -- of pure and simple disinterest. Referring 
to the trust Bill Clinton placed in the Syrian leader Hafiz 
al-Asad, or the manner in which he compelled Ukrainian President 
Kravchuk to give his nuclear arsenal back to Russia, the author 
of a WALL STREET JOURNAL editorial speaks of naivety. In any 
case, there are mumblings about a certain otherworldliness of 
the kind that characterized the policy conducted by Jimmy Carter. 
  Admittedly, President Clinton has scored successes, 
especially on the domestic scene and at the level of trade, 
particularly with regard to the conclusion of the GATT and NAFTA 
agreements. His Asian policy, taking form at the recent APEC 
[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] summit in Seattle, would 
also seem to be resolved. Beijing, meanwhile, is still very much 
on trial and, with the upcoming visit by Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen to China, is apparently making the minimal 
concessions required to secure the extension of the most-favored 
nation clause. There, too, no excessive naivety should be 
displayed. No more than in North Korea, where Washington, 
although apparently satisfied, has not obtained any real 
guarantee of being able to keep tabs on the development of 
nuclear arms.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Quartermasters Leave For Bosnia </F>
Tomorrow"] 
  [Text] A group of 21 members of the Dutch military are 
leaving tomorrow for the Bosnian enclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa 
in order to prepare for the arrival of the reinforced battalion 
of the light mobile brigade. This unit of 1,100 men is to 
relieve the Canadian soldiers currently in the area. The 
battalion may be able to leave as early as mid-February. 
  The Dutch Government yesterday received a further request 
from the United Nations to send the 1,100 Dutchmen to Bosnia. 
The soldiers' job will be to protect the population in the 
Muslim enclaves and ensure the safe transport of humanitarian 
aid. 
  An earlier mission by Dutch quartermasters failed when the 
Bosnian Serbs refused their entry. The Dutch battalion had been 
due to leave for Bosnia at the beginning of the year. 
  Military circles say the reason the Dutch are now being 
allowed in is due to NATO's threat to use air strikes to ensure 
the relief of the Canadians. At the Defense Ministry, however, 
they are not so sure Bosnia's Serb fighters are not still going 
to block the work of the quartermasters or the arrival of the 
battalion, despite the fact that leaders Karadzic and General 
Mladic have now agreed to the relief of the Canadians by the 
Dutch. 
  The quartermasters need 10 days in order to inspect 
locations 
for the encampment of the men in the reinforced battalion. The 
Dutch unit consists of 800 men from the light mobile brigade and 
300 support troops. The light mobile brigade has armored 
vehicles with heavy machine guns, mortars, and TOW [antitank 
missiles] and Dragon antitank rockets. The mandate is to return 
fire in self-defense. Ter Beek described this as `robust' 
action in the Dutch Parliament. 
  The arrival of the light mobile brigade will bring the 
number 
of Dutch soldiers in and around the former Yugoslavia to almost 
3,000.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Butrus-Ghali Praises Netherlands </F>
Role--`Important Military Contributions to UN Peace Operations'"] 
  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has given 
the Netherlands lavish praise for the important military 
contribution it is making to UN peace operations. Butrus-Ghali 
was speaking to members of Parliament and the Senate and later 
addressed a packed Great Church in The Hague. 
  The offer to send a reinforced battalion in addition to the 
1,840 Netherlands soldiers who are already deployed in the 
former Yugoslavia was "highly valued" by the United Nations, 
Butrus-Ghali said. 
  Dutch support to mine clearance operations in 
Mozambique--the 
Netherlands is to send some 10 mine clearance experts--was also 
especially welcome. 
  The secretary general regretfully noted that some countries 
were starting to show "symptoms of fatigue" where contributions 
to UN peace operations were concerned. "I am not certain 
whether I will obtain enough troops for peace operations," he 
said. "Nor am I certain of financial contributions. Some 
countries say that the costs and risks are too high." 
  In a confidential speech to members of Parliament and the 
Senate, Butrus-Ghali said he could not impose peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina if the warring parties continued to refuse to 
end the hostilities. The order to launch air attacks on Bosnian 
Serb positions was a matter for the UN member states themselves. 
<H5>  Borrow </H5>
  Butrus-Ghali, who is on a three-day visit to the 
Netherlands, 
added that he could only "borrow" military resources from the UN 
member states. The decision to launch air attacks was not his 
first responsibility, he said. NATO has spoken in favor of air 
attacks, but so far Butrus-Ghali has received no request to 
carry them out. 
  Prince Willem-Alexander, virtually the entire cabinet, MP's, 
the military top brass, and many prominent Dutch persons 
attended the secretary general's speech in the Great Church. 
Butrus-Ghali is a former international law professor in Egypt, 
his country of birth. He called for breathing new life into 
international law so that it would be possible to react 
appropriately to the great challenges of the post-Cold War 
period. He referred to the great role the Netherlands has long 
played in this respect. It was not for nothing that The Hague 
houses the UN International Court of Justice, the Permanent 
Court of Arbitration, and the International War Crimes Tribunal.

<F P=106> [By Sarah Womack, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>
  [Text] There is no prospect of the immediate withdrawal of 
British troops from Bosnia, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind 
said today. He was speaking as Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd 
began a two-day visit to central Bosnia, as part of 
consultations on whether British troops should continue to serve 
with UN forces there. 
  He stressed there was no question of Britain pulling out 
unilaterally or withdrawing during "these winter months". His 
comments came as protracted talks to try to end the fighting 
remained deadlocked. 
  Mr Rifkind told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "There is no 
question of us pulling out during these winter months. There is 
a job to be done ... and that is going to take a little bit 
longer at the very least. 
  "Secondly, I don't think there is any likelihood of Britain 
pulling out unilaterally. 
  "What we are talking about is whether the United Nations as 
a 
whole should continue to be in Bosnia, whether the time might 
come at some stage when it no longer can carry out its mandate. 
  "That's not just a matter for the United Kingdom. France, 
Spain, Canada and a number of other countries are all having 
exactly this debate at the present time." 
  Britain and France currently provide the thrust of the UN 
military operation which protects aid convoys to treacherous 
parts of Bosnia. 
  Mr Hurd, following the main supply route running through the 
British bases at Tomislavgrad, Gornji Vakuf and finally Vitez, 
the location of the First Battalion Coldstream Guards, will 
speak to officers from the battalion group before moving on to 
the UN headquarters for Bosnia in Kiseljak tomorrow. 
  Mr Rifkind, pressed whether it was unlikely that British 
troops would still be serving in Bosnia in the spring, indicated 
that this was too early a time for withdrawal. 
  "`Come the spring' I think is fairly early, we are not far 
from the spring. 
  "I think the important point first of all is to see this 
winter through." 
  But if by the spring or early summer there was no prospect 
of 
a peace settlement "then it does have to be addressed as to 
whether the UN presence is making a material contribution to 
ending this ghastly war." 
  Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Menzies Campbell said a 
unilateral British withdrawal would be "wholly unreasonable". 
  But Tory MP Peter Viggers said the humanitarian mission was 
grinding to a halt and it was time to pull out the troops. 
  The Gosport MP and Commons Defence Select Committee member 
told the Today programme: "We are coming to a time of decision. 
I fear that decision must be to withdraw the troops." 
  Meanwhile, peace mediator Lord Owen was struggling to retain 
credibility after an embarrassing vote of no confidence from 
disgruntled Euro MPs in Strasbourg. 
  The 106-95 vote showed their determination to express 
dissatisfaction at Lord Owen's failure to find a breakthrough 
after almost two years of bloody conflict.

<F P=106> [By LONDON PRESS ASSOCIATION correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams again called tonight 
for direct dialogue with the British government to help clarify 
key issues in the Downing Street peace declaration. He told 
party workers in west Belfast: "The Unionist veto prevents 
political movement and makes the achievement of consent 
impossible." Mr Adams hinted, however, that if the right 
signals flowed from the Downing Street declaration an IRA 
ceasefire could not be ruled out. 
  "I have to go back to the May 10 situation, where Sinn Fein 
negotiators with the British government delegation meetings and 
the political basis and perameters for them, and at the British 
request a proposition was put to the IRA to suspend its campaign 
and the IRA agreed to do that and then the British walked away 
from it. 
  "On the one hand that makes the situation all the more 
dangerous because of the way the British Government tried to 
abuse that process. "But on the other hand, the IRA have been 
very positive about the Irish peace proposals put by myself and 
John Hume. 
  "There is still the opportunity for peace and Sinn Fein is 
committed to ensuring the British Government doesn't squander 
that opportunity." Mr Adams accused the Government of being an 
obstacle in moving the peace process forward. He said: "Their 
inability to come to a definitive attitude or to decide whether 
this declaration fits into the overall peace strategy is tied 
totally to the British clarification. 
  "In other words, the sooner they provide this clarification 
the sooner Sinn Fein can come to conclusions. The only logical 
reason for the British refusing clarification can be that they 
are working to their own political agenda."

  [Text] South Africa was tonight invited to rejoin the 
Commonwealth after a 33-year absence. The offer came from the 
Secretary General of the Commonwealth Secretariat, Chief Emeka 
Anyaoku, when he spoke at London's South Africa Club. 
  He said: "The Commonwealth's 50 member countries drawn from 
all the continents and regions of the world will provide the new 
South Africa with a ready gateway to the wider world." 
  Chief Anyaoku said that central to the resolution of South 
Africa's accumulated problems will be its ability to reintegrate 
fully into the world community of nations. He invited South 
Africa to heal the "family rift" now that it was becoming a 
non-racial democracy. 
  South Africa will hold its first democratic elections on 
April 27 with all races able to vote after its Parliament 
approved an interim constitution leading to black majority rule. 
  Chief Anyaoku said: "By normalising its relations with the 
Commonwealth, South Africa will at a stroke be consolidating its 
relations with 50 other countries with influence and a network 
of relations in their respective regions." 
  He added: "A post apartheid South Africa, reconciled and at 
peace with itself and its neighbours, will, as far as the 
Commonwealth is concerned, be sufficient reward in itself. It 
will be a triumph for the most cherished of all Commonwealth 
principles, namely, the equality of all human beings 
irrespective of colour, religious belief, culture or any other 
adventitious criteria," he said.

  [Editorial Report] Munich ARD Television Network at 1930 
GMT on 20 January on its ``Monitor'' program, moderated by Klaus 
Bednarz, carries a 10-minute report by Jo Angerer and Mathias 
Werth on the Federal Intelligence Service, BND, in 
Munich-Pullach plans to extend its activities to industrial 
espionage. 
  Asked about the BND's future tasks, Bernd Schmidbauer, 
intelligence coordinator in the Federal Interior Ministry, says 
it will deal with the problems of "drugs, money laundering, 
terrorism, and problems related to proliferation, meaning the 
export of instruments and machinery for the production of 
weapons of mass destruction, which, in view of the changed 
world, is one of the important central points." 
  Asked whether the new tasks include dealing with the large 
area of industrial espionage, Schmidbauer says: "It does, as 
far as prevention is concerned; it does not, as far as active 
industrial espionage is concerned. The FRG does not pursue 
industrial espionage with its intelligence services." 
  The video shows a "confidential BND document" that says "the 
opposite." It reveals that "Department I, the most important 
BND department, which is responsible for active espionage, is 
being restructured. The author of the paper is Volker Foertsch, 
head of Department I and a confidant of Minister in the 
Chancellor's Office Schmidbauer. This document not only deals 
with proliferation, organized crime, and international drug 
trafficking. Among other things, the BND work will in the 
future be focused on Comp Int, or competitive intelligence -- in 
other words, industrial espionage." 
  Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, an "intelligence expert," says "the 
creation of such a section in BND Department I means agents from 
Pullach will in the future steal foreign companies' internal 
secrets to make them available to German firms for competitive 
advantages. The BND pursued such activities in the past in 
exceptional cases, but is obviously planning to do so 
systematically." 
  According to ``Monitor'', the BND is prohibited by law from 
carrying out industrial espionage abroad. "But this is 
precisely what the service is planning to do," says the 
correspondent. "What the BND means by competitive intelligence, 
or industrial espionage, is described in an internal working 
paper, which demonstrates by a U.S. example what -- as it says 
verbatim -- competitive intelligence as such means." 
  The video shows a document that deals with the way a U.S. 
firm obtains information from the U.S. NSA on the planned 
introduction of a new microchip generation by a foreign producer. 
  The BND "cooperates closely with German industry, and, in 
addition to the Federal Government and federal authorities, 
German firms are among its consumers." Schmidbauer denies this: 
"This has never been the case, and it will not be the case in 
the future. Of course, certain information is passed on to 
private institutions by the responsible authorities if such 
institutions are concerned. This is not the rule, however, but 
the exception." 
  The video shows an internal BND document "for official use 
only." Apart from government authorities and NATO, "we also find 
industry as a consumer of BND information." 
  Schmidbauer says he does "not know this document. I repeat, 
this would be an activity that would be incompatible with the 
legal bases of the Federal Intelligence Service. If such 
information really exists, we must examine it and, if necessary, 
submit it to the Parliamentary Control Commission." 
  According to these documents, the "BND passes on secret 
information to German industry, and intends in the future to spy 
on foreign firms as well -- illegally, but in the world trade 
war, one does not hesitate to use dirty tricks in this country, 
too," the ``Monitor'' report concludes.

  [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN)--The Federal Intelligence Service 
(BND) has denied reports from the ARD (German television) 
magazine program "Monitor" alleging that the BND is about to 
extend its activities to industrial espionage ("Competitive 
Intelligence") [previous two words in English] to the benefit of 
German industry. 
  "We have no mandate for this," BND spokesman Elmar Lehberg 
said on Friday [21 January] in response to a question, but he 
would not comment on the detailed information from the 
television program. In keeping with the BND law, the BND only 
gathers information about foreign countries that are of foreign 
and security policy importance for Germany, said Lehberg. 
  The "Monitor" program showed documents on Thursday allegedly 
proving that the BND had, without the knowledge of the 
parliamentary control commission, developed plans to restructure 
Department 1 and to commission it with spying on foreign 
businesses. The report, which was classified as secret, names 
German industry as the "consumer" [Bedarfstraeger]. Bernd 
Schmidbauer, state secretary in the Federal Chancellery, said he 
had no knowledge of such plans.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Leo Wieland: "Clinton's First Apprentice </F>
Year"] 
  [Text] New bumperstickers can be seen in the United States 
marking the anniversary of Clinton's first year in office. They 
read: "Don't blame me -- I voted for Bush." However, this 
criticism is not representative. Most Americans do not regret 
the change. This applies both to those 43 percent who voted for 
Clinton and to some who prefered Bush or Perot. On his first 
anniversary, opinion pollsters affirm to the President, whose 
popularity dropped to an unprecedented low for newcomers in the 
middle of last year, that some 60 percent are now satisfied 
again with his performance. It was the same percentage that had 
expressed their advance confidence when Clinton first took 
office. 
  That Clinton is seen as a man on whom people can pin their 
hopes has something to do with his personality. His engaging 
manners blend with the stylistic elements of a Kennedy and the 
communicative talent of a Reagan. At home, he is seen as a 
pragmatic worker who is ready to make compromises. Abroad, he 
is self-assured and presentable, which could be seen in his 
recent trip to Europe. One can hardly criticize anything about 
the form; if anything, one can find fault with the political 
substance, which sometimes appears to be lacking body. Clinton, 
who presented his administration as a clean prototype of a "new 
ethic," is nevertheless being followed like a shadow by the 
"question of character." The damage caused by old stories of 
women and business deals in Arkansas is still limited. The 
voters, who had heard about it, gave him a kind of absolution in 
the polls in November 1992. If the "revelations" that are still 
to be expected remain confined to his term as governor -- and do 
not extend to his time in the White House -- he will probably 
get out of it without much harm. However, since in the view of 
the U.S. media, presidents do not have a private life and have a 
transparent past, Clinton has to be watchful regarding 
everything that might look like an attempt to cover something up. 
  The slow, albeit meanwhile recognizable, upswing is 
Clinton's 
most valuable political asset. Strictly speaking, the recovery 
may have more to do with Bush's careful laissez-faire and the 
responsible and flexible attitude of the U.S. Treasury than with 
Clinton. Still, he is profiting from it. Inflation and 
interest rates are low. Unemployment has decreased to 6.4 
percent. In the last quarter of 1993, the growth rate was over 
5 percent. The industry and the consumers are optimistic. Only 
national debts and the budget deficit remain at such a high 
level that any increase in funds has to be ruled out both for 
domestic policy programs and foreign aid. 
  However, as an "activistic" government head, Clinton is 
exposed to this very temptation. In sharp contrast to the 
eighties, when Reagan, a Republican, denounced a costly, 
overinflated bureaucracy as "part of the problem but not of the 
solution," Democrat Clinton personifies the belief in the "good 
administration." His course corrections range from tax to 
family policy. They include courageous laws (firearms control, 
social work for scholarships) and controversial initiatives 
(admitting homosexuals into the Army, abortion at public 
expense). Yet, the three most ambitious projects -- health, 
welfare, and education reform -- are emerging only gradually. 
At the same time, doubts are rising whether these projects can 
be financed, particularly as far as the promised national health 
insurance is concerned. 
  In foreign policy, Clinton can, at best, present a mixed 
balance. Here his first year often was an irritating tightrope 
walk between realpolitik and appeasement. Hesitation in the 
face of conflicts and the tendency to pursue the path of least 
resistance manifested themselves in many ways: in Bosnia, 
Somalia, and Haiti, NATO turning down the Central Europeans out 
of consideration for Russia, and the treatment of the "nuclear 
communists" in North Korea. Empty threats and the obvious 
resolution not to interfere in alien conflicts cannot have won 
him much respect from despots of the likes of Milosevic or 
Cedras. 
  On the credit side, Clinton can point to achievements in the 
one sphere he is interested in and that affects the U.S. pocket: 
foreign trade. Here, the acronyms NAFTA (North American Free 
Trade Association), GATT, and APEC (Asian-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation) stand for his most impressive success. In the 
Middle East, however, where the superpower sees its "vital 
interests" affected because of Israel and the oil reserves, 
Clinton's mediating activities -- from the handshake with 
'Arafat to his meeting with Al-Asad -- are proof of a 
respectable commitment. 
  The lessons Clinton learned from his first 12 months include 
the understanding that he can in no way keep out of foreign 
affairs, and, like a "laser beam," focus exclusively on national 
economy. Despite credible assertions of partnership, neither his 
leadership power nor his determination to lead have so far been 
sufficiently tested. In an unusual way, Clinton has turned out 
to be a new generation American. More than all of his 
predecessors since World War II, he has no problem with leaving 
Europe and other faraway regions more to themselves.

<F P=106> ["hen"-signed report: "Waigel: Budget Covers All Economic </F>
Risks"] 
  [Text] According to Finance Minister Theo Waigel 
(Christian Social Union), the coalition in Bonn is in "complete 
control" of the 1994 budget. In spite of the cutbacks involving 
5 billion German marks [DM] that were allocated to the 
individual ministries on Monday evening [17 January], all 
economic risks for the current fiscal year that are discernible 
at this point have been covered. Thus, there is no need for a 
supplementary budget from today's viewpoint. The data adopted 
in the 1994 budget are clearly "credible targets," even though 
they were discredited as "faked figures" by Chairman of the 
Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Rudolf Scharping, 
Waigel told journalists in Bonn on Tuesday. 
  Scharping's assessment leaves him cold because it comes from 
a politician who has proven to be "not very competent" in the 
sphere of economics, Waigel stated. He believes the financial 
statement at the end of 1993 and the allocation of the DM5 
billion cutbacks to the various ministries will create new 
confidence in Bonn's economic and financial policy. Thus, the 
government had succeeded in completely achieving the targets 
concerning the major data of the budget in the last fiscal year 
in spite of enormous national challenges. At a net borrowing of 
DM67.6 billion, the government has "impressively" refuted the 
SPD's claim that the debt will exceed DM80 billion. The 
preliminary results of the 1993 tax receipts are about DM2.25 
billion higher than the calculations of the "tax estimation" 
working group, presented in November 1993. This is a surplus of 
DM1.5 billion for the government, which ensures a solid basis 
for the 1994 budget as far as receipts are concerned. 
  Still, the Federal Government will continue its austerity 
course when drafting the 1995 budget, which will be adopted by 
the cabinet before the summer recess, despite the election 
campaign. Thus, Waigel plans to include the cutbacks involving 
DM5 billion, adopted at the recommendation of the Bundestag 
Budget Committee, in the 1995 draft, too, to induce the 
individual ministries to save as much as possible. Regarding 
the receipts of the 1994 budget, he proceeds from the premise 
that the tax receipts will nominally rise by approximately 4 
percent, which was considered feasible by the annual 1994 
economic report. Waigel pointed out that he has no other data 
than those of the economics minister. Thus, those politicians 
from the Free Democratic Party of Germany who regard a 
supplementary budget for 1994 even now unavoidable should first 
check with their colleague Rexrodt whether their demands are 
compatible with the economic situation, Waigel pointed out. 
  The finance minister confirmed once more that, at DM1.25 
billion, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe has to carry out the 
largest cuts within the DM5 billion austerity package. It will 
not be easy for the Bundeswehr to handle that, and therefore a 
repetition is not possible. According to Waigel, the other cuts 
involving hundreds of millions will fall on the following 
ministries and areas: Transportation DM673 million, Berlin aid 
DM642 million, labor and social affairs DM500 million, the 
economy DM373 million, research and technology DM250 million, 
Interior Ministry DM200 million, agriculture DM187 million, 
development aid DM145 million, Finance Ministry DM129 million, 
and the Foreign Ministry approximately DM115 million. All other 
items in the budget are clearly below the DM100- million limit. 
Only housing has to save a larger sum -- DM80 million. 
  The finance minister sees no need for political action 
concerning the DM2.6 billion that the compromise of the 
mediation committee on the austerity package cost. He believes 
that this sum can be compensated for by expenditure cuts or 
increased receipts before the end of the year. This also 
applies to the costs of the action program for growth and 
employment planned by the coalition. 
  The SPD described the government's budget decisions as 
"insufficient patchwork." The budget is a "financial torso", 
its economic spokesman, Oskar Lafontaine, stated. He demanded 
the submission of an "honest supplementary budget."

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt 
complained of "fossilized welfare state structures" today. He 
said before the German World Economic Association today in 
Berlin that the "ossification of institutions and behavior 
patterns in our society" were delaying the necessary structural 
adjustments and jeopardizing the competitiveness of German 
industry. 
  The far-reaching changes in the global economy were a 
challenge to the Western world. The technological advantage of 
the old industrial countries was shrinking. The European and 
German superiority in the quality of work could no longer be 
taken for granted. 
  In Germany, said Rexrodt, the economy in the new eastern 
states was noticeably catching up with that in the West, 
"despite all prophecies of doom". It was particularly 
gratifying to note that the processing industry, which had so 
far "lagged behind", was now catching up. This could be seen 
from the increase in incoming contracts and strong production 
growth of just under eight percent in 1993.

<F P=106> ["kr"-signed report: "Capital Yield Tax Brings Less Than </F>
Expected"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 18 January -- The Bundesbank says 
in its latest monthly report that monetary conditions will not 
prevent an unexpected extensive economic recovery. It promises 
again to cautiously explore the scope of action for interest 
rate policy moves. It resolutely rejects forced interest rate 
cuts to boost the economic cycle, and refuses, equally 
resolutely, to solve Germany's economic problems through a 
devaluation of the German mark by means of lower interest rates. 
  The Bundesbank says in its report that it remains the most 
important monetary policy task to return to price stability. It 
stresses that this would also provide a basis for lasting growth 
and would be a contribution to the safeguarding of Germany's 
economic base. To make it successful, however, it must be 
supported by a moderate wage policy and by an economic and 
financial policy seeking stable framework conditions. The 
Bundesbank believes that the money supply target for 1994, which 
has been set at between 4 and 6 percent, can be reached. 
  In its monthly report, the Bundesbank also examines the 
question of how German savers have reacted to the capital yield 
tax. Before the new tax was introduced, there were massive 
evasion reactions and "evasion deals" through financial centers 
in the neighbor countries. Unlike the "withholding tax" of 1989, 
however, most of them were not accompanied by definitive capital 
outflows. 
  In view of no more than 11 (as against an estimated 24) 
billion German marks in gross earnings from the capital yield 
tax, the Bundesbank criticizes the federal finance minister for 
having underestimated the extent of the evasion reaction. It 
admits, however, that probably only the smaller part of the 
deficit can be explained by tax evasion abroad. The wrong 
forecast has above all something to do with the applications for 
tax exemption by which a larger part of the income was exempted 
from tax than originally expected. Another factor is the 
extensive decline in the average yield since the spring of 1992. 
  According to the Bundesbank, the largest vehicle by far for 
portfolio shifts are foreign investment funds. The second most 
important "evasion instrument" were investments in the 
Euromarket.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta </F>
by Federico Bugno "on a flight back to Rome from Cairo"; date 
not given: "Beware: This Is a Return To the First Decade of This 
Century"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Although obviously tired, 
Foreign Minister Andreatta had not lost his proverbial energy. 
He said of many authoritative Italian commentators that "they 
only get excited when they talk about Italy's national 
interest," in the petty nationalist belief of rediscovering a 
nonconfessional foreign policy to set against the Catholic 
foreign policy desired by Alcide De Gasperi, which has lasted 
for the past 40 years. Thus they ultimately discover a foreign 
policy confined to what can be seen barely beyond our borders, 
in a merely geographical vision of international politics. 
Against geopolitics, he sets geoeconomics, which does indeed 
have "global horizons." He vigorously defended Italy's busy 
activity within the international bodies: "We are among the 
countries that have benefited most from these alliances and from 
having taken part in a system within which certain rules 
prevail," he said. 
  [Bugno] But the concept of the national interest is not now 
so uncommon. The new Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott, 
cited the U.S. national interest to explain the Americans' 
support for Boris Yeltsin. And in Germany and Poland some 
emphasis is placed on this concept. Not to mention France, 
where this emphasis has never been absent. 
  [Andreatta] I too perceive the dangers of a 
renationalization 
of European foreign policy. In the way international relations 
are taught in the universities, in the mentality of the new 
generations of diplomats, there is something of a taste for a 
return to the "art deco," the "Liberty" period in foreign 
policy. This, because the great war of religion which divided 
the world is over, and so too is the imposition of an order 
founded on the basis of the strict mathematical logic of the 
nuclear equation. Personally, I regard all this with anxiety. 
Of course, I could even admit that, as an exercise, France's 
gamble over GATT was textbook material. They were able -- for 
the sake of nonvital interests that had become important only 
for reasons of domestic policy -- to play a well orchestrated 
game which, however, placed in jeopardy negotiations that lasted 
2,800 days and that made it possible to lower world tariffs by 
almost 40 percent. At one stage they hinged on France's problem 
with increasing its grain exports by a few million tonnes or 
denying American films access to European television channels. 
The French jeopardized the negotiations with their 
parliamentary filibustering methods. Such conduct does not seem 
to me to belong to the mainstream of history. However, it 
cannot be assumed that all countries can succeed in doing that 
which France succeeded in doing, keeping in mind that France has 
in its past someone called De Gaulle, who always did such 
things. For these reasons I believe that Italy -- a country 
that is very superficial on matters of security and defense and 
that will never equip itself with the financial and political 
resources to organize a security based entirely on its own 
management capability -- must be careful not to become isolated. 
Hence the concern with strengthening the framework of 
international organizations. 
  [Bugno] How? 
  [Andreatta] I will give you some examples. We proposed to 
the British that the Central and Eastern European countries be 
admitted to the second and third pillars of the Maastricht 
Treaty, that is, those that concern a common security and 
foreign policy and justice and domestic policing policy. This, 
reversing the old belief that first we should build the economic 
Europe and then the political Europe. This is not possible with 
these countries. This also entails a division of labor, however 
-- leaving to NATO the predominant, though not exclusive, task 
of reassuring the Russian moderates, and to the European Union 
that of providing the intermediate countries with economic, 
political, and institutional relations, providing them with such 
substantive ties as to make it clear even to the most 
expansionist of the Russians that, beyond Belarus and Ukraine, 
there lie territories already integrated into Europe. 
Furthermore, with a view to the NATO summit in Brussels we 
wrote to American Secretary of State Warren Christopher and NATO 
Secretary General Manfred Woerner, notifying them that we would 
be asking that part of the budget resources be reserved for 
financing research into nonlethal weapons to be used in 
peacekeeping operations and for the use of techniques for border 
control and for crime control in guerrilla warfare. We also 
placed emphasis on the issues of security in the Mediterranean; 
in the future it may be possible to offer the countries of the 
Mediterranean some kind of association analogous to the 
Partnership for Peace, the instrument now being used to 
stabilize relations with Eastern Europe. 
  [Bugno] Are these all Italian initiatives? 
  [Andreatta] Yes, but the newspapers do not talk about them 
and the parties are not interested. On no less than two 
occasions in October I was summoned before Parliament just to 
hear the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] criticize me for 
having failed to side with the rebels in the White House in 
Moscow against President Yeltsin. According to the PDS, the 
Italian Government should have corrected its pro-Yeltsin stance, 
shared by all the Western countries, and sided with the old 
Parliament. But nobody asked me to come to discuss the issues 
of the NATO summit. And yet dozens and dozens of people in Rome 
and Brussels, in the embassies, are dealing with these issues 
precisely in order to put forward Italy's viewpoint, what you 
say is the national interest. 
  [Bugno] What conclusion do you draw from this? 
  [Andreatta] As far as the PDS is concerned, the sole 
conclusion is that this party has reached as far as the economic 
and foreign policy lines that have been the constants of the 
past 40 years. I do understand that this could constitute 
so-called "innovation" for the PDS. It certainly is not so for 
the country, and it is not so for me, since I have always 
demanded a balanced budget, and when I was treasury minister I 
used to have to increase the deficit by 1-2 billion lire just to 
make the PCI [Italian Communist Party] -- now the PDS -- happy 
and thus to try to have the finance bill passed. Nor is there 
anything new abut the obvious observation that Eastern Europe 
and Russia are now having to pay for the rebirth of the liberal 
ideal that lay behind the revolutions of 1848 but which never 
prevailed in Russia. 
  [Bugno] You have often drawn a distinction between the 
national interest and the general interest. Why? 
  [Andreatta] The reason for this distinction is that I would 
like to demystify the idea held by some elites that their own 
interests coincide with those of the country. What lies behind 
the writings of some commentators is in fact the same mistake as 
Henry Ford made when he said that Ford's interests were 
America's interests. No, interest is something that has to be 
built politically, in a complex manner, just as the concept of 
the common good is a complex one, too. And in a democracy 
viewpoints can change in time. 
  [Bugno] I must ask you this question. Somalia and Bosnia: 
These are two issues that are prompting much discussion. 
  [Andreatta] Somalia: My position has been to avoid turning a 
technical and military disaster into a rupture with our allies. 
The easiest solution was precisely to raise the flag of 
national interest and, as at Sigonella, to become famous for 15 
minutes and to damage Italy's relations with its own partners 
and with the United Nations. I consider it one of my merits 
that I have succeeded in blocking any suggestions in this 
direction, avoiding encouraging the Italian people's worst 
instincts -- that oscillation between broad internationalism and 
an escape into peevish isolation. We have countered errors 
without challenging the authority of the United Nations. And 
this corresponds to Italy's general interest. 
  [Bugno] What about Bosnia? 
  [Andreatta] None of the warring sides seems to want to stop, 
and the international community, by facilitating supplies, is in 
fact ensuring that matters continue that way indefinitely. And 
yet in December peace seemed to have been achieved. But it is 
the Muslims now who are opposing a division on the basis of 33 
percent to each of the warring sides, as they themselves 
demanded during last year's negotiations on board the 
Invincible, and the danger is that they will no longer obtain 
even that. But you cannot impose the desire for peace on a 
people when each of their components has suffered terrible 
iniquities.

  [Text] Vatican City, Jan 19 (AFP) -- Pope John Paul II on 
Wednesday [19 January] named Nuncio Andrea Cordero Lanza di 
Montezemolo as the Vatican's special representative to Israel, 
following an agreement to normalise relations. 
  Di Montezemolo, 68, is currently apostolic delegate to 
Jerusalem and Jordan and pro-nuncio to Cyprus. 
  Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said last month that the 
appointee would keep his other functions, as representative of 
the Vatican to the local churches, and would reside at the 
Franciscan community at Jaffa, near Tel Aviv. 
  Born in Turin, di Montezemolo is a seasoned Vatican diplomat 
and was one of the drafters of the December 30 agreement with 
Israel. 
  In a reciprocal move, Israel on Wednesday appointed Shmuel 
Hadas as its representative to the Holy See, the Israeli Foreign 
Ministry said. 
  The Vatican had opposed Israel's first choice, Rabbi David 
Rosen, suggesting it preferred a career diplomat for the post. 
  Hadas was born in Argentina in 1931 and emigrated to Israel 
in 1954, settling in the Nir-Am kibbutz, before joining the 
foreign service ten years later. 
  In 1986 he was appointed Israel's first ambassador to Spain. 
Since 1987, he has run the Foreign Ministry's Cultural and 
Scientific Affairs Department, doubling as adviser to Foreign 
Minister Shimon Peres. 
  Israel and the Vatican have agreed to establish diplomatic 
relations at the ambassadorial level within four months of last 
month's accord.

<F P=106> [Article by Sandra Bonsanti: "`The Suspicions Have Put Me in </F>
a Mincing Machine'"] 
  [Text] Francesca: ".... Therefore, Mr. President, we call 
on you to resign." The president: "It would have been easy, 
and in keeping with my character, which is hotblooded in spite 
of my years, to walk out of a job for which I asked no one, for 
which I never lifted a finger, for which my name has never 
figured in any conceivable political listing, slamming the door 
behind me at the first rustlings in the undergrowth! But in my 
conscience I felt it my duty not to walk out for so little, as 
it would have prevented the dissolution of parliament and 
prevented the elections." It would have been easy, but .... 
says Scalfaro: "Look, I found myself in a situation where, for 
reasons that I cannot go into here, they tried everything, at 
the political level, at the personal level, everything to stop 
me signing the dissolution of parliament. They tried 
everything." 
  This denunciation of maneuvers against the early elections 
is 
an unexpected outburst on the president's part in front of the 
teaching staff and students of the Third University of Rome. He 
is replying to the girl who, departing from the initial script 
of an address describing Scalfaro as one of the "role models" 
and examples of steadfastness of which youth today is in such 
great need, replaced this passage with another in which the 
figure of the role model disappears behind that of a president 
who ought to resign ...., immediately creating a political 
furore. Is the head of state offended, is he angry? The 
cabinet, with an excess of zeal bordering on the ridiculous, 
"deplores" the "lamentable" episode that has involved Scalfaro, 
to whom it reaffirms "its gratitude for his valuable work in 
defending our institutions at a sensitive time in the life of 
the republic." Will Francesca be "punished" for her outrageous 
speech? "There is a thirst for truth," she said, "there are 
former state officials, self-confessed criminals, making 
allegations against you, Mr. President, incredible allegations." 
But reason of state must not have its way, and, "We hope that 
you ... will want to see the truth established, as the true 
first citizen of Italy." 
  The audience in the great hall, just officially opened, at 
Rome's latest university is taken aback. Scalfaro rises. "I 
had intended to hold my peace, but .... I will dwell for a 
moment on what Francesca Maresco has so wisely said." 
  And the president speaks, recounting, in his somewhat 
antiquated style, what has been happening over the previous few 
days and weeks. "We need ideals, examples to follow." His story 
is that he has found himself up against people who did 
everything they could to prevent the dissolution of parliament. 
But the president's duty is to respect the will of the people. 
"And the overwhelming majority of voters in the referendum 
imposed a principle that made for a total change in the 
electoral system: total! .... But there were too many interests 
determined to prevent the dissolution of parliament. I took the 
job on," says Scalfaro in vindication of his role, "and I thank 
God that he has allowed me to carry it through. It has not been 
easy, it has not been pleasant to remain at my post." 
  It is an account of a dramatic period in his life at the 
Quirinale, fighting the temptation to resign, and of the 
immunity that seems to be a prerogative that "renders a person 
untouchable but puts him into a mincing machine, preventing him 
from exercising his rights." "Crazy" allegations, against which 
he cannot "yet" defend himself. Not a heroic act, but the 
performance of a duty. 
  The head of state had never before linked the allegations 
made against him by the Sisde [secret service] officers so 
forcibly with the political will to keep the paliamentary term 
going. He had never spoken so directly in public about 
resigning. There are those who see this as a sign: Did he mean 
that he may resign after the elections? There has been no lack 
of maneuvering, even as regards the choice of date. Scalfaro 
explains that he had let it be known as early as Sunday morning 
that he was willing to sign a government decision permitting 
voting on 27 and 28 [March] until 2200. But Rabbi Toaff, 
"probably owing to a misunderstanding," said on the television 
news that "voting on the Monday was of no interest." And this 
issue, too, has been the subject of speculation and protest on 
the part of "an unquantified number of politicians, and I must 
say that some bishops, too, have taken the Old Testament to 
heart with a quite fascinating vehemence." 
  So Francesca's more or less spontaneous words gave Scalfaro 
a 
valuable opportunity, which he seized with both hands, only 
complaining that there had been an element of "underhandedness": 
He would have preferred that the paragraph containing the call 
for his resignation had been in the written version. "I assure 
you I should have been twice as eager to come. At the present 
time, I am surrounded by a small number of straightforward 
people and I do not say a large number, I say too many 
underhanded people."

<F P=106> [Giovanni Valentini report: "Segni: These Are My Ideas To </F>
Win"] 
  [Excerpts] Rome -- Heedful of the proverb "Short reckonings 
make long friendships," [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni 
presented his Pact for Italy platform in Rome yesterday, thus 
virtually opening the electoral campaign and challenging the 
progressive coalition. [passage omitted] 
  Let us look more closely, then, at the Pact's seven 
proposals, as illustrated by Buttiglione and Baldassarri. 
  1. Italy's peace and security. National unity is a basic 
principle that must be upheld against [League secretary] Bossi's 
and [League ideologue] Miglio's separatism. This assertion must 
have been welcomed also by Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta, 
so much so that in his contribution he expressed appreciation 
for this "wait-and-see position" in relation to the League, 
urging the latter to "clarify the boundaries between federalism 
and Italy's federal break-up." 
  2. Reform of the state and of local autonomous governments. 
In order to combat centralism, Segni's movement is proposing to 
strengthen the local autonomous governments. "Autonomy," 
Buttiglioni explained, " means transferring decisionmaking power 
as close as possible to citizens, voters, and taxpayers." 
However, this does not rule out "coordination instruments at 
interregional level." 
  3. Law and order. This means protecting people and their 
property. Apart from continuing to combat organized crime, 
efforts must also be made to combat petty crime, which is 
threatening urban life more directly. 
  4. Tax reform. According to Baldassarri's proposal, tax 
rates should not exceed 40 percent. Sharing the tax burden more 
equitably is one of the platform's objectives. 
  5. Solidarity policy. Until now, this policy has been "false 
and mystifying." It must now strive for efficiency. As regards 
running the services, budget limitations must be complied with, 
and managerial criteria applied. 
  6. Job and employment development. Access to work must 
become more flexible -- for example, by transforming 
unemployment benefits into incentives to become employed. To 
help young people, trainee contracts must be reintroduced, with 
reduced social charges during the first few years. 
  7. Modernizing society. This involves, in the first place, 
developing the south. For Baldassarri, however, the south's 
development "must be understood in terms of the country's 
overall development." For his part, ruling out massive 
subsidies, Segni explained in his contribution that "this policy 
must enable the south to become its own master, and provide for 
itself."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Batyrev] </F>
  [Text] Paris January 20 TASS -- Our present visit to France 
is highly unusual because Georgia is now very much interested in 
establishing new relationships with its partners, and we attach 
great importance to this trip, Georgian leader Eduard 
Shevardnadze told ITAR-TASS upon arriving in France for a 
two-day visit. 
  Georgia became an independent state only recently and quite 
naturally we seek to build our new equitable relations with 
other sovereign states by developing a solid legal framework for 
them, the Georgian leader said about the aim of his visit to 
France. 
  During his two-day visit Shevardnadze will be received by 
French President Francois Mitterrand and sign with him a treaty 
of accord, friendship and cooperation between the two countries, 
as well as sign the Paris Charter for a New Europe. 
  Journalists who met Shevardnadze in Paris pestered him with 
questions about prospects for relations between Georgia and 
Russia. "Directly upon my return home, I will begin preparations 
for a very important event -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 
visit to Tbilisi," Shevardnadze said. Yeltsin's trip to Georgia 
is scheduled for the beginning of February. 
  "We are bound with Russia by many ties, and the Russian 
president's visit to Georgia is a major event in many years of 
our life," Georgian leader said. Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi is 
designed to define relations of friendship and cooperation 
between the two sovereign states. 
  "Georgia is now entering a period of stability after the 
threat on unleashing a large-scale civil war has been 
eliminated", Shevardnadze said. "After we settle the conflict 
with, the man task for us is to ensure the country's normal 
economic development," he said. One of the principal conditions 
needed for progress in this field is Russia's continuous 
democratic evolution. If this evolution is disrupted, most 
unfavourable developments can ensue, Shevardnadze said. 
  Also on Thursday [20 January], Shevardnadze met the leaders 
of two international organisations based in Paris - Federico 
Mayor, Director-general of the United Nations 
Educational,Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and 
Jean Claude Payem, director general of the Organisation for 
Economic Cooperation and Development to discuss prospects for 
the development of relations between Georgia and UNESCO, Georgia 
and OECD. Business cooperation between Georgia and France was 
discussed in headquarters of the National Council of French 
Entrepreneurs.

  [Text] Paris, Jan 20 (AFP) -- Georgia President Eduard 
Shevardnadze called Thursday [20 January] for an international 
inquiry into the the death of his predecessor and rival for 
power Zviad Gamsakhurdia. 
  Shevardnadze, in Paris for a two day official visit, also 
accused members of ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky's 
Liberal Democratic Party of backing the Abkhazian separatist 
movement in western Georgia. 
  The republics of the former Soviet Union faced a double 
danger from "aggressive separatism ... and a resurgence of 
fascism," Shevardnadze added. 
  Gamsakhurdia's family, who announced his suicide at the 
start 
of the year, has opposed an inquiry. They are currently seeking 
to have the former president's body transferred from eastern 
Georgia to Abkhazia. 
  Shevardnadze, a former Soviet foreign minister, heaped 
praise 
on Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  In Russia there was "no alternative" to Yeltsin who 
displayed 
heroism in crushing last October's parliamentary rebellion and 
in withstanding the August 1991 coup during the last months of 
the Soviet Union, he told a press conference. 
  New Russian friendship and troops last year helped 
Shevardnadze defeat Gamsakhurdia's rebels as they staged an 
insurgency in western Georgia in a bid to bring the ousted 
leader back to power. 
  Yeltsin is expected to seal the warmer relationship between 
Tbilisi and Moscow and discuss energy and a range of bilateral 
economic issues on a visit to Georgia next month. 
  Shevardnadze stressed that Russian help was a key to solving 
the separatist rebellion in Abkhazia. Russian interests would 
not be served by a victory for the separatists which would 
boomerang against Moscow, he added. 
  In a separate meeting with French business leaders, 
Shevardnadze said France could make a great contribution to 
exploiting his country's assets and pulling it out of a 
catastrophic recession. French investment in Georgia is 
currently almost non-existent. 
  The Georgian leader is looking to stimulate French interest 
by gaining support from French Industry Minister Edmond 
Alphandery, whom he meets Friday, in measures to overcome 
investment obstacles. 
  Georgia is in a "stabilisation phase," said Shevardnadze. 
"The threat of civil war is disappearing." 
  Economic reform would continue in spite of past errors such 
as the privatisation of land and the hasty departure from the 
rouble zone, he said. 
  Industrial production in Georgia is in free fall with an 
average decline of around 15 percent a month. Annual inflation 
stands at 1,500 percent per year and the budget deficit has 
reached around 80 per cent of gross national product. That 
figure is likely to rocket further with levels of government 
spending four times higher than receipts. 
  Industry, responsible for around 46 per cent of the 
country's 
wealth, is working at less than a third of capacity because of 
energy shortages. Georgia is heavily reliant on Russia for its 
energy needs.

  [Text] Paris, Jan 20 (AFP) -- Norwegian Prime Minister Gro 
Harlem Brundtland discussed Norway's bid to join the European 
Community during a meeting with French President Francois 
Mitterrand on Thursday [20 January]. 
  In a half-hour meeting with Mitterrand, Brundtland stressed 
the need to find solutions to problems brought up in 
negotiations over Norway's possible membership in the EC. 
  Addressing European Parliament deputies in Strasbourg 
earlier 
Thursday, Brundtland said negotiations over the expansion of the 
EC could be concluded by March 1. 
  "This is an ambitious target, but if the political will is 
there, it is feasible," she said. 
  The main obstacles to Norway's EC membership remain 
agriculture and fishing, the prime minister said. 
  As for agriculture, Norway is seeking "some special 
arrangements adapted to our climate and topographic situation," 
Brundtland said. 
  Oslo is also requesting "creative reflection" to solve the 
problem of the management of northern Norwegian fishing areas, 
she added. 
  "So far we have achieved encouraging results related to 
energy and also regarding environmental standards. We have also 
met a constructive approach to regional policy," she said. 
  The EC has fixed February 28 as the deadline for concluding 
negotiations on EC membership with Norway, Austria, Finland and 
Sweden, so that these countries may join the community in early 
1995. 
  Speaking in Strasbourg Wednesday, Greek European Affairs 
Minister Theodoros Pangalos, whose country currently holds the 
rotating EC presidency, did not rule out that this deadline 
could be extended.

  [Text] Bayonne, France, Jan 21 (AFP) -- France has 
extradited a suspected ETA Basque separatist to Spain, where he 
is wanted for allegedly participating in five terrorist attacks 
which killed 12 people, a judicial official said here Friday [21 
January]. 
  Felix Ramon Gil Ostaoga, alias Zaldi, is the first suspected 
ETA separatist extradited by France this year and the 25th since 
1984, the official said. 
  Originally from Legazpi in Spain's Guipuzcoa Province, 
Ostaoga, 35, has been living in France since 1983. 
  He was detained by French police on October 24, 1989 in 
Ciboure, southwestern France. Spanish authorities have since 
made several extradition requests for him. 
  Spain has charged Ostaoga with participating in five 
terrorist attacks in 1978 and 1979, as part of the Urola 
commando which is active in Guipuzcoa province. Ten civil 
guardsmen, one policeman and the mayor of Olaberria were killed 
and four other people were seriously wounded in these attacks. 
  Ostoaga arrived in Madrid late Thursday afternoon on a 
regular Air France flight and was immediately handed over to the 
Audencia Nacional anti-terrorist authorities, a Spanish judicial 
official said.

<F P=106> [Report signed S.R.: "Government Cautious About Recovery"] </F>
  [Text] Discretion was the word of the day yesterday in 
government circles, following the meeting of an 
"interministerial committee" devoted to economic policy and to 
possible supplementary measures for reviving the economy. 
  Officially, Edouard Balladur and three of his ministers made 
a wide-ranging "survey" of the country's situation for more than 
an hour, thus making it possible to confirm "the encouraging 
prospects of the economy," said Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy. 
"We did not adopt anything," summed up tersely another 
participant at the committee meeting, Alain Madelin, the 
minister in charge of businesses. 
  So, for now, the government is sticking by its projected 
growth figure of 1.4 percent for this year and is awaiting the 
full effect of recovery actions taken since its arrival in power 
in March 1993. [Economy Minister] Edmond Alphandery repeated 
this yesterday: "We agreed to say that nothing justified 
calling into question the government's economic scenario for 
1994." 
<H5>  Choices To Be Made Known on 3 February </H5>
  The economic minister once again left the door open to 
measures for encouraging consumption. "More specifically, we 
will see what can be done within a few days, when the figures 
for the end of 1993 and January show are released and when we 
know what the sales and Christmas period [le blanc] yielded," he 
said without further clarification. It is true that too much 
talk of possible supplementary recovery instruments, "just in 
case," could end up having the opposite effect to the one 
desired: Consumers might hold off their purchases while 
awaiting new incentives. The short statement made by Edmond 
Alphandery two weeks ago about possible measures to boost the 
automotive industry put the government and the manufacturers in 
a awkward situation. 
  Yesterday's meeting was the first in a series of three 
"interministerial committees" organized by Edouard Balladur to 
redefine the government's economic and social strategy. A 
second committee meeting on social security issues is planned 
for today, while the third -- which is to concentrate on 
employment -- is scheduled for next Tuesday [25 January]. 
  The work will be summarized during a government seminar on 3 
February, at which time the prime minister will make his choices 
known, i.e., with regard to the essential recovery of the 
economy and the reduction of social security deficits. 
  In the meantime, the entourage of ministers is putting the 
emphasis on the last survey from the Bank of France, which notes 
a slight improvement in the economic prospects of business 
leaders. 
  Yesterday, another indicator heartened the economic analysts 
at Bercy [Finance Ministry]: Industrial production rose in 
November, even though it has been dropping continuously since 
summer. It rose by 0.6 percent compared to October, using data 
corrected for seasonal variations.

<F P=106> [Article by Eric Zemmour: "Balladur, or the Art of </F>
Weathering a Self-Inflicted Controversy"] 
  [Text] The prime minister should not suffer too much from 
the new political situation, even though all observers agree 
that, for the first time, he has made a mistake. There are even 
indications that he may end up in a better position for the 
presidential election. 
  Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators having taken to the 
streets clamoring for [Education Minister] Bayrou's resignation; 
a piece of legislation hastily shoved into a closet... The 
analogy between Alain Devaquet and Francois Bayrou does no go 
beyond this point. First of all, because the political climate 
is not the same; because the demonstration on Sunday [16 
January], although impressive, remained good-natured; because 
the Socialist leaders shrewdly downplayed its political 
significance in order to reap larger benefits; and because -- 
with the exception of Patrick Devedjian [Rally for the Republic, 
RPR, MP], who wondered aloud whether Mr. Bayrou might resign 
from his position as National Education minister -- the majority 
remained united, whatever it may have to say privately about Mr. 
Bayrou's method and mistakes. And there was no Malik Oussekine! 
In any case, Francois Bayrou did not flinch. "He who is prone 
to being seasick, should not be a sailor," was his rather 
gallant answer. And he accepted Michel Rocard's proposal to call 
for a national forum on education, which he prefers to call 
"assizes," in order to have everyone concerned talk about the 
future of the educational system. 
  It is clear, however, that in the negotiations that begin at 
rue de Grenelle [Education Ministry] today, the minister is in a 
weaker position in front of teachers' unions, which he rather 
hastily considered to be ruined by their schism. With a view to 
next week's roundtable at Matignon [prime minister's office], 
the unions already have been asking for a five-year programming 
law. Money, always more money... In such a context, Francois 
Bayrou will be hard put to push forward his pet project: the 
reform of the single college... 
  Furthermore, there is no definite indication that Edouard 
Balladur would have given him the go-ahead. One will remember 
that the Devaquet affair had terminally bogged down the Chirac 
government's reform machinery, which had previously been going 
full speed ahead. Comparing Balladur's current policy with 
Chirac's boils down to comparing a waltz to hard rock. And yet, 
with the attempted revision of the Falloux Act, Balladur had 
indulged a little, so as to satisfy both his more conservative 
electors and the majority leaders who never failed to remind him 
of this electoral promise. The fact that Edouard Balladur made 
the final decision to revise the Falloux Act on the very day the 
GATT agreement was signed is no coincidence. It may be due to a 
kind of euphoria, as Raymond Barre puts it. 
  One may be assured that the prime minister will not twice 
let 
himself be blinded by pride. And that he will even find in his 
disappointment an additional reason to hold on to his certainty 
-- repeated over and over -- that in the excessively fragile 
French society, where passions may flare up at any time, any 
reform must be slow, explained, and accepted by all. 
  This will inevitably make it more difficult to reform the 
social security system, a task the government has been getting 
ready to tackle. After Sunday's demonstration, one may wonder 
under which shape Balladur -- who no doubt remembers the 
disastrous impact of the 1987 Seguin reform -- will let it come 
out. 
  Concurrently, Balladur is taking other, more political 
risks. 
His consensus-oriented policy, based on negotiation, expert 
consultations, and snail-paced reform, will increase the 
impatience of those who, at the UDF [Union for French Democracy] 
and the RPR, already charge him with being "Rocardized." In 
addition, the failed attempt to revise the Falloux Act gives 
Jacques Chirac new ammunition when he claims, much to Edouard 
Balladur's irritation, that real change can only take place 
after the 1995 presidential election. 
<H5>  First Ballot </H5>
  A presidential election for which Balladur's mistake has not 
disqualified him, however -- another major difference with the 
Devaquet affair. The prime minister, as usual, has made sure he 
stood on safe ground, even though he did appear on TF1 [TV 
network] to defend the government position. It is worth noting 
that the demonstrators were asking for the resignation of 
Bayrou, not Balladur. The most recent opinion polls indicate 
that his fight with a newly combative left has increased his 
influence within the RPR electorate. 
  And according to a Sofres poll to be released today, he 
would 
win a presidential election in the first round of voting! This 
is what a UDF elected representative calls the "Balladur 
mystery." 
  And this mystery is not about to fade away. Indeed, as 
Balladur watchers have pointed out, should [Socialist Party 
Secretary General] Michel Rocard's chances in the presidential 
race improve, thanks to the mobilization of the left in favor of 
anticlerical values, the majority would be constrained to unite 
behind a single candidate. 
  In other words, an RPR candidate who is not only accepted 
but 
happily backed by the UDF: Edouard Balladur. On the other 
hand, Chirac supporters would rather consider that the rebirth 
of the left is bound to deflate Balladur's popularity ratings 
due to his image, which is much more consensual than Chirac's. 
Provided the current crisis -- which brings back the 
traditional left-right rift within French society -- does not 
provide Edouard Balladur with the party leader profile he 
absolutely needs in order to become a genuine presidential 
candidate instead of a mere politician with stellar opinion 
ratings, not unlike [Social Affairs Minister] Simone Veil, for 
example. Should this happen, the mystery would deepen further 
still...

<F P=106> [Jacques Fleury report: "Mitterrand Remonstrates With </F>
Government"] 
  [Excerpt] The impressive procession which crossed Paris on 
Sunday [16 January] to defend state schools is still prompting 
reaction in political circles. At the cabinet meeting, Edouard 
Balladur once again tried appeasement confirming, that he would 
meet with the trade unions and parents federations on 27 
January. But Francois Mitterrand seized the opportunity to 
rebuke the government, a government that was also the subject of 
criticism in majority ranks. 
  Francois Mitterrand readily played the role of professor of 
applied politics to the government gathered for the cabinet 
meeting. Boosted by the success of Sunday's demonstration, he 
carefully lectured the "national education minister" who thought 
he could disregard the French people's convictions. The head of 
state took great pleasure in reaffirming the reservations which 
he expressed when the Falloux bill was presented to him. By 
refusing to include the continuation of the debate in the 
extraordinary session of Parliament, he had hoped, he explained, 
that the government would consider the consequences of such a 
law. But the "national education minister" preferred to fan the 
flames of an education war. The French people have answered him. 
  This presidential rebuke was aimed at the government in 
general and the prime minister in particular. This is the first 
time since the start of cohabitation that Mitterrand has been 
able to give the representatives of the new majority a good 
"telling off" in this way. He did not waste such a golden 
opportunity. Nobody replied to his cutting statement. 
Moreover, there was nothing else to say because the prime 
minister himself had previously drawn the necessary conclusions 
from this demonstration. 
  It was a demonstration which, according to Edouard Balladur, 
"was a large-scale mobilization and bore the stamp of the 
anxiety which has been displayed with regard to state education. 
The government has acted accordingly," because consultation has 
begun with the trade unions and parents federations. [passage

  [Text] Paris, Jan 20 (AFP) -- The French Alcatel 
telecommunications group has set up two joint venture companies 
in China with the Chinese Telecommunications Ministry in Beijing 
and Chengdu, the company said on Thursday [20 January]. 
  Alcatel China and the ministry would have equal shares in 
the 
companies set up to work on equipment for transmission by 
Hertzian wave and by cable. 
  The first of these, called Alcatel of Beijing Transmission 
Systems, would produce and distribute Hertzian transmission 
equipment and portable equipment of the same type for the 
Chinese market. 
  The second, Alcatel of Chengdu Communication Systems, would 
produce and distribute cable transmission equipment for the 
Chinese market. 
  The Chinese market in these sectors is believed to be worth 
one billion dollars during the next five years, Alcatel said. 
  The Chinese telecommunications infrastructure grew by 40 
percent between 1992 and 1993, the company said. 
  Alcatel is a leader on the Chinese market for digital 
transmission equipment, holding 50 percent of the market. 
  France and China put their relations on a normal footing on 
January 12 following a period of tension which ended with a 
decision by France to cease selling weaponry to Taiwan.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis stressed that a 
pannational conference is necessary for long-term planning to 
handle such an important national issue as the Cyprus problem. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Thessaloniki at noon today, 
Kliridhis added that in the course of the Cyprus issue we should 
have set short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals, as the 
Turkish side has done, regardless of the government. He added: 
Turkey is following this policy, and is now working toward 
recognition of the pseudostate. It later will aim at 
partitioning and possibly occupying all of Cyprus. 
  The president said he will meet Greek Defense Minister 
Yerasimos Arsenis tomorrow to discuss the common defense area. 
He stressed: It will be easy for the Turks to advance in 
Cyprus if there is no joint strategic defense plan. 
  Answering a question on the new tour of Joe Clark, the UN 
secretary general's special representative in Cyprus who is 
expected in Cyprus tomorrow, Kliridhis said Clark's goal is to 
determine whether the Turkish side accepts the UN secretary 
general's proposal on Varosha and Nicosia Airport. He added: 
The Turkish side has not accepted the UN secretary general's 
proposals. If the statements that appeared in the press are 
true, then my evaluation of their position is unchanged. 
  Answering another question, Kliridhis replied that he will 
accept nothing less than the return of Famagusta's fenced-off 
area and that he will attempt to change Butrus-Ghali's map 
during the talks. 
  The president said those who can change Turkish policy on 
the 
Cyprus issue are: the United States, the UN Security Council, 
and Europe. He stressed that, according to the latest 
indications and for some serious reasons that he knows but does 
not want to publicize now, for the first time these forces are 
pressuring Turkey that the status quo cannot continue and that a 
Cyprus solution must be found.

Turkish Cypriot side has agreed to discuss the 
confidence-building measures without making any concessions on 
the principles it has defended so far. 
  The Council of Ministers met under President Denktas at 0900 
today. Upon emerging from the meeting at 1130, the president 
said the Council of Ministers discussed the confidence-building 
measures and reached a decision which will be conveyed to the UN 
secretary general. Denktas pointed out that after the decision 
is conveyed to Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, the necessary 
announcement will be made to the public. 
  In turn, Prime Minister Hakki Atun said the experts will 
continue to study the confidence-building measures. He added 
that work on these measures will be conducted in cooperation 
with President Denktas and the Turkish Republic. The Republican 
Assembly and the other parties will be briefed on the issue, he 
said, adding: The issue will be conducted in unity, taking into 
consideration the interests of the community and the state. 
  The Council of Ministers meeting continued under Prime 
Minister Atun after Denktas left it. The meeting is still in 
session.

  [Text] Douglas Hurd, British secretary of state for 
foreign and Commonwealth affairs, who is currently in Ankara on 
a working visit, has proposed that Turkey should suggest 
practical steps to develop relations with Europe rather than a 
schedule for membership in the European Union. 
  Addressing the Turkish Scientific and Technical Research 
Institute, Hurd remarked that Turkey is becoming increasingly 
closer to Europe. He noted that ways to advance this process 
will be explored during the talks in Ankara. Hurd explained 
that this process will be accelerated if Turkey resolves its 
economic problems such as high inflation and the budget deficit 
as soon as possible. Noting further that Turkey has great 
knowledge and experience concerning its geographical region, 
Hurd declared that Britain understands the struggle waged 
against terrorism and believes that this problem will be 
surmounted within the framework of democracy.

<F P=106> [Interview with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by </F>
unidentified correspondent in Ankara; from the "Morning 
Interview" program--live] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] At the moment, the British Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd is in the Turkish capital, Ankara, with 
his German counterpart, Klaus Kinkel. I now welcome the German 
foreign minister. Good morning. 
  [Kinkel] Good morning, Mr. (?Wiese). 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Kinkel, this German-British-Turkish 
grouping seems unusual. How did it come about? 
  [Kinkel] The fact is that Turkey is of great strategic, 
political, and cultural importance for us, particularly after 
the end of the East-West conflict on a bilateral level, but also 
with regard to Europe as a whole. It has a new function as a 
bridge on the frontier between Europe and Asia, between 
Christianity and Islam. It was my idea at the last 
German-British talks that we should attempt, in trilateral talks 
with Britain, to involve Turkey in this role in a stronger 
dialogue with the European countries. This is why we are here 
-- Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, and I. Why the 
two of us? Why Great Britain and Germany? Because we have 
roughly the same approach with regard to Turkey. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Kinkel, Turkey is regarded as an 
important regional power in relation to the surrounding areas of 
unrest, which I mentioned in my introduction. In connection 
with this, many people follow your talks with Turkish Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin with particular attention. 
  [Kinkel] Well, I have just said that this bridge function -- 
the frontier position of Turkey to Asia and to the Balkans -- is 
extraordinarily important in the region. One must see that 
Turkey already has relatively strong links with Europe and with 
the OECD. It has an association that has not yet been ratified, 
but will be, with the WEU [West European Union]. It is 
associated with the EU and also maintains close cooperation, 
above all, within the CSCE. The CSCE is of considerable 
importance in the areas of change here in this region. 
Therefore, we will discuss, in particular, the situation in 
areas where the Islamic component has gained greater importance 
than it had before due to the changes. 
  [Correspondent] You mentioned Turkey's association with the 
WEU and the EU [European Union]. The Turkish side thinks that 
is not enough. Will the end of this development be formal 
Turkish membership in the WEU and the EU? After all, this is 
what Turkey really wants. 
  [Kinkel] Yes, that is perfectly clear. Naturally, Turkey is 
at the moment not satisfied with its current links with the EU 
and the WEU, because so far it has only associate membership. We 
have -- and I can say this for Great Britain as well as for us 
-- we have always strongly supported Turkey's full membership in 
the European Union. Formal WEU membership is only legally 
possible if one is already an EU member. So, Turkey can only 
have associate membership in the WEU at the moment. Our talks 
are also intended, however, to bring Turkey -- with its 
important function as an important NATO partner -- even closer 
to Europe. 
  [Correspondent] Clearly, once again: Does the German 
Federal Government support full Turkish membership in the EU as 
well as--as a consequence of this--in the WEU? 
  [Kinkel] Certainly we do. It is only a matter of time. We 
are not alone in this wish, but we also do not decide this 
alone. Naturally, Turkey must fulfill certain preconditions. 
These include, for instance, an improvement of the human rights 
situation. This is something that we will, of course, raise here 
as well, something I have always raised with our Turkish friends. 
  [Correspondent] You have given me a clue, Mr. Kinkel. Turkey 
has been seen not exactly as a bastion of human rights. Its 
policy toward the Kurdish minority, in particular, is being 
criticized strongly. What will you tell your Turkish 
counterpart in connection with this? 
  [Kinkel] Douglas Hurd and I will tell our Turkish 
partners--the prime minister and the president, whom we will 
also meet--clearly and unambiguously that Turkey must, of 
course, play its part in this respect. It must solve its 
internal problems. There is the difficult problem of PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorism. We understand it has to 
be fought, but we point out urgently that this must be done by 
means that are compatible with the rule of law. There are the 
continuing problems with the Christians in the southeast. There 
is the Kurdish problem in general. There are also human rights 
abuses in police custody. My approach has always been and will 
continue to be to remind Turkey from a friendly position to 
respect human rights--from a friendly position--while at the 
same time stating very clearly where the journey will have to 
take us in this respect. 
  [Correspondent] Do you believe the persecution and the fight 
against the PKK is currently not being conducted in a lawful way? 
  [Kinkel] I cannot say anything generally, but there are 
indications again and again that there are problems with this. 
We have our own problems in our country. You know that I have 
always very strongly urged a ban on the PKK in Germany. The 
Turks are grateful for this now. Naturally, we have every 
reason -- after Moelln and Solingen -- to say clearly that we 
too, in our own country, want to and must meet the 
responsibility of ensuring the welfare of the 1.9 million 
Turkish fellow citizens. We also have a specific need to 
explain what is happening in our own country. We must 
acknowledge this clearly. 
  [Correspondent] As a NATO partner, Turkey receives large 
quantities of weapons, not least from Germany. There are 
repeated reports that these weapons are being used by Turkish 
Government troops in their fight against the PKK as well as 
against civilians. How do you ensure that this does not happen? 
  [Kinkel] I cannot ensure this. In all my discussions, 
however -- and I have a very amicable relationship with Mr. 
Cetin, who is a Kurd himself -- I have repeatedly stressed that 
it is wholly unthinkable that weapons coming from us, in 
particular former GDR Army weapons, are used against the Kurds. 
The Turks have assured us that everything is being done to make 
sure this does not happen, but I cannot check every individual 
case. I have to rely on their pledges, but it is something I 
have to constantly remind them about. I will do so again today. 
  [Correspondent] Germany is supporting genocide with the 
weapons it supplies, according to [Remzi] Kartal, the deputy 
chairman of the Democracy Party who is also a member of 
parliament in Ankara. Do you accept this argument? 
  [Kinkel] No. I really do not think one can say that. I 
mean, on the one hand, you have to see that Turkey is a crucial 
pillar of NATO, working closely with us in the overall security 
system. For this reason, it simply has to have these weapons 
deliveries. There is no question about it. With regard to the 
other component -- as I said a moment ago, and I repeat the 
point -- we do everything to urge the Turks to ensure that 
eventualities do not arise that we do not want, that we do not 
tolerate, but that we probably cannot prevent in every 
individual case. In spite of this, I say again that I will 
touch on this point clearly during my talks as well as publicly 
during my news conference. 
  [Correspondent] What do you think in this context about the 
demand made by human rights organizations as well as Alliance 
90/Greens that economic, arms, and intelligence cooperation with 
Turkey be stopped unless the situation in Kurdistan, with the 
fight against the Kurds, changes. 
  [Kinkel] Well, it is fair to say that the situation in 
southeastern Turkey is not good at the moment. Unfortunately, 
it looks as if there are problems above and beyond the 10 
provinces where there is a state of emergency. However, it will 
not be possible, and I do not think it would be right to stop 
cooperation with Turkey in these areas as a whole. 
  I repeat, Turkey is our NATO partner. We have had friendly 
ties with this country for a long, long time, although this 
cannot stop us from clearly telling each other in an amicable 
way what we think of each other and where there has to be 
change. I have to repeat that we ourselves have every reason to 
explain certain things to Turkey in light of recent extreme 
right-wing violence in Germany. You always have to see these 
things calmly and in a balanced way. You can rest assured, 
however, that I, as German foreign minister, have always raised 
the points you mentioned in terms of human rights, and I will 
raise them again today--clearly and plainly. 
  [Correspondent] This also means that the Federal Border 
Guard 
unit GSG-9 will train special Turkish units to fight against the 
Kurds. Can you confirm this? 
  [Kinkel] I cannot confirm that. I do not know the answer to 
that, so I am unable to give a response. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Kinkel, regarding all the issues we have 
just discussed, particularly the question of human rights, are 
you in full agreement with your British counterpart Hurd? Will 
you be pulling in the same direction during your meeting with 
the Turks? 
  [Kinkel] Of course. We have had these trilateral 
consultations prepared by our political directors; that is point 
A. Point B is that we have had the chance to discuss this with 
each other constantly in Brussels and Luxembourg. We see that 
we are pulling in the same direction. Half an hour ago, I spoke 
to Douglas Hurd by telephone to harmonize our approach once 
again, and we also discussed these points. There is not the 
slightest difference in the British and German positions. 
  [Correspondent] One final question. Will you, as demanded by 
Alliance 90/Greens, take up the case of the Kurdish family that 
is alleged to have disappeared in Turkey since they were 
deported from Germany about two weeks ago? 
  [Kinkel] Yes, I shall raise this point. I have a host of 
individual items on my list, as well as points from Amnesty 
International. I have a number of items on my agenda, 
particularly with regard to the persecution of Christians. We 
have to discuss these issues clearly and plainly. There is no 
reason to duck or to avoid anything. I have to repeat, however, 
that the aim of our visit here is, of course, to give Turkey 
credit for the role it has played since the end of the East-West 
conflict, to support it, and to help it move closer to Europe. 
That is the main reason for our talks here, but other issues 
will feature as well.

  [Excerpts] The tripartite consultative meeting of the 
foreign ministers of Turkey, Britain and Germany was held in 
Ankara today. At the meeting, all participants agreed that 
Turkey -- as a European country -- needs to get closer to the 
continent's political, economic, security and defense structure. 
  The British and German foreign ministers met at the Foreign 
Ministry this morning. The talks continued over luncheon as 
well. [passage omitted] 
  Foreign Ministers Hikmet Cetin, Hurd, and Kinkel held a 
joint 
news conference after the tripartite meeting. 
  Cetin said furthering bilateral relations was discussed and 
views were exchanged on international and regional issues at 
this first meeting, which is part of the consultative mechanisms 
that have been set up. He added all participants shared the 
view that Turkey -- as a European country -- needs to get closer 
to the continent's political, economic, security and defense 
structure. The post-cold war reality was discussed and Cetin 
added that they have realized that the initial optimistic 
expectations have not materialized. He continued: 
  [Begin Cetin recording] The most prominent examples are the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the Balkans and the problems 
between Azerbaijan and Armenia in the Caucasus. We, therefore, 
assessed the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the developments in 
the Balkans. We assessed what we can do to solve the problems 
in the Caucasus and the problems between Azerbaijan and Armenia. 
We assessed how Armenia can withdraw from Azerbaijani territory 
and the problem can be solved through peaceful means as soon as 
possible. We further assessed that this problem should be 
solved within the framework of the Minsk group. [end recording] 
  Cetin said Turkey is fighting against terror within the 
framework of democracy and the laws, adding that the visiting 
ministers were told of Turkey's determination on the issue. He 
noted that Turkey is at a turning point in its struggle against 
terror and that the support to be extended by its European 
friends is most important. 
  Speaking at the news conference, Hurd said Turkey's 
importance and role in the international arena has increased in 
recent years. Noting that Turkey has significant experience in 
the region, Hurd added that they found the opportunity to 
benefit from this experience during the talks. He noted that 
Turkey's political, economic and security relations with Europe 
were discussed at the talks, stressing that a rapprochement 
among the policies of the participants was achieved. 
  Kinkel said Turkey constitutes a bridge between Europe and 
Asia and the Christian and Muslim worlds. Pointing out that 
this role increases the importance of the rapprochement between 
Turkey and Europe, Kinkel added that his country is extending 
every possible support on the issue. 
  In reply to a question by a Turkish Radio and Television 
correspondent on establishing an independent state in northern 
Iraq, Kinkel said: We do not want any change in the region. We 
are not in favor of border changes. We are in favor of Iraq's 
territorial integrity and the preservation of the current border.

  [Text] It has now been learned that a top secret agreement 
was signed between the Turkish Republic and the Syrian Arab 
Republic on 1 December. The 15-point agreement mostly deals 
with security issues. The second article of the agreement, 
which provides for "joint operations against terrorism," 
stipulates that "Syria's water needs will be met without 
restrictions." With this agreement, which stipulates that in 
the talks with Israel and the United States, Turkey will speak 
out in defense of Syria; the Syrian Government consents to 
Turkey carrying out cross-border operations on its territory. 
  The Foreign Ministry sources reported that, in addition to 
the security agreement, three separate complementary agreements 
were also signed at close intervals. 
  The signatures of the foreign ministers of the two countries 
are on the agreement. It was reported that Syrian Foreign 
Minister Faruq al-Shar' and Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin signed the agreement through senior ambassadors. The 
Foreign Ministry sources explained: "Such agreements of utmost 
secrecy could, in exceptional cases, be signed by the sides even 
without a meeting of the foreign ministers by simply calling 
each other's ambassadors to the Foreign Ministry." 
  The agreement was initialed soon after the secret protocol 
signed in Ankara on 20 November by General Badr al-Hasan, the 
commander of the Syrian Secret Service, al-Mukhabarat, and 
Mehmet Agar, head of Security Directorate. 
  It was learned that the following were the main topics of 
the 
agreement: 
<H5>  Joint Stance on Kurdish Problem </H5>
  1. Cooperation shall urgently be forged between the two 
countries. 
  2. The parties shall fulfill the commitments indicated in 
the agreements. The Turkish Republic shall meet Syria's water 
needs, one of Syria's urgent requests, without restrictions. 
  3. Turkey and Syria shall act jointly on the Kurdish 
problem. 
  4. There shall be cooperation against destructive activities 
threatening the national unity and regimes in both countries. 
  5. Turkey and Syria share the same view on Iraq's 
territorial integrity and the unalterability of its borders. 
  6. Turkey shall provide the utmost support to Syria against 
anti-Syrian initiatives in international forums. 
  7. Turkey shall defend Syria's policies on contentious 
issues between Syria and Israel vis-a-vis the United States and 
Israel. 
  8. Turkey shall support Syria's policies on the Lebanese 
problem. 
  9. The Syrian Government shall help the Turkish Government 
prevent destructive activities against Turkey on Syria's own 
territory and in northern Lebanon. Both sides reject terrorism 
and agree not to interfere in each other's internal affairs. 
Syria shall support any operation to eliminate bases belonging 
to the illegal organizations in Syria's northern border region 
and in al-Biqa'. Syria shall allow military operations against 
the Kurdish settlements on the Turkish-Syrian border, provided 
that it is informed beforehand. 
  10. The sides shall abide by the agreement on the 
extradition 
of criminals. 
  11. In its statements regarding Syria, Turkey shall use 
language compatible with friendship and fraternity. 
  12. The implementation of the provisions of this agreement 
shall be realized through cooperation and correspondence between 
the military organizations of the two countries. Cooperation 
will be ensured on the border region by special methods. 
  13. The agreements concluded between the foreign and 
interior 
ministers and military organs will be submitted to the heads of 
state and government of both countries. 
  It was learned that Articles 14 and 15 of the agreement 
covered matters pertaining to the level and maintenance of the 
secrecy of the agreement and ways to resolve disagreements.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Sami Kohen: "All Right, But a Disadvantage </F>
Exists" -- punctuation as published] 
  [Text] As far as Turkey is concerned, President Clinton's 
decision to include the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] problem 
in his talks with President Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva and to urge 
Syria to adopt a clear approach on that terrorist organization 
is a favorable development. The matter indicates that Ankara's 
contacts with Washington and the views Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller conveyed to President Clinton when they met some time ago 
have been effective. It is meaningful that President Clinton 
placed the PKK at the top of the list of terrorist organizations 
during the joint news conference he held with his Syrian 
counterpart. 
  President Clinton's initiative has not yet yielded concrete 
results, however. As he himself has said, the United States and 
Syria continue to differ on the activities of organizations such 
as the PKK and Hizballah. So, Syria has continued to remain on 
the U.S. list of terrorist countries. Nevertheless, Clinton and 
al-Asad have decided to establish a mechanism to remove their 
differences of opinion. The U.S. secretary of state and the 
Syrian foreign minister will hold talks on the matter from time 
to time. 
  President al-Asad, who has successfully played on the Middle 
East chessboard for 25 years, obviously intends to use his pawns 
slowly and very carefully. He has apparently scored favorable 
points in his lengthy meeting with President Clinton on the 
question of peace in the Middle East.... 
  President Clinton's talks with President al-Asad on the PKK 
problem and the support he has given to the Turkish viewpoint on 
the matter are undoubtedly an advantage for Turkey. That the 
U.S. suggestions or pressure have not yet yielded results must 
not be taken to mean that they will not be effective in the 
future. 
  Nevertheless, the other side of the coin also has to be 
considered. President Clinton and President al-Asad held talks 
on the PKK problem within the framework of the effort that is 
being made to establish peace in the Middle East. One aspect of 
the problem between Syria and Israel is terrorism. As far as 
Israel is concerned, one of the preconditions for peace is that 
Syria end its support of the activities of Hizballah and other 
organizations in the occupied areas, southern Lebanon, and even 
in Israel itself. In view of the fact that Clinton also 
supports that view, he allocated a significant part of his 
meeting with al-Asad to the "question of terrorism." That is 
how the PKK problem was discussed by the two presidents... 
However, that placed the PKK's terrorist activities in Turkey 
within the wide-ranging and complex context of the Middle East 
problem. In other words, the problem has gained an 
international aspect. 
  As we have already mentioned, the advantage in that is that 
Syria has come under international pressure, particularly from a 
superpower like the United States. The disadvantage, however, 
is the possibility that the matter may become a part of the 
Middle East problem in the long run. In return for the steps he 
may be asked to take in the future, President al-Asad may ask 
for more serious concessions. To enhance his position, he may 
link that matter to the other terrorist organizations or even to 
regional problems such as the question of transnational water. 
In other words, he may strengthen his bargaining position. In 
view of that, although President Clinton's move to draw 
al-Asad's attention to the PKK problem is a favorable 
development, care should be taken to prevent the matter from 
becoming an international issue. The new aspect of the problem 
must not overshadow the dialogue between Turkey and Syria and 
the effort made to have it resolved through direct talks. 
  We shall discuss in another commentary the effect the 
rendezvous in Geneva will have on the efforts being made to 
establish peace in the Middle East and the rapprochement between 
Israel and the Arab countries. 
  As far as President Clinton's talks with President al-Asad 
on 
terrorism are concerned, we are convinced the latter has gained 
strength and esteem in Geneva. Syria found itself in a state of 
isolation after the Soviet Union collapsed and the PLO signed an 
agreement with Israel. Obviously, the United States is the only 
country that can provide the foreign support Damascus now needs. 
President al-Asad, who is 63, is aware of that state of 
affairs. Meanwhile, Washington is convinced Syria is a key 
country in the Middle East and that true peace cannot be 
achieved in the region without it. 
  The Geneva meeting took place when the two countries 
realized 
that a rapprochement had to be established. It is a fact that 
President al-Asad, who regards himself as a leader who cannot be 
ignored in the region, has gained from his talks in Geneva and 
become stronger. That will give him an opportunity to feel more 
relaxed when playing his cards on various issues, including the 
PKK problem.

  [Excerpt] Addressing a lesson on international relations at 
the Ground War School during a tour of the school today, 
President Suleyman Demirel noted that the civilized world today, 
at least in theory, rejects using force to solve problems. 
Despite this, Demirel remarked, there are incidents in 
Yugoslavia and the Caucasus. Extreme nationalism, racism, 
sectarianism, and xenophobia lie at the base of this problem, 
the president explained. 
  Pointing out that there are 3,000 different languages and 
179 
countries in the world today, Demirel continued: 
  [Begin Demirel recording] If every different ethnic group 
and sect claims a different flag and demands independence, then 
3,000 states must be established. Geography is also not 
conducive to this. People live intermingled with one another. 
People are happy when they live without making an issue of 
their origins and their beliefs, and when they show tolerance 
for each other and accept one another. [end recording] 
  Demirel recounted that the Soviet Union, which covered 22 
million square km, collapsed, but Russia today includes 70 
percent of this territory and its population. Noting that the 
Red Army is still standing and that there are close to 20,000 
nuclear warheads in Russia, Demirel said intensive diplomatic 
contacts are under way throughout the whole world in order to 
prevent the reemergence of a military threat and a return to the 
old days. 
  Demirel concluded by saying Turkey has an important place, 
name, and stature in international relations as a result of its 
60 million population and its sensitive geographical location.

  [Excerpts] Today the foreign currency market almost 
overshadowed all other problems on Turkey's agenda. Yes, an 
earthquake took place in currency markets. The dollar rose to 
20,500 Turkish lira [TL], and all economic forecasts went 
topsy-turvy. The currency stands stopped selling cash dollars 
to people. The Central Bank remained a mere spectator. The 
stock exchange transactions continued to fall, and the Treasury 
and the banks are getting ready to increase interest rates. 
  [Begin offscreen reporter recording] The Turkish lira is 
experiencing a real shock. The Turkish people started to 
frantically exchange their money for dollars in the aftermath 
of developments that resulted from increasing the amount of 
money in circulation beyond TL66.4 trillion. The people started 
withdrawing their money from the stock exchange and started 
buying up dollars following the new bank interest rates and the 
bad mark given to the Turkish economy by international financial 
circles. People formed lines in front of currency stands to buy 
dollars or marks, and the cash foreign currency sales almost 
came to a halt in Istanbul and Ankara. Businessmen are 
unwilling to sell their dollars because they are finding it 
difficult to predict how much the dollar will continue to rise. 
All the predictions so far have been wrong, and at one point 
the dollar was selling at TL22,000 and the mark at TL11,500 at 
the currency stands. The dollar is selling at almost TL20,000 
in Tahtakale [Istanbul financial district]. 
  The businessmen's associations such as TUSIAD [Turkish 
Association of Industrialists and Businessmen] and the 
government had predicted that the dollar would reach TL24,500 
and TL26,000 only at the end of 1994. 
  The stock exchange transactions fell and shares fell by 403 
points to 25,503. Despite this activity in the currency market, 
the Central Bank is keeping silent. [passage omitted] 
  How did this happen to the currency market? According to 
economists in Istanbul, the clash between the Treasury and the 
Central Bank is the reason behind the rise in the value of 
foreign currency. In line with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's 
request, the Treasury is trying to lower interest rates. Unlike 
in the past, the Central Bank is not selling its foreign 
currency reserves to collect the excess Turkish lira, which is 
now escaping the lower interest rates and is being changed into 
foreign currency. Because of this, the price of the dollar went 
out of control. [passage omitted] 
  It is not known how the TL2,000 gap between the official 
exchange rate and the market will be bridged. Regarding the 
money shuttling between the stock exchange and the foreign 
currency market, and the government stance on this issue, 
business circles are warning that the excessive amount of money 
being printed in Turkey has opened the way for a considerable 
amount of speculative money to be accumulated. The economists, 
who have said that dollar prices have not gone up so fast 
anywhere else in the worl, now say: For the first time ever, 
speculative money is being used to buy up dollars. People are 
being dragged by this process. This money could leave the 
dollar market and return to the stock exchange at any time, and 
then people will suffer. The government is aware of this and is 
expecting such an occurrence. [end recording]

  [Text] Ankara -- True Path Party (DYP) chairperson and 
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller is being regularly disappointed in 
her campaign for the local elections which she began at the 
start of the new year. 
  Ciller did not receive the enthusiastic welcome she had 
expected from the crowd in her recent swing to Adana nor on her 
campaign stop in Malatya last weekend. Following the rally in 
Malatya, eggs and tangerines were thrown at her. Due to the 
tension within her party, she could not even announce the DYP's 
mayoral candidate for Malatya. Her mood influenced by her 
disappointment over the domestic tours, Ciller harshly 
reproached the columnists whom she takes on every domestic tour. 
When Ciller arrived at Malatya airport, the people showed their 
anger over the behavior of the police during the protest march 
of the civil servants the previous day, in which around 30 
demonstrators were taken into custody. Inonu Square, where 
Ciller was to deliver her speech, was mostly filled with people 
from opposition parties and civil servants. While Ciller was 
delivering her address, pro Welfare Party (RP) people were 
giving the thumbs-up and the Grand Unity Party (BBP) members 
were making the wolf-sign in a bid to identify themselves. 
Ciller had to cut her speech short due to the incessant 
whistling and shouting. She later visited the governor of 
Malatya, Saffet Arikan Beduk, whom she held responsible for what 
had happened. 
  Ciller became involved in more unpleasant situations before 
and after her visit to the Malatya mayor, who had joined the RP. 
A group of RP members and ultranationalists known as "ulkucu" 
(idealists) protested against her. Police used batons to 
disperse them. Meanwhile, one of the eggs and an orange thrown 
at the DYP convoy hit Ciller. Despite the protests, Ciller 
always kept a smile on her face. 
  Explaining the reasons for the government's decision to 
extend the period of military service, Ciller said that the 
government aimed at preventing separatist terrorists from 
recovering their strength during the winter months. She said 
that the government did not have any other alternative but to 
extend the term of military service, since shifting troops from 
the western or northern regions to the Southeast seemed 
impossible because of developments in Greece and Russia.

  [Text] Canada has suspended U.S. Cruise missile testing 
over the Arctic. Defense Minister David Collenette says the 
U.S. will be denied permission to conduct tests until MPs hold a 
special debate in the issue next week. According to the 
minister Washington was informed late last year that the 
Liberals wanted to review the testing agreement, but the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has learned that plans were 
under way for a Cruise missile test next week. Michael 
MacCaulif reports: 
  [MacCaulif] The decision to hold a parliamentary debate on 
Cruise missile testing is in a sense a face saving exercise. In 
November the new Liberal government told the Americans to begin 
their planning for 1994 Cruise missile tests, but in opposition 
the Liberals had also said no further tests should take place 
until Cruise missile testing was reviewed. So after this 
morning's cabinet meeting Defense Minister David Collenette said 
the Liberals would be true to their word. 
  [Begin Collenette recording] We had a discussion this 
morning and we hope to have a debate some time next week before 
any decision is taken on the, any tests in 1994. [end recording] 
  [MacCaulif] Even though in November the Liberals had told 
the 
Americans to begin planning their 1994 tests Collenette insists 
they were also told there would have to be a review first. 
  [Begin Collenette recording] The United States does, did 
know 
that any future tests would hinge on our government reviewing 
it. [end recording] 
  [MacCaulif] But CBC news has been told in fact that isn't 
the 
case. Until this week many people even in the Canadian military 
were under the impression that this year's tests would go ahead 
on schedule and plans were fully under way for the first test to 
take place next Tuesday [25 January].

Article Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Munich PRO 7 Television Network in 
German at 2130 GMT on 18 January in its "Reporter" program 
carries a seven-minute report by Rainer Laux on Russian Liberal 
Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. During the 
segment, Zhirinovskiy reacts to German media reports about him, 
including a report on his alleged contacts with a prostitute in 
Vienna published by the German daily Hamburg BILD. 
  Laux opens the report by saying that he showed Zhirinovskiy 
recent copies of German newspapers and "confronted him with our 
fear of a return to the Cold War." When he was shown a copy of 
DER SPIEGEL depicting his face in the foreground and Hitler's in 
the background, Zhirinovskiy's said: "It is very nice to see my 
picture on the front cover of DER SPIEGEL. However, if I am 
depicted once more along with Hitler, and if you compare me with 
Hitler again, then the future for DER SPIEGEL will be tough, and 
then I could see the end of DER SPIEGEL before long. Our party 
has never had a relationship with your underexposed [referring 
to the cover photo] fuehrer. You must never forget that your 
mad Hitler shot and annihilated more than 26 million Russian 
citizens. You and your fuehrer, who was nothing but an 
uneducated painter. He was a mad fanatic who was later 
condemned by the entire world. Pass that immediately on to our 
lawyers. We will sue DER SPIEGEL for 100 million marks." 
  The journalist stresses that Zhirinovskiy's strong language 
appeals to people and that he always knows how to place himself 
at the center of attention. Laux notes that although 
Zhirinovskiy's popularity is increasing, he is "far from 
supported by all Russians." One unidentified man in the street 
states that Zhirinovskiy is "a dangerous man, who might start 
World War III." A woman who is asked about Zhirinovskiy only 
says that "he is mad." 
  Laux then describes Zhirinovskiy's rhetorical talent: "He 
terrifies his audience with spraying spittle, he evokes the huge 
disappearing empire, reaching his climax by showering abuse on 
the corrupt reformers, communist liars, and obtrusive 
foreigners." 
  Rainer Laux then notes that these slogans are "particularly 
appealing to the young Nazis in Russia," who are still meeting 
"secretly," while "their great idol" appeared at a Congress of 
the German People's Union [DVU] in Passau last October. Laux 
adds that the DVU has "booked" Zhirinovskiy again for its 
"right-wing radical spectacle" this coming September. 
  However, Laux argues that Zhirinovskiy "is flexible, and 
cultivates profitable contacts with the left, too. The millions 
of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED] are welcome." 
Quoting from a German newspaper, Zhirinovskiy says: "My dear 
deputies. Here I can read that the communists in eastern Germany 
-- the SED, although they call themselves differently now -- say 
that they paid us DM8 million. Please tell them that we would 
be happy if only they had given us DM8. All the money for us, 
immediately." 
  Laux emphasizes that the military, in particular, feel 
attracted by "the dangerous dreams of a megalomaniac demagogue." 
Zhirinovskiy: "Germany is not an independent country, because 
it is occupied. More than 300,000 Russian soldiers remain 
stationed in Germany. As the security power, Russia can 
determine your country's fate. We have the right to say whether 
the soldiers remain there or are withdrawn. Instead of 
withdrawing them we might as well send another 700,000 soldiers 
there. Then 1 million Russian soldiers would stand on German 
soil." 
  Zhirinovskiy then goes on to say: "BILD claims I had sex 
with a girl. Am I not allowed to do that? What do the Germans 
think? Don't the Germans have contact with women, or do they do 
it with animals? What do the Germans do? What is the problem? 
That one here? I have to put on my glasses. This girl is a 
snake. I do not want one like her. Let me meet 10 other girls. 
Sasha, look, they say that I did it with that girl in Austria. 
It would have been a pleasure for me to have had something with 
20 Austrians, but not with that one. You can dump that one off 
on Schmidt and Kohl, but not on me." 
  Laux says that apart from his threats to occupy Germany, 
Zhirinovskiy also "hypocritically expressed his sarcastic 
concern about our country." 
  Zhirinovskiy: "One day Germany will cease to exist, because 
more and more people are getting divorced there, people do not 
have children any more, everybody is gay. This is why Germany 
will soon be populated only by foreigners! Do you understand 
that?" 
  Laux ends the report with a quote from Zhirinovskiy's 
address 
to the DVU Congress in Passau last October. Zhirinovskiy: 
"Long live the great Germany, long live the great Russia. 
Russian and Germans -- friends forever."

  [Text] Paris, Jan 20 (AFP) -- French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe on Thursday [20 January] called for a major review 
of Bosnian policy and said he planned to quickly broach the 
issue with U.S., Russia and European partners, as disgust built 
over the latest failure of Bosnian talks. 
  Juppe said he was "offering in the coming hours and days to 
make new contact with our American, Russian and European 
partners to proceed with this overhaul." 
  "We can no longer watch on the one hand the different 
parties 
negotiate in Geneva, and on the ground watch an escalation of 
the conflict," said Juppe in a statement for the French 
Assembly's foreign affairs committee. 
  He spoke as the European parliament in Strasbourg called for 
the replacement of David Owen as European Community negotiator 
in the Bosnian negotiations in a resolution that criticized the 
strategy of EC and United Nations negotiators "who have achieved 
no results and who persist in wanting to divide 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, though a member of the United Nations, along 
ethnic lines." 
  Hans van den Broek, the European commissioner for external 
relations, meanwhile, suggested Thursday in Stasbourg that the 
EC should perhaps consider suspending its mediation efforts 
"until the three parties (in Bosnia) are ready to accept a 
durable solution." But he said it was "unfair" to blame Owen, 
since he was acting on a mandate from the EC. 
  Two days of talks on Bosnia in Geneva collapsed Wednesday 
with the Bosnian Moslems, Croats and Serbs still deadlocked, as 
international mediators held out scant hope for progress when 
talks reconvene in three weeks.

government's decision to invite Mr. 'Arafat for talks at the end 
of this month. Mr. Stich said in a newspaper interview that he 
thought Mr. 'Arafat's visit to Bern was a good idea and was in 
line with Switzerland's promised support for Palestinians in the 
Israeli-occupied territories. He pointed out that Mr. 'Arafat 
had now renounced violence, and it was important for Switzerland 
to be briefed on developments in the Middle East peace process. 
During his first official visit to Bern, Mr. 'Arafat will meet 
Mr. Stich and the Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti.

four years ago of an Iranian opposition leader. 
  The Swiss Foreign Ministry said it had formally complained 
to 
the Iranian ambassador that the Tehran government had not

  The move comes two days after Iran denounced what it calls 
Switzerland's unfriendly attitude.

<F P=106> [FINSKA NOTISBYRAN report: "Ireland Wants Finland in the </F>
EU"] 
  [Text] Dublin -- Ireland is well disposed toward Finland's 
aims in the negotiations for membership of the European Union 
(EU). Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds spoke in positive 
terms when commenting on the state of the negotiations after 
discussions with Prime Minister Esko Aho (Center Party) in 
Dublin. Aho began the official part of his visit to Ireland 
yesterday. 
  Reynolds admitted that problems had arisen in the 
negotiations, but that they are no different from those of other 
countries. In his view, the negotiations have progressed well. 
  The negotiations must be completed by the end of February at 
the latest if Finland and the other aspiring members are to be 
able to become members of the EU at the beginning of next year. 
Reynolds told FINSKA NOTISBYRAN that the timetable is a tight 
one. However, he considers that enough has already been 
achieved in the negotiations with the result that people are 
bound to be able to find solutions to the remaining problems. 
  The trickiest issue in Finland's EU negotiations is 
agriculture. Reynolds considers Finland's aims moderate. In 
his view the EU Commission has produced a good analysis of the 
problems and that it will be possible to find a solution on the 
basis of this. 
  Ireland is a warm supporter of an enlargement of the 
European 
Union. Reynolds believes that the Union should not be 
restricted to embracing only 12 members. 
  Aho's visit is official. The welcoming ceremony at Dublin 
airport was reminiscent of the reception given to heads of 
state. This can be explained by the fact that the prime 
minister, "Taioseach" in Irish, is in practice head of state in 
the Irish political system. 
  Immediately after his discussions with Reynolds, Aho held 
talks with Industry Minister Ruairi Quinn, who is the foreign 
minister's deputy. In the afternoon Aho had several meetings at 
the parliament building. In the evening he delivered an address 
on Finland's traditional international position at a gathering 
at the Irish Institute for European Policy. 
  In addition to his discussions Aho also had a more 
lightweight program. He visited a genuine Irish public house 
and was given a glass of Ireland's "national drink," Guinness.

  [Text] Canada has promised to push for full sanctions 
against Haiti, unless the military allows the return of exiled 
president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Foreign Affairs Minister 
Andre Ouellet made the pledge during a meeting with Mr. 
Aristide, who is on a six-day visit to Canada. 
  Current sanctions imposed by the United Nations prevent oil 
and weapons from reaching the Caribbean island, but Ottawa wants 
the ban made complete in order to prevent Haiti from receiving 
anything except aid from nongovernmental organizations. 
  Mr. Ouellet said Canada and the other three so-called 
friends 
of Haiti -- the United States, Venezuela, and France -- will 
soon put a motion before the UN Security Council, calling for 
the tougher sanctions. All four nations promised to push for a 
total embargo against Haiti if the military refused to 
relinquish power by 15 January. Mr. Aristide won Haiti's first 
democratic elections over two years ago, but was later deposed 
in a bloody coup.

  [Text] A prominent member of ruling party PASOK 
[Panhellenic Socialist Movement] has suggested "Slavomacedonia" 
is an acceptable compromise in the dispute over the name of the 
former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, ahead of Monday's [24 
January] crucial parliamentary debate on the Skopje issue. His 
suggestion received support from ex-New Democracy minister 
Alexandros Papadhogonas but was dismissed by the government 
spokesman. 
  Pandelis Oikonomou, a member of the PASOK Central Committee, 
has been known to take up unpopular policy options which the 
party leadership sometimes later embrace, as in the case of his 
preelection stand in favor of taxing "repos." But his 
"Slavomacedonia" suggestion comes at a time when Prime Minister 
Andreas Papandreou is eager to show his government is united on 
the issue, especially after recent divergent opinions from 
European Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos. 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos, echoing the 
Interior Minister Akis Tsokhatzopoulos, insisted Mr. Oikonomou 
was only expressing "his personal views which have nothing to do 
with government policy."

  [Text] Vatican City, Jan 24 (AFP) -- Pope John Paul II 
admitted Sunday [23 January] the need for armed action in 
ensuring that humanitarian aid got through to regions of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina where it was needed to prevent starvation or 
save the lives of the wounded. 
  "Arms must not be silent when they are escorting essential 
goods to people who are dying of hunger, medicine for people who 
are ill or wounded, or concrete support for the poor," the 
pontiff said in an address during a day of prayer for Bosnia in 
which he invited all Christians to take part. 
  The pope expressed pain at "so much cruelty" in the former 
Yugoslav republic and issued an "urgent appeal" for road access 
to be given to convoys bringing relief to "those who are dying 
of hunger" in Sarajevo, Tuzla and Mostar. 
  "We suffer at the sight of so much cruelty, the repeated and 
very serious violations of human rights, the destruction of 
priceless monuments to civilisation. The acts of violence 
against women, children, elderly and defenceless people affect 
us deeply," he said. 
  And he told the Bosnian people: "You are not abandoned. We 
are with you and we will be with you, we will always be with 
you." 
  Meanwhile in Sarajevo, Bosnia's leading Moslem cleric 
Mustafa 
Efendi Ceric called on the Islamic authorities of Iran, Turkey 
and Egypt to end the suffering of the Bosnian people "whom all 
the others have betrayed and abandoned." 
  In a letter written after the death of six Sarajevo children 
killed by a shell as they played in the snow, Ceric said he 
could no longer call "either on (UN chief) Butrus Butrus-Ghali, 
or on the European or world community, which remain deaf to the 
cries of our women and children." 
  Ceric, whose letter was broadcast by Sarajevo radio, accused 
the international community of "looking on with indifference as 
the aggressor kills innocent children because the victims are 
Bosnian Moslems whom they themselves have deprived of the right 
of self-defence." 
  The latter comment was a reference to the international arms 
embargo against the republics of former Yugoslavia which 
Bosnians regard as preventing them from defending themselves 
against the superior weaponry of separatist Serbs who are armed 
by Belgrade. 
  The radio said the letter was sent to Iran's spiritual 
leader 
Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, to the chief ulema of Turkey and to 
the imam of Al Azhar in Egypt. 
  Bosnian vice-president Ejup Ganic meanwhile called on U.S. 
President Bill Clinton to honour his pledge not to tolerate the 
strangling of Sarajevo "which has gone on for 22 months now." 
  He said he hoped the United States "will not allow countries 
which tolerate genocide and reward aggression to dictate the 
policy of the international community on Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  After the killing of the six children on Saturday Bosnian 
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic called in a letter to 
Butrus-Ghali for airstrikes to break the stranglehold imposed by 
Bosnian Serb forces on the Bosnian capital.

  [Text] Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos 
arrived in Strasbourg this evening to present the [European 
Union] Greek presidency program at the European Parliament [EP] 
plenary session. 
  European Parliament President Egon Klepsch and the political 
group leaders today disapproved of the international press 
attacks against the Greek presidency when it assumed its term of 
office. Our Strasbourg correspondent Nikolaos Belos has the 
following report: 
  [Begin Belos recording] European Parliament President Egon 
Klepsch and the political group leaders in Strasbourg 
disapproved of the international press attacks against the Greek 
presidency when it assumed office. The issue was raised for 
discussion by Mr. Klepsch at the European Parliament presidium. 
He said that the criticism was condemnable and that he does not 
accept prejudging the failure of a presidency before it even 
begins. Mr. Klepsch added, following the discussions he had a 
few days ago with representatives of the Greek Government in 
Athens, that he believes that the presidency gives priority to 
cooperation with the European Parliament and the other bodies of 
the European Union. 
  Jean-Pierre Cot, leader of the European Parliament's 
socialist group, described the Greek presidency as solid and 
experienced and called the international press articles on the 
alleged negative character of the Greek presidency impolite. 
Referring to the Greek presidency's priorities, Mr. Cot 
described them as correct because they cover economic and social 
aspects of the European Union as they were determined within the 
framework of the white paper. Mr. Cot also referred to the 
European Union's foreign policy, which the presidency will 
promote, and stressed that from his contacts in Athens with 
leading members of the Greek presidency he has viewed the 
experience and knowledge the Greek Government has on Balkan 
issues. In conclusion, the socialist group leader expressed the 
conviction that the Greek presidency aims at insuring peace and 
security in the Balkans. 
  Participating in the discussion on the Greek side were the 
two European Parliament vice presidents, Paraskevas Avyerinos of 
PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] and Yeorgyios 
Anastasopoulos of New Democracy. They both stressed that the 
international press attacks were not only against the government 
but also against the Greek people. At the same time, they also 
dealt a blow to the European Union institutions. 
  European Commission President Jacques Delors also criticized 
the international press attacks against the Greek presidency 
during his visit to Athens. [end recording]

  [Text] The European Parliament's [EP] plenary session 
accepted the Greek presidency's program without substantive 
criticism. Reservations were expressed only regarding the white 
paper's implementation. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Theodhoros 
Pangalos, the Greek alternate foreign minister and president of 
the Council of Ministers, presented the Greek presidency's 
program to the European Parliament's plenary session. Pangalos 
particularly stressed what could be expected from a presidency 
in an international environment that is very unstable, 
experiencing serious crises, and suffering clashes. In his 
address, Pangalos stressed that the Greek Government attaches 
particular importance to implementing the white paper on 
employment and development. He said he hopes this will not be 
hindered by financial obstacles. 
  Discussing the European Union's [EU] expansion with four new 
members from the North, Pangalos referred specifically to 
Cyprus' application. 
  Referring to EU initiatives on common foreign policy, 
Pangalos mentioned the Greek presidency's sensitivity toward 
promoting peace and security in the Balkans and working toward 
resolving the tension in the former Yugoslavia. This position 
was accepted, the Greek presidency indirectly clarifying that it 
will not exploit the presidency to promote a national policy on 
the Balkans. This is why Pangalos carefully avoided mentioning 
Skopje or Turkey's policy toward Greece, something that was 
criticized by KKE [Greek Communist Party] Eurodeputy 
Efraimidhis. Replying to Efraimidhis, Pangalos said he was 
speaking for Greece as the EU president, not as a Greek 
nationalist who could satisfy his own wishes. [end recording]

  [Text] Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos made 
a statement in Strasbourg expressing his satisfaction over the 
European Parliament's acceptance of the Greek presidency 
proposals. Many European Union [EU] member countries supported 
the accession of Cyprus and Malta to the EU. Nikolaos Belos, 
Greek Radio special correspondent at the European Parliament 
headquarters, has the following report: 
  [Begin Belos recording] All the political groups in the 
European Parliament are in favor of the membership of Cyprus and 
Malta in the EU. This conclusion has been drawn from today's 
deliberations at the European Parliament plenary session, which 
were held after EU Council President Theodhoros Pangalos and 
Commission member Hans van den Broek presented reports on 
relations between the EU and these two countries. 
  At the same time, it has been learned that the name of the 
EU 
observer at the intercommunal negotiations on the Cyprus issue 
within the UN framework will be announced in the next few days. 
As Mr. Pangalos noted, the observer will brief the EU on 
whether negotiations within the UN framework are in accordance 
with EU norms [kektimeno] and EU-Cypriot relations. Analyzing 
the presidency's intentions concerning the application of Cyprus 
for membership, Mr. Pangalos stressed that he has scheduled a 
meeting on the EU's association with Cyprus for May and added 
that the Greek presidency, responding to the decisions made at 
the Lisbon summit, will also hold a political dialogue with the 
Cyprus Government at all levels. 
  Mr. Hans van den Broek pointed out that talks between EU 
officials and Cypriot authorities on preparations for membership 
are developing at a very satisfactory pace. In conclusion, Mr. 
Hans van den Broek described 1994 as an important year for the 
membership requests from Cyprus and Malta and stressed that the 
final decisions will be made in January 1995 on the basis of the 
progress made by that date. It is worth noting that all the 
political group representatives without exception, Greeks and 
others, who took the floor supported Cyprus' membership in the 
EU. 
  Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos gave an 
international news conference late this afternoon and responded 
to questions from correspondents on the Greek presidency's 
program. On EU expansion, Mr. Pangalos, who will visit the 
three Scandinavian candidate countries soon, stressed that there 
are difficulties in the negotiations but expressed the hope that 
they will conclude by 28 February as scheduled. He added that 
the presidency has provided for two unscheduled meetings of the 
EU foreign ministers in February. 
  Responding to a question on the Skopje issue, Mr. Pangalos 
said that Greece supports and guarantees the existence of 
Skopje. This state, he said, exists thanks to Greece, since its 
economic life depends on Thessaloniki. For this reason, Mr. 
Pangalos added, Greece would like this state to change its 
behavior on the issues of borders, its constitution, and the 
emblems on its flag. 
  Mr. Pangalos also responded to questions on the 
implementation of the white paper and on other issues that the 
Greek presidency will be handling. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Cowardice of Europe"] </F>
  [Text] There must be not less, but more Europe. That is 
the familiar chorus of the litany of many political parties, and 
over the next few months the population will continue to be 
confronted with it. After all, the European election campaign 
will soon be starting, and a not inconsiderable number of 
candidates will declare their great belief in the European idea. 
Their words will meet with great skepticism, not least because 
of Europe's dramatic failure in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Exactly how great and total the debacle really is, was once 
again illustrated all too clearly yesterday in the European 
Parliament [EP] in Strasbourg. European Commissioner Hans Van 
den Broek called for the curtailment of European attempts at 
negotiating peace, claiming that after all they lead nowhere and 
invariably end in failure. Despite the many conferences that 
have been held, the prospect of peace is further away than ever. 
And whenever agreements were reached in the past, they were not 
respected. The warring factions in Bosnia are continuing to 
give priority to their armed struggle and Europe is powerless to 
convince them to do otherwise. The European Union lacks the 
military might, a coherent concept, and, above all, the 
single-mindedness to do so. It is no coincidence that Van den 
Broek should specifically choose the Greek presidency to propose 
that Europe wash its hands in innocence, echoing the legendary 
cowardice of Pontius Pilate. After all, the Greeks are allies 
of the Serbs, and will do nothing that ruffles the feathers of 
Milosevic &amp; Co. Under these circumstances, it can virtually 
be 
ruled out that the Union will succeed in acting firmly or 
coherently. After nearly three years of war, an exhausted 
Europe has had enough of the misery in Bosnia. Yesterday, an 
isolationist appeal was made by EC Commissioner Van den Broek, 
but there were also the decisions by the Netherlands and Germany 
to send thousands of Croatian refugees back home. The question 
remains, however, as to what the consequences will be of any 
further spreading of the fighting and ethnic cleansing. Bosnia 
is not the only powder keg in the Balkans. There is also 
Kosovo, and Macedonia. If their fuse is ignited, then the fire 
could spread right through the Balkans, and the European Union 
would have no alternative but to fear the collapse of that 
entire flank of the continent. The belief that the Union can 
isolate itself from the rest of Europe is a dangerous 
misconception, and a foolish illusion.

<F P=106> [Article by Lucy Walker: "Votes in an Imperfect System"] </F>
  [Text] The geographical centre of gravity of the European 
Union [EU] will shift sharply northwards with the proposed 
inclusion of four new member states by 1995. 
  But before negotiations with Austria, Finland, Norway and 
Sweden can be concluded, the Twelve's existing members must 
decide how far they are prepared to see the political centre of 
gravity shift, too. 
  The Union's Mediterranean members are worried that embracing 
the four rich, and principally Protestant, northern states will 
move the political agenda away from their own priorities. 
  Which gives Malta and Cyprus -- also queuing up for 
membership -- an opportunity to argue that making them full 
members soon would keep the current north-south balance more or 
less intact. 
  Yet the Mediterraneans -- who count only two large 
countries, 
Italy and Spain, in their number -- could find the northern 
newcomers allies when it comes to deciding the balance of power 
between large and small countries. 
  Large countries have more votes in the Council of Ministers 
than small ones -- a legacy of the old European Coal and Steel 
Community, in which France, West Germany and Italy were not 
prepared to be outvoted by Belgium, the Netherlands and 
Luxembourg. 
  Yet with votes based only roughly on population size, the 
minnows look overrepresented in terms of the ratio of votes to 
population. Luxembourg's two votes mean one vote for every 
200,000 of its citizens. Britain and France's 10 give them 
roughly one vote per 5.8 million people. 
  It's a voting formula which has survived the successive 
incorporation of new members and ensures that large countries 
can't be outvoted in the Council by a motley alliance of 
mini-states. 
  Even so, the way that votes are evaluated has changed. By 
the 1980's, Brussels had almost ground to a halt. The 
Community, hit by recession and a decision-making structure 
requiring unanimity, was in the grip of Eurosclerosis. The 
response was the 1987 Single Act. 
  This aimed to kick-start the EC by allowing binding 
decisions 
on a majority vote in a wide range of policy areas. Small 
members were protected from intimidation by larger ones by a 
system of weighted -- or "qualified" -- majority voting. Under 
this procedure, it takes 54 of the Council's 76 votes (a 
difference of 22) to get a qualified majority, so small 
countries need only pool 23 votes to successfully block a move. 
  The compromise has worked well. To reach a qualified 
majority, the Big Five need at least two small states on their 
side. Alternatively, small countries need the support of three 
heavyweights. Any combination represents roughly 70 percent of 
the Union's population. 
  Still, each wave of new members into the EU means 
readjusting 
the balance of power. EU leaders agreed on the number of votes 
for new members last month. Sweden and Austria will get four 
each, with three apiece for Finland and Norway. But they have 
still to agree on the formula for blocking minorities. If the 
equation used to decide on votes is extended, eight of the 
tiddlers -- representing less than one eighth of the combined 
population -- would be able to block decisions affecting the 
remaining seven eighths. 
  Karl Lamers, a German Christian Democrat, has proposed a 
complex formula that would ensure decisions are taken by a 
majority of member states which among them represent a majority 
of the EU's citizens. A new category of "super-qualified" 
majority could be introduced in areas now requiring unanimity 
such as taxation and foreign policy. 
  A new formula could be agreed by EU leaders in Corfu in 
June, 
or at a special summit, possibly in March or April. 
  And yet any solution will be a stopgap. Germany -- the 
biggest member state and, since unification the most grossly 
under-represented per head of population -- may push for a 
redistribution of votes at the Union's next round of 
institutional reform in 1996. 
  There may be a redistribution of commissioners, too. Today, 
the Big Five have two each and the rest -- including the four 
new members -- one each. One suggestion is that the Big Five 
each have a permanent seat in Brussels, while the minnows rotate 
the remaining places. 
  The issue could be more complex if the Union brings in 
micro-states Malta and Cyprus. Maltese diplomats have indicated 
privately that their country may not take up its right to hold 
the EU's rotating presidency, perhaps missing a turn at the 
helm, as Portugal did. 
  Such a concession might alarm medium-sized members. For them 
this would be a slippery slope, dangerously eroding their 
comparative power against the big battalions.

<F P=106> [FINSKA NOTISBYRAN report: "EEA Conflict Over Alcohol </F>
Monopoly"] 
  [Text] The EFTA [European Free Trade Association] 
countries and the EU [European Union] are agreed that the last 
unresolved issues in the supplementary protocol to the EEA 
[European Economic Area] agreement must be resolved before the 
end of January. The two sides fixed this deadline at the first 
meeting of the EEA Mixed Committee in Brussels yesterday. 
  The issues have to be resolved if the supplementary protocol 
is to be able to come into force by the beginning of July at the 
latest. Before it comes into force it has to be ratified by the 
parliaments of the EU countries and those of the five 
participating EFTA countries -- something that will take a few 
months. 
  "If matters are not completed by then the supplementary 
protocol could be delayed until the beginning of next year -- 
something that we must avoid at all costs," said the EC 
Commission's Hans van der Pas, who is the chairman of the Mixed 
Committee in the first half of 1994. 
  The supplementary protocol contains around 400 EU laws which 
have come into existence since the negotiations for the EEA 
agreement were completed. 
  Around 10 questions remain unresolved, but both Van der Pas 
and the EFTA countries' representative on the Committee, Antti 
Sauli, believe that it will be possible to resolve them. 
  Yesterday's meeting was devoted chiefly to organizational 
matters, but a first bone of contention regarding the 
interpretation of the EEA agreement has already surfaced. 
  Norway and the EU Commission take different views as to 
whether the Norwegian state alcohol monopoly can be reconciled 
with the EEA agreement, and the Commission has asked EFTA's 
oversight body, the ESA [EFTA Surveillance Authority], to look 
into the matter. Norway wants to retain its wholesale monopoly, 
but the Commission wants it abolished. 
  With Finland and Sweden the EU has reached agreement 
regarding their alcohol monopolies in their membership 
negotiations. The solution was that all monopolies apart from 
that in the retail sector will be abolished. 
  The ESA is currently beginning its work by going through all 
legislation regarding the EEA agreement of the five EFTA 
countries participating in the EEA. 
  This review of Finland's, Norway's, Iceland's, Sweden's, and 
Austria's legislation will cover laws on alcohol and other 
monopolies, and also the free movement of people, and the 
abolition of tax and other obstacles to trade. The ESA will 
also look at all state support paid out in the five countries. 
The work is expected to take several months.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 19 (AFP) -- The European Community 
agreed here Wednesday [19 January] on the distribution of 
ECU13.948 billion (about 15.4 billion dollars) to help fight 
unemployment in the 12-nation Community over six years to 1999. 
  The biggest beneficiary was Britain, which is to get 
ECU3.377 
billion (3.7 billion dollars), followed by France (ECU3.203 
billion -- 3.5 billion dollars) and Germany (ECU1.942 billion -- 
2.14 billion dollars). 
  The money comes in addition to the ECU141 billion (155 
billion dollars) which the EC will spend on economic development 
in the poorest parts of the EC -- known as Objective 1 areas -- 
between 1994 and 1999. 
  Objective 1 areas include pockets of depression throughout 
the EC plus most of Spain and all of Ireland, Greece and 
Portugal. The money divided up on Wednesday will go to other 
areas in the EC. 
  It is earmarked to fight long-term unemployment by helping 
young people adapt to the labour market along with others long 
excluded from the workplace, and to help workers adapt to 
industrial change. 
  According to the latest official figures, unemployment in 
the 
EC is running at over 10.7 percent and is expected to peak at 
11.5 percent in mid-1995.

  [Text] Strasbourg, Jan 18 (AFP) -- The European Community 
can progress towards the introduction of a single currency 
without reimposing narrow bands on the exchange rate mechanism 
(ERM), Finance Commissioner Henning Christophersen said on 
Tuesday [18 January]. 
  "If everybody accepts that the 15 percent band is a normal 
band, the only important question is: Is your currency close to 
the central rate?," he told journalists outside a meeting of the 
European Parliament. 
  At the beginning of August, in the face of massive 
speculation against currencies in the European monetary system 
(EMS) and particularly against the French franc, EC finance 
ministers widened the permitted range of fluctuation of most of 
the currencies within the ERM from 2.25 percent to 15 percent. 
  Christophersen said that the re-imposition of narrow bands 
might lead to a resumption of speculation against ERM currencies. 
  Under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty, the Community is 
to 
begin stage three of economic and monetary union between the end 
of 1997 and the end of 1999 at the latest. 
  Under stage three the Community is to adopt a single 
currency, and Christophersen declined to rule out the 
possibility that the currency might be adopted in 1997. 
However, he said that it would be "very, very difficult." 
  A senior EC official has said that six members of the 
Community might be ready quickly to meet the conditions for use 
of a single currency. He named them as Belgium, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, Germany, Ireland and France.

  [Text] Luxembourg, Jan 21 (AFP) -- The 12-monthly rate of 
inflation in the European Community (EC) rose in December to 3.3 
percent representing an increase of 0.1 percent from the rate in 
November, the EC Eurostat institute reported on Friday [21 
January]. 
  But the institute said that the figure of 3.3 percent was 
the 
lowest for a calendar year since 1987, when it had been 3.4 
percent. 
  Half of the EC countries met the inflation criteria laid 
down 
in the Maastricht Treaty on European Union for meeting targets 
for economic convergence. 
  These countries were Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, 
Britain, France and Belgium. Under the treaty, the annual rate 
of inflation must not exceed the average of the three lowest 
rates by more than 1.5 percentage points. 
  But Sweden and Austria, which are negotiating to join the 
Community, did not meet the criteria. Inflation in Sweden was 
4.8 percent and in Austria it was 3.5 percent. 
  Two other candidates for membership are Finland, with 
inflation of 1.5 percent, and Norway with 1.8 percent. 
  The inflation rates for the 12 months to December were: 
Belgium 2.7 percent (from 2.4 percent in December 1992), 
Britain 1.9 percent (2.6 percent), Denmark 1.5 percent (1.5 
percent), France 2.1 percent on a provisional basis (1.9 
percent), western Germany 3.7 percent (3.7 percent), Greece 12.1 
percent (14.3 percent), Ireland 1.5 percent (2.5 percent), Italy 
4.4 percent (4.6 percent), Luxembourg 3.6 percent (2.9 
percent), the Netherlands 1.7 percent (2.9 percent), Portugal 
6.4 percent (8.5 percent), and Spain 4.9 percent (5.3 percent).

<F P=106> [Report by Olivier Gossey: "Opinion of EC Commissioner for </F>
Competition Karel Van Miert on Common Challenges for Europe and 
the United States"] 
  [Text] GATT, social protection, and the environment: Karel 
Van Miert believes that the European Union and the United States 
are now faced with several similar objectives. 
  Addressing the members of the American and Common Market 
Club 
(ACMC) in Brussels, European Commissioner Karel Van Miert 
affirmed that apart from enlargement, ensuring the follow-up of 
the Uruguay Round, and working in favor of the environment and 
social dimension will be the three main challenges facing the 
European Union in the near future. Moreover, he noted -- as 
U.S. President Bill Clinton recently remarked -- that these 
three objectives are now common to both Europe and the United 
States. 
  The Belgian commissioner believes that the important thing 
now is to convert the touchdown scored in GATT: "For instance, 
the agreement does not guarantee any opening of the Japanese 
market," he pointed out, highlighting that some obstacles 
remain, which are not even of a regulatory or legislative 
nature, but are rather of a "private," "psychological," or some 
other nature. "The imbalance is flagrant and this is becoming 
less and less acceptable," remarked Van Miert. "The Americans 
have understood this clearly, and it is they who from time to 
time turn on the heat vis-a-vis the Japanese partner." 
  On the other hand, the single market is far from being 
completed, added the former chairman of the SP [Flemish 
Socialist Party]. In the telecommunications sector: "A 
substantial amount of time was lost on the Americans and the 
Japanese." Even if there are only slight differences at the 
technological level, the sector is characterized by considerable 
tariff discrepancies, and both structural and organizational 
divergence. Too many member states are still wrapped up in 
their national monopolies, which constitutes a major 
"comparative disadvantage." By the same token, in the air 
transport sector -- where some are advocating a break -- there 
can be no going back, and Van Miert stressed that "headway must 
be made more rapidly," while at the same time asserting that "if 
the single market had been in existence 10 or 15 years ago, then 
it would have proven easier to emerge from the current crisis." 
<H5>  Social Dumping </H5>
  The single market is also hampered by competitive 
devaluations and social dumping, to Van Miert's dismay: "If 
certain member states begin to manipulate monetary or social 
instruments, then we will find ourselves back in the situation 
of a soccer match where some players only use their feet, and 
others their hands, or head. That is the truth of the matter." 
With respect to the dossier on the steel sector, some episodes 
may only be described as "scandalous": "How can we negotiate," 
says Karel Van Miert rebelliously, "when each state has a right 
of veto, and certain parties occasionally deny the reality 
regarding the state subsidies which they are awarding?" 
  Nonetheless, the words of the former Commission vice 
president (since the end of December, under the terms of the 
Maastricht Treaty, there are now only two vice presidents in the 
Community executive: Manuel Marin and Henning Christophersen -- 
L' ECHO editor's note) try to be optimistic. Whereas the 
European Commission was in rather a bad way one year ago, Van 
Miert maintains things have improved since then, especially by 
virtue of the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty, the 
adoption of a strategy for recovery, the conclusion of GATT, and 
also thanks to the efforts of the Belgian presidency. In any 
case, the European Commission has not been weakened by the 
exercise involving the white paper. He observed: "It has been 
proven that, when called upon to draw up certain texts or to 
negotiate, the Commission can always be relied upon. Do you 
think that the Germans would have accepted the British haggling 
over GATT? Sometimes it is enough for a country merely to table 
a particular document for it to be systematically rejected by 
the others. That is why people turned to Delors for the white 
paper." Furthermore, Mr. Delors will not hesitate to point 
this out if there are attempts to "drown the fish," i.e., if the 
document is not followed up. 
  "The Commission must seize the opportunities that present 
themselves, without worrying about its popularity," concluded 
Van Miert. "Do you know that during the negotiation of the Eko 
Stahl dossier, the Germans from the eastern laender remarked to 
us that before they were bound to follow the instructions issued 
by Moscow, whereas now they are bound by those originating in 
Brussels. Criticism was already being leveled at the Commission 
at the time of General de Gaulle, and there are those who would

  [Text] In Madrid, the air force chiefs of staff of Spain, 
Germany, the UK, and Italy have signed the document containing 
the technical features of the future combat aircraft that the 
four countries are developing jointly. The project was started 
in 1984, but the cost forced alterations to the project, which 
were confirmed by the air force chiefs today. Spain will order 
87 aircraft, the first two of which will be delivered in 2000.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 20 (AFP) -- The European Community 
tried here Thursday [20 January] to lower the temperature of a 
subsidy row between British Airways and Air France, insisting 
that British criticism did not amount to a formal complaint. 
  A spokeswoman for the EC's executive European Commission 
said 
that British Airways criticism about allegedly illegal state aid 
for state-owned Air France had been made in response to an 
existing EC inquiry. 
  She contradicted reports that British Airways had lodged a 
new complaint. 
  The privately-owned British Airways called on the Commission 
Wednesday to demand that Air France return a capital injection 
of 1.5 billion francs (253 million dollars) extended in the form 
of a bond issue and other securities. 
  The EC's executive had already begun a probe of the 
injection 
last November on the grounds that it might contravene 
regulations against state aid which distorted competition and 
would not be granted by private investors. 
  Air France has maintained that the bonds were taken up under 
normal market conditions, largely by an affiliate of the Caisse 
des depots et des consignations (CDC), a state-owned institution. 
  British Airways has been campaigning against further 
government aid for loss-making state-owned European airlines.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bad Luck Dogs Airbus"] </F>
  [Excerpt] One after another, incidents are affecting the 
newest aircraft produced by the European consortium currently in 
service among French airlines. An Air Inter A330 periodically 
refuses to retract its landing gear, and an almost brand new Air 
France A340 was destroyed by fire on the ground yesterday. 
  Once again, malfunctions occurred with the first Airbus A330 
delivered to Air Inter. While all the test and air trials were 
carried out normally, the aircraft -- put into service early 
this year by Air Inter -- is demonstrating a bad attitude. Last 
Monday [17 January], after taking off from Orly airport en route 
to Toulouse, the crew noticed that the landing gear was not 
retracting normally. The aircraft landed and the passengers 
were sent on the next flight, while the plane was subjected to a 
battery of tests supervised by technicians from the airline as 
well as from Airbus Industrie. Since nothing suspicious could be 
found, the aircraft was put back into service Wednesday. 
<H5>  A340 Destroyed on the Ground </H5>
  Nevertheless, while the first flights of the morning went 
off 
without the slightest incident, the crew noticed just after the 
takeoff of flight IT-423 that the same symptoms were back. Once 
again, the landing gear refused to retract into its housing. 
One might think that the aircraft had become allergic to 
Toulouse, its place of birth. Since last September, Air Inter 
has performed many test flights without the slightest incident. 
According to Airbus Industrie, the incidents that occurred 
Monday and Wednesday are probably only due to a "simple 
adjustment." The fact remains, however, that this makes a bad 
impression. The Air Inter A330 is the first one delivered and 
put into commercial service, and the French airline still has 
yet to receive 15 units out of a total of 118 aircraft ordered 
from Airbus. The A330 is very similar to the A340, the only 
difference being the number of engines fitted onto the planes. 
The Air Inter twin-engined aircraft, planned for use on the 
busiest routes, are configured to carry 412 passengers. 
  The incidents that arose on the A330 following the two 
takeoffs from Orly are, however, completely different and less 
serious than the incident that affected a four-engined Air 
France A340. This is the long-haul version of the aircraft 
manufactured by Airbus Industrie, 117 units of which have been 
ordered and 22 already delivered and in put into service. The 
airplane, which had just been through one of its periodical 
technical checkups, was brought out of the maintenance hangar 
around 0100 [2400 GMT]. Four hours later, a fire broke out. 
Air France firemen, assisted by firefighters from Aeroports de 
Paris, brought the fire under control after fighting it for half 
an hour. Nevertheless, the fire had no impact on the airlines 
traffic, despite the fact that the aircraft was scheduled to fly 
at midday. The cause of the fire remains unknown, and the air 
transportation gendarmerie has taken charge of the 
investigation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 23 (AFP) -- The European Community has 
proposed a draft agreement to cut overproduction of aluminium, 
with regard especially to Russian exports of the metal, at talks 
here, an EC spokesman said Sunday [23 January]. 
  EC negotiator Joern Keck, who chaired the January 18-21 
talks, said the draft memorandum of understanding should lead to 
cuts in overproduction of aluminium, which amounts to up to two 
million tonnes annually on a total of 18 million tonnes. 
  Details of the accord were not released, pending a response 
from the EC nations, Australia, Canada, Norway, Russia and the 
United States, which were asked to make their views known by 
next Friday. 
  The participants to the talks here agreed to meet again in 
Canada at the end of February, an EC spokesman said. The 
Brussels talks finished on Friday, but it took two days to 
prepare the memorandum, he added. 
  The European Commission, the executive arm of the Community, 
said that participants at the Brussels talks were "conscious 
that transparency and the availability of full and comprehensive 
data are essential for sound commercial decisions." 
  They agreed that the International Primary Aluminium 
Institute (IPAI) offered the "most effective mechanism" and 
Russia, in particular, had begun taking steps to cooperate fully 
with the IPAI, furnishing data with a view to membership, the 
statement added. 
  Other participating nations expressed readiness to help 
Russian industry in the process of integration into the world 
aluminium market on the basis of fair competition and high 
environmental standards, the statement said. 
  Overproduction of aluminium, especially following a massive 
rise in Russian exports, has led to a sharp decline in world 
market prices for the metal and an increase in stocks, which 
currently amount to more than three times world consumption. 
  Between 1990 and 1993, Russian exports grew five-fold from 
300,000 tonnes a year to 1.5 million at particularly low prices. 
  The EC has decided to limit imports from Russia to 180,000 
tonnes per year, including 45,000 tonnes for the period November 
30, 1993, to February 28, 1994. 
  At the negotiations, the Russians called for the threshold 
to 
be raised to 320,000 tonnes, but agreed to revise their figures 
in exchange for financial and technical aid to restructuring and 
modernising the industry. 
  The talks here followed two previous rounds in Moscow and 
Washington at the end of last year that failed to lead to an 
agreement. On Friday, U.S. trade representative Mickey Kantor 
called on the European nations to show more flexibility with 
regard to imports from Russia.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Thomas Klestil by unidentified </F>
NEWS reporter in Vienna; date not given: "Klestil: The 
Interview"] 
  [Excerpt] [NEWS] Over the past few days, political 
speculations that a positive conclusion of the EC negotiations 
will no longer be possible by early March and that the 
referendum on Europe might be delayed by almost a year have been 
increasing. Is this assessment also a result of your contacts? 
  [Klestil] First of all, on account of my contacts, I am sure 
that Austria is assessed in a particularly positive way in all 
EC capitals. We are treated as if we were already fully 
integrated. My second assessment is that we achieved an enormous 
success before Christmas regarding the question of the 
environmental package. It is an Austrian habit to always assess 
our successes very modestly -- but a terrific thing happened. 
The European Union [EU] adjusted its lower environmental 
protection standards to that of Austria's. Thus, small Austria 
did not adjust itself to the lower environmental protection 
standards, but rather the big EC states adopted our particularly 
high environmental standards. This is an incredible success in 
the negotiations. If the same concessions are made to us in the 
remaining open questions, then the date in March may work out 
absolutely. 
  [NEWS] Do you believe that it is still possible to conclude 
the negotiations in March and carry out the referendum in June? 
  [Klestil] This target date is certainly very important 
because, on the one hand, it puts pressure on both sides and, on 
the other hand, it forces everyone to work day and night to 
achieve this date. 
  [NEWS] In your opinion, are the negotiations currently 
stagnating, or is this pessimism mere tactics? 
  [Klestil] It is certainly not tactics. There are really 
several very important open questions regarding the topics of 
agriculture and transit. In March, provincial diet elections 
will be held in the provinces that are affected most by these 
questions -- for example, Tirol -- which clearly complicates an 
objective discussion. But even without the pressure of these 
elections, the following would have been valid: The result is 
more important than the date. 
  [NEWS] There is also the attitude that we have to hurry with 
our entry because the situation in Russia might jeopardize 
Europe's security. 
  [Klestil] A delay would, of course, be deplorable. 
Precisely in view of the speedy change of the political 
situation around us, I would prefer all that to be settled in 
March. Therefore, both things are very important for me: that 
we achieve both the March target and the June referendum with 
great commitment and a result in the negotiations that is 
convincing and that one can present to the people with 
self-confidence. In the next few weeks, all our energy really 
has to be aimed at Brussels. The conclusion of the negotiations 
in March, a referendum in June, and entry into the European 
Community in early 1995 -- this would be the ideal schedule. 
  [NEWS] In the political scene in Vienna, there is currently 
a very decisive question: How much will you personally commit 
yourself to the European Community in the election campaign 
before the referendum? 
  [Klestil] First of all, I will have a close look at the 
result of the negotiations and exclusively assess it according 
to Austria's interests. I will then clearly give my opinion on 
this result of the negotiations. I will state my point of view 
on this question for or against the European Community. And the 
citizen can deduce a guideline from it, if he wants. I will 
state my point of view very clearly before the referendum. 
  [NEWS] In favor of the European Community. 
  [Klestil] My basic attitude toward the European integration 
process is known. I pursued it very consistently over the past 
few years. 
  [NEWS] What will happen if the negotiating teams do not 
achieve an agreement by March? 
  [Klestil] This will be deplorable, but it will not be a 
tragedy. 
  [NEWS] In that case, would you clearly come out in favor of 
advanced Nationalrat elections in June so that the referendum 
can take place in the autumn and the process of entry will be 
accelerated? 
  [Klestil] It is exclusively the business of the Nationalrat 
to decide when the Nationalrat elections will be held. It is 
not my task to give advice here, not in public. 
  [NEWS] And behind the scenes? 
  [Klestil] When my opinion was asked during my regular 
contacts with government members, I always stated it very openly. 
  [NEWS] That is, the advancement of the Nationalrat elections 
to the spring so that a new government can carry out the EC 
referendum unburdened in the autumn? 
  [Klestil] This is certainly a possible variant. However, by 
all means, the date by which we have to become an EC member is 1 
January 1996. The main decisions on the political future of the 
European Union will be made in 1996. Joint security policy, 
joint foreign policy, and joint monetary policy will then be 
discussed -- all decisive security questions. It is my wish 
that Austria will be able to participate in the decisions and 
have a say. 
  [NEWS] We are currently witnessing a race for NATO 
membership of the former East Bloc states surrounding us. You 
said two years ago that you think that neutrality presently is 
outdated, and you were criticized severely for it at that 
time.... 
  [Klestil] I said that the State Treaty has to be considered 
fulfilled and, therefore, obsolete. Because otherwise there 
will be the danger that successor states of the Soviet Union 
suddenly will call for their rights as partners of Austria. The 
developments that have taken place so far have borne me out. 
Referring to neutrality, I said that it has to be adjusted to 
the new reality. If you have a look at the threats of today, 
which go far beyond the military sphere -- floods of refugees, 
drug-related crime, organized crime -- a new way of thinking is 
required in the field of security. Neutrality has never been an 
end in itself; neutrality serves security -- and if a collective 
security system that serves security more than neutrality is 
developed in Europe, then one should be able to think about it.

<F P=106> [Report by Otmar Lahodynsky: "New EU Transit Position"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The European Union (EU) shows itself ready to 
recognize the main contents of the transit agreement for a 
transition period for the entire national territory once Austria 
becomes a member. A new, joint proposal by Germany, Italy, and 
the Netherlands for the entry negotiations is making greater 
concessions to Vienna's requests than the Commission's former 
position, which wanted to limit the system of ecological points 
to sensitive alpine regions. 
  The new initiative, the complete written version of which 
should be presented as a new EU "joint position" next week, 
provides, however, for a shorter period -- three years have been 
mentioned -- for the ecological-points system, which was 
concluded to last until 2004. 
  Three years have been mentioned as the EU's position for the 
negotiations, while Germany would even accept a longer period. 
In the case of an eight-year transition period starting in 
1995, the agreed reduction of exhausts to 40 percent would be 
achieved by the year 2002 according to the transit agreement 
that came into force in 1993. In the Council's enlargement 
group last Wednesday [19 January] there seemed to be a clear 
majority in favor of the proposal offered by the three countries 
most affected by the transit agreement. Some countries such as 
France or Spain have not yet commented but do not reject the 
initiative on principle. "Our proposal is certainly more 
interesting for Austria than the former one, because it sticks 
to those points of the transit agreement that are important for 
you, such as its nationwide applicability," an Italian diplomat 
told DIE PRESSE. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, the transit issue is also straining ongoing 
negotiations between the five EFTA [European Free Trade 
Association] countries that participate in the European Economic 
Area [EEA] and the EU on adopting over 400 EU legal regulations, 
which have came into force in the EU since August 1991 -- the 
date set for the EEA Agreement. Austria rejects some of the new 
EU regulations regarding road-use fees or the transportation of 
dangerous goods as incompatible with the transit agreement.

<F P=106> [Report by Norbert Mayer and Thomas Mayer: "EU Locomotive at </F>
Full Blast"] 
  [Text] Vienna, Brussels -- On Friday [21 January], Austria 
and the European Union [EU] reached agreements on another two of 
29 chapters, namely competition policy and free trade in 
services. This means that 15 of the 29 chapters have now been 
ticked off. The major part of the remaining issues is to reach 
the agreement stage by the beginning of February. This means 
that from next week on, the accession locomotive will be running 
at full blast. 
  Chancellor Franz Vranitzky stressed the "enormous 
importance" 
of his visit to Greece, which currently holds the EU Presidency. 
The "big chunks" -- agriculture, transit, and second homes -- 
will become central issues. The Social Democratic Party's 
foreign policy spokesman, Peter Schieder, told DER STANDARD: "We 
will find a solution to all of these issues." 
  Vienna is preparing for the following compromise solutions: 
transit agreement to run throughout its envisaged period but 
including East European and domestic transport; domestic and 
foreign transport to be treated equally; no "sensitive regions" 
but nationwide applicability; increasing weight limit from 38 to 
40 tonnes. For agriculture and second homes, transition periods 
of four to five years are envisaged. The talks on foreign trade 
policy were slowed down by Austria during Friday's negotiations. 
As Austria sees its brown coal mining endangered by imports 
from East Europe, it aims at a five-year transition period, 
which has been rejected so far by Brussels on the grounds of EU 
antidumping regulations. The chapter on customs union has also 
been completed apart from expiration dates on Austrian forms. 
The customs union will do away with country of origin 
regulations, which have been a great problem to Austrian 
exporters and have obstructed across-the-border processing. 
  In Brussels, a new working group has started formulating the 
first final agreements in order to avoid bottlenecks later on.

<F P=106> [Report signed "pur": "Vranitzky Strictly Against Regular </F>
Army"] 
  [Excerpt] Vienna -- On 18 January Chancellor Franz 
Vranitzky sharply rejected the idea of a regular army, which was 
suggested by Austrian People's Party [OeVP] Chairman Erhard 
Busek. The chief of the Social Democratic Party of Austria 
[SPOe] said that all objective facts speak against such a form 
of national defense; moreover, Busek's move had come "absolutely 
at the wrong time." The restructuring of the Army, which was 
agreed upon in 1992, would only be implemented in two years and, 
therefore, one could not think about introducing something new 
now. In addition, a regular army would be much too expensive 
and had not proven successful in other countries. Defense 
Minister Werner Fasslabend (OeVP) said it should not be 
forbidden to discuss the idea of a regular army. However, in 
view of the current threat, the strength of the militia army 
could not be reduced in the next few years. [passage omitted]

to St. Stephen's Square was organized by the "SOS Fellow Man" 
group to protest against isolating foreigners, underprivileged, 
and poor people ("Human beings come first"). A total of 5,000 
people participated in the procession. [passage omitted] 
  In St. Stephen's Square, the number of participants 
increased 
to 10,000. During the final rally, writer Johannes Mario Simmel 
warned against newly developing right-wing extremism. He said: 
"The Nazis are on the advance like never before since 1945." He 
said the letter-bomb attacks in Austria are only a "preliminary 
culmination point." [passage omitted].

  [Text] Vladimir Dlouhy, [Czech] minister of industry and 
trade, is on a one-day visit to Austria today. Marie Budhansova 
reports from Vienna: 
  [Begin Budhansova recording] Vladimir Dlouhy, minister of 
industry and trade of the Czech Republic, is in Vienna today at 
the invitation of the Austrian Government. 
  In the morning, Dlouhy met with Victor Klima, minister of 
transport and public works. According to Mr. Fojtik, the 
commercial counsellor of the Czech Embassy, the Austrian side 
was interested in questions connected with supplies of oil and 
gas to the Czech Republic, progress and details of 
privatization, and problems of the Czech metallurgical industry 
where Austrian firms are involved. 
  Minister Dlouhy was briefed by his hosts on the

<F P=106> [By Jean Burner] </F>
  [Text] Vienna, Jan 19 (AFP) -- Several countries in East 
Europe can expect to see fragile growth this year after five 
years of recession, but unemployment will also rise, experts at 
the WIIW economic research institute here said. 
  Poland, which in 1993 was the only country in the whole of 
East Europe to achieve growth, of about four percent, should 
continue to recover. Its gross domestic product (GDP) should 
grow by 4.5 percent in 1994. 
  This performance should be followed by that of the Czech 
Republic with growth of two percent and of Slovenia with one 
percent. 
  However, experts have calculated that in Poland, despite the 
growth, GDP at the end of 1993 was 14 percent below the figure 
for 1989 which was the last year of state-direction of the 
economy before the collapse of communism in East Europe. 
  Czech GDP was 25 percent below the figure in 1989. 
  Hungary, the favoured country for Western investment, would 
again experience zero growth this year, but Slovakia, Romania 
and Bulgaria would go through their fifth consecutive year of a 
decline in GDP of about two percent. 
  But this would represent a sharp improvement from a decline 
of about six percent in 1993. 
  The institute here was less optimistic about former members 
of the Soviet Union, chief among them Russia and Ukraine. It 
said that GDP in Russia would decline by seven percent and in 
Ukaraine by 12 percent. In 1993 their GDP figures had fallen by 
15 percent. 
  Most of the countries in East Europe would also improve 
their 
performances on inflation. The Czech Republic might reduce its 
inflation rate from 21 percent to 11 percent, Poland from 39 
percent to 28 percent, Slovenia from 30 percent to 20 percent 
and Slovakia from 23 percent to 18 percent. 
  But in Hungary inflation would rise slightly from 24 percent 
to 25 percent. 
  In the Balkans, it would fall to 55 percent in Bulgaria from 
75 percent, and to 200 percent in Romania from 300 percent. 
  The main indicator weighing on the outlook was unemployment. 
Privatisation, and increase in the number of bankruptcies and a 
strengthing of corporate financial discipline, would increase 
unemployment further despite a general improvement in the 
economic situation. 
  Poland, leading the way to growth, would have an 
unemployment 
rate of 18 percent representing more than three million people, 
at the end of 1994. Bulgaria, Slovenia and Slovakia would have 
an average rate of about 18 percent. The rate of unemployment 
in Hungary and Romania was likely to stabilise at about 12 
percent. 
  The Czech Republic, owing to an ingenious system of early 
retirement and strong growth in the private sector, should 
achieve the best result with a rate of seven percent. 
  Another worrying aspct of these economies was the trade 
deficit which appeared in 1993 and was likely to increase this 
year, the economists said. 
  The institute said that it expected the overall deficit for 
the seven countries to total 7.2 billion dollars from 6.8 
billion dollars in 1993. 
  Hungary and Poland, which in 1992 had achieved spectacular 
surpluses, would be the most affected. Hungary was likely to 
report a deficit of 2.7 billion dollars and Poland of 1.9 
billion dollars. 
  Exports to industrialised countries were likely to increase 
slightly but imports would again rise strongly.

  [Excerpt] Deputy Prime Minister Guy Coeme was in principle 
due to be heard at 1300 hours by the special commission of the 
chamber in charge of dealing with the lifting of his 
parliamentary immunity. But there was a surprise late this 
morning. We first heard that Guy Coeme was going to make a 
statement to the press at his office at 1215 hours, that is 45 
minutes before his hearing by the commission of the chamber. 
Then, at 1209 hours, a communique from the royal palace said 
this: On the proposal of the prime minister, the king has 
accepted the resignation of Mr. Guy Coeme from his post of 
deputy prime minister, communications minister, and public 
companies minister. Guy Coeme explained his resignation just a 
few minutes ago. I invite you to listen to extensive excerpts 
from his statement: 
  [Begin Coeme recording] I have decided of my own free will 
to 
renounce my ministerial duties. I was wrong to believe that 
when one is innocent one has nothing to fear. I was wrong to 
believe that I could work in serenity while defending myself. I 
will have to face an increasingly fierce fight every day. It is 
a political fight, because this affair has become political. It 
is a fight against the media, which is fed by rumors, lies, and 
slander. I am disgusted. As this climate is not my doing, I 
think I cannot pursue my ministerial duties with the necessary 
serenity. 
  I am clear-minded. I don't want the government to suffer 
from this; I don't want my party to suffer from this, and, above 
all, I don't want the population to suffer from this, because I 
can no longer work under normal conditions to serve the people. 
My freedom will allow me to defend myself with all my energy to 
bring the truth to light. 
  My innocence will be proved. I am going to the special 
commission of the chamber to reaffirm that there has been no 
forgery and no use of forgery, that nothing illegal has been 
done, and that there is absolutely nothing to blame me for. My 
conscience is clear. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Brussels, Jan 21 (AFP) -- Two leading socialist 
officials of Belgium's French-speaking regional government 
resigned Friday [21 January], a few hours after Belgian Deputy 
Prime Minister Guy Coeme, after being embroiled in a bribery 
scandal. 
  Guy Spitaels, former Francophone Socialist Party president 
and president of the French-speaking regional government, and 
Guy Mathot, another member of that government, announced their 
decision to the press just two hours after the Royal Palace 
announced Coeme's resignation. 
  The three leaders had been accused of taking bribes and 
channelling funds to the Socialist Party in connection with the 
1988 purchase of 46 Italian Agusta helicopters for the Belgian 
Army. 
  Coeme, 48, was defence minister at the time of the 225 
million dollar purchase. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The Francophone Socialist Party, PS, has decided 
not to quit the governing coalition despite the resignation from 
office of three of its senior members. [passage omitted] 
  Their party, the Parti Socialiste, held an emergency meeting 
on Friday evening [21 January]. The party leadership decided 
not to quit the government, though it did not name successors to 
the three resigning ministers. 
  According to PS Chairman Philippe Busquin, his party is 
outraged that the whole affair has been politicized. The party 
also regrets that their Flemish coalition partners, the 
Christian Democrat CVP and the Socialist SP, refused to confirm 
their confidence in the deputy prime minister. 
  Mr. Busquin said the reason the PS is not quitting the 
government is primarily due to concerns about the social 
security system. The PS feels the system may be destroyed, and 
it wants to protect it from within the government. 
  Meanwhile, it has emerged that the anonymous witness in the 
Agusta corruption scandal is Mr. Philippe Moreau, who is also a 
member of the Francophone Socialist Party. The witness was 
identified yesterday by Mr. Coeme himself. Earlier, Philippe 
Moreau had been heard by a magistrate of the Supreme Court. 
His statements were damaging to both Guy Coeme and Guy 
Spitaels, but less so than it was assumed at first. Mr. Moreau 
did confirm that his two party colleagues told him personally 
that Agusta was prepared to pay a bribe in order to win the 
helicopter contract, but he denied that Mr. Spitaels and Mr. 
Coeme sent a courier to Luxembourg to collect the money.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 21 (AFP) -- The centre-right coalition 
government in Belgium is to remain in power despite the 
resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Guy Coeme after he became 
embroiled in a bribery scandal, Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene 
said Saturday [22 January]. 
  After meeting the leaders of the four coalition partners, 
Dehaene said in a statement that they "wish the government to 
continue its work." 
  Two other leading socialist officials of Belgium's 
French-speaking regional government resigned Friday, a few hours 
after Coeme. 
  Guy Spitaels, former Francophone Socialist Party president 
and president of the French-speaking regional government, and 
Guy Mathot, another member of that government, announced their

1988 purchase of 46 Italian Agusta helicopters for the Belgian 
Army. 
  Coeme, 48, was defence minister at the time of the 225 
million dollar purchase. 
  A judicial investigation was launched after the 
assassination 
of former Socialist Party President Andre Cools on July 18, 1991. 
  In an article entitled "Is a fuse necessary?" the 
influential 
newspaper LA LIBRE BELGIQUE wrote Friday that the affair had 
caused dismay in the centre-left coalition of socialists and 
christian-socialists which backs Dehaene's federal government.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 22 (AFP) -- Belgian Prime Minister 
Jean-Luc Dehaene reshuffled his cabinet Sunday [23 January] 
following the resignation of the deputy prime minister amid a 
lingering kickback scandal. 
  Dehaene had said Saturday that his centre-left coalition 
would remain in office despite the departure of his deputy Guy 
Coeme, who stepped down after being implicated in a scandal over 
a 1988 government helicopter contract. 
  A statement from Belgium's King Albert II said Elio Di Rupo, 
culture minister of the country's French community, was named to 
replace Coeme as deputy prime minister, minister of 
communications and public enterprises. 
  Magda De Galan, former minister of social integration, 
health 
and environment, was named minister of social affairs. 
  Jacques Santkin, a member of parliament, was named minister 
of social integration, health and environment. 
  Jean-Maurice Dehousse will be in charge of infrastructure 
while conserving his post as minister of science policy, the 
statement said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Guy Daloze: "A Necessary Fuse-Wire?"] </F>
  [Text] Pick up your newspapers again: For the last 20 
days, public life has revolved around nothing but the Agusta 
affair, blotting out all other problems, such as the global 
pact, unemployment, budget control. It's not that the 
journalists are short of ideas or copy. But all of rue de la 
Loi is seemingly paralyzed, unable to really concentrate on 
anything else. And rightly so, as the affair raises so many 
political and ethical problems, as the impact assumes growing 
importance and is now touching upon the very future of our 
democratic system. And it is going to continue. It is 
impossible to settle just like that, with just a few statements 
of principle, an affair which has kept the legal profession busy 
for two and one-half years. 
  And that is the whole problem: Our country cannot afford the 
luxury of such a paralysis, especially saince it is accompanied 
by the harbingers of a crisis. Since the debates by the Chamber 
of Deputies and the "signals" which its partners have sent to 
the PS [Socialist Party], in practice the coalition has ceased 
to exist in parliament while Jean-Luc Dehaene gives no more than 
half-hearted support for his first deputy prime minister, Guy 
Coeme. Especially also as the damage increases: Public opinion 
is becoming increasingly scornful of politicians, certain 
journalists are happy to rely on anonymous informers to launch 
scathing attacks, and a party as important as the VLD [Flemish 
Liberals and Democrats] does not hesitate to play the dangerous 
card of an extreme right- wing, antiparliamentary formation. 
  Government paralysis, coalition in danger, deteriorating 
climate and attitudes: The diagnosis is clear and calls for 
urgent measures. We respect the right to defense and the 
presumption of innocence. But we know that a nation, a 
community, a party, and a coalition cannot remain insensitive to 
the concept of greater interests. As the politician responsible 
for the helicopter affair, Guy Coeme has but a few days to 
convince. Or to resign: Fuse wires are sometimes necessary.

  [Text] The Hague, Jan 20 (AFP) -- Dutch MP Hans Janmaat 
caused an outcry Thursday [20 January] with remarks to be 
published in the weekly magazine ELSEVIER in which he called for 
the resignation of the justice minister on the grounds that he 
is Jewish. 
  Janmaat, sole parliamentary representative of the Centrum 
Democrat party, said of Ernst Hisch Ballin: "For Jews to be 
nomads, fine, but that they should enjoy public office, no." 
  He added that it was natural that Ballin's parents should 
flee Germany during the Nazi persecutions, "but why did he come 
to the Netherlands?" 
  Judicial officials said that Janmaat would be charged with 
racist and discriminatory comments. 
  A Justice Ministry spokesman said Ballin would make no 
comment on Janmaat's remarks. 
  In the same interview, Janmaat attacked the junior minister 
for agriculture, Dzsingisz Gabor, on the grounds that he was 
born in Hungary. Political life should only be open to "Dutch 
citizens of at least three generations standing," he said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Political Parties Are Already </F>
Wrangling About Van Thijn's Successor"] 
  [Text] The appointment of Amsterdam Mayor E. van Thijn as 
home affairs minister is uncontested in national politics. The 
large parties value his administrative qualities. But his 
departure from Amsterdam has launched an immediate struggle over 
the question of which political party is to supply his successor. 
  D66 [Democrats 66] says that given polls of voters' 
intentions, it is no longer self-evident that the PvdA [Labor 
Party] should provide a candidate. D66 holds few mayor's 
positions and none in the four large cities. The fact that VVD 
[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] alderman P. de Grave 
is to become acting mayor has raised questions, because De Grave 
is also the VVD's leading candidate in the municipal elections. 
  On 15 January the cabinet voted unanimously in favor of the 
nomination of Van Thijn to succeed minister Dales, who died last 
week. PvdA party leader and Deputy Prime Minister Kok said that 
in his view Van Thijn "was the first choice and the best 
candidate." 
  Van Thijn has much political and governmental experience and 
briefly held the position of home affairs minister in 1981. 
Last weekend Kok let there be no misunderstanding that he 
wanted a heavyweight like Van Thijn to strengthen the PvdA in 
the forthcoming parliamentary elections and the subsequent 
formation of a government. 
  Van Thijn had planned to give up his position as mayor no 
sooner than next year, when his second term of office was due to 
end. Kok put an end to the plan. "The PvdA needs you," he told 
Van Thijn. The party leader also wants him to remain minister in 
the following cabinet should the PvdA participate in government. 
"Although you can neither give nor ask for guarantees on that 
sort of thing," Kok said. 
  Prime Minister Lubbers said on Saturday [15 January] that 
Van 
Thijn's appointment would present Amsterdam with problems, just 
before the municipal elections. "But that was no reason not to 
appoint him," Lubbers said. "The problem would have occurred 
soon anyway, because he had indicated that he did not want a 
third term in office." 
  Today Van Thijn will resign formally as mayor and will be 
sworn in tomorrow by Queen Beatrix. Lubbers did not want to 
speculate on the political color of the future mayor of 
Amsterdam. "In the first place that is a question for the 
Queen's commissioner in North Holland, who is approaching a 
successor in consultation with the municipal council."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Hungarian Industry Minister </F>
Latorcai by J.F. Hinrichs; place and date not given: "Hungarian 
Industry Minister Wants No Devaluation, but Greater Efficiency: 
`The West Pays Too Little Attention To Us'"] 
  [Text] The attention paid to Hungary has somewhat decreased 
in recent years. While Communism reigned, Hungary was the 
conspicuous, stubborn little reformer. Now it is the only 
country where the economic reforms can be continued normally, 
without resulting in any major shocks. Whereas the reforms 
carried out elsewhere have caused necessarily large and 
spectacular shocks, Hungary had already made extensive 
preparations "on the way to the market." 
  Hungary is also the only former Socialist country where an 
active industrial policy does not mean that the previous 
planners are trying to retain their grip on businesses. Hungary 
is conducting an industrial policy in the Western sense. On 
Tuesday [18 January] and Wednesday, the Hungarian minister of 
industry and trade, Mr. Janos Latorcai, visited the Netherlands, 
where he met with Ministers Andriessen and Alders, and with 
Secretary of State Van Rooy, was a guest at Akzo, and had a 
meeting with various Netherlands bankers. 
  Latorcai said that Hungary's industrial policy comprises 
five 
main subcomponents. "Privatization is of major importance. A 
large number of companies still has to be transferred to the 
private sector. Then there is a considerable number of 
companies which are too big, and which we are splitting up into 
smaller units. We are encouraging companies to improve their 
technology and to develop new products. Then, we want to 
attract technological know-how and money from the West. And we 
are trying to encourage people to change their attitude." 
  The companies which have invested in exports to Eastern 
markets in recent years have all run into financial problems. 
As Latorcai put it: "We have a strategy aimed at reducing 
corporate debt in a manner that is compatible with the market. 
One of the instruments for doing so is to turn debt into 
shares. Sometimes one part of the debt can be eliminated. 
Since 1991, the policy has been that companies have to find a 
solution to their problems, otherwise they will go bankrupt." As 
a result, dozens of companies have gone bankrupt, unlike in 
other East European countries. 
  It is striking that unemployment is nonetheless clearly on 
the decline. In February last year, unemployment peaked at a 
level of 700,000; in December there were still 620,000 
unemployed. Thus, the level of unemployment decreased from 13.6 
to 12.1 percent, a drop that is unique in East Europe. 
  According to Latorcai there is talk within industry of 
further, considerable increases in productivity: "With a 
4-percent growth in industrial production during 1993 we still 
lost 100,000 jobs. Last year, production in industry increased 
by 10 percent. The services sector -- and tourism in particular 
-- made up for this to some extent." 
  Hungary is implementing a strict monetary policy to keep 
down 
the rate of inflation, which was rated at 22.5 percent in 
December. One of the elements of that policy is that 
devaluations of the forint have been strictly limited. Although 
he is very happy with this in his capacity as industry minister, 
are Hungarian companies not complaining loud and clear about 
their position regarding exports? 
  Latorcai responded: "Monetary policy must be seen as one 
part of a whole. It may well be that industry is complaining, 
but if further devaluations are made to stimulate exports, then 
that will only help in the short term. In the long term we are 
concerned with costs, productivity, and the development of new 
products. Devaluations freeze the technical inferiority of 
companies and only set companies even further behind." 
  Hungary, which borders Yugoslavia, Romania, Ukraine, 
Slovakia, and Austria, is an island of stability in a sea of war 
and political unrest. As Latorcai puts it: "That is the sad 
truth, and it means that we have poor sales markets in our 
immediate vicinity. The war on our southern border and the 
embargo on Yugoslavia is costing us pots of money." 
  And then he switched over to the favorite subject of every 
member of the Hungarian Government. He hastens to reiterate 
that none of this is preventing foreign capital from flowing 
into Hungary in abundance. In 1993, foreign investments 
totalled $2.2 billion, compared with $1.7 billion in the 
previous two years. Over five years, a total of $7 billion has 
been invested in Hungary. "That," maintained Latorcai, 
"certainly means something. More than half of what has been 
invested in East Europe has gone to Hungary." 
  After the disintegration of the Habsburg empire, Hungary 
shrank considerably in geographical terms, leaving large 
Hungarian minorities in its neighboring countries. These total 
five million, and their plight has been a continual source of 
tension since the fall of Communism. Several of Hungary's 
neighbors are now maintaining that Budapest wants to change its 
borders. 
  The minister left no doubt as to the fact that the 
government 
in Budapest is not advocating border changes. "However, we do 
feel responsible for the Hungarians in our neighboring 
countries, and we are demanding that their rights be respected, 
that there be no discrimination, and that they are given the 
chance to speak their own language, and be educated in 
Hungarian." 
  Latorcai says that his government is maintaining normal 
contact with the government of nationalist [President] Meciar in 
Slovakia: "We are always ready to take the first step in our 
contacts with Slovakia," he claimed. In May there are general 
elections, and there would seem to be a good chance of the 
present tripartite coalition losing its majority. Is it 
conceivable that the ultranationalist Istvan Csurka, who wants 
the question of Hungary's borders to be discussed, will be 
included in the coalition? Latorcai claimed not: "The coalition 
wants to exclude extremists." 
  However, he was not enthusiastic regarding the attitude 
adopted by the West in the recent debate on the extension of 
NATO, saying -- diplomatically -- that Budapest regards the 
Partnership for Peace as merely a first step along the road to 
full membership. However, he had to concede that absolutely no 
guarantee had been given. "West Europe places too much emphasis 
on regions that are much further afield," he said. "It is a 
mistake to overlook us. If something goes wrong in East Europe, 
then West Europe will not escape the consequences. There is now 
a possibility to do away with the distinction between East and 
West Europe. We must seize this opportunity."

<F P=106> [Article by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd: "The Answer Is </F>
Yes"] 
  [Text] It might seem rather odd, in the midst of my visit 
to the turmoil in Bosnia, to say that the world is a little bit 
safer this week. However, that, I believe, is the outcome of 
last week's NATO summit in Brussels. 
  Summits are odd creatures. An EC summit, however well 
prepared, is always an occasion for some jousting between the 
great ones on the second morning. NATO summits come less often, 
and are even more intensively prepared: officials hope that in 
this way the summit will be a stately dance with no trip-ups or 
stumbles. 
  This last summit in Brussels was admirably prepared. But the 
questions before the Alliance, quite apart from the essential 
discussion of Bosnia, were so fundamental that they could not be 
handled in a routine way. It came out well. The main decisions 
are fundamental to the future security of Britain. Would the 
idea of the Atlantic Alliance hold? Would the allies show the 
imagination needed to extend security across our continent? 
Could NATO adapt itself to the new disorders which have largely 
replaced the old Armageddon scenario of East versus West? 
  The summit answered yes to all three questions. 
  Much depended on President Clinton. He reaffirmed 
unequivocally the American commitment to Europe and the Atlantic 
Alliance. He made clear that 100,000 American troops would 
remain in Europe to buttress the peace and stability which we 
have enjoyed for more than 40 years. Of course the United 
States is hugely interested in Asia. But we can now have a truce 
to the stories that interest in Asia means neglect of Europe. 
  It is a measure of NATO's success that we tend not to think 
about it very much. NATO is just there, getting on with its 
job. Few institutions do their job so confidently and 
effectively. Without NATO, we could not have protected our 
freedom from communist expansion. 
  American servicemen in Europe are the most tangible 
expression of that commitment. The voices raised against that 
presence are reassuringly few. Anti-Americanism is out of 
fashion on the European Left. Isolationism in the U.S. is still 
confined to small pockets within the Democratic and Republican 
parties. 
  The European willingness confirmed at Maastricht, to build 
up 
the European pillar of the Alliance has shown sceptical 
Americans that we are serious about sharing the burden of 
collective defence. The closer French involvement in dialogue 
with the Americans and in the new work of the Alliance is good 
news for us all. 
  But there is another reason for America's renewed commitment 
to the Alliance: it is the sight of new democracies knocking on 
NATO's door. The United States will not invest money, troops 
and political attention in the European continent simply to 
protect rich West Europeans. During the Cold War it was NATO's 
task to defend the line dividing freedom and communism against 
encroachment from the East. It did that well; but now the line 
has evaporated and the task has changed. 
  Since 1989, people have looked to NATO to extend security 
and 
stability to the new democracies of Central and East Europe. 
That is in Britain's interests. If we want to reduce the risk 
of war in West Europe we have to tackle the causes of insecurity 
and instability in the East. 
  How, then, to respond? NATO has taken in new members before 
-- Greece, Turkey, Germany and Spain. There is no bar in 
principle to its enlarging again. But enlargement is a serious 
undertaking -- more, perhaps, than some seem to realise. The 
NATO treaty says an armed attack against one signatory should be 
considered an attack against them all. 
  Britain has gone to war twice this century in Europe on 
behalf of others. Through NATO we would be ready to do so again 
if necessary. But a decision to extend NATO's territory and 
commit our troops to the defence of new borders cannot be taken 
lightly. We are not talking about membership of a social club. 
  Deep down we know NATO cannot remain closed. I do not see 
how we could deny to other Europeans the benefits which NATO has 
brought us. The summit recognised this. It took decisions 
which opened the clear perspective of NATO's eventual 
enlargement. We agreed it would require great care: the object, 
after all, is to strengthen peace and stability in Europe. 
  Any hasty decision about who does and does not belong to 
NATO risks creating a new division in Europe. We do not want to 
set Russia's teeth dangerously on edge. Hence the idea of 
Partnership for Peace, which everybody, including Russia, is 
invited to join on the basis of shared democratic principles and 
military co-operation. 
  The idea is simple: all members of the old Warsaw Pact will 
have the chance to enter into individual partnership programmes 
with NATO. Each country possesses different military assets and 
different experience, so each will choose different dishes from 
the NATO menu. Each will undertake, with NATO, to meet specific 
political objectives. 
  These could include joining international treaties, civilian 
control of the military, transparency in defence budgets. In 
return, NATO will draw each partner into its mechanisms for 
planning, training and consultation. If partners are ready to 
participate, we would hope to involve them in NATO-led 
peacekeeping operations. 
  This is a sensible and practical way forward. It means that 
NATO is committed to the principle of enlargement, but we are 
not determining in advance who or when or under what precise 
conditions. 
  So the summit has left us much clearer about how to handle 
our friends in Central and East Europe. Some of those friends 
would have liked us to go further. All accept that we have 
moved a good way. We also talked in a new way about how to 
handle the threats we face. Most of the security threats we can 
foresee will require a mobile and flexible response from NATO, 
as the Gulf and Bosnian conflicts have shown. Peacekeeping and 
humanitarian operations will become more frequent but not easier. 
  NATO should be able to deploy forces overseas on 
international missions and involve non-allies if we wish. Not 
all the NATO allies need be involved on every occasion. For 
example, European forces within NATO could deploy with Alliance 
support if the U.S. sees no immediate interest and it is agreed 
that the Europeans should lead. 
  So the summit endorsed the idea of a Combined Joint Task 
Force headquarters. These could run operations to be carried 
out by NATO, or if that was what we all decided, by, for 
example, the European members of NATO. This means that as the 
new European common foreign and security policy gradually takes 
shape, built brick by brick on particular decisions, there will 
be means within NATO to carry out European decisions. 
  The Western European Union is the link between the two. It 
sounds complicated because it is complicated, and much work 
still needs to be done on the linkages. But the agreement in 
Brussels last week means that there is no question of NATO being 
sidelined. The Atlantic and European institutions grow side by 
side. 
  One benefit is that France -- which for many years kept its 
distance from NATO's military activities -- will now play a 
larger role in Alliance operations, as she has in Yugoslavia. I 
welcome this. Britain and France already both move effectively 
together as substantial European military powers. 
  FinallY, we agreed that preventing the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction is one of NATO's main aims. We want 
to see an indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty. The Americans have notched up a great success in 
bringing the Russian and Ukrainian governments to an agreement 
on nuclear warheads in Ukraine. 
  It is easy enough to reaffirm faith in NATO with eloquent 
speeches. Rhetoric is the bugbear of modern diplomacy. But 
this summit did more than that. It took decisions which will 
ensure that it remains supple. It showed that NATO is willing 
to contribute to security throughout Europe. It showed that the 
future of NATO can be as impressive as its past.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, by David </F>
Davenpower, in Belfast on 22 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] It is nearly six weeks now since Albert 
Reynolds and John Major issued their Downing Street Declaration 
aimed at securing a cessation of violence in Ireland. But 
there's still no sign of the Republican movement coming up with 
its response. Britain insists it won't clarify the document for 
Sinn Fein, but that party says it cannot decide its position 
without clarification. The past week has seen the two 
governments attempting to put fresh impetus into the initiative. 
Also in the past week, it became possible legally to broadcast 
interviews with members of Sinn Fein for the first time in 21 
years. So, when our northern editor, David Davenpower, met the 
Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, in Belfast yesterday, he asked 
him first to respond to the observation of the deputy leader of 
the SDLP [Social Democratic and Labor Party], Seamus Mallon, on 
the issue of self-determination. Mr. Mallon had said that under 
that heading, there wasn't a whisker of a difference between the 
declaration in Downing Street and the Hume-Adams document. 
  [Begin recording] [Adams] Well, Mr. Mallon is wrong. And, I 
mean, one has to be a bit patient because in all these matters 
party political people, especially people in leadership, always 
have a temptation to advance their own party political platform. 
So, obviously, if Mr. Mallon was right the IRA leadership, 
which last year endorsed what was called the Hume-Adams, surely 
having endorsed that they would have speedily moved to embrace 
the Downing Street Declaration. John Major rejected, in a very 
public way in the British House of Commons, and insulted in a 
very public way John Hume, and at Brussels did exactly the same 
thing in the joint communique. So he clearly saw a difference 
between what is called Hume-Adams and what is now the Downing 
Street Declaration [words indistinct] put the thing back. And 
this is quite clear, if the British think, genuinely seriously 
think that Sinn Fein is playing for time, why don't they call 
our bluff. We are not playing for time. The British Government 
have never engaged positively on this issue since we started to 
move forward on a peace process. And we shouldn't go into side 
tracks around this. We live here. Major doesn't. Major is a 
lame duck prime minister. A man who goes from scandal to 
scandal, from crisis to crisis .... 
  [Davenpower] That's all very well, Gerry Adams, but just 
spell out for us, if you will, this crucial difference between 
the Hume-Adams principles and the Downing Street Declaration. 
Where's the problem? 
  [Adams] Well, the, first of all, first of all, if there is 
no 
difference, or if those who say there is no difference, they 
should then clarify what is clearly not obvious at the moment. 
Secondly, if there is only a narrow gap, or even if there's a 
wider gap, we must move to bridge that gap and if the 
governments move I will respond positively to the move also. 
  [Davenpower] We know all this, but what is the difference? 
  [Adams] Well, I'll tell you the difference now, but what I'm 
pointing out is, notwithstanding the difference, that we must 
move to bridge the difference. Now, what was envisaged in the 
Irish peace initiative and what was outlined was that the Irish 
people as a whole, exercising the right to self-determination, 
the British Government accepting that as a policy objective, the 
Dublin government accepting that as a policy objective, and 
within a broad time frame, which wasn't agreed, but within a 
broad time frame, moving us all in that direction. In other 
words, the British joining the persuaders. The British moving, 
with Dublin. And all of it done in consultation with ourselves 
and seeking the consent and the maximum consent and 
participation of the Unionists. Now that clearly, if that is 
contained in the Downing Street Declaration, then I wish, I am 
anxious, I want to be convinced that that is the case. The 
standoff from my point of view is intolerable. It's silly and 
it's bizarre that a British Government which says it has a 
settlement won't explain the basis of that settlement. 
  [Davenpower] But most of what you've outlined is in fact 
contained in Paragraph Four of the Downing Street Declaration. 
If we just refer to here the relevant section is that the 
British Government agree that it's for the people of the island 
of Ireland alone, which is what you want, by agreement between 
the two parts respectively, to exercise their right of 
self-determination, and the British Government's representative 
here, Patrick Mayhew, has further said that any conclusion is 
possible as a result of that act of self-determination --even a 
united Ireland if that's the conclusion, so be it. 
  [Adams] Well you see, well that is making, if I can say so, 
a 
virtue out of a necessity. If the Irish people have the right 
to self-determination it isn't up the British to have any say in 
how that right should be exercised or even to put in any 
predetermined end to that. But the questions which, David, 
which run from that -- I mean are we now to accept that the 
six-county state is a nation, that the six-county state has the 
right to national self- determination, or are we to accept that 
a united Ireland is dependent upon Patrick Mayhew. What, if the 
Irish people have the right to self-determination of course we 
have always had that right [as heard]. I mean Ireland has only 
been divided for the last 70 years and if the right's been 
denied us how do we exercise that right? 
  [Davenpower] If that's the nub of it then, you want a vote 
-- an all-Ireland vote -- on the same day to decide which way 
the island proceeds politically? 
  [Adams] Well, we cannot even collapse the principle of 
national self-determination into one of being a mere vote. 
National self-determination is the right of a people, of a 
nation, without any outside impediment to determine their own, 
as far as their own economic affairs, their own political 
affairs, their own social affairs. Now that is 
self-determination in terms of the United Nations and of other 
universal declarations and of how it has been exercised now. 
  And in any of the discussions which, for example, John Hume 
and I had, we said that the Irish people as a whole have the 
right to self-determination, we said the majority of people of 
Ireland accept this, we said that there is not agreement on how 
that should be exercised: that part of our task has to be to 
agree on how that right should be exercised. 
  But one thing is clear, from any democratic position the 
British Government have no right to any say in how the people of 
this country, 32 counties of this country, exercise our right to 
decide our own future, and that is bedrock, and for the British 
to, on the one hand, address that issue and then, from the other 
hand, to appear to be qualifying it so heavily as to 
predetermine the future, appears to me to be so vague and so 
obscure and so semantical that it needs clarification. 
  [Davenpower] But what are you going to do with the million 
Protestants, the million Unionists, living in this part of the 
island of Ireland, who don't want to know, and whose property 
and whose businesses are being blown up by people in your name 
just this week? 
  [Adams] Well, first of all, the Unionists have no reason to 
move, none whatsoever. For the last 70 years and before that, 
but particularly for the last 20 years, the Unionists' position 
has been underwritten by British governments. Until the British 
Government joins the persuaders, until the British Government 
says to the Unionists -- your future rests with the rest of the 
Irish people, and we want to help to bring that about, we want 
to move, we want to cooperate -- now we as Republicans and 
Nationalists and everyone else have to appreciate the real 
concerns that Unionists have about their future in an 
all-Ireland context, and I think we have to be flexible, and I 
think that we have to reach out, and I think that we have to 
develop a whole process of what we have called national 
reconciliation. 
  Now, the conflict that has consumed everyone here for the 
last 20-odd years, no section of the people here have any 
monopoly on suffering out of that. Every section of our people 
in this state and the people in Britain, and people throughout 
all of Ireland have suffered as the result of the 
institutionalized violence, the wide range of armed actions by 
all of the factions involved, and the complete disruption of 
life in this state, so that must be brought to an end. 
  [Davenpower] But still, effectively, don't those million 
Unionists represent a million vetoes? Don't they actually hold, 
they can in a practical way, block political progress along your 
chosen road? 
  [Adams] Of course they can, and they have been doing so. But 
what about the Nationalists in this state? Have the 
Nationalists consent? Is it not required? Is a Nationalist -- 
is there a Nationalist veto going to be awarded? I mean, where 
are we going to get here if we all get into a situation of 
everyone having a veto? And I go back to my Fermanagh remarks. 
I mean, if one wants to clarify the six-county area -- and I'm 
not, I'm totally opposed to repartition. But I'm just looking 
at -- if you reduce democracy to mathematics, you know, why not 
one county? Why not West Belfast? Why not Derry or South Down, 
or Armagh or Tyrone? Why not get into that nonsense? And I 
think when you get into that it's just, it's so, it's such a 
crazy conclusion that one has to then come back out of it and 
say, right, let's look around the broad principle of national 
self-determination. How do we best rule, how do we best govern 
ourselves? 
  [Davenpower] Where does your stance on the whole issue of 
Unionist consent now lie? Because when you agreed your 
principles with John Hume, you agreed that consent and 
allegiance was essential for any political progress, that's 
Unionist consent and allegiance. Yet this week in a speech here, 
in Conway Mill, you seemed to be moving away from that. You 
derided the whole notion of Unionist consent; you said that the 
British Government only needed it when it suited them. Where do 
you stand? Do you -- do you feel now that Unionist consent is 
an absolute prerequisite for any agreement? 
  [Adams] I, you cannot have an agreement unless all sections 
of our people, and this particularly is aimed at the Unionists, 
can come to an agreement with it. So their consent is obviously 
and absolutely necessary. But to use that notion and that very 
necessary attaining of consent as a precondition not to move to 
me is just crazy. We're very -- you know, look back on the last 
20 years. What have the Unionist leaderships -- and I think 
they're out of step with grass-roots Unionists in this -- but 
what have the Unionist leaderships initiated or agreed to or 
volunteered in terms of improving the situation? Not one of the 
very modest reforms on housing, on any other issue which was at 
the nub of the civil rights campaign. Some of them will even 
tell you, some of the Unionist leaderships will tell you that 
there is never discrimination, even yet! Where did all of the 
talks, all of the initiatives from way back in 1970 through 
Sunningdale, through Darlington, through the Hillsborough Treaty 
-- what movement did the Unionists make towards that? And in 
all of my criticism of Unionism, I have to say that they behave 
as they behave because the British Government (?come in) and 
underpin their position. I mean look at the relationship 
between Molyneaux and Major. Look at the issue of 
clarification. Ask yourself, is the reason why John Major is 
refusing to give clarification to Sinn Fein because he fears 
losing the support of the official Unionists? 
  [Davenpower] But to return to the nub of the impasse at the 
moment -- what you call this intolerable standoff -- it seems to 
me that the British Government has swallowed a great deal of 
Hume-Adams in the wording of the joint Downing Street 
Declaration. It's swallowed the notion of a united Ireland being 
a reasonable aspiration. It's swallowed the entire notion of 
self-determination for the Irish people as a whole. Why can't 
you go to the IRA and say, look what we've achieved; this is 
enough, lay down your guns now? 
  [Adams] But David, we never need a British Government to 
tell us that a united Ireland is a reasonable [words indistinct] 
this fact, please, even former taoiseachs [prime ministers] 
never asked, even though this Dublin government has probably 
done more to try and resolve the problem than predecessors, they 
never asked for a British Government to merely recognize the 
aspirations as legitimate ones. They asked them to move, to do 
something about it, to activate, to come in behind the process, 
to become persuaders. Now, the IRA is quite capable of reading 
the joint declaration for itself. Derry doesn't need me or 
anyone else to go and interpret it for it. The person who has 
the responsibility to do that is John Major. Now, I said, as 
part of the broader peace process, and the peace process is 
about demilitarization. When I was asked the question by a 
journalist in the IRISH TIMES about the IRA, and I said that 
this, as one of the strands of the peace process, that I sought 
to get what I called the package, a proposition which I could 
bring to the IRA, and which I hoped would allow the IRA to make 
definitive decisions about the conduct of its [word indistinct]. 
Now, I don't have such a proposition to put to the IRA. The 
IRA have said, as John Major has said, that they won't make 
unilateral, they won't take unilateral actions. (?Thirdly,) in 
the course of the summer, and I think that this is a fact which 
should not be lost sight of, Sinn Fein and the British 
Government in the course of protracted dialogue and contact, in 
which there was elaborations and clarifications given by both 
sides, and there was no -- from the British point of view -- 
notion of a settlement. So, if I could just take a rest for a 
second, here we have these discussions going when they had no 
settlement in mind, and they were given clarification. Now, 
they say they have the basis for a settlement and they won't 
give clarification. So it seems to me that that is a very 
bizarre attitude to this. But notwithstanding this, in the 
summer of last year the British Government proposed to us 
delegation meetings with Sinn Fein. And we successfully 
negotiated it out with them the political basis for those 
discussions and the broad conduct of those meetings, and they 
said and have said so for some time before this, this would be 
better, have a better chance of working if there was no IRA 
campaign, if the IRA stopped its campaign, if the IRA lowered 
its campaign, if the IRA did less. And at the request of the 
British Government that proposition was put to the IRA. And the 
IRA agreed to suspend its action [words indistinct] to the 
British Government, and the British Government walked away from 
it. It was on the eve of the Maastricht controversy, it was on 
the eve of the leadership crisis that Major is still involved 
in, it was coming up to Commons votes, it was at a time when 
they started to (?flirt) with the official Unionists. But, 
nonetheless, and regardless of the reasons, the fact is that the 
IRA has in fact, in order to, if you like, enhance the 
possibility of talks and the outcome of talks, had agreed to 
suspend its (?conflict). And that was turned against it and the 
British Government told lies about it, and Major, and Major 
tried to use it to cause confusion in Republican ranks. That, a 
British Government which behaves in that very disgraceful way 
has first of all no real interests in engaging in a real and 
genuine peace process. And secondly, that anything that would 
be presented as by the British Government to the IRA has to be 
one which doesn't have the same baggage as that which engaged 
both sides last summer. But I'm also saying that I'm still 
anxious and still believe that the broad peace process is going 
to bring us about a negotiated settlement. I think we're in a 
critical phase of it. I think the onus is very clearly upon the 
British to move us out of this phase. and I think we are going 
to move out of it. How long it takes is a question that has to 
be asked of John Major. 
  [Davenpower] But if the IRA were prepared to offer a 
cease-fire of two weeks duration during the summer, why can they 
not make that gesture, that monumentally courageous gesture that 
John Hume has dubbed this, of calling a cease-fire now at what 
you acknowledge is a critical stage of the peace process? 
  [Adams] Because it's, because, and this is a matter [word 
indistinct] matter absolutely for the IRA to decide upon, 
because it doesn't see that it has the basis in terms of the 
current phase of the peace process.... 
  [Davenpower] It doesn't feel that it has got enough from 
the British, is that what you are saying? 
  [Adams] Well, what it has from the British is a 
free-standing 
statement which is a masterpiece of ambiguity. Which, which 
James Molyneaux says, and is not contradicted by the British, 
has nothing in it for Nationalists. Which John Major says is 
not a time scale for a united Ireland, is not, in fact, heading 
towards a united Ireland. Which, if I can put it to you like 
this, Major says, and this is the language he uses, now you 
don't hear this language being used in South Africa, or the 
Palestinian-Israel process, he throws down a gauntlet. He then 
says that if the IRA stops that Sinn Fein will go through a 
12-week decontamination process. Now this is the language he is 
using to people who (?vote) for us in this state. They have to 
go through a decontamination process and then we can talk to 
British civil servants about how the IRA can surrender its 
weapons. Now, is that a serious, is that, I mean, is that what 
people, what your listeners seriously think anyone could bring 
to the IRA? 
  [Davenpower] If John Major hadn't made the speech, to which 
Republicans apparently have taken exception, in the House of 
Commons on the afternoon of the joint declaration, would you 
have a sufficient package to bring to the IRA? Is the joint 
declaration without the Major commentary a suitable basis for a 
negotiated settlement? 
  [Adams] Well, he did make the speech. And we can't deal with 
a hypothetical situation. There are three areas, there is the 
declaration itself, there is the contradictory interpretations 
by both governments of it, and particularly the utterances of 
Major and other cabinet ministers. And then there is where or 
how does this declaration fit into the peace process? And I 
have to bring you back again to the start of the interview. 
This, this, I mean, this declaration came well along the road 
of a peace process, this declaration came at the end of a year 
which had seen frenzied activity to try and build peace. So it 
is a response to that and a product of that, and what 
Republicans, you see, and Nationalists have to apply ourselves 
to, is this merely almost a counteroffensive by the British, is 
this sort of a government which didn't want to be in open 
confrontation with the Dublin government trying to get together 
some arrangement to deal with the crisis? And a government 
which is almost in a permanent crisis, to deal with the crisis 
of that time. Or is it genuinely a [words indistinct] a process 
in which we can move ahead. I mean, that's the broad context in 
which this has to be viewed. And the commentary, the 
understanding of the prime ministers is crucial to this. I mean 
it's their statement, they told us last year only governments 
can take initiatives, which is a bit strange, but there you are. 
They told us only governments can take initiatives, and this is 
their initiative. They told us there isn't a solution. So, 
where do we go? What is the next step? And why do we have to 
wait? Why in the middle of a situation where people are, as we 
sit here probably, planning to kill other people, where you have 
armies out there -- Loyalist army, British Army, Republican 
army, why do we, why do the British Government put a barricade 
up of nonclarification and hide behind it and engage in 
megaphone propaganda with Sinn Fein? Why can't they provide for 
Sinn Fein what they have provided for the other parties? 
  [Davenpower] As you say, across Northern Ireland it's a sad 
reality that people are probably planning to kill other people, 
some of them in your name, some of them the so-called godfathers 
of the IRA. Could I ask you at this juncture: What is the 
precise nature of the relationship between your party and the 
IRA? 
  [Adams] Well, Sinn Fein is not the IRA and this needs to be 
clearly said again and again and again. And the IRA is not Sinn 
Fein. I wouldn't try to distance myself as an individual 
Republican from the IRA. I think it would be dishonest, I've 
never tried to do that. I think it would be intellectually 
dishonest, and I think it would be immoral. I accept as a 
Republican leader, as I think other political leaders have to 
accept, a responsibility for what is happening here. But I 
don't lead the IRA. I am a leader of Sinn Fein. Sinn Fein is 
engaged in developing (?unarmed) strategies. Sinn Fein has been 
involved in a long evolution of policy and of strategy going 
back almost over a decade. Most of it missed because of the 
problems created by our censorship. And the main function of 
Sinn Fein now as a political party is to build the peace 
process; and the political priority for me, and the personal 
priority for me, is to assist in enhancing and developing and 
moving that whole process forward. I want to see an end to the 
IRA. I want to see an end to all the organizations which have 
citizens of this country engaged in armed actions. I want to 
see an end to it, I want to see a peaceful progress being made 
towards, as a Republican, I want to see an independent Ireland, 
but a peaceful development towards an accord which everyone can 
give their allegiance to. 
  [Davenpower] But is Sinn Fein subject in the rules of the 
Republican Army to the IRA? 
  [Adams] Not at all, not at all, that's a nonsense. 
  [Davenpower] Well, you said yourself that Sinn Fein was on a 
par with the IRA while still recognizing the army as the supreme 
authority. That's in an interview in 1984. Has that changed? 
  [Adams] My position has consistently been of developing Sinn 
Fein from almost being a poor second cousin, that we all come 
from the same broad constituency. 
  [Davenpower] Is the IRA still the supreme authority in the 
Republican movement? 
  [Adams] Not at all, not at all. The army deals with its 
armed struggle and Sinn Fein deals with its unarmed struggle, 
and Sinn Fein will take decisions openly and democratically at 
our [word indistinct] meetings, that's local level, or at [word 
indistinct]. And we never go to some anonymous grouping of 
people, having come to some democratic conclusion, and say, oh, 
is it OK for us to do this. We move forward, and clearer and 
clearer in recent times you can see how Sinn Fein can actually 
bring about, from a Republican perspective, a situation where 
the IRA in a multilateral way can move into a demilitarized 
situation. 
  [Davenpower] OK, so the relationship is one that's evolving. 
It's evolved from the days in 1984 when you were in a position 
to say that the IRA was the supreme authority. Could it evolve 
to a position where Sinn Fein would break with the IRA? 
  [Adams] Well, it isn't a matter of Sinn Fein breaking. 
There is no organic connection between Sinn Fein and the IRA 
but I have to stress once again that I wouldn't seek to distance 
myself from the army and from all of those people who are in 
prison at this moment, from the suffering of this action of the 
Republican community. But what we have to do is to move the 
situation on, until there is no reason for armed actions by any 
faction, Republican, British or Loyalist, in this part of our 
country. 
  [Davenpower] You see, despite your fine words about the 
allegiance necessary from Unionists and Loyalists, it seems to 
many people that the IRA, part of the Republican family, is 
engaged in what is essentially a sectarian war. It's shoppers 
on the Shankhill Road that get killed, not shoppers in the Falls 
Road, by the IRA. It's businesses in Coleraine and not in 
Republican or Nationalist towns that get blown up and burnt. 
  [Adams] Well, any actions which have been in any way hurtful 
or harmful and, in fact, which have killed civilians, I would be 
highly critical of and have been highly critical of, and have 
done so on the spot right away (?as I can). My, my, er ... 
  [Davenpower] But you felt you had to carry the coffin of the 
perpetrator of one of the worst of those outrages. 
  [Adams] David, I don't think that we should try to heap upon 
that young man the responsibility of all that has happened here 
in the last 25 years, and when I say that I will not distance 
myself from the IRA, the people in the Shankhill Road who were 
killed are my people. The Shankhill Road's only 200 yards from 
where we are doing this interview. At the same time I wouldn't 
add any further offense to Thomas Begley's family, to his mother 
and family, his mother and father, and I think it's important 
that we don't go for the type of tabloid or knee-jerk reaction. 
  [Davenpower] But how did you feel? That outrage happened at 
a critical stage in the peace process. How did you feel? 
  [Adams] Well, at any time when these things happen, and 
particularly because I'm a Republican, when they occur as a 
result of IRA actions, of course there is a feeling of 
despondency and I, like anyone else, I'm appalled. But the only 
political response there can be, from my point of view anyway, 
is to try not to engage in the politics of the last (?tragedy), 
but to try and move to a situation where these actions don't 
happen. And, and -- I mean, one can go through the last 20 
years and pick out -- highlight atrocities, and, God forbid, but 
until we get a peace process going that's what's facing us up 
the road. 
  [Davenpower] But until the IRA show the courage to turn 
their 
back on violence, we're locked into the politics of the next 
atrocity; the next atrocity committed by the IRA could determine 
the future of this peace process, or could bring it to a halt. 
  [Adams] Of course there's always that potential. But there 
is a need for a demilitarization of the situation, and when one 
zeros just on the IRA and when you offer up -- whether it's a 
person or just a debating point that the British Army is a 
legitimate -- er -- army, no, if the British Army wasn't here, 
if the British weren't here there would be no IRA. I mean, if I 
can say so at the risk of frightening the managers of RTE, if 
the British Army were back in uniform in Dublin tomorrow there 
would be young people from all parts of Dublin, back again 
engaged in armed resistance. 
  [Davenpower] That's a hypothetical situation, you seem to be 
able to enter into hypotheses when it suits you... 
  [Adams] Well, that is, it's also the historical situation 
that when the British Army were in your part of the country they 
were met by a ruthless band of people who were criticized in 
those days by the establishment in the same way as Republicans 
are criticized... 
  [Davenpower] They had a mandate that you have just this week 
acknowledged that the IRA currently do not. 
  [Adams] What mandate did they have? 
  [Davenpower] They had a popular mandate, they had a mandate 
from the first day... 
  [Adams] [words indistinct] What about Pearse, what about 
James Connolly? 
  [Davenpower] Are you saying that... 
  [Adams] What about old Wolf Tone and Robert Emmet? What 
about 1916? Did they go out and fight elections before 1916? 
  [Davenpower] The fact is that the IRA currently... 
  [Adams] Was Plunkett elected? 
  [Davenpower] The fact is the IRA currently have support of 
a tiny minority electorally north and south. 
  [Adams] OK, the IRA doesn't contest elections, and I made it 
quite clear last week that the IRA doesn't have any electoral 
mandate, but I mean, I'm just making the point to you that Irish 
revolutionary resistance organizations don't generally have 
electoral mandates. I know of none of them, in fact, that had 
such a mandate. 
  But what -- a mandate comes from the conditions in which 
they 
exist and the mandate for the IRA today comes clearly from 
British occupation of this part of the country, and it has to be 
said that there is enough support for the IRA throughout 
Ireland, and particularly in this part of Ireland, to allow it 
to continue its campaign in perpetuity. 
  But what I want to do, as one who has spent 30 years in this 
struggle, and who has been not just at the funeral of Thomas 
Begley, but at the funeral of a lot of Republicans and also of 
ordinary civilians and neighbors and friends and family members, 
is to bring an end to a situation where an IRA, in the military 
situation which the British successfully brought about -- the 
British militarized this situation -- what I want to do is to 
bring about a demilitarization of it. 
  [Davenpower] Well what most people want to hear is the 
message that the IRA is prepared to lay down its arms, now may I 
put to you this hypothesis, that the reason you cannot go to the 
IRA and tell them to lay down their arms is because Sinn Fein 
north and south doesn't have that mandate -- it doesn't have a 
mandate, it's got 1.61 percent of the population south of the 
border, 10 percent of the population here -- and that once the 
gun is taken out of the Republican movement, Sinn Fein is 
emasculated. 
  [Adams] Not at all. Sinn Fein is in the state it's in in the 
26 counties for historical reasons, many reasons that were 
self-inflicted... 
  [Davenpower -- interrupting, Adams continues speaking in 
background] Oh come on, with all but one candidate losing his 
deposit in the last general election? 
  [Adams] This is the first time that you or anyone else in 
RTE, or that RTE listeners and viewers will have heard a Sinn 
Fein spokesperson for over 20 years. How do we expect people to 
vote for a party which the state seeks to make invisible, which 
the state seeks to strike mute, to make dumb? One cannot take 
away the potential that there was in the last 25 years to 
develop Sinn Fein in the 26 counties and that potential has been 
wrecked absolutely by censorship now. 
  Let me say this: I, as a human being the same as you, don't 
want to be locked into conflict. I want to pursue whatever 
aspirations and ambitions, which aren't all that remarkable, in 
a peaceful and normal way. I happen to live and have been born 
in a military state, in a police state, in the northeast of our 
country, which denies me my rights as a citizen. I still strive 
as a leader of Sinn Fein to develop unarmed strategies to 
counter this, but others in the context of British occupation 
take up arms and that is the reality of the situation. 
  [Davenpower] But John Hume, the joint author of those 
principles, says that there's enough in the declaration for the 
IRA to lay down their arms. He says the justification for armed 
struggle is gone. 
  [Adams] Yes, but John Hume has never been engaged in armed 
struggle. And John Hume knows very well, and he has actually 
made it clear again today that clarification should be given to 
the Republicans -- he has made that quite clear on a number of 
occasions, so let's not, you know, separate John Hume's 
particular attitude to that issue and John Hume's courageous 
commitment when he has been vilified by all sorts of people. 
  [Davenpower] But you've hedged your bets on whether the 
joint declaration has actually removed the justification for 
violence. You've said it remains to be seen whether it has or 
not. Has it? 
  [Adams] Well, first of all, that isn't a question for me. 
I'm not engaged in violence. 
  [Davenpower] No, but you have an input, presumably. 
  [Adams] No, I'm not engaged in violence, David. And I think 
that's very, very important, that Sinn Fein is not engaged in 
violence. Sinn Fein, in fact, has had 13 of our people killed 
in as many months recently. Now.... 
  [Davenpower] I accept that. But the Republican movement is 
engaged in violence. 
  [Adams] The IRA is engaged in armed struggle. The IRA 
haven't moved to endorse the Downing Street Declaration. 
  [Davenpower] OK. Another theory that has been put about is 
that one of the reasons for your inability to recommend to the 
leadership of the IRA that they should lay down their arms is 
that you are afraid of a repetition of the disastrous cease-fire 
from the IRA in the Republican movement's point of view in 1973, 
when the Republican movement effectively split. 
  [Adams] Well, first of all -- first of all -- the IRA will 
come to a decision to come to a cessation by taking its own 
counsel. Secondly, I wish to assist that process, as I have 
said. I've been part of a broad peace process and hopefully as 
a strand of that by finding a proposition to put to the army 
leadership. The reason I haven't put that to the army 
leadership isn't because I'm afraid of anything. 
  It's because I don't have it to put to them. Now, can I also 
say, there is going to be no Republican split. There's no 
potential for it, there's no reason for it, and there's no proof 
whatsoever anywhere in the broad Republican family of any 
indication that there's going to be any Republican split. So 
these things, while they're legitimate enough curiosities for 
journalists to investigate, the only reason why I cannot put 
forward any proposition to anyone is because there isn't a 
proposition there. And the reason there isn't a proposition 
there is because the British Government have decided not to give 
clarification to the people that I represent. It's OK to give 
clarification to everyone else but not to Sinn Fein. 
  [Davenpower] As we draw towards the conclusion of this 
interview -- and we've gone on I think for longer than we 
anticipated -- can I ask you about some features of your letter 
to John Major? I know you were angry that this was made public, 
but you do say that, in the letter, that the document that was 
forwarded to the British Government by the Irish Government 
earlier this year in April or June -- I can't remember which 
month -- was a suitable basis and contained enough of the 
Hume-Adams principle to have been endorsed by the IRA. What 
happened to that? 
  [Adams] I don't know. I mean this is, this is one of the 
imponderables of the situation. And, you see, all of this as 
we, as we develop it may become more difficult and more 
confusing. I remember on a number of times when there was a lot 
of deadlines being set and false hopes being raised where I 
said, look this situation is liable to be protracted, it's 
dangerous, risky, and people are going to try and confuse us. 
All I know is that the propositions that John Hume and I were 
working on were that both governments were informed at every 
stage in the development of those proposals. And all I know is 
that John Hume and I came to an agreement -- that that was given 
to the British Government. And I also know, and you know, that 
publicly the IRA endorsed it. Now, where did it go? Ask John 
Major. 
  [Davenpower] Is it your opinion that the Brussels summit 
actually saw the end of those proposals that you had put 
forward, that you had inputted into the system? 
  [Adams] Well, I am told that there is enough of them in the 
Downing Street Declaration. That's what I'm told. And if that 
is the case then I would like to move ahead on that basis. On 
what I can read myself I see no evidence that that is the case. 
But I come back to what I said earlier, that there's a gap 
between what is now on offer and what is required. Let us move 
to bridge that gap. Let's not get back to pre-April '94 [as 
heard]. Let's move forward to try and bring about peace. Let's 
not let the British Government squander -- you know, If I can 
come back again just to this whole issue -- are the Irish people 
-- whether we're Unionists or whether we're Nationalists, 
whether we have no politics at all -- are the Irish people not 
intelligent, reasonable, sensible enough to shape out some 
arrangement to live on this island without half-baked English, 
failed English, politicians being sent here by a lame duck prime 
minister to set out the rules and regulations and restrictions 
and innovations for our future? And I would argue very strongly 
that we -- we're no better than anyone else in the world -- but 
we deserve the chance to shape our own future free from British 
interference. And we can make accommodations with the 
Unionists, and we can come to an arrangement with the Unionists 
which satisfies all of the people of this island. And that's 
what the peace process should be aiming to do -- not setting up 
barricades as the British do, not the British (?being) 
reluctantly making the minimum movement possible over the 
longest protracted period -- but bringing about a conclusion 
which will allow people to live peacefully together. And David, 
as I've said many times, the other big issues of prosperity and 
everything else that our people deserve. 
  [Davenpower] Even if the IRA don't call a cease-fire -- and 
as you say they were prepared to call a cease-fire last year but 
apparently not at the moment for whatever reason -- even if they 
don't, do you think that there is the prospect for peace in '94? 
  [Adams] I think the prospect for peace, without putting any 
deadline on it, remains now. I think the potential for peace, 
the opportunity for peace, is still there. It deserves and 
requires cooperation from all the people involved. I am 
prepared to cooperate to bring that about. Whether John Major 
is or not remains to be seen. So far he hasn't shown much 
evidence and must be moved to that position. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] And that was the Sinn Fein president, Gerry 
Adams, speaking in Belfast yesterday afternoon to RTE's northern 
editor David Davenpower .

Ouellet by Sylviane Tramier and Francois Brousseau; place and 
date not given: "Tough Issues for Canadian Diplomacy"] 
<H5>  [31 Dec pp A1, A8] </H5>
  [Text] Blue helmets to maintain peace or impose it? 
For a multilateral dimension in foreign policy. 
  In an interview with LE DEVOIR, new Foreign Minister 
Andre Ouellet surveys Canadian diplomacy and the important 
issues it will have to tackle. In the first of a series of two 
articles, he discusses peacekeeping issues and explains the 
cardinal pillars of Canadian foreign policy. 
  It was Canada that invented and introduced to the United 
Nations the concept of "peacekeeping," an accomplishment which 
earned Lester B. Pearson a Nobel Prize. But today, Canada has 
misgivings about following the UN's lead into the field of peace 
enforcement and deployment of blue helmets into war-torn 
countries. 
  The brief detention of 11 Canadian soldiers by Serb 
militiamen in Bosnia just before Christmas prompted Ottawa to 
express its misgivings publicly. In a recent interview with LE 
DEVOIR, the newly installed minister of foreign affairs, Mr. 
Andre Ouellet, shared his thoughts on the subject. 
  "Traditionally, the United Nations was invited to send 
peacekeeping contingents into regions where the opposing sides 
had decided to make peace.... In the last 18 to 24 months, the 
United Nations has been led to involve itself in conflicts 
(without) the approval of local authorities. This is a 
completely new dimension, and Canada must ask itself whether it 
has the means to intervene militarily in countries where there 
are active conflicts." 
  Peacekeeping (on the "Cyprus" model) versus imposition of 
peace (as in Bosnia): This is not the only tough question with 
which Canadian diplomacy is wrestling. There is also debate over 
the size of contingents deployed. 
  Mr. Ouellet assures us that Canada still has the intent and 
the means to participate in traditional peacekeeping missions 
that do not demand excessively large numbers of troops. "But 
2,400-man military missions in the former Yugoslavia, where 
maybe there is some hope for peace but not much of an ongoing 
peace process: That's very expensive. I am not saying no; I am 
not saying we should reject the concept of humanitarian 
intervention. But we must be cautious along that path. And we're 
going to have to delimit Canadian interventions very precisely." 
Mr. Ouellet notes there are some situations where "one can play 
an important role with as few as 15 people--technicians, 
experts--facilitating deployment of an effective peace force." 
  For all that, Canada is not turning its back on the UN. To 
the contrary, it plans to be "very much present and very active" 
in the international organization. "But these are general 
concepts. The way these concepts are applied needs to be 
reassessed," the minister says. 
  Amid all the excitement that surrounded the unveiling of a 
new government, one small detail might have escaped even the 
most attentive observers: Canada's diplomatic establishment is 
now called the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, having abandoned the 
old "External Affairs" tag inherited from its link to the 
British Crown. 
  A simple name change, it ought to have been made when Canada 
first assumed full sovereignty in the conduct of its 
international relations. "It's just a way of catching up with 
reality," says the new chief of Canadian diplomacy. 
  Catching up with reality, elaborating a policy that conforms 
better to the new international situation and to domestic 
imperatives: This is a priority objective for Minister Ouellet, 
who announced his intention of organizing a forum next March to 
discuss Canadian foreign policy and defense issues. 
  More than ever, a mood of reevaluation is in the air. "We 
think it necessary, in the new world context, to have a broad 
public debate on all these questions," said Mr. Ouellet. "We 
want an open, Canadian-style debate, instead of the old 
decisionmaking system based on telephone calls between Ottawa 
and Washington." 
  As an opposition party, the Liberals had criticized the 
Conservatives for having clipped the wings of Canadian diplomacy 
and made it subservient to the United States, narrowed its focus 
to the American continent, and relied excessively on Brian 
Mulroney's special ties with the then-tenant of the White House. 
  Now in power, the Liberals are reaffirming their intention 
to 
restore the multilateral dimension to Canadian foreign policy. 
"We will not be continentalists. We want to concentrate our 
efforts and initiatives on the three pillars of Canadian 
diplomacy: our relations with the United States, of course, but 
really with all the Americas; our transatlantic relations with 
an enlarged Europe now building closer ties to the countries of 
East Europe; and our Asian and Pacific relations, which have 
stayed on the back burner for too long." 
  In the framework of this "three-dimensional" diplomacy, 
Canada places great importance on expanding its relations with 
the countries of the former Warsaw Pact. In face of insistent 
demands by some of those countries--Hungary, Poland, the Czech 
Republic--for entry into the Atlantic Alliance, Canada opposes 
undue haste and favors requiring them first to meet the 
democratic standards upheld by NATO member countries. 
  When it comes to the perceived stiffening of Russian foreign 
policy in the wake of the ultranationalists' electoral 
breakthrough--"a protest vote," according to Mr. Ouellet--the 
minister aligns himself with those who believe in standing up to 
Moscow. Many European chancelleries reject any thought of 
opposing the Russians; they believe that if Moscow "vetoes" the 
entry of Poland or Hungary into NATO, its wishes must be honored. 
  Minister Ouellet is not of that persuasion. He describes 
himself as concerned to avoid giving the impression of yielding 
to Moscow's opposition. "The Russians are pressing their 
objections very energetically, but if we do nothing, we risk 
seeing the old hegemonies reestablished. We must take care not 
to re-create, by default, a situation which in years past we 
deplored and considered regrettable. Inaction on the part of the 
Western countries only encourages Russia to reaffirm and 
reimpose its hegemony over its neighbors." 
  On the delicate issue of Macedonia, the former Yugoslav 
republic which several European countries recognized this month 
even though the United States continues to follow a 
"wait-and-see" policy, Mr. Ouellet laconically observes that the 
question is "being studied." 
<H5>  [4 Jan pp A1, A14] </H5>
  [Text] In this second and final installment of his 
interview with LE DEVOIR on the future of Canada's foreign 
policy, Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet shares his thoughts on 
the political crisis in Haiti -- a country where Canada plays an 
important role -- and the steps that should be taken to resolve 
it. 
  Convinced that the Haitian military leaders who overthrew 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide will not voluntarily let go 
their grip on power, Ottawa proposes tightening the screws to 
force their hand. 
  "At this time, the military leaders are not prepared to 
cooperate in resolving the crisis," said Foreign Minister Andre 
Ouellet in an interview with LE DEVOIR. "They are deliberately 
stalling for time because they know time is on their side. Thus, 
concrete new initiatives are required. If we remain passive, we 
won't succeed." 
  Minister Ouellet admits the Haitian crisis is not moving 
rapidly toward resolution--indeed, it seems to be worsening. He 
says Washington is partly responsible for this state of affairs. 
  Taking the Americans sharply to task, Mr. Ouellet opines 
that 
their confused and contradictory policies have strengthened the 
military's position. "The fact that statements coming out of the 
State Department were being contradicted by the Pentagon may 
have contributed to strengthening the (Haitian military's) 
conviction the Americans would not intervene." 
  In December 1990, Canada welcomed the accession to power of 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide as Haiti's first democratically elected 
president. Since the 30 September 1991 military coup that forced 
Aristide into exile, Canada has played an important part in 
efforts by the Organization of American States (OAS) and the 
United Nations to mobilize support for President Aristide and 
his restoration through diplomatic means. 
  Although Minister Ouellet considers a military solution 
totally out of the question and relies rather on sanctions to 
achieve the objective, he maintains that Canada bears a special 
responsibility toward Haiti "because it is very close to us, 
because many Haitian nationals live in Canada, because Quebec 
religious figures have been working in Haiti for many years, 
because there are deep-rooted ties." 
  After two years with no apparent progress, the foreign 
minister suggests it is time for Canada to abandon its passive 
stance and "lean on the Americans." "They need to start speaking 
with one voice. Because the State Department says one thing, 
then the military and the CIA say something else. After that, 
they need to be persuaded to act." 
  High on the list of concrete steps recommended by Mr. 
Ouellet 
is the formation of a Haitian police force. Canada suggests a 
good beginning would be to provide training for police officers 
"who could become a counterweight to the military." "As long as 
the military exercise complete hegemony over the country, 
they're going to impose their own rule," says Mr. Ouellet. "The 
balance of power needs to be changed." 
  The Governor's Island Pact signed last July by President 
Aristide and General Cedras, commander in chief of Haiti's Armed 
Forces, called for measures to be implemented last fall to 
separate the police from the Army. 
  So far, the Haitian military have blocked this reform. 
Minister Ouellet proposes to move ahead now on training of 
Haitian policemen--in Canada, if it cannot be done in Haiti. The 
core of the police force could be constituted by the 
presidential guard that provides protection for President 
Aristide in Washington. 
  All of its neighbors have taken up the call for democracy in 
Haiti, but not to the point of strictly enforcing the UN 
sanctions against the Haitian military. One of the weakest links 
in the pro-Aristide coalition is the Dominican Republic whose 
land border with Haiti on the Isle of Hispaniola is used to 
circumvent the oil embargo. 
  Mr. Ouellet thinks that if sanctions against Haiti are to 
have any chance of success, the Dominican Republic must be 
induced to enforce them to the letter. "We need for everyone to 
stand united and severely tighten the screws on the Haitian 
military. We would also like to persuade the Dominican Republic 
to take an active part in these efforts." Referring to Canada, 
France, the United States, and Venezuela--the countries that 
compose the group known as the "Four Friends of the UN Secretary 
General on Haiti" and serve as advisers on the Haitian 
situation--Mr. Ouellet thinks the Dominican Republic should be 
persuaded to join the "Four Friends" group.

<F P=106> [Report signed "C.G.": "Mounting Concern in Bonn and </F>
Russia's Neighboring Countries About Developments in Moscow"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn, 19 January -- On Wednesday [19 January], 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel extended an invitation to the 
foreign ministers of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to come to 
Bonn. Kinkel intends to hold "consultations" with Foreign 
Ministers Luik (Estonia), Andrejevs (Latvia), and Gylys 
(Lithuania) in early March. The invitation has to be seen in 
connection with the increasing feeling in the Baltic countries 
of being under threat from Russia. Kinkel intends to discuss 
with the Baltic ministers how their countries can be brought 
closer to the European Union. Germany is trying to extend the 
mandate for negotiations, which the Brussels Commission adopted 
in December. So far, the mandate provides for negotiations on a 
free trade agreement. Kinkel wants to achieve that, comparable 
to existing Europe treaties with other countries, the agreement 
should at least contain "prospects" for later accession to the 
European Union. 
  The Federal Government is worried about developments in 
Russia. There is lack of clarity in Bonn about the shift of 
balance in connection with the establishment of the new 
government in Moscow. Statements by Foreign Minister Kozyrev 
according to which Russia has "basic vital interests" in the 
other successor states to the former Soviet Union, the "CIS," 
and the Baltics, were regarded in Bonn at least as requiring 
clarification, even after Moscow sources said that the statement 
was "quoted in a distorted way." Hungary and Washington have 
also expressed concern. On Tuesday night, U.S. President 
Clinton and Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl held extensive 
discussions on the telephone about Clinton's talks in Moscow and 
and his talks with Syrian President Al-Asad in Geneva. Clinton 
was obviously not yet aware of the situation after the 
resignation from the government of the reformers around Deputy 
Prime Minister Gaydar. In coordination with Clinton, Kohl is 
currently trying to get Yeltsin on the telephone to ask him 
about the determination of the course of the future government. 
Sources in Bonn have stated that, like Clinton, Kohl continues 
to bank on Yeltsin. Owing to the insecure situation in Russia, 
the Federal Government is particularly interested in the 
compliance with the agreements regulating the withdrawal of the 
Russian Forces from eastern Germany. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report signed "ban": "Bonn Concerned About Refugees"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 21 January -- In spite of opposition from 
other European states, the Federal Government is demanding a 
common European Union (EU) regulation on accepting refugees from 
the former Yugoslavia. On Friday [21 January], during the first 
reading of the ratification act on the "Dublin Agreement," 
Lintner, the state secretary in the Interior Ministry, said a 
"fair distribution" of refugees from the civil war zones must be 
safeguarded throughout the European Union and other European 
states. "So far, we have met with strong opposition from 
several West European states." Lintner pointed out that Germany 
has accepted some 370,000 refugees from the former Yugoslavia. 
This is approximately two-thirds of all the refugees who fled to 
the European Union from the civil war zones. 
  In the summer of 1990, the European Community members had 
concluded an agreement on asylum proceedings. Under this 
agreement, asylum seekers entering the European Union have the 
right to only one such proceeding. The responsibility lies with 
the country that has allowed the foreign national to enter, or 
that was the first one he entered. The agreement shall prevent 
foreign nationals from applying for asylum in more than one EU 
member countries, either concurrently or consecutively. Lintner 
said the agreement is an important step toward harmonizing the 
community's asylum laws. The Dublin Agreement is to be seen in 
connection with the abolition of border controls agreed on by 
the community. He said the reason given for the change of the 
asylum law that was passed by the Bundestag last year was the 
European agreements. Lintner said that beside the Dublin 
Agreement, the government is aiming at a standardization of 
asylum policies and procedures throughout the European Union. A 
short debate showed that the Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union agrees with the Social Democratic 
Party and the Free Democratic Party on this matter. The Party 
of Democratic Socialism and Alliance 90/Greens opposed the idea. 
Deputy Weiss of Alliance 90/Greens warned against "isolation 
measures," which would create the preconditions for criminal 
organizations trafficking in asylum seekers.

<F P=106> [Report signed "K.B.": "The Embargo Against Serbia Is Being </F>
Breached"] 
  [Text] Cologne, 20 January -- Customs Service investigation 
bureaus have launched 346 probes into possible breaches of the 
trade embargo against Serbia and Montenegro since the beginning 
of the year. The figure was provided by the Customs Service 
Criminal Investigation Department in Cologne, which has a 
coordinating function and gathers information in the course of 
overseeing German foreign trade. 
  The EU [European Union] embargo, which followed UN sanctions 
resolutions, has been in force since June 1992. The embargo has 
applied to UN Protection Areas in Croatia and Serbian-controlled 
areas in Bosnia since April 1993. In a conversation with the 
FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, the Customs Service Criminal 
Investigation Department stated that the undoubtedly high number 
of cases must be seen in perspective. At the same time, however, 
their importance should not be played down. Apart from a large 
number of minor breaches, there are also a several serious cases 
involving German companies. 
  A total of 180 investigations have been launched into bus 
companies alone: They are alleged to have transported Serbian 
citizens to their home country or to have collected them from 
there. Journeys by bus, like travel generally, also come under 
the extensive embargo covering services. Apart from Serbian 
businessmen, there are also several German businessmen involved 
in operating such services. This has led the Transportation 
Ministry to appeal to the relevant associations to warn their 
members about the consequences of violating the embargo. 
  Of the four convictions that have been obtained in the 59 
criminal proceedings instituted by the Customs Service Criminal 
Investigation Department on suspicion of violations of the 
embargo, one involves the Serbian owner of a bus company in 
Germany. He received an 18-month jail sentence and a period of 
probation. Violations of the embargo can be dealt with under 
Paragraph 34, Article 4, of the Law on Foreign Trade and such 
offenses carries a minimum sentence of two years imprisonment. 
In cases of lesser violations, at least a fine has to be 
imposed. 
  Minor cases involve Serbian citizens attempting to bring 
food, liquor, or tobacco products into Germany. They do not 
include the normal provisions that people take with them on 
journeys. The 60 kg of beef, 18 kg of wool, 435 kg of cabbage, 
and 192 liters of spirits that have been in found in the 
possession of Serbs entering the country are treated as 
violations of the embargo. 
  Serious cases currently under investigation or already under 
criminal proceedings involve German companies importing millions 
of German marks worth of frozen fruit, shoes, and cables. 
Former Yugoslavia has traditionally supplied large quantities 
of fruit for processing. Since the imposition of the embargo, 
however, investigations have not been initiated against firms 
involved directly in processing, but against trading companies. 
Of the 364 investigations that have been launched, 167 concern 
imports and 65 concern exports. 
  Investigations indicate that many of the companies based in 
Germany against whom proceedings have been instituted are in 
Serbian hands. Deliveries of magnesium are a special case. 
They could only stem from Serbian plants, which have supplied 
German industry for many years. The customs service has 
established that magnesium continues to be delivered, but 
Macedonia is being given as the country of origin. 
  Of the 52 criminal proceedings that were instituted by 
Customs Service investigation bureaux following the conclusion 
of investigations, the state prosecution service has only 
decided not to continue with proceedings in nine cases according 
to the Customs Service Criminal Investigation Department. The 
Customs Service Criminal Investigation Department has not been 
fully informed about the outcome of the criminal proceedings, 
because the prosecution service and courts are not obliged to 
pass on such information to federal agencies. 
  With regard to the weapons embargo that was imposed by the 
United Nations on all of former Yugoslavia in 1991, the Customs 
Service Criminal Investigation Service has received no 
indications of violations involving weapons or ammunition. The 
embargo also covers other forms of military equipment. 
Investigations have revealed that used equipment has been 
supplied by Germany. Initially, this also involved trucks that 
previously belonged to the former National People's Army. In 
1993, for example, criminal proceedings and monetary penalties 
have been instituted in cases of deliveries of belts, boots, 
tents, steel helmets, and berets.

<F P=106> [Article by Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier, financial policy </F>
spokesperson for the Social Democratic Party of Germany: 
"Brussels Does Not Need To Incur Debts"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 20 January -- In view of the currently 19.2 
million unemployed in the European Union [EU], a continuing slow 
economic cycle, and the fact that Europe's innovative potential 
lags increasingly behind the United States and Japan, Commission 
President Jacques Delors took the initiative. With his white 
paper on more growth, competitiveness, and employment, which he 
submitted at the EU summit in mid-December, he intends to fuel 
the European economy. 
  In fact, the white paper Delors presented contains some 
correct principles. 

  -  The Commission is aware that the EU 
employment crisis must be overcome by creating internationally 
competitive new jobs and technological progress; employment 
programs of the old type are not suggested in the white 
paper. 
  -  The white paper recommends more flexibility in business 
and industry and a decrease in ancillary wage costs, without 
intending to lower the well-tested EU social standards. 
  -  Great 
importance is attached to the development of the infrastructure, 
not least in view of the Maastricht Treaty and the planned 
adjustment of the economic potential. The white paper, 
therefore, suggests measures for the development of European 
transport, energy, and telecommunications systems. 
  There is just one snag to the white paper, however: If the 
Commission had its will, EU debts would increase further. At 
the same time, the European Union would be authorized to incur 
debts. The Commission suggests that the European Union should 
borrow an additional ECU8 billion -- less than 16 billion German 
marks [DM] -- annually, in addition to the existing programs. 
Following some resistance at the summit, the EU Council has 
ordered a study to analyze the matter. 
<H5>  Right To Incur Debts at European Level </H5>
  The European Commission intends to use the program presented 
in the white paper in order to give the European Union a special 
right to incur debts. Such a right to indebtedness at the 
European level, however, is neither necessary nor desirable. 
  It is not necessary because there are already enough 
instruments in the framework of the EU budget, some of which are 
exclusively envisaged for the financing of trans-European 
systems -- the cohesion fund, the structural fund, and the 
medium-term research framework program. In addition, the 
European Investment Bank can grant credits; the credit volume in 
1993 was approximately ECU19 billion. Moreover, a European 
investment fund will be created in 1994 that will primarily deal 
with the financing of trans-European systems. Through this 
fund, approximately ECU30 billion can be mobilized. There is no 
indication that these funds will not be sufficient. 
<H5>  The EU Budget Must Not Be Financed by Way of Credit </H5>
  A special right to indebtedness of the Commission is not 
desirable, because in this way, another debt vehicle would be 
opened that would develop its own dynamism. It would provide a 
loophole for member states to incur a debt that is not possible 
nationally. The European Treaty, therefore, says for good reason 
that the EU budget is not to be financed by way of credit, but 
solely from the member states' own funds. 
  In addition, the Maastricht Treaty defines stability 
criteria 
for the future European monetary union. The upper ceiling of 
indebtedness in the member states should not exceed 60 percent, 
and new borrowing should not be higher than 3 percent of the 
GDP. The necessary efforts to observe the convergency criteria 
at the national level would lose much of their value, if 
borrowing were shifted to the European level. It is 
unacceptable that individual member states should try to fulfill 
the stability criteria, whereas the European Union could incur 
an excessively high debt. If this were possible, then this debt 
would have to be allowed for proportionately regarding the 
indebtedness of the member states, which, after all, have to pay 
for interest and amortization. 
  In all member states, public debt has become a real obstacle 
to growth and employment. Any further debt increase in the 
European Union would complicate the necessary interest rate cuts 
and would thus hinder investment in new jobs. Investors and 
consumers are concerned about continuously increasing public 
debt. Everyone knows that sooner or later, the state must apply 
the emergency brake and initiate consolidation measures. The 
more indebted the countries are, the more painful the spending 
cuts, and the greater the need for tax increases. However, this 
is extremely harmful for the cycle and the employment market. 
  What is more, the debt incurred by the Commission must also 
be serviced. For the necessary interest payments, the 
Commission must go to the member states to finance financing. 
This means that the member states' payments to the European 
Union would increase because of interest peyments. The wind 
that is currently blowing into the European Union's face is 
rather becoming stronger, as a result of such proposals and 
analyses. 
  It is not necessary to create new debt vehicles, credit 
programs, and special debt options of the European Union. What 
is necessary, however, is to reduce debt at all levels and take 
the convergency criteria of the Maastricht Treaty seriously. If 
the available funds were not to be sufficient, readjustments 
must be made in the EU budget in favor of the measures mentioned 
in the white paper. 
  In Europe, too, the debt mentality must be broken. The 
united Europe must not become a debt community. The disastrous 
impact of further debts will threaten growth, competitiveness, 
and thus the very goals that are to be implemented with the help 
of the white paper -- the decrease of unemployment and the 
improvement of competitiveness in Europe. I, therefore, call 
upon the Federal Government to reject clearly the Brussels debt 
plans.

<F P=106> [Article by Winfried Muenster: "Does the Eurocorps Have </F>
America's Blessing?"] 
  [Text] Brussels, January -- During the most recent NATO 
summit, not even the parking lots of the press were booked up. 
General boredom seemed to be the reason numerous correspondents 
saved themselves the trip to Brussels. "You have realized that 
not much is happening here," government spokesman Dieter Vogel 
apologized for his unexciting statements. Had something escaped 
the attention of Vogel and the correspondents? Diplomats at the 
Alliance headquarters in Brussels and in Bonn and other capitals 
expressed extraordinary satisfaction a few days later. "A new 
NATO was created on Monday [10 January]," Bonn officials stated 
jubilantly. "The declaration by the 16 heads of state and 
government is a significant breakthrough. It was the most 
important NATO summit since the end of the Cold War." 
  It is true that, nearly unnoticed, the 16 allies set a new 
course in security and defense policy. The quarrel between the 
"Europeans" and the "Atlantic-minded" on the role of the 
European Union in security policy was settled. Not only does 
the United States accept that, but it even applauds the European 
allies in the community of 12 for their efforts to create their 
own "security and defense identity." The defense pact Western 
European Union [WEU], which the United States viewed 
suspiciously for many years, is now considered "the defense 
component of the European Union" by the U.S. ally. Thus, no one 
else but the community should be authorized to strengthen the 
"European pillar of the Alliance." This was no controversial 
subject at the summit. Everything was settled in advance, and 
NATO is now characterized by a harmony that it has not seen in 
the past 14 years after the controversial dual track decision on 
nuclear rearmament was adopted. 
  The trans-Atlantic quarrel over whether the European allies 
should be allowed to safeguard their own joint 
security-political interests was more than the topic of debates 
among insiders on the diplomatic stage. It undermined 
Washington's determination, particularly that of Congress, to 
ensure European security and gnawed at the foundations of the 
Alliance. 
  The squabbling started at the beginning of the 1980's as a 
result of U.S. readiness to grant the Soviet Union strategic 
parity. The strategic balance among the superpowers made 
Moscow's military superiority vis-a-vis Europe appear in a new 
light. Prior to U.S.- Soviet arms control talks in March 1985, 
for example, the WEU states wanted to meet -- outside NATO -- to 
discuss the situation. The United States objected. It insisted 
on complete U.S. control over security and defense policies so 
long as it had to protect Europe. If the Europeans had something 
to say, then they should do so within NATO. 
  Thus, the WEU sank into oblivion for another two years. In 
1987, however, the European Community adopted the project of the 
single market, and the idea of an economic and monetary union 
gained ground in France. A combination of these two concepts 
was bound to nourish dreams of a "political union" that would 
accompany Europe's economic integration with unification in the 
sphere of foreign and security policy, and later even with a 
joint defense policy on the basis of the WEU. From that time 
on, France and Germany did not abandon this topic any more, 
particularly since the Cold War ended two years later and Europe 
had to make a larger contribution to its own security. 
  Yet, the Bush administration did not give up its resistance 
-- not least because it mistrusted France, which was not 
integrated in the command structure of NATO, and that, with its 
support for the WEU, aroused the suspicion that it wanted to 
create a structure of European armed forces outside the U.S. 
sphere of influence. In May 1992, U.S. NATO Ambassador William 
Taft stated frankly in Brussels that he did not understand why 
the 10 states of the European Community that belonged to the 
military integration of NATO could not make it clear to their 
French partner "that France's vision of a common defense can 
only be realized in the institutions of NATO." It is not 
sufficient to cooperate occasionally with the Alliance, he 
stressed. However, the U.S. position softened slowly. 
President George Bush accepted the WEU as early as at the NATO 
summit in Rome, "if it does not represent a European alternative 
to NATO." Reginald Bartholomew, Taft's successor, stressed in 
the autumn of 1992 that the Alliance should remain the supreme 
"defense forum." 
  However, a change of power at the White House was apparently 
necessary to transform America's resistance into agreement. 
Strobe Talbott, the new U.S. deputy secretary of state, 
admitted shortly before the most recent summit that this 
resistance against an independent European defense identity was 
"pure theology" -- which was quite unfounded because, with the 
exception of France, the European partners were never interested 
in founding an organization rivaling NATO. Quite the contrary. 
"We support the WEU as a strong European pillar of the 
Alliance," the declaration adopted by the NATO summit reads. 
For the defense officials in Bonn, it is hardly conceivable for 
WEU countries not to be NATO members. 
  Europe's security-political elements are now forming a 
complete mosaic. "It was clear that if the United States 
renounces its theology, the French will also give up their dogma 
of Charles de Gaulle, according to which strict independence and 
distance vis-a-vis Washington is to be ensured," a Bonn diplomat 
pointed out. Bonn officials have always believed that a 
European defense identity would bring France closer to NATO and 
not increase the distance between Germany and the Alliance. 
They were right in the end. The agreement that the WEU may use 
the military apparatus of NATO is proof of that. In addition, 
France will occasionally participate in the Alliance's defense 
planning -- that is, the meetings of the defense ministers. Out 
of consideration for U.S. feelings, Great Britain and the 
Netherlands have so far kept away from the Eurocorps. Now that 
the Strasbourg Armed Forces have been generally accepted, the 
Netherlands and the Germans want to complete them with a second 
corps. Great Britain is currently not participating. 
  In fact, time was also on the side of the Europeans after 
the 
end of the Cold War. The United States, which reduced its troop 
presence to one-third in Europe, was hardly in a position to 
deny the old world an independent defense initiative. Also, it 
was not possible for the Americans to insist on having the final 
say while, at the same time, calling on the Europeans to assume 
their global share of work. This was Clinton's message at the 
Brussels summit. He considers NATO the authority that is 
ultimately responsible for the global strategy of the West, 
including the military one. The European Union, however, should 
concentrate on economic reconstruction -- with the United 
States, in the case of Russia -- and, above all, the 
democratization of East Europe. Allies who are expected to fill 
these task do not have the feeling that somebody is putting a 
spoke in their wheels.

<F P=106> [Report signed "HB": "Kohl Demands New Ideas From Industry"] </F>
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 18 January -- Chancellor Kohl has 
called on industry to turn new ideas into marketable products 
and to use these for opening up new markets. At the Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry's New Year Reception in Duesseldorf on 
Tuesday [18 January], Kohl pointed out that top achievements in 
research and technology are important preconditions for 
future-oriented jobs in Germany. 
  "I am, therefore, very concerned about our falling behind 
important competitors in the fields of research and technology, 
for instance regarding the number of patent applications," Kohl 
said. Research and innovation are not only a matter of funds. 
They also require a social climate that is open to new ideas. 
  On the labor market situation, Kohl said the problems 
"cannot 
be solved in the short term," even with the expected upswing of 
the economy. For this reason, everybody who is involved in the 
economic process is called on to help secure jobs. The Federal 
Government has taken action. The new law on working time, which 
enables more flexible working hours and longer machinery 
operating hours, has been presented to the Bundestag. The 1992 
pension reform provides the opportunity to combine part-time 
work with drawing partial pensions. So far, this instrument has 
been made far too little use of. Almost 2.5 million full-time 
employees would rather work part-time. This means there is an 
enormous job potential there, said Kohl. 
  Kohl welcomed the wage agreement in the chemical industry as 
"an important signal." The wage round parties put employment at 
the center of their talks. This is a good contribution to 
securing jobs. Other important factors are the agreed starting 
wages for young people starting work and for the long-term 
unemployed. This is the first time that wage round parties made 
agreements that take account of the different capacities of 
different companies. 
  Kohl said the government's job is to improve the basic 
structures for stimulating growth and employment in Germany. In 
this connection, the chancellor emphasized the government's 
decision to cut the budget by another 5 billion German marks 
[DM]. This was "not simple," because a total of DM21 billion 
had already been saved in the 1994 budget. Financial planning 
has a "solid base," which can also be seen from the preliminary 
1993 budget balance. In 1993, the government's new indebtedness 
was some DM500 million below estimate. Economizing also means 
fighting the misuse of social benefits, which has led to DM1.2 
billion being saved by the end of November 1993. 
  Kohl stressed that in the next legislative term the tax law 
should be simplified and the company tax reform continued. 
Another important issue on the government's agenda is 
simplifying the planning and licensing procedures in Germany. 
These -- with the "program to increase growth and employment" 
-- are important steps taken by the coalition toward enforcing 
the measures laid down in the report on "Securing Germany's 
Future as a Business Location," as was announced last September.

<F P=106> [Report signed "S.Sch.": "Compensation for the Research </F>
Budget?"] 
  [Text] Berlin, 20 January -- Contrary to assurances from 
the government that the Research Ministry's budget would remain 
untouched, Research Minister Krueger, Christian Democratic 
Union, must now accept reductions totaling 250 million German 
marks [DM] in his DM9.4-billion budget. This means his 
department -- after the Defense Ministry, the fiscal 
administration, and the Economics Ministry -- is in the top 
group of the 29 federal institutions that are obliged to make 
economies. Krueger told this newspaper he regretted that his 
department, which accounts for only 2 percent of the total 
budget, has been burdened with 5 percent of the amount that is 
to be saved. He is not pleased with this development. He must, 
however, accept the Federal Government's decision, especially as 
he has been offered "compensatory measures." It is planned that 
his ministry should receive approximately DM150 million from SED 
[Socialist Unity Party of Germany] assets. It is still 
"litigation" money, however, as the legal dispute about SED 
assets has still not been resolved. Krueger is, nevertheless, 
firmly counting on the money, because guarantees have been 
offered at the federal level. The funds, which were always 
envisaged as additional funds for the Research Ministry, are 
only available in a limited way. They can only be allocated for 
research in the new laender. A further DM100 million of this 
year's budget should, according to Krueger, be financed through 
the Bank for Reconstruction with low interest loans. This means 
that in the future, research institutions will increasingly have 
to finance their work with loans rather than state contributions.

  [Excerpt] Bonn [DDP/ADN] -- The positions of the government 
coalition and opposition became further entrenched in the 
Bundestag debate on the government's financial and economic 
policy today. Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Economics 
Minister Guenter Rexrodt defended the government's action 
program to increase growth and employment, but the SPD [Social 
Democratic Party] accused the coalition of wanting to break the 
social consensus within the country. 
  Waigel stressed that the policy of consolidation was to be 
continued "without restrictions." The consolidation of public 
budgets would promote economic growth and create new investment 
opportunities for industry. The action program was a 
"consistent" continuation of the privatization policy and the 
instruments for controlling the labor market were being 
extended. In order to encourage innovation, small- and 
medium-size businesses would receive particular support. 
  Rexrodt stressed there were "clear indications" that the 
economic downturn in Germany had been overcome. Export 
prospects had improved. Optimism was justified, at least with 
regard to the economy. However, this did not apply to the 
development of the labor market. Therefore, the action program 
focused on the creation of additional jobs. 
  Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier, the deputy chairperson of the SPD 
parliamentary group, said the government was facing an economic 
and financial "pile of rubble." For months, the government had 
turned a blind eye to the rise in unemployment; now political 
action was supposed to cover up the inability to act. [passage

<F P=106> [Report signed "Jl": "Only Slight Recovery in Foreign Trade"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt, 21 January -- Germany's foreign trade 
saw only a slight recovery in November 1993, compared with 
November 1992. During the first 11 months of 1993, exports and 
imports declined markedly over the comparable period of the 
previous year. The Federal Statistical Office reports that goods 
worth 54.7 billion German marks [DM] were exported in November, 
a 0.4 percent increase from October. Imports increased by 0.6 
percent to DM46.5 billion. At DM8.2 billion, the export surplus 
remained stable over October, but it was distinctly up over 
November 1992 (DM1.7 billion). From January through November, 
goods worth DM547.4 billion were exported, which is 11.1 percent 
less than in the same period last year. Imports declined by 14.9 
percent to DM496.1 billion. At DM51.3 billion, the export 
surplus is markedly higher than last year (DM33.2 billion). Due 
to deficits in the service sector, as well as transfers, the 
favorable foreign trade balance in the goods and services 
balance turned into a DM34.6-billion deficit.

<F P=106> [Report signed "ari.": "BDI Expects Stimulation of Foreign </F>
Demand"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf -- In the opinion of the Federal 
Association of German Industry (BDI), the possible gradual 
economic recovery will not yet lead to a relaxation of the labor 
market. 
  Rather, the Association proceeds on the assumption that the 
employment problem will even increase in 1994. The latest 
economic report substantiates this by the statement that the 
expected stimulation of foreign demand can only result in a 
modest growth impulse. With the new increase of the burden of 
rates and taxes, the economy has been burdened with an 
additional "field pack for the way out of the economic 
depression." According to this assumption, it will not be 
possible to return to a dynamic investment boom and thus to 
solve the employment problem in 1994, it was stated. 
  The industrial enterprises reacted to the economic 
deterioration with rationalization and staff cuts. The measures 
have not failed to be effective. While in the first quarter of 
1993, the unit labor costs, which increased by more than 10 
percent, almost exploded, they were only about 1.5 percent 
higher than last year in the past three available months. 
However, the cost crisis has not yet been overcome. While 
producer prices continue to decline, the profit situation 
remains tense. 
  The improvement of the cost situation does not suffice for 
economic recovery. In addition, relative competitiveness has to 
be improved and demand has to be developed. At present, 
however, this is complicated by the increasing tax burden. As 
early as now, the job reduction caused by rationalization goes 
far beyond comparable developments of former cycles. A 
considerable part of it also contains structural adjustments 
because of deteriorated conditions of business locations, it was 
stated. 
  Almost all job losses fell to industry in 1993. While in the 
economy as a whole there were still about 1.3 million employees 
more than in 1989, in the west German industry there were 
already 100,000 fewer employees than in the recession year 1983. 
Here it has been taken into account that the building trade was 
the only industrial branch to slightly increase its employment 
once again in 1993. 
  The BDI is convinced that the job reduction will gradually 
end in eastern Germany. Production expanded in many branches in 
1993. This process will broaden and become more dynamic this 
year. Despite considerable success in the improvement of 
production, the level of costs in the east is still higher than 
in western Germany. This is an important reason for the 
previous small success of east German enterprises in the world 
market, it was stated. 
  Apart from Great Britain, in the countries of the European 
Union (EU) the economic situation is still marked by weak 
economic activity. However, the downward trend slowed 
perceptibly in the second half of 1993. Meanwhile, the bottom 
of recession has probably been reached almost everywhere. 
Private consumption has stagnated. As a result of the 
increasing surplus capacity and the pessimistic business 
expectations, the enterprises' investments have decreased 
considerably. 
  The economic development is still suffering from the 
sluggish 
domestic demand. Therefore, industry in the EU countries 
suffered most from recession in 1993. From June to August, 
production decreased by 3.8 percent and the production of 
capital goods by even 6.4 percent, it was stated. 
  At the end of the year, however, there were the first signs 
of a recovery of the EU economy. The world economic 
surroundings have improved further. Thus, the export chances of 
European enterprises have clearly increased. The stimulation of 
exports will initiate a modest recovery, but without a change in 
the trend in domestic demand it will not be possible to achieve 
sufficient dynamism, which is required for the reduction of 
unemployment. The BDI assesses it positively that, with 3.2 
percent, the inflation rate in the European Union has fallen to 
a new low in November and may decrease further, since the 
pressure from wage costs will presumably decrease. Then 
monetary policy will be able to stick to its course, which 
supports economic activity. 
  The improvement of the economic climate in the European 
Union 
itself also points to a further economic stimulation. The 
latest poll signals decreasing pessimism in industry in nine out 
of 12 countries. Capacity utilization amounted to 77.5 percent 
in October, and thus it was slightly higher than in the previous 
quarter. In the opinion of the BDI, the capacity utilization 
rate will increase gradually in the next few months.

<F P=106> [Report signed "eld": "Trust Agency Sells First Power </F>
Supply Company"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- The Trust Agency has started to privatize 
the east German power supply industry. The Preussen-Elektra AG 
company in Hanover will take over the majority of five of the 15 
regional supply companies. The five firms are: Oder-Spree 
Energieversorgung AG (Oseag) in Frankfurt/Oder, Maerkische 
Energieversorgung AG (Mevag) in Potsdam, Energieversorgung 
Magdeburg AG (EVM) in Magdeburg, Hanseatische Energieversorgung 
AG (Hevag) in Rostock, and Energieversorgung Mueritz-Oderhaff AG 
(EMO) in Neubrandenburg. 
  The power supply enterprises Bayernwerk AG in Munich and the 
Rheinisch-Westfaelisches Elektrizitaetswerk AG (RWE) in Essen 
will take over 51 percent each of some regional east German 
power supply plants on the basis of the electricity agreement 
concluded in 1990. However, negotiations with the Trust Agency 
have not yet been concluded. The east German communes will 
receive the remaining 49 percent later. 
  Talks on privatizing the Veag Vereinigte Energiewerke AG in 
Berlin are more difficult. The majority of the east German 
enterprise is to be sold to the three large west German 
electricity concerns Bayernwerk, Preussen-Elektra, and RWE. The 
Veag is planning for investments worth approximately 30 million 
German marks by the end of 2005 to modernize the east German 
power supply. 
  In view of the economic crisis in the new laender, the Veag 
must expect a lower sale of electricity. Establishing public 
utilities also has a negative impact on the Veag's sale of 
power. Thus, the Trust Agency might be forced to reduce the 
price. According to the Trust Agency, the privatization of the 
Veag is to be concluded by the middle of 1994, and the sale of 
the second east German brown coal producer, Lausitzer Braunkohle 
AG (Laubag), in Senftenberg is to be completed by the same time, 
if possible.

<F P=106> [Report on study prepared by the German Institute for </F>
Economic Research: "The Real Shock and the Enormous Level of 
State Redistribution"] 
  [Text] The economic policy debate in western Germany is 
focusing on wage policy more and more. It is being increasingly 
blamed for the ongoing rise in unemployment not only within the 
framework of the debate on the country as a center for industry 
but in a manner that extends well beyond that. Excessive wage 
increases are said to have led to a situation in which there is 
an insufficient demand for labor on the part of companies and in 
which there is a threat of another sharp rise in unemployment. 
However, this approach does not concentrate on the relevant 
subject matter to an adequate degree. It is another instance of 
narrow-minded economic thinking, which sees the labor market 
compared with markets for goods. By contrast, monetary policy 
is to a large extent excluded from discussion. 
<H5>  Wage Policy </H5>
  It is obvious that both sides have made mistakes with 
respect 
to wage policy. In its January 1992 report, the DIW [German 
Institute for Economic Research] wrote that wage policy should 
not take things too far in the conflict with monetary policy; 
otherwise, a recession and unemployment would be inevitable. 
Last year's wage increases already indicated that corrections 
were under way, corrections that would permit a high degree of 
price stability and competitiveness in the medium term. This 
year, the first wage agreements and union demands in key sectors 
indicate that the wage increases will be closer to 2 percent 
rather than 3 percent. 
  In public debate on the subject, wage cuts are being 
frequently called for with a view to making Germany more 
competitive and providing openings for the unemployed. However, 
anyone who calls for wage cuts today must take into 
consideration the fact that overall economic development in the 
1980's was marked by extremely moderate wage growth. Nominal 
wage increases hardly exceeded the progress that was made in the 
production field. That was also in no small part due to 
moderate wage hikes under collective agreements and reductions 
in working hours. This behavior on the part of the parties to 
collective agreements led to a high degree of price stability on 
the one hand and to very substantial increases in profits on the 
other hand. Accordingly, there was a boom in investment as a 
result of the low cost of capital and low money market interest 
rates. The poor level of investment, which was complained about 
at the beginning of the 1980's, became entirely a thing of the 
past. Until 1991, western Germany recorded a constant rise in 
the level of investment, one that was also high in international 
terms. 
  There is no doubt that such a development would have been 
impossible if if German labor costs had been "too high" 
internationally. The opposite is true. Until 1991, the rate at 
which west German unit labor costs were rising, in German marks, 
was always below the average rate of increase among Germany's 
trading partners. It was not until 1992, when the German labor 
market situation at the beginning of the year was still 
influenced by the preceding boom and the rest of the world had 
already been experiencing the effects of a recession on labor 
markets for a long time, that German unit labor costs began to 
grow more rapidly in comparison to those among its trading 
partners for the first time since 1970. 
  The fact that at the end of the boom, and at a time when the 
labor market situation was good, unit labor costs grew more 
rapidly than before and markedly more sharply than prices in 
industry is simply the product of a "normal" economic reaction 
on the part of unions and employers to a preceding period of 
significant increases in profits. One may take exception to 
that. However, it is not a convincing basis for expressing 
concern about a fundamental change in power structure on the 
labor market or constant mistakes on the part of trade unions. 
Thus, labor in Germany has not become "too expensive," neither 
in international terms -- if one excludes exchange rate 
fluctuations -- nor in relation to domestic productivity and 
price trends. 
  There is also no proof to support the assertion that labor 
has become too expensive in relation to capital. Labor can only 
become too expensive in relation to capital if not only nominal 
but also real wages grow "too much," so that in the 
manufacturing process, the production of a certain quantity of 
goods involves "too little" labor and "too much" capital. The 
rate at which real wages increase is not determined by the 
parties to collective wage agreements, however, but by the 
market or markets, where the prices of all goods are determined. 
In addition, the overall rate of economic development would be 
an obstacle to a strategy of reducing real wages. One cannot 
draw a straightforward comparison between the labor market and 
the market for consumer goods. 
  For example, if there is an oversupply in the automobile 
market, a reduction in prices can rapidly lead to an increase in 
demand: That does not, mean, however, that the volume of 
automakers sales and the demand that they generate will rise. 
The situation in the labor market is different. Even if prices 
remain constant in the wake of a reduction in nominal wages, 
which would entail a reduction in real wages, an increase in 
company demand for labor in the short term cannot be expected. 
Even if companies consider the reduction in real wages to be 
lasting, their first reaction will only be to gradually start to 
reorganize the production process with a view to making it more 
labor intensive. However, what would have an immediate impact is 
a drop in demand, which would probably entail a further increase 
in unemployment. That would in turn lead to another reduction in 
real wages. Even if a strategy for reducing wages were 
considered possible and economically safe, it would pose 
problems for a country such as the Federal Republic. A 
reduction in real wages and the change in the ratio of labor to 
capital that this entails, one tending toward greater labor 
intensiveness, also means a decline or at least a lower rate of 
growth in productivity. It is also questionable whether Germany 
would then still be able to manufacture the products that are 
manufactured by the leading group of technologically advanced 
countries. 
  Wage cuts -- irrespective of how they are justified in each 
individual case -- constitute a defensive strategy that does not 
promise success. However, a modern wage policy -- as the 
institutes jointly recommended in the fall of 1993 -- is 
warranted. As a fundamental adjustment to distribution is not 
required, wage negotiations over the next two years will be 
solely about making a adjustment to those increases in 1991 and 
1992 that have exceeded the medium-term rate. If wage 
agreements were of the order of 2 percent, that would be 
guaranteed for the entire economy. If this course were to be 
followed, then it would be possible to make the adjustments that 
are appropriate for each branch of industry without abandoning 
the principle of overall collective agreements. 
  After two "adjustment years," wage policy can return to a 
reasonable medium-term rate of about 4 percent. The normal and 
necessary economic adjustments to distribution that benefit 
profits will entail increases in productivity, increases that 
will significantly exceed the medium-term course in the short 
term. All demands that tend downward regarding such a course, 
including those that follow one or several rounds of zero wage 
increases, are economically harmful and also harm company 
profits. 
  Zero wage increases are also inappropriate in an 
international context because -- especially in Europe -- they 
only lead to increased pressure on wage settlements in partner 
countries. This is also an area in which there is a fundamental 
inconsistency in the present discussion: A devaluation of the 
German mark vis-a-vis European currencies is categorically 
rejected, a freeze on wage increases or reductions in nominal 
wages, which would have the same effect -- namely a devaluation 
of the German mark in real terms -- internationally, are being 
discussed and promoted as possible solution. 
<H5>  Reductions in Working Hours </H5>
  In view of the rapid increase in the number of unemployed to 
an annual average of 4 million this year and the possibility of 
a high level of unemployment in the medium term, further 
reductions in working hours are being discussed. Volkswagen has 
come up with a radical option in this respect. The Volkswagen 
proposal of a drastic reduction in working hours is only a model 
for companies that expect a significant reduction in personnel 
to be necessary in the medium term. Because the loss of income 
that personnel will experience could be marked, the state can 
offer some compensation in this regard. What would, for 
example, be appropriate is a temporary and degressive reduction 
in unemployment insurance contributions for those concerned. 
This would also compensate for the lower benefits provided by 
unemployment insurance under the Volkswagen model. 
  However, in terms of the economy as a whole, such a large 
step as the reduction in working hours at Volkswagen is barely 
acceptable. Thus, individual steps aimed at reducing working 
hours should, as has been the case until now, take place within 
a framework of higher productivity. This permits settlements to 
be found that have a neutral impact on costs and maintain the 
real income levels of those affected by such moves. 
  At the same time, shorter working hours should be 
accompanied 
by a further separation of working hours and machine operating 
hours. Optimal plant operating hours are necessary for a country 
like the Federal Republic of Germany with its relatively high 
wage and high capital costs if it is to compete internationally. 
Internal company agreements on annual working hours can better 
harmonize company and personal interests than has been the case 
so far. Thus, overall, a significant contribution can be made 
to reducing unemployment. 
<H5>  Fiscal Policy </H5>
  So far, fiscal policy has prevented more serious harm from 
occurring to overall economic development. In 1993, the 
contribution of the state amounted to as much as 1 percent of 
the GDP. To a large extent, this was the result of stabilizing 
factors that are built into taxation and transfer systems. This 
year, the effect of these elements will be much weaker. In 
addition, there are also the negative effects of discretionary 
components -- that is, reductions in social welfare provisions, 
as well as increases in taxes and contributions so that in 1994, 
the state will have a restrictive influence on the overall 
economy. 
  There is no doubt that fiscal policy is in a precarious 
situation. The possibilities for it are more limited than 
before with regard to offsetting a reduction in private demand 
and providing a positive stimulus to the economy. The rapid 
increase in the level of state debt reduces whatever room for 
maneuvering there is. In 1995, there will be a further increase 
in the state debt when the state takes over the debts of the 
Trust Agency. The state will then have debts totaling almost 
2.2 trillion German marks [DM], which will require annual 
interest payments totaling DM150 billion -- almost a fifth of 
all tax receipts. 
  The difficult state budget situation is primarily due to the 
fact that costs of German unification were largely financed with 
loans. However, it is also a reaction to the fact that, for a 
long time, monetary and fiscal policy have had conflicting 
effects in the economy. The costs that adjustments entailed and 
had to be borne by fiscal policy as a result of a restrictive 
monetary policy and its effects on the economy were significant. 
If monetary policy now becomes more expansive, it would be 
disastrous if fiscal policy were then to counteract a more 
relaxed monetary policy. Used correctly, monetary and fiscal 
policy are the key automatic stabilizing elements in a free 
market system. 
  In times of recession, monetary policy becomes more stable 
through a rapid normalization of the interest rate structure and 
fiscal policy does so through the acceptance of growing 
deficits. If one of these stabilizing factors is absent, the 
other policy area has a greater burden to bear. A strategy from 
which both these stabilizing elements are absent prolongs a 
recession. However, this year, monetary policy will only 
gradually be equal to its responsibility. Thus, 1994 is an 
exceptionally inappropriate time for attempting to consolidate 
public budgets. Reductions in expenditure mean reduced demand 
and lower incomes in the economy as a whole and lower taxes and 
social insurance contributions. For this reason, the government 
cannot be sure that its austerity program, which amounts to DM20 
billion, will result in a reduction in the deficit of the same 
order. In the best case, the shortfall that has to be financed 
will be reduced by DM10 billion. Finally, the state will only 
regain the ability to act if there is a lasting upturn, because 
only then will revenues rise and the need for funds to finance 
unemployment will diminish, and only then can the contributions 
made to other social insurance systems be reduced. 
  In the discussion on the causes of the recession, it leads 
to 
confusion to repeatedly mention dues that are "too high" and 
"too high" a level of social benefits. These assertions do not 
tally with the fact that the enormous expansion of employment in 
the late 1980's and the 1990's took place within such a social 
framework. It makes just as little sense at a time of declining 
demand for labor to make the seemingly inflexible range of jobs 
offered ("excessively high benefits") responsible for 
unemployment. No one "suddenly" decided to become unemployed in 
1992 to take advantage of the high level of unemployment 
benefits. To redefine the current level of unemployment, which 
is due to economic factors, as "voluntary" unemployment rules 
out finding a solution that tackles causes. 
  Of course, in a recession, the social insurance burden on 
companies is much higher than in an economic upturn. The social 
welfare system must be maintained in a crisis. It will now 
become apparent whether the system operates efficiently -- that 
is, is it in a position to alleviate the effects of the economic 
crisis on those who have been affected involuntarily and, thus, 
contribute to stabilizing the entire system. Like wage costs, 
in a recession, social insurance payments -- and taxes -- cannot 
be low enough for companies. However, what might appear right 
for a businessman in a given situation is not necessarily 
advantageous for the economy as a whole. What economic policy 
requires at the present time is not a limit on employment market 
instrument but the expansion of such instruments. This 
particularly applies to eastern Germany, where the state will 
bear a responsibility for developments on the labor market for a 
long time to come. 
  Today -- and this discussion also has a cyclical character 
-- 
the social welfare system is seen as being too costly to 
finance. It should not be forgotten that the current low level 
of public funds is the product of taxation (redistribution) 
measures in the 1980's and the beginning of the 1990's. The 
declared aim of the policy was to increase incentives in order 
to make the economy more competitive internationally. This 
policy not only failed to prevent the recession but could not 
succeed because the international race to lower taxation has 
resulted in all economies having a high level of state debt. 
  When there is an economic upswing, the condition of public 
finance almost "automatically" improves, just as its condition 
worsens when there is a downturn. However, it remains an open 
issue whether the improvement will result in attaining what is 
considered a normal level. Much depends on the extent to which 
politicians are prepared to check the content and scope of state 
tasks and create more efficient administrative structures. It 
is rightly conjectured that there is considerable potential for 
economies in public administration. In the short term, however, 
this potential can barely be used. 
<H5>  Monetary Policy </H5>
  Wage policy has performed its role in a reasonable way in 
that it has responded to the recessionary increases in 
unemployment with declining nominal wage increases. This also 
means it has been the most important element in combating 
inflation in Germany. A provision has been made for ensuring 
that the shocks that the German economy has experienced in the 
wake of unification can be dealt with with in the medium term 
without inflation. The mechanism that has produced this result 
can be easily understood: As a result of the reduction in the 
availability of money that is prompted by an economic upturn, 
monetary policy causes interest rates to rise, which leads to 
lower investment activity and unemployment, and because 
unemployment means that fewer wages are being paid out, this in 
turn leads to a new upturn, which is prompted by a reduction in 
interest rates above all. 
  Whether the inflation rate rises or falls at the same time 
has no bearing on whether the operation of the mechanism is 
successful, because only an increase in prices that leads to 
higher wages on a constant basis leads to inflation. 
  The restrictive effect of monetary policy will immediately 
prevent demand-related inflation, as well as a cost-related 
secondary inflation through the wage adjustment process that has 
been described. 
  What monetary policy cannot in itself prevent is an increase 
in the rate at which prices grow as a result of a real decrease 
in supply -- the effects of the explosion in oil prices provided 
a textbook illustration of this. Ultimately, such price 
increases have an important function: They alter relative 
prices and create an incentive for substitution, for increasing 
the supply of the scarce commodity and for restricting demand 
until a higher level of supply is available. However, it is 
also conceivable that to the extent that one particular price 
rises, others will fall, so that despite a real shock, the 
inflation rate will remain stable. The reduced supply of one 
particular commodity does not automatically lead to a decline in 
the demand for other goods, because as a rule, a reduction in 
supply is accompanied by the redistribution of income, which 
does not have to affect effective demand. As a result, a 
reduction in demand for other goods must be achieved through 
monetary policy. However, that can only occur by way of rising 
interest rates and rising unemployment, as described above. 
  Nevertheless, monetary policy does not have to prevent an 
increase in price levels that stems from a real shock, because 
after a certain period of time, the rate at which prices grow 
returns to its previous level if waged-induced secondary 
inflation does not occur. This cannot be expected under the 
conditions that exist in western Germany if unemployment 
increases. 
  In the case of the FRG, the real shock was unification at 
the 
beginning of the 1990's. It entailed an enormous redistribution 
of state resources that was to a large extent financed through 
raising indirect taxes. Such measures have a direct impact on 
prices. The housing shortage in western Germany has also become 
more acute through migration. In view of the liberalization of 
the housing market, this has resulted in rapid increase in 
rents. At its highest point, the increase in rents amounted to 
over 6 percent (at the end of 1992). Rents and administrative 
prices have had a big impact on the rate of inflation. They 
kept the rate at which prices were rising high well into the 
recession. A monetary policy that is oriented toward the 
inflation rate is led of course by this effect. That is 
precisely what happened in Germany. German monetary policy has 
not followed a medium-term oriented strategy, but starting in 
the middle of 1992, sought to limit the risk of inflation, which 
no longer existed, with an approach based on small steps. Once 
the recession had started, the Bundesbank, following a 
medium-term course, should have sought to reduce its key 
interest rates quickly and by substantial amounts to support and 
accelerate the fall in long-term interest rates stemming from 
the worldwide recession. The Bundesbank did not do that and the 
consequences are grave. To express things clearly, the German 
Bundesbank's policies are forcing industry into a crisis in 
terms of costs and earnings, because more housing is needed in 
Germany. 
  This policy means that jobs are being lost, because it is a 
policy that prolongs and intensifies the crisis. Anyone who 
complains about a new increase in unemployment must take account 
of the following: Over the past 20 years, monetary policy has 
steadily become more restrictive. In the 1950's and 1960's, 
interest rates never assumed an inverse character. At the 
beginning of the 1970's it amounted to five quarterly periods 
for the first time. In the middle of the 1970's, following the 
highest inflation rate that the FRG had experienced since the 
beginning of the 1950's, it amounted to four quarterly periods. 
At the beginning of the 1980's, it was already 11 quarterly 
periods. Since the beginning of 1991, it has already amounted 
to 12 quarterly periods. 
  Monetary policy that is geared toward continual expansion 
must always allow for a slowing down of economic growth. If one 
wants to stabilize prices, one must be in a position to check 
investment activity and accept unemployment temporarily in the 
belief that in the medium term, the inflation rate will come 
closer to the goal that has been set because wage policy has 
responded accordingly. That has always been the case in western 
Germany. Thus, there is no reason for monetary policy to become 
extraordinarily restrictive. 
  Since the summer of 1992, doubts have always been voiced 
about a rapid reduction in central bank interest rates. At a 
time when the German mark was largely under pressure to rise in 
value and subsequently became an overvalued currency after being 
an undervalued one, it can be assumed that the argument has 
little to do with reality: A rapid reduction in German money 
market interest rates would have led to a devaluation of the 
German mark and an increase in German capital market interest 
rates, because it has boosted expectations that inflation will 
rise and the difference in interest rates between Germany and 
other countries has grown. As has been pointed out several 
times in this article, since the summer of 1992, there was no 
basis for fearing inflation and -- as the rather premature 
behavior of several central banks showed in the first half of 
1993 -- other European countries responded to a reduction in 
German interest rates with appropriate reductions. However, even 
if there was a certain devaluation of the German mark in 
relation to, for example, the U.S. dollar, it would counteract 
the tendency to overvalue the German mark -- that is, a 
situation that is as undesirable in the long term as that trend 
toward undervaluing the German mark that lasted many years. 
  A rapid relaxation of monetary policy has been and is 
rejected with the argument that this would lead to an expansion 
of the M3 money supply. This argument is questionable for two 
reasons: First, over the past one and a half years, the 
expansion was justified in terms of potential: As has been 
indicated on many occasions, the Bundesbank set far too low a 
money supply target for 1992. Second, a rapid reduction in 
interest rates on short-term deposits -- despite a significant 
increase in the M1 money supply -- has not led to an 
acceleration, but to a slowing down of the M3 money supply, as 
many depositors have reduced short-term savings -- an important 
component of the M3 money supply -- by converting such savings 
into long-term forms of investment. 
  Trends toward checking monetary expansion are already 
apparent. The slowing down of monetary expansion should continue 
this year, especially as money market interest rates continue to 
fall. In this respect, the Bundesbank goal of between 4 and 6 
percent for 1994 is completely realistic. However, the 
Bundesbank's money supply goal contains an element that responds 
to economic developments in a way that cannot be reconciled with 
a medium-term strategy. The Bundesbank is not guided by 
whatever rate of growth is possible in the medium term but by 
the actual current rate of growth. The potential medium-term 
rate of growth amounts to 3 percent, whereas the actual rate 
amounts to 2.5 percent. This relatively low rate is 
attributable to the decline in west German investment activity. 
The decline is not entirely but largely due to a restrictive 
monetary policy. To allow that to influence the future monetary 
supply goal simply amounts to a partial abandonment of the 
concept of a medium-term monetary policy and the inclusion of a 
cyclical factor.

  [Text] Was Karl Wienand, the powerful Bundestag group 
chairman of the Social Democratic Party [SPD] between 1976 and 
1974, a KGB spy? Brigitte Seebacher-Brandt (47), Willy Brandt's 
widow, told BILD: "In the second half of March 1992, Valentin 
Falin, the former Soviet ambassador to Bonn, visited Brandt in 
Bonn." 
  During this meeting, Falin told Willy Brandt that Wienand 
was 
a KGB spy, Brigitte Seebacher-Brandt stated. The Federal 
Intelligence Service was then informed. 
  Wienand emphatically rejected all accusations yesterday. 
  In the meantime, official Bonn has been alarmed by the 
suspicions of espionage that also affect former SPD Bundestag 
group chairman Wehner, who died in 1990. 
  Waigel, the head of the Christian Democratic Union, called 
on 
the SPD in Munich "to clarify the matter." SPD leader Scharping 
did not see much new in the accusations against Wehner. 
  BILD asked former SPD leader Vogel: "Did Brandt tell you 
anything about Wienand's activities as an agent?" 
  Vogel replied: "For reasons of principle, I do not want to 
disclose details of talks that were held when Willy Brandt knew 
he would die soon. I consider this respect for human dignity. 
Thus, no conclusions can be drawn in any direction."

<F P=106> [Report signed "Fz": "Wehner Case: CSU Does Not Rule Out </F>
Investigating Committee"] 
  [Text] The Christian Social Union [CSU] group in the 
Bundestag has requested that the GDR contacts of Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] officials Herbert Wehner and 
Karl Wienand be clarified. The CSU does not rule out 
establishing an investigating committee in this connection. 
  In Bonn yesterday, Michael Glos, head of the CSU group in 
the 
Bundestag, said one must clarify the extent to which foreign 
powers had an influence on activities in the old FRG. 
  Brigitte Seebacher-Brandt, the widow of former SPD Chairman 
and Federal Chancellor Willy Brandt, who died in 1992, disclosed 
notes of her husband that create the impression Mr. Wehner, who 
died in 1990, was involved in secret cooperation with Moscow and 
East Berlin. 
  With a view to the "confessions" of young Wehner in Moscow, 
which have now become public and in which he denounced comrades 
in Germany during the Stalin era as deviationists, Glos stated 
that it had to be clarified whether the former chairman of the 
SPD Bundestag group was liable to blackmailing. Glos added that 
clarification was also necessary in connection with the 
suspicion that Karl Wienand, Wehner's long-standing Bundestag 
group manager, might have spied for the GDR or the Soviet KGB. 
  Guenter Verheugen, federal manager of the SPD, spoke of a 
"campaign" that, considering the treatment of hitherto 
unpublished files, provided a foretaste of the 1994 super 
election year. The SPD's attention was to be deviated from the 
election campaign and its party leadership was to be presented 
in a suspicious light. 
  Former SPD Chairman Hans-Jochen Vogel told Cologne EXPRESS 
that Brandt never accused Wehner of espionage. SPD Deputy Klaus 
Lennartz accused Brigitte Seebacher-Brandt of suffering from an 
image neurosis. 
  Wienand rejected the accusation that, regarding Willy 
Brandt's overthrow in 1974, Wehner served the cause of the 
former Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED] rulers or 
intercepted Honecker letters to Brandt. Wienand said Wehner, 
who was a member of the German Communist Party until the 1940's, 
used his former contacts to achieve progress in inner-German 
relations.

<F P=106> [Report signed "sp": "Antifascists Criticize Police"] </F>
  [Text] Hannover, 18 January -- The Goettingen "Autonome 
Antifa" group has accused the police of attempting to obstruct 
its antifascist activities. The Lower Saxon Land Office of 
Criminal Investigations [LKA] has been investigating the group 
for more than two years on the grounds that some of its members 
are suspected of belonging to a terrorist group. 
  The "Autonome Antifa" on Tuesday [18 January] described the 
effects of the police investigations on the group. The members 
of the group are exposed to permanent harassment, including 
regular observation of their meetings and even their private 
apartments. Telephones have been bugged. Their publications 
and press releases are picked up at the receivers and the papers 
are then examined for fingerprints by the LKA. Whenever the 
group rents halls for meetings, LKA officers have questioned the 
owners of the premises and even showed them files with 
photographs. For one rally, the group rented a loudspeaker van; 
the officers later confiscated the files of the car rental place 
and even questioned employees. Over the weekend, the Greens 
party of Goettingen stated that representatives of their party, 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], and the Federation 
of German Trade Unions [DGB] received summons from the LKA. 
They were asked to testify in the preliminary procedures 
against members of the "Autonome Antifa." Last March, this 
group assumed the initiative for a demonstration against 
neo-Nazi activist Hans-Michael Fiedler and his training center 
in Adelebsen (Goettingen district). Some 2,000 demonstrators 
participated in the nonviolent protest march after the appeal 
was also backed by members of the Greens, the SPD, and the DGB. 
  The "Autonome Antifa" has concluded from the LKA actions 
that 
"efficient, broadly based antifascist work is to be prevented." 
Neo-Nazi activists such as Fiedler, however, are able to enhance 
their activities under the eyes of the state prosecutor and the 
LKA, it was said. When asked about this by FRANKFURTER 
RUNDSCHAU, a spokesman for the Lower Saxon Interior Ministry 
said the LKA was conducting its investigations on the 
instructions of the chief state prosecutor of Celle.

  [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- According to information from 
the BERLINER MORGENPOST, the units of the Western Group of 
Russian Armed Forces still stationed in Germany are missing over 
80,000 tonnes of ammunition. Major General Hartmut Foertsch, 
the federal government's authorized representative for the 
withdrawal of the Western Group, told the paper (Sunday [23 
January] edition) that on 1 January 1991, a total 677,000 tonnes 
of ammunition had been stored in Germany. Of this amount, 
580,390 tonnes had been dispatched to Russia between 1991 and 
1993. The Western Group had reported stocks of only 15,560 
tonnes of ammunition on 1 January 1994. There was uncertainty 
about the whereabouts of the missing 81,050 tonnes. 
  The general criticized the fact that the Russian side is "at 
present refusing to enter into discussion" with the German 
liaison command he heads.

  [Excerpt] Frankfurt, 20 January -- Russia, Belarus, and 
Ukraine can count on significantly more apartments for their 
troops returning from the former GDR than were originally 
expected under the program financed by the Federal Government, 
according to Konrad Hinrichs, chairman of the Foreign 
Construction Commission of the Main Association of the German 
Construction Industry. Instead of the approximately 36,000 
housing units that were the subject of an agreement, it is now 
expected that approximately 45,000 units will be built at 40 
different locations. They will be handed over at the end of 
1994. 
  The Federal Government had originally made 7.8 billion 
German 
marks [DM] available for apartments, technical and social 
infrastructure, certain production facilities, and housing 
construction combines. Last year, a further DM550 million was 
added to the housing program. According to figures provided by 
Hinrichs, contracts for over 40,000 housing units at 37 
different locations have been signed. A further four or five 
locations where 5,000 housing units are to be built are still at 
the planning stage. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial by Republikaner Chairman Franz Schoenhuber: </F>
"Germany -- Where Are You Going? 1994 -- Year of Decision"] 
  [Text] "Our economic-technological system, applied by a 
centralizing bureaucracy craving to rule, is eating itself up as 
Saturn ate his children; we are overpopulated, have 
overfabricated and overproduced, are overfed, and have 
dehumanized our public servants with letters and ink, dispirited 
the administration, and dissolved everything into a dead 
mechanism!" 
  Karl Reichsfreiherr vom und zum Stein, written in the first 
third of the last century. 
  This dead mechanism is more "alive" today than ever. The 
established political class has moved too far away from 
humanness, adopted dictatorial practices, and only knows one 
objective: survival at any price, even at the price of the 
decline of its own people: apres nous le deluge [after us the 
deluge]! 
  Have we learned something from the historical catastrophe 
that was the result of a Nazi regime gone hubristic? Maybe that 
we walk upright? 
  I have experienced the Third Reich fully aware of what it 
was, so I allow myself to compare it with other systems, and I 
claim that the people who lived at that time had a higher degree 
of personal courage than the present generation. Moreover, one 
must take into account that resistance in those unfortunate 12 
years not only meant restrictions or even the loss of one's 
civil existence, but that quite frequently it even lead to 
death. We Republikaners are filled with great pride that a man 
such as resistance fighter Hans Hirzel, member of the "White 
Rose," has found his political home in our party. 
  What legitimizes those who were born later to condemn those 
who were maneuvered into a bitter time by fate? The regime was 
criminal, but the people who lived under it were not. They were 
victims of a megalomania that covered up its real intentions 
very well at the beginning. However, they were also victims of 
the failure of the parties in the Weimar Republic. 
  Those who, today, want to spare the FRG the fate of Weimar, 
and who want to save our people from another moral and cultural 
decline, have to go to the roots and not just treat the 
symptoms. The renewal and consolidation of democracy must be 
everyone's cause and not be left only to those who call 
themselves representatives of the people, and who frequently 
only represent interests of their own or of certain groupings. 
Petitions for referenda and referenda must be rated more highly. 
  The watering down of traditional links and values must end, 
liberalism must not be confounded with libertinism. The harmful 
influence of the American way of life, which is characterized by 
success-based thinking at any price, must be forced back. These 
influences are particularly strong in the sphere of movies, 
radio, and television. The struggle for audience rating 
eliminates the last ethical and moral scruples. Women are made 
the object of lusty craving, degraded into merchandise and cheap 
labeled articles. The sexual act is exhibited on the screen, 
just like that between apes in a zoo, in all its varieties and 
deviations. While Africa is putting on clothes and listening to 
Mozart, we are taking off clothes and discovering the particular 
artistic value of the bush drum. 
  Even children are harnessed to the cart of the advertising 
industry and confronted day after day with the representation of 
violence of the worst kind. Such representations seduce people 
into imitating them, and we citizens even promote these 
activities by paying excessively high fees. One has to think 
intensively about abolishing these fees. 
  The churches bear a great part of the blame for the moral 
decline. They subject themselves almost unconditionally to the 
zeitgeist to deviate attention from their failure in the Third 
Reich. Here it is also true that churchmen showed more backbone 
in the Nazi state than their successors do now. I would like to 
mention Cardinal von Galen or Pastor Niemoeller in this 
connection. 
  I am of the opinion that the spying activities of Manfred 
Stolpe, the current minister president of Brandenburg and 
Evangelical churchman, must be regarded as worse than the 
divisive and ingratiating attitude of the then "Reichbishop" 
Mueller in the Third Reich. Mueller acted openly, while Stolpe 
was spying behind people's backs. 
  We Republikaners are in favor of the separation of Church 
and 
State. What Frederick the Great said is valid for us, namely 
that each may be saved after his own fashion. Where is the 
Christian way of doing things of political pastors from Hintze 
to Thierse? As we can see, even for somebody like Mr. Hintze a 
lie is a "bourgeois prejudice" -- just as it was for Lenin. 
  The church tax has favored this moral degeneration. Church 
servants have become church earners. Moral regeneration of the 
churches will only be possible when they go back to the status 
of the early Christians, when they renew themselves in the 
catacombs, so to speak. 
  Even many years before Bluem, who ultimately caved in 
anyway, 
we requested that the church tax not be levied by means of the 
state. Besides, we regard it as legitimate to hold a referendum 
on whether the church tax makes sense or does not. 
  What must also be exposed is the hypocrisy, particularly in 
the case of "Christian" politicians, who are least qualified to 
moralize. In my former capacity as a journalist I repeatedly 
had the experience that the first thing leading Christian Social 
Union officials did once they arrived at their destination on an 
official visit was to ask for the address of a brothel, and then 
they exchanged their "experiences" with a twinkle in their eyes. 
They are the same politicians who appeared with their entire 
families at Catholic Church or Evangelical Academy receptions, 
effectively displaying their deep piety in public. If we 
Republikaners were to strike back with the same instruments the 
established parties and their foundations are using against us, 
I would guarantee the moral "decapitation" of quite a few 
Christian politicians and even Catholic dignitaries, who 
clandestinely live in pseudomarital conditions, while calling 
from their pulpits for compliance with the Church's commandments. 
  We are all human beings. And who will throw the first stone? 
We will not! We will not even throw back the stones that bear 
a signature and are aimed at us. We want an open exchange but 
will not hit below the belt. We have political opponents but 
not enemies. If a politician like Mr. Stoiber says the "enemy 
stands at the right," then this proves, first, that he does not 
know the first thing about the rules of the game of democracy 
and, second, that in order to stay in power he is capable of 
doing anything. After all, as everybody knows, he is determined 
to conduct the election campaign with ideas right of center. 
  Let us not deceive ourselves. Even our party is not yet 
everywhere in the best possible shape necessary to credibly 
represent our causes. Self-criticism must not become a foreign 
word for us. Our program is good. We must manage to bring our 
program and members to one level everywhere. 
  The year 1994 is the year of decision -- not only for our 
party, but also for our people. The zeitgeist is abdicating; it 
has no more money. That gives us a chance! Let us do 
everything we can to make sure people cannot say at the end of 
the year: tried and found wanting! I believe in our success!

<F P=106> [Report signed "dm": "Poll: Scharping Still Ahead of Kohl"] </F>
  [Text] Berlin -- According to an opinion poll, Rudolf 
Scharping, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD], continues to be more popular than Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
A total of 31 percent of 2,522 persons polled by the Forsa 
Institute supported Scharping, and 28 percent Kohl. Thus, 
Scharping has won another percent after the verbal duel at the 
Bundestag during the budget debate. Kohl lost 1 percent. 
  Asked about the different parties, 42 percent endorsed the 
SPD -- 2 percent more than last week. The Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union lost 2 percent and was only 
supported by 34 percent. Alliance 90/Greens achieved 8 percent 
in the weekly Forsa poll carried out on behalf of RTL, and the 
Free Democratic Party of Germany 7 percent. 
  Chances are also increasing for the Party of Democratic 
Socialism [PDS] to reenter parliament after the next elections. 
In the most recent Allensbach poll, the successor party of the 
Socialist Unity Party of Germany achieved over 5 percent (5.3) 
for the first time. In eastern Germany, its share of votes 
doubled from 1992 to 1993 to 21.9 percent. In the Brandenburg 
local elections, which took place at the beginning of December, 
the PDS emerged as the second strongest party (21.2 percent). 
  The PDS also notes growing support in the West. Election 
manager Andre Brie estimates PDS potential at approximately 2 
percent. "Our election opportunities have, so far, been 
massively underestimated." This should change. The fight for 
votes and mandates is being strategically planned. A total of 
17 million German marks will be made available for the campaign 
for the Bundestag and European elections. Brie mentioned these 
figures in Berlin yesterday. 
  To explore the mood among the people, the PDS engaged 
several 
polling institutes. The tenor of the results is: Over 50 
percent of the east Germans and approximately 15 percent of the 
west Germans are likely to endorse the "leftist-opposition" 
spectrum and, thus, the PDS. Brie hopes for considerable 
support among those younger than 25. According to Emnid, 55 
percent of this age group support the PDS campaign against the 
asylum law and the great bugging campaign. 
  Brie considers the fight for the nonvoters decisive for a 
PDS 
success. A total of 43 percent of the citizens in the new 
laender (35 percent in the west) want to boycott the upcoming 
elections.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Political Barometer: SPD Leading in </F>
Economic Competence"] 
  [Text] Mainz -- A total of 48 percent of Germans expect the 
Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] to win this autumn's 
Bundestag elections, while only 17 percent think the Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] will come out 
on top. This is the result of an opinion poll conducted by a 
Mannheim-based research group for the ZDF television network's 
"Political Barometer." 
  If elections were held now, the CDU/CSU would gain 36 
percent 
of the votes --this is 1 percent less than last December. The 
SPD still holds at 39 percent and the Free Democratic Party of 
Germany at 6 percent, while the Greens/Alliance 90 are supported 
by 10 percent, the Republikaner by 4 percent, and the Party of 
Democratic Socialism by 3 percent of the voters. Scharping, the 
SPD candidate for chancellor, has the approval of 52 percent of 
the voters, while Chancellor Kohl's (CDU) rate of approval is at 
34 percent. 
  The research group conducting the poll considers the main 
reason for this trend to be a shift in competence regarding 
economic issues. Thus, 39 percent of those polled are confident 
that the SPD could solve the problems in eastern Germany -- this 
is 7 percent more than six months ago, while only 24 percent 
consider the government able to do so -- 4 percent down on last 
July. Only 30 percent think the present government is able to 
solve the economic problems in the west (minus 6 percent); 41 
percent consider the SPD competent (plus 8 percent).

<F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Joffe: "Mark Two"] </F>
  [Text] At the beginning of Bill Clinton's presidency, it 
looked as though the candidate would have to expect a 4 [out of 
a possible 5] for overall performance on his year-end report 
card. In domestic policy, one blunder followed the other, 
especially in personnel matters. To date, many of his 
candidates are still in limbo between being confirmed by the 
Senate and sinking into oblivion. Foreign policy did not take 
place -- and if it did, it deserved the rating: "idea good, 
execution inadequate." 
  After one year in office, Clinton deserves a 2. In domestic 
policy, he has meanwhile shown a good performance. Cutting the 
deficit has begun and a general health insurance and the control 
of portable firearms are under way. Following Somalia (3-) and 
Haiti (5), he got three good marks in foreign policy: for 
concluding GATT, for ratifying the free trade agreement with 
Canada and Mexico (NAFTA), and finally, Clinton's top 
performance at the NATO summit. 
  Unfortunately, however, it is not just the bitter cold at 
home that troubles him on his first anniversary. In time for 
the anniversary, a special public prosecutor was appointed to 
look into the Clinton's alleged embezzlements in connection with 
the Whitewater company. The same thing happened to Richard 
Nixon, and that is why Washington now has a Whitewatergate. 
What if the affair ends up in smoke? In this case, Clinton has 
the best chances of getting reelected in 1996. For, the economy 
is finally recovering and, as we all know, election results are 
predetermined by the purse.

  [Excerpts] The day after yet another setback at the Geneva 
talks on Bosnia, with all camps seeming to favor the logic of 
war, the question is being raised more and more openly of the 
continuing presence of the Blue Helmets, first by the British -- 
who nevertheless rule out withdrawing alone -- and also by the 
French. Today a Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that the 
departure of the Blue Helmets is, I quote, an option among 
others, while stressing the negative consequences that such a 
decision would entail. 
  Some of the French Blue Helmets have arrived back at their 
barracks in Frejus . Sandra Smit and Didier Beaumont report: 
  [Smit] [passage omitted] The defense minister made a point 
of 
paying tribute to the men of the 21st Regiment of Marines in 
Frejus, but also to the 9,000 French troops still deployed on 
the ground. [passage omitted] As Francois Leotard stressed, the 
political decisions of the UN take precedence over the demands 
of the military authorities. 
  Since the outbreak of the Bosnian conflict, several generals 
have overstepped the rules. In the defense minister's view, 
this is no chance coincidence and the United Nations should 
reconsider the matter: 
  [Begin Leotard recording] We believe that if there is a 
crisis, it is not a crisis between France and the United 
Nations. It is a crisis within the United Nations itself, with 
particular reference to its ability to handle situations as 
complex as that obtaining in the former Yugoslavia, to the chain 
of command, and also to the infirmity of the general staff in 
New York, which is obviously not adapted to this type of 
situation. [end recording] 
  [Smit] Francois Leotard will soon be sending a memorandum to 
the United Nations, asking for very clear guidelines on the 
terms governing the use of the French troops, and above all on 
whether they are needed at all.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Juppe by Christine </F>
Fauvet-Mycia and Sylvie Pierre-Brossolette in Paris -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Fauvet-Mycia] Good evening, Mr. Juppe. 
  [Juppe] Good evening. 
  [Fauvet-Mycia] [passage omitted] We start with Bosnia and 
the 
first question from Sylvie Pierre-Brossolette of L'EXPRESS. 
  [Pierre-Brossolette] Following the failure of the Geneva 
talks, you are proposing a complete review of the whole Bosnian 
issue. Is this a diplomatic way of saying that nothing more can 
be done, or do you really hope to get anything out of your 
current international contacts? 
  [Juppe] Whatever the temptation, we cannot say that nothing 
more can be done. If I proposed a review of the issue, it is 
because the time has come to ask some fundamental questions. We 
have taken many initiatives since last April. France is behind 
the adoption of the UN resolution on sanctions; we can see its 
impact today. France also launched the idea of the security 
zones, which was adopted but not implemented. We, that is 
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and myself are behind the 
plan which brought about the European Union initiative. All 
this has failed, and we must have the courage to say so. 
  In Geneva in the last 48 hours, the various parties went 
back 
on the agreement in principle which they gave in November or 
December. As far as the NATO summit initiative launched on 10 
and 11 January is concerned, it included two concrete 
operations: one to reopen the airport in Tuzla, the other to 
organize the relief of the Canadian contingent in Srebrenica. 
These operations are still bogged down in endless talks. This 
cannot go on like that. 
  Should we leave? This is the question some are asking today, 
particularly in the foreign countries which are providing 
troops. What would be the consequences of a pullout? Have they 
been clearly assessed? [They are] the humanitarian catastrophe 
which would undoubtedly ensue, and the risk of a general 
conflagration in the region. Those who believe that a pull-out 
is unavoidable and who create the conditions for a pullout 
should weigh their responsibility in such a contingency. If a 
pull-out of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] is ruled out, how 
can we get out of the diplomatic deadlock in which we are 
trapped today? Perhaps all the great powers, and not only the 
12 countries of the European Union, should get more deeply 
involved in telling the three warring factions: That's enough 
now. 
  [Questioner] Is that what you are now asking your partners 
to do? 
  [Juppe] This is what I am assessing; this is what I said 
yesterday. With all our partners, I am now considering, if you 
allow me to say so, how we could bounce back. As you know, the 
American secretary of state will be in Paris over the weekend; I 
will meet him on Monday, I believe. I have contacts with my 
German and British colleagues too. In short, we must look for a 
way out of the deadlock in which the warring parties have 
trapped themselves. Things must be clearly said. At the start 
of the conflict, it was rightly said that the Serbs were the 
aggressors. They were the aggressors. The Croats too have a 
great deal to feel guilty about. However, today, all observers 
monitoring developments on the ground, and that includes the 
UNPROFOR staff which drafted telling reports, agree that the 
Bosnian army, the army of the Bosnian Muslims, has more 
equipment and more men and now considers that it can achieve its 
goals through war and not through negotiations. This must be 
said in order to apportion responsibilities to the various 
parties and to move forward. 
  [Questioner] At a time when others are on the verge of 
giving 
up, do you believe that France will be able to remain the only 
one to say that something must be done? 
  [Juppe] We cannot grow tired and as far as I am concerned, 
whatever the difficulties, I shall not grow tired. You are 
right to point out that when one considers what is happening on 
the international stage, France is probably the country that has 
done the most. First, thanks to its soldiers on the ground; 
they are playing a wonderful role. Then, through the financing, 
with its partners within the European Union, of the largest 
share of the humanitarian aid. And finally, through the 
multiplicity of its diplomatic initiatives, which I recalled 
earlier. 
  [Questioner] Are you already considering that you might have 
to explain that soldiers in the area might have to pull out next 
spring or next winter? 
  [Juppe] Earlier in this program I tried to outline the 
consequences of such a pullout, so before rushing into this easy 
solution which might be welcomed by some of our partners, we 
must think carefully and, I repeat, weigh all the consequences 
and look for other solutions. The other solution, which I 
believe is the only one which would prevent a disaster today, is 
a diplomatic initiative by all those who can influence the three 
warring factions. You can see today that some of these factions 
feel encouraged by the absence of our great international 
partners, encouraged to continue fighting. It must be put to 
them clearly that there is no solution in this direction. 
  [Questioner] How do you explain the fact that General Cot 
has been recalled by the United Nations? Valery Giscard 
d'Estaing told the [National Assembly] Foreign Affairs Select 
Committee yesterday that General de Gaulle would have never 
accepted such a decision. How do you react to these remarks? 
  [Juppe] I am a Gaullist, but I do not believe I am entitled 
to speak on behalf of General de Gaulle. 
  [Questioner] What about the recall of Gen. Cot? Do you 
understand this? 
  [Juppe] Listen, we were told that this was taking place in 
the framework of a rotation within the UN system. Having said 
that, I will remind you of something obvious, something simple 
which is not a criticism of anyone, namely, the supreme 
authority commanding Gen. Cot in the framework of UNPROFOR is 
the UN secretary general. 
  [Questioner] Don't you believe that, at times, there are 
double standards and that the UN is sometimes harder on some 
French or European generals than it is on American generals, in 
Somalia for instance? 
  [Juppe] Perhaps. 
  [Questioner] Therefore we cannot understand the reactions 
and 
the arguments provoked by this recall. 
  [Juppe] I did not condemn any reaction, I simply refuse to 
take part in any argument. Having said that, I will naturally 
mention this to the UN secretary general when we next meet. 
There is probably a problem. I believe this is the fourth 
general to have been thus expended, if I may use this word, by 
the UN in the former Yugoslavia. This means that this system 
must contain a certain number of -- how can I put it? -- a 
certain number of dysfunctions. 
  [Questioner] Do you intend to visit the area and are these 
visits to the area useful? 
  [Juppe] You know I am not very keen on media diplomacy, and 
in some of these visits, promotion through the media is often at 
the forefront. I might go there if it is useful, if it enables 
me to understand better, to have a constructive and positive 
meeting with the authorities in Sarajevo. 
  [Questioner] Is this planned; have you got a date? 
  [Juppe] I am considering the issue, but I have not decided 
on 
a date yet. 
  [Fauvet-Mycia] Mr. Juppe, we have three short questions 
concerning foreign affairs. First, Algeria: Are you optimistic 
following the recent goodwill gestures made by the Algerian 
Government in favor of the Islamists? Do you expect more 
gestures? 
  [Juppe] I am not optimistic as far as Algeria is concerned 
and I note that the situation is still deteriorating; there is, 
in particular, growing violence. I hear some people asking: 
What is France doing? I would like to point out that we do not 
hold the solution to all problems. First of all the Algerians 
themselves have to solve this conflict, which is looking more 
and more like a civil war. 
  What we did first was to take the necessary security 
measures 
to prevent too many threats against our nationals. 
Unfortunately, these measures are not fully effective. We also 
encouraged the Algerian authorities to make some moves, since 
conservatism, the status quo, brings failure. They made some 
moves in the economic sphere. Unfortunately, the political 
climate is such that this economic reform, which will probably 
be included in the agreement which the Algerian Government 
reaches with the IMF, will certainly be extremely difficult to 
implement. The various ways for a meaningful dialogue must be 
explored. 
  [Fauvet-Mycia] Let us go further east, to Saudi Arabia. You 
have just been there with Edouard Balladur. It was an obvious 
failure, you did not sign any contracts. What happened? 
Everyone is puzzled. Why go there if you do not bring back 
anything? What was the mistake? Was it because the Quai 
d'Orsay was not involved in the negotiations? 
  [Juppe] We do not have such ambition. I have visited Saudi 
Arabia before, several ministers have visited it. It is 
absolutely necessary to have a close relationship with this 
country, which plays an important political and economic role. 
The prime minister rightly visited this country and, in 
particular, you will see that three large contracts will 
materialize in the coming days. 
  [Fauvet-Mycia] Concerning which areas? 
  [Juppe] You will know when they are announced. I am always 
very prudent where contracts are concerned. You must have two 
partners agreeing before you can announce anything. 
  [Fauvet-Mycia] With regard to Franco-Chinese relations, 
Michel Rocard spoke of disgrace for France. I assume you will 
tell me that this is somehow disproportionate, but were all the 
necessary steps taken? Was the Quai d'Orsay left on the 
sidelines in this instance, too? 
  [Juppe] Listen, one cannot just say anything -- I am 
naturally referring to Mr. Rocard. One of my very first goals 
when I became foreign minister was to re-establish normal 
relations with China. Every step came from our side. I have the 
list of the meetings which I chaired myself, or which the prime 
minister chaired at my request, in order to achieve this result. 
This is a diplomatic success which I am claiming as one of the 
achievements of French diplomacy and, once more, Mr. Rocard -- 
who has no clear idea whatsoever on foreign policy -- has lost 
the opportunity to remain silent. 
  He may be obsessed with arms sales to Taiwan, that is his 
problem, but to choose between Taiwan and a country numbering 
1.3 billion people, a country which is one of the world's 
leading powers, a country achieving an annual growth rate of 
13.5 percent, to choose as he does is either shortsighted or 
evidence of a political negativism -- which by the way is Mr. 
Rocard's trademark. You will note that he has become Mr. Nyet -- 
he says no to everything; this is a kind of stubborness in the 
opposition which, it seems, is a sign of the future candidacy in 
the presidentioal elections. This has nothing to do with 
diplomacy. 
  I repeat that I am deeply satisfied with what has been 
achieved, and the Quai d'Orsay played its full role in this, as 
might have been expected. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, Jan 21 (AFP) -- Georgian President Eduard 
Shevardnadze and French counterpart Francois Mitterrand on 
Friday [21 January] signed a friendship treaty at the close of a 
two-day official visit by the Georgian leader. 
  Shevardnadze also initialled the Paris charter of the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) which 
sanctioned the end of the Cold War. 
  Shevardnadze already signed the charter in 1990 when he was 
foreign minister of the former Soviet Union. 
  Mitterrand, referring to Georgia's economic difficulties and 
the Abkhazia secession, said Tbilisi "can count on the 
solidarity of its friends." 
  In a meeting on Thursday with French business leaders, 
Shevardnadze said France could make a great contribution to 
exploiting his country's assets and pulling it out of a 
catastrophic recession.

  [Text] Paris, Jan 22 (AFP) -- French President Francois 
Mitterrand on Saturday [22 January] called for a "new departure" 
in Franco-Chinese relations after talks with the Chinese foreign 
minister formally healed a rift over French arms sales to Taiwan. 
  Mitterrand, during a 30-minute meeting with Qian Qichen who 
arrived earlier Saturday, said he wanted to "give a new 
departure to our relations. It would be beneficial for both our 
countries." 
  The French president was quoted by his spokesman Jean 
Musitelli, who added that the meeting "confirmed the desire for 
a rapprochement" on both sides. 
  Mitterrand notably said that "we must increase initiatives 
now that we agree that things should improve." 
  Qian told reporters after his meeting with Mitterrand that 
"the future of Sino-French relations is very promising," when 
asked about prospects for economic and industrial cooperation. 
  But later Foreign Minister Alain Juppe rebuked China for its 
human rights record, saying "a lot must still be done" in that 
area. 
  But Juppe said that Qian's trip to France marks "a new 
departure" in Franco-Chinese relations following the healing of 
the year-long rift over French arms sales to Taiwan. 
  He said in addition to the human rights issue his meeting 
with Qian also focused on nuclear proliferation, regional 
conflicts and the role of the UN Security Council of which 
Beijing is a permanent member. 
  The minister's three-day official visit was scheduled after 
Franco-Chinese relations returned to normal on January 12 when 
Paris pledged not to conclude any new arms contracts with Taiwan. 
  Relations had been strained for a year after a contract for 
the sale of 60 Mirage 2000-5 bombers to Taiwan, followed up by 
the sale of gunboats, but Juppe said these contracts would be 
honored although France would not be signing any new arms sales 
agreements. 
  Mitterrand noted that "in recent years, Franco-Chinese 
relations went through difficulties, particularly because of a 
dip in trade," according to Musitelli. 
  Qian, pointing out that China was experiencing high growth 
rates, said his country "is a market with strong potential for 
foreign businesses, particularly French ones, which are welcome." 
  French businessmen are keen to return to the lucrative 
Chinese market after being excluded over arms deals with Taiwan. 
  A pro-Tibet committee on Thursday urged French authorities 
to 
push the issue of human rights in the autonomous region during 
Qian's visit. 
  Qian was due to meet French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur 
on Monday. Balladur is soon to pay a visit to China, probably 
in March. 
  On Monday he is also to meet U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher to discuss human rights issues, conditional on the 
United States renewing China's most favoured nation status next 
June.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Francois Mitterrand by Svetoslav </F>
Terziev; place and date not given: "Bulgaria Advanced in 
Transition Toward Democracy"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Terzivev] Who could 
guarantee Bulgaria's security after the disappearance of the 
communist military system? Could it remain a neutral state or 
should it join the Western structures, such as NATO and the 
Western European Union [WEU]? 
  [Mitterrand] I fully understand Bulgaria's concern regarding 
the situation we call the "security vacuum" in Central and East 
Europe. There are several ways to cope with this situation. 
The sense of insecurity, which is based on military 
considerations, springs from various other forms of instability 
that are related to the country's economic, social, and even 
ethnic situation. Therefore, France has proposed initiatives of 
preventive diplomacy that aim to prevent or decrease tension. 
This is the essence of the French idea on the pact of 
stability, which was adopted by the European Union. The other 
possibilities lie in strengthening bilateral cooperation, which 
we subscribe to. The third possibility is in working to bring 
the countries of Central and East Europe closer together, on the 
one hand, and the European security organizations and 
associations, on the other. In this context, France advocates 
opening up those structures to the aforementioned countries. 
France proposed a formula for the association within the WEU of 
the countries that have already been associated or are in the 
process of associating with the European Union. 
  In addition, it is well known that the last NATO summit 
adopted the Partnership for Peace initiative. As I said in 
Brussels, this concept allows us to respond to the concern of 
states that want to associate with NATO and also avoid Russia's 
negative reaction -- which a new division of Europe would have 
caused, something that would have been detrimental to European 
security. For me, Partnership for Peace means that no threat 
could be directed against the sovereignty and territorial 
integrity of any partner state without affecting the other 
partner states. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Mr. Clinton's First Year"] </F>
  [Text] One year after his inauguration (20 January 1993), 
Bill Clinton is enjoying rather comfortable approval ratings. 
According to various surveys, 54 to 60 percent of Americans say 
they are satisfied with their 42d President. This is a dramatic 
recovery after a difficult summer during which George Bush's 
successor had fallen lower in his fellow citizens' esteem than 
any President since World War II. 
  "America first," such was the tireless rallying cry of 
democratic candidate Clinton throughout his electoral campaign. 
The promise was kept. Mr. Clinton managed to get Congress to 
approve a budget that is a first step on the deficit-cutting 
road. He also pushed through a plan for penniless university 
students to retroactively finance their education through 
community service. Above all, he saw to the passage of the 
Brady Bill, which imposes a five-day wait on gun sales in order 
to check the buyer's criminal record and which had been stalled 
for years. 
  A blueprint for health care reform -- the President's grand 
design, and that of his wife Hillary -- was unveiled. Mr. 
Clinton did not wobble on the essential aspect of it, which is 
offering health insurance to all Americans, regardless of their 
financial resources. Debate in Congress on the ambitious 
project will likely take up the better part of 1994. Even if 
the final result does not fulfil all hopes placed into the 
reform, M. Clinton can at least be credited with tackling a 
vital issue which his predecessors had cagily eschewed. 
  The year 1993 ended with two successes as regards 
international trade liberalization: The passage by Congress of 
the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, 
and the successful conclusion of the Uruguay round of GATT. Mr. 
Clinton's intensive last-minute canvassing of Congress members 
in the former case and his ability to demonstrate a measure of 
flexibility so as to carry the day in the latter were major 
factors in these two victories. 
  This year's weaknesses are to be found on foreign policy, 
with the exception of trade matters. In Bosnia and Haiti, after 
looking determined to act, Mr. Clinton backed down. He also let 
himself be foiled by General Aidid's stubborn resistance in 
Somalia. However, all this -- including his perhaps 
indiscriminate support to Boris Yeltsin -- hardly matters in the 
eye of his fellow Americans. Most important is the fact that 
Mr. Clinton's first year in the White House was also the one 
during which America reacquainted itself with economic growth.

  [Text] Paris, Jan 22 (AFP) -- French authorities have 
placed under house arrest a Kurdish leader and are planning to 
expel him despite his assertion that his political actions are 
legal, an anti-racism group said here Saturday [22 January]. 
  The Movement Against Racism and for Friendship Between 
People 
said Azad Dere had been questioned by police in Paris on 
Thursday and then ordered to remain at home in the south of 
France. 
  Interior Minister Charles Pasqua signed an expulsion order 
for Azad Dere on December 30 as part of a Europe-wide crackdown 
on Kurdish activists. 
  Dere told AFP by telephone he had been detained while acting 
as an interpreter for a visiting Kurdish delegation. 
  "My activities in France are perfectly legal," he said. "I 
have a resident's permit that is valid until 2003." 
  Police have placed him under house arrest "until they can 
find a country that will accept me after my expulsion from 
France," he said, adding that the expulsion order was a result 
of pressure from the Turkish Government. 
  On November 18, police carried out an operation against 
Kurds 
suspected of involvement with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, 
which is fighting the Turkish Government for an independent 
state. 
  Sixteen of the Kurds detained in the raids are still being 
held and three others are under house arrest. Azad Dere slipped 
through the net while he was attending a meeting of the European 
Parliament in Strasbourg. 
  In a statement, the Movement Against Racism demanded Azad 
Dere's immediate release, charging that "this new act of 
complicity (with the government in Ankara) dishonored France."

  [Text] Rome, Jan 22 (AFP) -- The Italian Popular Party 
(PPI) opened its founding congress here Saturday [22 January] by 
firmly rejecting an invitation by the formerly communist 
Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) to join a left-leaning 
alliance. 
  PPI officials, seeking to regroup forces from the 
ex-Christian Democratic (DC) Party and outline a strategy and 
alliances for the upcoming March elections, left open the 
possibility of joining a right-wing alliance. 
  Rosa Russo Jervolino and Mino Martinazzoli, respectively 
president and national secretary of the PPI, told a crammed 
constituent assembly in Rome's conference center that they would 
refuse to "forge alliances that would contradict the identity of 
the new party." 
  Occhetto was wrong to invite the PPI to joining his 
progressive alliance and thus make the PPO "a satellite," 
Martinazzoli said to strong applause. 
  "We are not looking for solitude, we are not against joining 
forces, but we have paid such a high price for our mistakes that 
we will never renounce our reason for existing," he said. 
  Jervolino insisted the PPI would "maintain an identity as a 
party of Christian inspiration even if it should mean losing 
votes" and said she would set three conditions for any alliance 
-- solidarity, democracy and national unity. 
  The PPI, which adopted its new name last Tuesday, has been 
troubled from its inception, as a break in DC ranks led to the 
creation of a parallel centre-right party, the Christian 
Democratic Centre, whose avowed aim is to form an alliance with 
the federalist Northern League of Umberto Bossi. 
  Over the past few months, other former Christian Democrats 
have also left to join the conservative right or the progressive 
alliance of the left. 
  According to a survey of 1,700 voters carried out by the 
CIRM 
polling institute for Telemontecarlo television, an alliance of 
the Popular Party and the "Pact for Italy" launched by ex-DC 
centrist Mario Segni would win 22 percent of the vote, the same 
as its main rival, the ex-communist Democratic Party of the Left 
(PDS). 
  Segni, who is a candidate to head the future government 
after 
the March 27-28 elections, began consultations on Friday to 
determine who would rally to his movement which presents itself 
as a centre-right alliance with no ties to the neofascist 
Italian Socialist Movement (MSI). 
  Segni's first meeting with Martinazzoli appeared Saturday to 
have led to agreement on a broad plan of action. 
  The two men, considered in the moderate DC tradition, are 
seeking to enlarge their movement from its traditionally 
Catholic base to include lay forces. 
  Most observers say, however, that an alliance between the 
Northern League and the moderate centre-right axis would stand 
the best chance of winning the upcoming elections. 
  Also Saturday, neofascists and hardline communists were 
holding their respective congresses Saturday at a hotel close to 
the PPI congress. 
  The congress of the "Refounded Communists" was in its third 
day at Rome's Ergife hotel, where the "National Alliance" of the 
neofascist MSI and other ultra-conservative leaders were also 
meeting. 
  These two movements are trying to convince voters that they 
have become moderate enough to be able to join any future 
government alliance.

  [Text] The congress of the neocommunists is drawing to a 
close. The congress has elected a new party secretary in Fausto 
Bertinotti. There were bitter arguments over the decision to 
change the Communist Refoundation Party into a force for 
government. Guido Dell'Acquila reports: 
  [Dell'Acquila] The change in the Refoundation Party has been 
achieved. The manifesto proposed by the United Left group, 
which faced the thorny issue of governing the country, obtained 
70 percent of the delegates' votes. In other words the 
majority, led by Cossutta, Magri, and Bertinotti, saw their 
manifesto win approval by a wide margin. However, the margin 
does not conceal the deep splits and the anxiety which this 
choice provoked. 
  The results of the vote to elect a new executive will not be 
known for a few more hours. It is already known, however, that 
Bertinotti will be the new party secretary. He replaces 
Garavini, who resigned six months ago. In the meantime Cossutta 
has been reelected to the post of party chairman. After four 
days of debate this congress for change is coming to an end. 
The Refoundation Party, which is more used to being in 
opposition, is looking at the new political set-up with a 
mixture of hope and regret.

<F P=106> [Report by Gianluca Luzi: "People's Party's Challenge; </F>
Martinazzoli Sets Course: Yes to Segni, No to Bossi"] 
  [Text] Rome -- "We want to be involved. We want to play a 
leading role, too, with our own style and standards, and a 
loyalty to our origins." The People's Party had been in 
existence for a couple of hours -- from 1610 [1510 GMT] on 18 
January 1994, to be precise, 75 years after don Sturzo's appeal 
"to free and strong men." Mino Martinazzoli, speaking softly, 
with head bowed, as though looking within himself, but without 
foregoing his recherche vocabulary, explained to the small group 
of guests -- the most prominent of whom were the speakers of the 
Senate and the lower house, Spadolini and Napolitano -- that the 
new PPI [Italian People's Party] is the sole heir to don Sturzo 
and De Gasperi and therefore to the DC [Christian Democratic 
Party], which no longer exists, as of yesterday afternoon. 
  Proud and stubborn to the point of standing alone at a time 
when those who remain alone are in danger of disappearing from 
the political map, Martinazzoli supported his challenge with an 
argument that it will be up to the voters to either approve or 
disapprove: "Our ideas," he said, "are still fresh and current." 
  Martinazzoli can see trouble on the political horizon. He 
described a scenario "laden more with cynicism than with 
civility, full of masks and disguises." A time when there is "a 
split between ordinary society, the parties, and the state, the 
consequent threat looms of a political vacuum, and of the decay 
of our moral unity." 
  In this grim scenario, Martinazzoli threw down a challenge. 
This, without concealing the fact that "we do not have many 
chances of being reborn; we have only one." The PPI presents 
itself as a center party, "in line with a lofty philosophy of 
moderation, which is anything but moderatism, neutrality, or a 
conservative spirit." This citing of "moderation" embodied all 
Martinazzoli's antipathy for politics understood as a contest 
between a right and a left. "We," the People's Party leader 
proclaimed, "reject the logic of blocs, the radicalization of 
the contest, or the short-cut method of the face-lift. Since we 
reject the idea of the closed party, we therefore deny that this 
rationale can be transferred now to a broader but equally rigid 
ideological juxtaposition or to an artificial contest between 
cartels labeled in accordance with some vacuous mannerism. We 
are seeking, rather, points of contact consistent with our own 
identity and proposals, within the context of the liberal and 
democratic tradition." 
  In fact, the meeting with [Pact for Italy leader] Mario 
Segni 
took place a while ago, and there will be no more before the 
elections -- no accord with the League, no understanding with 
Berlusconi, nor, still less, with the band of neocentrists who 
formed another party only a matter of hours earlier. The PPI 
will face the test of the elections supported only by its 
alliance with Segni, because what the League offered "was more 
of a death notice than an alliance." Martinazzoli met with 
[League ideologue] Maroni, because "I wanted to know what form 
this alliance would take in the electoral context. The answer 
was that in Lombardy the League would keep all the votes that 
they already have and would field their own candidates in every 
constituency. It was said -- with something of a smile, to tell 
the truth -- that the alliance would be on these terms: the 
League in the North and the DC in the South. That seemed to me 
like a death notice." Therefore "it is necessary to acknowledge 
the impossibility of a dialogue with the League. The offer of 
an alliance that it is making would be tantamount -- no more, no 
less -- to accepting the PPI's disappearance in the North, and 
that is unacceptable." 
  But Segni is about to meet with Maroni. Is the pact with 
Martinazzoli already facing some danger? The People's Party 
leader clarified one thing right away: "The rules that apply to 
us in our relations with the other political groupings also 
apply to the rationale behind our relations with Segni." This 
was an explicit warning: If Segni forges agreements with the 
League, the agreement with Martinazzoli will be broken. 
  Having closed the door to the right, is Martinazzoli 
perhaps thinking about opening negotiations with the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left], maybe after the elections, with 
a view to forming a government? He was very reserved on this 
subject. "It is clear," Martinazzoli replied, "that there is no 
possibility of an alliance with an interlocutor that is itself 
building another alliance. If I read the situation correctly, 
they are sending me messages via the newspaper headlines, while 
inviting the others to negotiations. That is a very different 
matter. In any case, I would have declined an invitation, 
because I do not believe that our role is to accede to one side 
or the other, as though we were some insignificant entity." But 
what will the PPI do after the elections? " We do not know what 
kind of parliament we will have after the elections. What we do 
afterward will depend on how much strength the voters grant us 
in a situation in which I no longer enjoy any consensus from 
before. We are contesting the elections for the first time, and 
we shall see what our dimensions and our strength prove to be. 
On that basis we will determine our political and parliamentary 
orientations." 
  The electoral verdict will say whether Martinazzoli has won 
or lost his gamble, and will also say how many votes 
[neocentrists] Casini and Mastella have taken away from him. 
For the present, there were only a few words for the newly 
departed neocentrists: "Farewells, which are themselves painful, 
do not need to be combined with rebukes and criticisms. This 
will be my attitude, which will also be a wait-and-see 
attitude." He will wait and see, but "if they have left because 
they do not want to do what we are doing, I would like to know 
how I could have them back immediately afterward." 
  Be that as it may, Martinazzoli will not contest the 
elections himself, because he has decided not to stand for 
reelection and will remain as People's Party leader "certainly 
not beyond the first congress." According to Martinazzoli, it 
is indeed "a contradiction in terms, in a parliamentary 
democracy, for a party secretary not to be a member of 
parliament." The congress will be held after the elections: 
"The imminence of the elections, which have implications for us 
regarding our very existence, does not permit us to hold a 
congress right away. We will do so immediately afterward." 
  The PPI is newly born. As De Mita left, he was asked if it 
was a good day for him, too. After a moment's thought, he 
replied: "Yes." Then, after a further pause, he smiled, and 
added: "I thought about it before saying so."

<F P=106> [Interview with neocentrist floor leader Francesco D'Onofrio </F>
by Federico Guiglia in Rome; date not given: "D'Onofrio: Under 
Martinazzoli's Banners, Occhetto's Hard Core"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The Parliament had been disbanded, the 
government's term had ended, the DC [Christian Democratic Party] 
no longer existed. Nevertheless, as the sun set on the First 
Republic, deputy Franceso D'Onofrio did not look like a ghost. 
Seated, or rather, slouching on a sofa in the Chamber of 
Deputies, he spent the day shaking hands with those who came to 
pay tribute, not only DC members. He has already been 
consecrated as the "bishop" of the split from the Italian 
People's Party [PPI]: for 24 hours now, D'Onofrio has been the 
floor leader of the Christian Democratic Center (so far 
comprising 23 former DC deputies). 
  [Guiglia] You have "split" from [PPI Secretary] 
Martinazzoli, 
but will you not make peace sooner or later, as good Christian 
Democrats? 
  [D'Onofrio] We will certainly remain united within the 
Catholic Church. In Italian political life, however, we will 
not be reunited, not at least with those who represent PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left] leader Occhetto's hard core 
within the People's Party. 
  [Guiglia] Was the rift caused by ideological motives or by 
electoral calculations? 
  [D'Onofrio] Fortunately, the current majority system cannot 
guarantee anybody a seat. Even the infamous proportional quota, 
which forms part of the mechanism and is coveted by several 
parliamentarians, is mere "guesswork." 
  [Guiglia] Within the moderate pole, [Pact for Italy leader 
Mario] Segni does not want a dialogue with the MSI [Italian 
Social Movement]. Do Christian Democrats agree? 
  [D'Onofrio] I am one of the few DC supporters who showed 
some 
interest in [MSI Secretary Gianfranco] Fini's evolution toward 
the center. If National Alliance's upcoming convention confirms 
what Fini has often told me -- namely, that a new right, capable 
of governing and with a European outlook, is rising from the 
ashes of the MSI -- then my position is very simple: The 
alliance of those who really want to constitute an alternative 
to the left cannot afford not to examine, very closely, the 
possibility of its platform converging with that of National 
Alliance. 
  [Guiglia] Can you also trust [League ideologue Gianfranco] 
Miglio, and his three Italies doctrine? 
  [D'Onofrio] As far as Miglio the academic is concerned, I am 
a minor colleague of his. As regards Miglio the politician, I 
never believed that he was one and the same thing as the League, 
nor that the League was the same thing as him. 
  [Guiglia] Does this also apply to Segni and his "Pact for 
Italy"? 
  [D'Onofrio] Mariotto [Segni] cannot expect to be umpire and 
center-field at the same time in this game. He must choose 
between being the leader of a government coalition whose 
identity is guaranteed and safeguarded by him, or, 
alternatively, he must limit himself to leading a platoon of 
deputies back into parliament. 
  [Guiglia] You are considered a Cossiga man. However, the 
former president tried to negotiate with Martinazzoli until the 
very last. Did Cossiga betray the "pickaxe policy"? 
  [D'Onofrio] The former head of state's mission to Brescia 
aimed simply to confirm whether the First Republic was indeed 
dead. 
  [Guiglia] Cossiga acting as Martinazzoli's coroner? 
  [D'Onofrio] I think that by meeting Martinazzoli, the 
chairman simply wished to have direct confirmation, namely, of 
the fact that he had been the first to read the signs correctly. 
Cossiga predicted that the end of the Cold War would lead to 
the disappearance of the DC and the PCI [Italian Communist 
Party]. He was dead on! 
  [Guiglia] However, did the "pickaxer" congratulate you on 
your split? 
  [D'Onofrio] Cossiga basically told us the following: "I do 
not regard you as deserters, because nobody was fighting the war 
any more." 
  [Guiglia] Martinazzoli, Segni, D'Onofrio -- will we end up 
with three DC's instead of one? 
  [D'Onofrio] The People's Party can no longer claim to be the 
sole heir to the democratic tradition. There are many heirs 
today, all of them legitimate. In addition, we have disproved 
those who did not wish to talk to the League on the grounds that 
an agreement on national unity was impossible. 
  [Guiglia] What is the basic difference between 
Martinazzoli's 
party and that of D'Onofrio, Casini, and Fumagalli Carulli? 
  [D'Onofrio] On one side, there are those who mistakenly 
believe that they can carry on happily on their own. On the 
other side, there are those who hope to bring Italy to make a 
choice between two alternative government alignments. The 
former want to go back to the past, we are looking forward to 
the future -- a future that could begin as early as spring. 
Martinazzoli's party is getting ready to rebake Occhetto's 
stale bread, the choice being between the bitter bread of 
communist Cossutta, and the tasteless bread of the "new" 
People's Party. 
  [Guiglia] You have been joined by Mastella, [former DC 
Secretary] De Mita's former spokesperson. What about renewal, 
then? 
  [D'Onofrio] Mastella was never a secretary nor held a post 
in 
the old establishment. Furthermore, today he risks losing his 
seat in parliament, as we all are. De Mita, on the contrary, is 
now forced to act as his own spokesperson. 
  [Guiglia] Will you answer "yes" or "no" to [Fininvest 
President] Berlusconi's appeal to moderates? 
  [D'Onofrio] I believe Berlusconi will enter into politics 
only if the anti-PDS alignment does not take shape. In such an 
event, he would do well to join in at full steam, thereby 
invigorating the whole spectrum constituting the alternative to 
Occhetto.

<F P=106> [Interview with Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary </F>
Achille Occhetto by Alberto Leiss in Rome; date not given: "And 
Now"] 
  [Text] Just back from Strasbourg, where he repeated his 
proposal to Martinazzoli for an possible accord between the 
progressive forces and the new People's Party (if he is really 
capable of opting for the left) on a joint election and 
government platform, and on the point of leaving for the 
Refounded Communist Party conference, Achille runs over the 
situation to date, on the eve of the election campaign that will 
be crucial to the history of the republic. He emphasizes the 
three new fundamental factors that have appeared recently on the 
scene, all of them, he adds, are goals "that we have worked 
toward and that we have all gone out to achieve." The first is 
the dissolution of parliament following the referendum and the 
new electoral system, and the beginning of the "new political 
and institutional phase in the life of our democracy, which is 
one of the fundamental aspects of the birth of the PDS," a "new 
phase in the reublic, with the arrival on the scene of new 
alliances and the end of the political parties that featured in 
the first republic." The second novelty is the "perfect timing" 
with which the progressive alliance appeared at the end of the 
legislature. Occhetto sees in this political event "the 
signature of the constituent phase that we have spoken about so 
often in the last few years, imagining that it would not have 
been possible to give an advance indication of the subjects that 
would have taken part." The third determining event is the end 
of the DC [Christian Democratic Party]. Another consequence of 
the fall of the Berlin Wall, and a confirmation of forecasts 
that the breakup of the old DC would have occurred. "The moment 
of truth for Catholic politicians," added Occhetto, "came closer 
and closer...." 
  [Leiss] Let us start from here. In response to your aperture 
toward Martinazzoli, the Catholic philosopher and member of the 
PPI [Italian People's Party] Rocco Buttiglione has accused the 
PDS of wanting to reconstruct the "associationistic system that 
created Tangentopoli [the kickback scandal]." How do you judge 
this response? 
  [Occhetto] I find it very curious. It comes from a certain 
confusion of ideas that I did not expect to see in a man whose 
ideas I have always valued. As well as his thesis on the need 
to create a bipolar system, with the church placing itself over 
and above the alternatives, thereby giving the Catholics freedom 
of choice between the progressives and the conservatives. I am 
continuing to move in this sense. I would therefore invite 
Buttiglione to reexamine his judgement more calmly and with 
knowledge of the facts. I do not see what associationism there 
is in asking, before the crisis of the grab-all DC party and its 
need to branch out into two elements -- one looking toward the 
right and the other that should be looking toward the left -- 
the People's party, or rather the Catholics who have been all 
involved in politics in the DC to date, to choose to govern with 
the right or the left. I do not see any associationism in a 
left-wing party leader hoping that Catholic forces will choose 
to govern in a transparent manner with the left. Instead 
associationism was represented by the existence of a party that 
consisted of center, right, and left, and that was associated in 
governing a country strongly occupied by satellite forces. 
  [Leiss] But are your not afraid that Segni will drag 
Martinazzoli into an accord with the [Northern] League? The 
meeting between the referendum leader [Segni] and Maroni of the 
League has already been set for Monday.... 
  [Occhetto] I have not given the People's Party a blank 
check. 
My reasoning is very much based on the fact that the People's 
party must reclaim itself -- not so much as far as votes are 
concerned -- but by really abandoning all the compromises with 
the old political order if it is to to govern with the 
progressives. I am not only referring to those who are under 
investigation, but to the moving forces of a phase of the 
republic, a direct expression of the occupation of the State and 
of associationism. Then what is needed is a distinct clarity 
regarding the alliances of the other side, not ambiguity. 
Instead I see the People's Party trying to save the "grab-all" 
aspect, to keep people like Mattarella and Rosy Bindi who are 
looking left together, and those who are making eyes at Segni, 
who in turn, is making eyes at Bossi and Berlusconi through a 
third party. This would end up disguising the same problem. 
That of a party that wants to contiue to keep its hands free. 
This would worry me if I were Buttiglione. 
  [Leiss] Well then, are you afraid that in the end, as 
Giorgio 
Galli says, after the elections the various fragments of the 
Catholic political world currently on the scene will reconstruct 
the moderate politics of the old DC? 
  [Occhetto] They can try to form a center to invite the left 
to an associationist solution. But we will oppose this and we 
will fight to win a majority for the progressives. 
  [Leiss] But why is it still difficult to expect Martinazzoli 
to make a statement before the elections, thereby revealing his 
right side and opening up a hemorrhage of votes that could be 
lethal for the PPI.... 
  [Occhetto] But then Martinazzoli would have to play the 
role of the force that is not forging alliances with anybody 
right to the end. From a moral point of view it would be an 
important decision but one that he could regret. I have 
appreciated and continue to appreciate his no to the League and 
to Berlusconi. But I also see the risk of unproductiveness as 
far as providing a response to the problems of the country is 
concerned. In an system that is no longer associationist and in 
which things are done openly before the citizens, if Catholic 
citizens consider being able to govern with the left a value, 
and perhaps a historical opportunity, then it is worth loosing 
the votes of the right. If, on the contrary, governing with the 
moderate is considered to be more important, then it is worth 
loosing the votes of the left. In a nutshell Martinazzoli must 
give Catholic voters a distinct and clear choice. 
  [Leiss] Martinazzoli must not take part in right-wing 
"orgies." But the leftists are also being criticized for having 
created a pole of forces that are very different. Does the 
distinction between an electoral accord and a government 
agreement under discussion at the "progressive table" clarify 
things or confuse them? 
  [Occhetto] In the current situation, with great extenuating 
circumstances over the choices of government for the country, 
and with a law that does not allow for a second turn and the 
"desistement" mechanism, it is very important for the citizens 
to know immediately that they have a valid tool to prevent the 
new and the old right-wingers from getting all the seats. And 
that a wide range of democratic and leftist forces that have not 
been compromised by scandals, that favor development, 
solidarity, and work, and that oppose the wild free-trade, have 
this objective. 
  [Leiss] And what about the government platform? 
  [Occhetto] we have formed a work group to formulate 
well-defined and detailed proposals. We feel it is our duty to 
undertake the responsibility of defining a clear-cut government 
platform for the democratic reconstruction of the country. I 
think this is what is expected from us, with the workers, 
businsessmen, and the manufacturing sector of the country. And 
for this very reason I have scheduled meetings at NATO 
headquarters, and with London investors over the coming weeks. 
Even Europe is waiting to see what kind of government platform 
the Italian progressives can draw up. 
  [Leiss] What driving ideas will be at the center of the 
programs? What will be the opposition to the free trade 
manifesto that the right-wingers, despite their divisions and 
confusion, are in substance already advancing? 
  [Occhetto] We intend to take in the proposals that have 
already come from the Social Christians, Democractic Alliance, 
and the Greens in this phase. The basic driving idea is that 
recovery and efficiency can be combined with solidarity, with a 
development that takes account of employment and environmental 
compatibility. I contest the fact that the other line-up has a 
government platform. It seems to me that they are promoting a 
free-trade propoganda only to discredit the PDS and the 
progressives. These are idealogical banners that no longer have 
any meaning. 
  [Leiss] Let us make an example and play a game. If Occhetto 
was prime minister, what proposals would he make to Agnelli and 
to the trade unions regarding the Fiat crisis? 
  [Occhetto] I would try to make the government favor 
solutions 
like those adopted by Volkswagen in Germany. Or by Olivetti in 
Italy. I would propose solidarity contracts. Not mobility lists 
[thoses workers who are available for other employment before 
final dismissal after 2 years] that fatally become the 
precursors of deindustrialization. A more courageous industrial 
policy is needed for Italy. It is precisely here that the 
difference of the progressive line-up lies. There must be a 
strategy for recovery that follows along the lines of what the 
Ciampi government has done. But by enrichening this with a new 
and original policy on work and employment. 
  [Leiss] Will the generalized reduction of working hours be a 
distinctive feature of the progressives program? 
  [Occhetto] Yes. But there will have to be two sides to this 
policy. The other will consist of innovative choices to create 
employment and development. This will be achieved through 
program accords and agreed-upon modifications to working hours. 
Without forgetting that such a strategy will have to be 
compatible in Europe. 
  [Leiss] The right-wingers are evoking a "Liberty Pole": Is 
Segni their strong point as a possible candidate for premier? 
How will the progressives react? 
  [Occhetto] Actually, the first real act of liberty was when 
Montanelli was fired using methods that I would call a little 
"Rumanian." What a "liberty pole!" As for premiers, if there 
were to be direct elections, I think we should first have a sort 
of "primary" election. And I would accept the result. But as I 
have often repeated, this law does not exist in Italy. In other 
European systems the leader of the majority coalition party that 
wins the elections is generally assigned this role. In our 
situation there is no sense in imitating a nonexistent electoral 
system. We must be careful not create contradictions. 
  [Leiss] Now there is talk of Ciampi no longer being the 
progressives' candidate, but the new president of the republic. 
You have said that he remains a "democratic reserve for the 
country..." 
  [Occhetto] I do not think anybody said this. Ciampi has 
placed himself above the sides even in this final and very 
delicate phase of transition. We appreciated this very much. 
But in the future, nothing would stop me from independently 
providing a list of the best names for a "democratic reserve" 
that is important for the country, if I were asked for advice 
concerning the composition of the government from the Head of 
State. 
  [Leiss] Regarding the Head of State. In Strasbourg you 
referred to an attack, a "plot" against Scalfaro. 
  [Occhetto] I confirm that an international band is focusing 
all its efforts against the Head of State because the president 
of the republic has always acted in a coherent and legitimate 
matter when facing the problem of Italy's transition. We cannot 
question Scalfaro's behavior just because of the questions put 
to him by a student, thereby exaggerating the accusations made 
by people like Broccoletti, who is at the center of the 
degeneration of our political life. 
  [Leiss] But judicial proceedings are underway. Are there 
exceptions? 
  [Occhetto] No we have always respected the investigations 
and 
verifications carried out by the courts. We have never made any 
exception, for nobody. Accepting unfounded scandals, that are 
generated to damage a decisive electoral campaign by resorting 
to "plague-spreader" methods as stated in Manozni's "Colonna 
Infame" is a different matter.

  [Text] Palermo, Italy, Jan 21 (AFP) -- A court here Friday 
[21 January] jailed 13 heroin traffickers, including a suspected 
mafia chief on the run, who was given 20 years, a judicial 
official said. 
  The smuggling ring sending heroin to the United States was 
allegedly headed by Pietro Aglieri, who was named by a mafia 
turncoat and is considered one of the new heads of organised 
crime in Sicily. 
  As well as receiving a 20-year sentence, Aglieri was fined 
150 million lire (90,000 dollars). 
  Salvatore Cancemi, a former mafioso who betrayed the ring, 
escaped with seven years and a 40 million lire fine. 
  In a separate hearing, the court imposed a 15-year sentence 
on American mafia boss John Gambino, which the official said was 
negotiated in New York in return for his collaboration. 
  Cancemi admitted running a heroin refinery at Caccamo, 40 
kilometres (25 miles) from Palermo, producing drugs which Toto 
Riina, a top mafia leader currently on trial, allegedly exported 
to the United States. 
  Francesco Marina Mannoia, another turncoat who alleged links 
between the mafia and former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, 
also worked in the refinery.

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva and Antonio Guterres 
[Socialist Party leader] were in Parliament, face to face, 
exchanging criticisms today. The topic of discussion was the 
European Union Treaty. Cavaco Silva called for everyone's 
commitment to the building of Europe. He also explained the 
government's strategy for the next few years. Guterres spoke 
after [the prime minister] to stress that Portugal is not taking 
advantage of the opportunities provided by the European 
Community. It was a heated debate in Sao Bento [Parliament 
seat], Tiago Rebelo reports. 
  [Begin recording] [Rebelo] After praising Parliament's 
commitment to European matters, Cavaco Silva went on to list the 
three main strategic objectives for the 90's. 
  [Cavaco] Firstly, the development of our economic and social 
structures with a view to reaching average European levels by 
the beginning of next century. Secondly, a greater presence of 
Portugal in the world through a strengthening of the heritage of 
our past, namely, the Atlantic ties and the special relation 
with Portuguese-speaking countries. Thirdly, a guarantee of 
security and peace within a framework of cooperation, of which 
NATO is an essential pillar, but which will be increasingly 
based on an effective European defense and security identity. 
  [Rebelo] Cavaco Silva's address fully supported the European 
Union, from the Economic and Monetary Union to the question of 
foreign policy. Antonio Guterres, taking on the role of 
opposition leader, did not waste any time in accusing the 
government of lacking a strategy for the defense of Portugal's 
interests in Europe. The secretary general of the Socialist 
Party quoted as an example of this, what he considered to be a 
permissive policy with regard to economic competition with 
Spain. As for economic policies, Cavaco Silva is a 
fundamentalist -- Guterres said in order to blame the head of 
government for the economic crisis. 
  [Guterres] It is necessary to find in Portugal a prime 
minister, who despite generous EC support, has led this country 
into recession, unemployment, and high interest rates -- he is 
here today in this room, it is not necessary to make prophetic 
assumptions about the future. 
  [Rebelo] The CDS [Social Democratic Center Party] demanded 
that the government clarify whether we are heading toward 
European federalism. The prime minister responded by saying 
that the CDS's worry did not make any sense, because that 
question did not apply to Europe and it will not do so for many, 
many years. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Finland and Russia have reached a preliminary 
agreement that the threshold for relaying information about 
nuclear accidents will be lowered. Finland will thus receive 
information from Russia about less serious accidents on the 
other side of the eastern border. In addition, the countries 
agreed this week that exchanges of information about nuclear 
plants will be increased. Within the next few weeks a Finnish 
group of experts will visit the Chelyabinsk nuclear waste 
reprocessing plant.

<F P=106> [Article by Trond Bo: "Increasing Russian Military Activity"] </F>
  [Text] The election in Russia could lead to a more unstable 
military situation with additional forces put into position, a 
Norwegian admiral feels. 
  The unstable situation in Russia and a reduction in advance 
stockpiling for allied air support were the central topics at 
the annual news conference at the Southern Norwegian Defense 
Command in Stavanger yesterday. 
  Vice Admiral Bjorner Kibsgaard, the commander in chief in 
southern Norway, said that the result of the Russian 
parliamentary election points toward a more unstable situation 
in Russia. He characterized statements made by certain new 
leaders after the election as blatant ambition. 
  Kibsgaard indicated that in the last two months there has 
been intense training activity on a Russian aircraft carrier 
Admiral Kusnetsov, but that it will take years for the ship to 
operate with the planned air strength of Flanker and 
Frogfoot--NATO terms for Russian aircraft. 
  "The Russian military is undergoing a hefty downsizing, but 
remains a modern and effective force despite extensive 
reductions," said Captain Christian Grundt, who is chief of 
intelligence and security at the Southern Norwegian Defense 
Command. 
  Since 1992, the standing forces in Russia have been cut to 
1.2 million soldiers, but a combat-ready, standing emergency 
force of 200,000 men is maintained. Training activity has 
increased in the last year, and there have been 150 sorties 
along the Norwegian coast as far south as Stavanger. The 
strategic submarine fleet with nuclear weapons onboard is on 
maneuvers just as before and moves continually with its nuclear 
cargo in the Barents Sea. There continues to be a capability 
ready for use whenever called upon. 
  Parallel with this plan, the NATO countries, with Norway 
leading, are planning joint exercises in the northern regions, 
in which Russia would participate. These would not be complex 
military exercises, but rescue exercises and training aimed at 
working together in a UN context. 
  The Russians have also adopted a new military doctrine, 
passed by the Russian security council on 9 November and 
approved by President Boris Yeltsin. 
  "What is new in the military doctrine is the fact that the 
Russians state they do not have any declared enemies and that 
their security goal is to prevent war," said Kibsgaard and 
stressed that the old political ideology was now gone. 
  Russia promises not to use force against other states unless 
their nation or other allied nations are targets of aggression. 
Nuclear weapons are to be regarded as deterrents, and Russia 
distances itself from first strike with nuclear weapons. Under 
certain circumstances, Russia retains the right to use nuclear 
weapons. 
  As to its relationship with neighboring countries and former 
Soviet republics, there is uncertainty with regard to the 
objectives of the Russian military in protecting Russian 
interests, which include those in foreign territories. 
<H5>  Political Leadership </H5>
  In answer to a question from AFTENPOSTEN as to whether the 
new military doctrine will lead to stronger political control 
over the military, Kibsgaard said: 
  "The military power apparatus has a lot of influence, but 
from what we have seen, the political authorities have control 
over the military." 
  With regard to the dramatic days in October, the commander 
in 
chief felt there was some uncertainty as to whether the Army 
remained loyal to Yeltsin because they supported him or because 
they saw their own purposes best served by quelling the 
uprisings. At present, the defense command is familiar only with 
the published version of the military doctrine. Kibsgaard felt 
that it was still too early to comment on possible changes in 
Russian military strategy.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Conservatives in the Wings"] </F>
  [Text] Professor Henry Valen is right, of course, when he 
calls the Storting election of 13 September an "anomaly" that 
broke the trend we have seen throughout the postwar period. It 
is clear that EC opponents from all the other parties, including 
the Socialist Left Party, flocked to the Center Party. However, 
it was a big surprise to many that election experts feel they 
can draw the conclusion that the record low voter turnout was 
caused primarily by EC opponents who decided to stay home. If 
that is true, it is a clear indication of the challenge that 
faces EC supporters. 
  The Labor Party has its problems to contend with, but the 
Conservatives have problems that are just as great. Among the 
nonvoters in the Conservative ranks, there were three times as 
many EC opponents as supporters. Even so, the election experts 
are overstating the case when they maintain that the Labor and 
Conservative roles as political opposites have been abolished. 
The fact that only a minority of voters regarded the 
Conservatives as a government alternative in this election does 
not necessarily mean that the traditional dividing line in 
Norwegian politics has become irrelevant for all time. It is not 
a foregone conclusion that the party patterns resulting from the 
EC struggle will be a permanent phenomenon. 
  Nonetheless, the Conservatives must be quite perplexed by 
the 
fact that the Labor Party received a sizable influx of EC 
supporters from both the Conservative and Progress parties in 
this year's election. For the many voters who regard a strong 
government as the best guarantee of stability, the Conservative 
Party was not an alternative. 
  The Labor Party for its part lost many EC opponents, mainly 
to the Center Party, but in return it acquired new voters from 
the ranks of those who support Norwegian membership in the 
European Union, the new name of the EC. Again underlining that 
the Conservatives are on the sidelines. EC supporters simply 
sought refuge in the Labor Party. At the same time, former 
Conservative voters who oppose EC membership voted for the 
Center Party--if they went to the polls at all. 
  It is no surprise that there are also many opponents among 
traditionally Conservative voters. However, it would be a 
complete mistake for the Conservative leadership to be deluded 
into believing that the election defeat was a consequence of the 
fact that there appeared to be more room for opponents in the 
Labor Party than in the Conservative Party. If the Conservatives 
had been able to make this year's meeting with the voters a 
government election, the EC opponents in the party's own ranks 
would also have voted the same way they did in 1989. 
  When it comes to our future relationship to the EC, the 
voters already knew where the Conservatives stood four years 
ago. The difference was that then the Conservatives emerged as 
the leaders of a nonsocialist coalition that was prepared to 
assume government responsibility. 
  When the nonsocialist coalition collapsed in November 1990 
and the Center Party paved the way for a new Social Democratic 
minority government, the Conservatives saw their big chance. But 
they never succeed in emerging on their own as a credible 
challenger in the fight for government power. 
  If the Conservatives remain standing in the wings without 
having any impact in the Storting, this year's "anomalous" 
Storting election could be the beginning of years of tedious 
effort. The Conservatives must now show that the party is able 
to find its bearings in a new reality.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis said this evening that 
with its joining Greece's defense space, Cyprus will be stronger 
than it is now as far as the negotiations go, and much stronger 
in regard to any Turkish expansionist designs. Speaking upon 
his return from Thessaloniki this evening, President Kliridhis 
noted that Turkey knows what has been said by Greek Governments, 
that any possible attempt at expansion into the free part of 
Cyprus is a reason for war, but he added that if it does not 
know that there are plans for implementation of this decision, 
it will not take us seriously. 
  President Kliridhis said that the practical steps for the 
unified defense space between Greece and Cyprus will be 
completed by the end of February and will be put before the two 
governments. He also said that a delegation from the Greek 
National Defense General Staff in Athens will come to Cyprus at 
the beginning of February for cooperation with the National 
Guard General Staff. Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos 
Arsenis will come to Cyprus around the middle of February for a 
further exchange of views. 
  Referring to an appraisal that the moment of truth for the 
Cyprus issue has arrived, President Kliridhis said that the 
moment of truth for the Cyprus issue has been close for a long 
time now, and that the truth is that [Turkish Cypriot Leader 
Rauf] Denktas has never responded positively to any proposal for 
a solution of the Cyprus issue. The president also said that 
the Greek Cypriot side agreed to discuss the UN secretary 
general's proposals in order to find ways to implement them. 
However, Kliridhis added, we do not accept Denktas' altering 
the proposals and will not discuss the Turkish Cypriot leader's 
altered proposals. Finally, the president noted that the 
National Council will be convened on 27 January.

  [Text] The contents of a letter President Rauf Denktas 
sent to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali informing him that the 
Turkish Cypriot side is ready to negotiate on the 
confidence-building measures have been revealed. The letter was 
given to the press yesterday but was embargoed until 1200 today. 
  In the letter, Denktas said that the Turkish Cypriot side is 
ready to cooperate with the UN secretary general in reaching an 
agreement on the confidence-building measures, which it accepts 
in principle. Denktas pointed out that in order to achieve this 
aim, he is ready to start negotiations with Greek Cypriot leader 
Kliridhis. We think it will be beneficial to hold the 
negotiations in Lefkosa [Nicosia], Denktas said. 
  The president told the UN secretary general that the 
government program which was approved by the Turkish Cypriot 
Republican Assembly anticipated that he, Denktas, be the 
negotiator, and that he has accepted this task. We are pleased, 
Denktas says, that the UN secretary general shares the 
understanding of the Turkish Cypriot side regarding the 
confidence-building measures. We have observed, he adds, that 
the various understandings and concepts which we meticulously 
emphasize are also included in the reports the secretary general 
submits to the Security Council. 
  President Denktas stressed that the measures to be 
implemented should not eliminate the limited means of the 
Turkish Cypriot side, that the arrangements to be made in 
connection with Maras [Varosha] and the Lefkosa [Nicosia] 
International Airport should help lift the embargoes against the 
Turkish Cypriots, and that sanctions should be imposed on the 
side that undermines the interests created by the implementation 
of the measures. 
  Denktas said in his letter that the fenced area of Maras 
which are to be given over to UN rule should be areas of contact 
and cooperation fitting the two communities' common interests. 
If the Turkish Cypriot side is prevented from benefiting from 
Lefkosa International Airport, Denktas said, then this region 
should be returned to Turkish Cypriot rule. 
  The president pointed out that one of the basic principles 
on 
which both sides agreed during the negotiating process was that 
a comprehensive solution should be sought by discussing the 
issue with all its aspects as a whole. It is obvious, Denktas 
said, that the approach to implement measures that will build 
confidence between the two sides will not change this basic 
principle. He added that the United Nations also admits that 
the confidence-building measures aim to reach a comprehensive 
solution easier. 
  Denktas said: I would like to stress that we have noted the 
guarantees in your reports saying that partial agreements will 
not be posited in the future, during our search for a 
comprehensive solution. 
  Denktas recalled that as cited in the 13th paragraph of the 
secretary general's report of 1 July 1993, the aim of the 
confidence-building measures is not to grant political 
advantages to the sides and that within that framework, the two 
sides will not be forced to make political concessions. Also, 
Denktas said, the two sides will not be forced to change their 
positions regarding each other's political status. The two 
sides reserve their positions regarding a comprehensive solution. 
  Denktas went on to say: On the other hand, I would like to 
stress that in our assessment of these measures, we took into 
consideration that one of the results of implementing the 
measures will be the elimination of the obstacles before the 
Turkish Cypriots in the commercial and economic fields, and in 
foreign travel. 
  Denktas stressed that he attaches great importance to the 
reassurances the UN secretary general made that the advantages 
to the two sides will be important, equal, fitting, and 
guaranteed in practical terms. 
  Denktas said: The Turkish Cypriot side's security 
considerations within the framework of the solution of the 
Cyprus problem is a vital issue that the United Nations takes 
into consideration as well. Whether in connection with measures 
that aim to increase mutual confidence, or within the framework 
of the search for a comprehensive solution, security is a 
priority issue for the Turkish Cypriot side. This security 
factor is as valid in connection with the confidence-building 
measures on which we now work. The importance we attach to this 
issue, particularly in connection with the Maras issue, was 
conveyed to the UN secretariat general in a list of questions we 
asked on 23 October 1993. Considering the history of the Cyprus 
problem, I am convinced that you will attach the necessary 
importance to this factor which is of vital importance to the 
Turkish Cypriots. 
  Denktas concluded his letter by saying that he would be 
pleased to confer with the secretary general by accepting the 
invitation he will extend to him at an appropriate time.

  [Text] President Denktas has said that the Turkish Cypriot 
side agreed to negotiate the issue of the Lefkosa [Nicosia] 
Airport and the opening of Maras [Varosha] -- part of the 
confidence-building measures -- based on the reports drawn up by 
the UN secretary general and the experts. 
  In a statement to the press today, Denktas pointed out that 
the confidence-building measures are being based on the premise 
that they will bring great economic advantages to the Turkish 
Cypriot side. The UN secretary general and the experts have 
confirmed this, Denktas said, adding: Our people will see. If 
that is so, then naturally the negotiations will be held in a 
comfortable atmosphere. 
  Denktas said that the reactions of the Greek Cypriot side 
must be well assessed. The principles of the Turkish Cypriot 
side are out in the open and we are not moving back, he said, 
adding: However, we are not going to shun negotiations to be 
held with goodwill. 
  Denktas recalled that in a speech in Thessaloniki, Greek 
Cypriot leader Kliridhis said he wants everything and every 
place and that he will not allow the Turkish Cypriot side any 
atvantage. On the other hand, Denktas stressed, we are being 
strongly reassured that the Turkish Cypriots can take their 
passports and fly from Lefkosa International Airport. 
  Denktas pointed out that another point on which the Turkish 
Cypriots are being strongly reassured is the fact that the Ercan 
[Tymbou] Airport control area and Ercan airspace will not be 
affected, and that Ercan will continue to function as it does 
today. The president said that planes registered in Turkey will 
be able to land and take off from Lefkosa Airport without 
intervention. He explained that this would mean an extensive 
relaxation of the embargo imposed on the Turkish Cypriot side. 
  Denktas went on to say that the entry into the Lefkosa 
International Airport will be from two separate gates, and that 
the gate from the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] 
will be solely in the hands of the TRNC authorities. He added: 
The FIR [Flight Information Region] line between us and Turkey 
which concerns our security will surely not be affected and will 
continue as it is today. 
  Denktas pointed out that the Greek Cypriot side said earlier 
that it would participate in the negotiations for tactical 
reasons only. It is necessary, he stressed, not to underestimate 
the difficulties, to remain cool, and to be patient. 
  Denktas said: It has been explained that the 
confidence-building measures were drawn up not in order to 
deceive the two sides, but to lead to new cooperation and to 
grant extensive economic advantages -- in the words of the UN 
secretary general -- to the Turkish Cypriot side which has been 
the subject of an embargo for years. At the end of the 
negotiations, we will see whether these promises were true or 
not, and we will ask our people for their opinion. 
  The president pointed out that the secretary general's 
special envoy Joe Clark will meet with him and Kliridhis on 
Monday, and that the shuttle diplomacy between the two sides 
might begin at the end of February. If positive results are 
achieved, Denktas said, it may be necessary to go to New York. 
  Replying to a question, the president said that he might be 
going to Turkey during the first week of February.

  [Text] Ankara, Jan. 24 (AA) -- President Suleyman Demirel 
said today that he and Israeli President Ezer Weizman were to 
discuss means to give an impetus to the two countries' relations. 
  Weizman arrived in Turkey earlier today for a four-day 
official visit, the highest-level visit by Israel to Turkey so 
far. 
  Speaking at the official welcoming ceremony at the 
presidential palace of Cankaya, President Demirel said that the 
visit of Weizman coincided with the emergence of hopes for peace 
in the Middle East and "we want this gate of peace to be opened 
thoroughly and our country will do whatever it can to this end." 
  Demirel said that the two countries had great opportunities 
to cooperate on trade, contracting services, tourism and 
technological exchange and that all levels of contacts will be 
held between Turkey and the Israeli delegation. 
  "Our relations with Israel continue uninterruptedly since 
1948. Recently these have been accelerated," Demirel said. 
  "Our efforts are aimed at laying the foundations of a Middle 
East which, all the energy and money spent for militarization 
will be spent for development," Demirel added. 
  On his part, Weizman said his country was doing more than it 
can for peace. 
  He recalled that his country was holding talks with 
Palestine 
for peace and "I hope that we begin talking for peace with 
Syria, with President al-Asad." 
  He recalled that his first visit abroad as president has 
been 
to Turkey and "I regard this visit also as a great step because 
of the changes taking place in our region." 
  He went on to say that both countries were desiring to 
establish a peaceful order in the region and "relations between 
Turkey and Israel could be a catalyst for peaceful relations in 
our region." 
  After the tete-a-tete meeting between Weizman and Demirel, 
delegations of the two countries began official talks.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over still of Interior Minister Nahit </F>
Mentese] 
  [Text] Interior Minister Nahit Mentese has announced that 
during operations conducted throughout the country from 1 to 23 
January, 197 terrorists were killed and 707 were captured. In a 
statement issued today, Mentese reported that of these 
terrorists, 176 were killed and 422 captured in the state of 
emergency region. Mentese said that during these operations, 
security forces seized 169 rifles, 63 pistols of various 
calibers, 268 bombs, and 7,224 rounds of ammunition. 
  Stressing that in no country in the world have terrorist 
organizations overpowered the state forces, Mentese remarked 
that in Turkey, too, terrorist organizations will be buried in 
the dark pages of history as a result of the determined and 
dedicated struggle waged by security forces. The interior 
minister said that the state is the counterpart of movements 
directed against the country's integrity and the principles of 
the republic, regardless of where these movements originate 
from. These movements will be stopped and the matter will be 
resolved with speed, Mentese added. He declared: We will 
overcome this nuisance of terrorism with the help of our great 
people and we will certainly bring about an atmosphere of 
tranquillity and security, which our people long for.

  [Text] Terrorists raided the Akyurek and Ormancik villages 
in Mardin's Savur District last night, killing a total of 20 
persons, mostly women and children. Seven persons were injured 
in the incident. Two of the terrorists who participated in the 
massacre were killed near Akyurek village. 
  According to information received by a TRT correspondent 
from 
the State of Emergency Region Governor's Office, a group of 
terrorists who raided Akyurek and Ormancik villages martyred 
four of the village guards who resisted them. The terrorized 
and frightened villagers gathered together, whereupon the 
terrorists hurled a hand grenade and a deadly gas bomb on them. 
Fifteen persons were killed immediately and a child died later 
in hospital. The injured persons were taken to Mardin State 
Hospital. 
  Extensive operations continue in the region to catch the 
terrorists. Unal Erkan, State of Emergency Region governor, 
left for the area of the incident this morning to hold contacts.

  [Text] National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan has said 
that to a great extent, Turkey will be saved from the curse of 
the separatist bandits by spring. This does not mean that 
terrorism will be completely eliminated, he said, but its arms, 
wings, legs, and spine will be broken. 
  Adressing a meeting organized by the Great Anatolia Group in 
Ankara today, Golhan said that the leaders of terrorist groups 
are usually not of Turkish origin. He explained that the 
separatist organization is being supported from inside and 
outside Turkey. The government is determined to fight terrorism 
and every support is being extended to the security forces 
regarding this issue, he said. 
  The minister pointed out that the efforts being made abroad 
to fight terrorism have also been successful. However, he said, 
certain neighboring countries are welcoming the terrorist 
organization kicked out by the West, but this will not benefit 
anyone. 
  On the postponement of discharges from the Army, the 
national 
defense minister said: 
  [Begin Golhan recording] Turkey is not in the position it 
was six months ago. Nor is it in the position it was one year 
ago; far from it. There is fire around Turkey. Turkey is 
surrounded by fire. Certain elections were held in some of the 
countries surrounding Turkey. New leaders were elected. You 
read their statements in the press. Today, Turkey is faced with 
danger, with a risk potential, more than it was yesterday. 
Turkey has decided to get rid of the curse of the PKK [Workers 
Party of Kurdistan]. What were we expected to do? Nothing? 
[end recording] 
  Golhan stressed that like all countries in the world, Turkey 
will overcome terrorism. He urged terrorists to surrender while 
there is still time.

<F P=106> [Unattributed "analysis": "The Military Debate: Escalation </F>
in Conflict Expected in the Near Future"] 
  [Text] Ankara -- Looking back at Turkey's agenda of the 
past weeks, any observer would spot only one phrase bobbing up 
and down: the military. 
  First there was an accusation against draft dodgers. Then 
talk of new measures. Next came television programs on how well 
the families of the martyred were treated by the state. And, 
surprise, surprise, Turkey had to welcome a decision to freeze 
all army discharges for at least three months. The latest 
chapter in the story seems to be a motion in Parliament 
demanding that some control be exerted over a tax-exempt army 
enterprise which has been spreading its influence after each and 
every coup. 
  These days, Ankara's agenda is full of a lot of rumors -- 
and 
warnings at that. 
  There is word of great people in great seats talking 
privately within the family. Telling tales of how for four 
decades they have served the country. Complaining of political 
vacuums which need to be filled. How much the country and 
nation is in need of them and how difficult it would be to leave 
their crucial positions at a time of massive crisis and when 
Turkey's risks and the threats to her position are on the 
increase. The warning is that such people may do much to stay 
put, and that any criticism of them could be taken as a reason 
for judgment "when the time comes." 
  This is a message. One which has been delivered and heard. 
  According to Gures, who heads a constitutional body whose 
existence is based solely on the sacrifices of the devoted tax 
payers, there are circles using the argument that "the army is 
not taboo," to undermine the armed forces. 
  According to Yekta Gungor Ozden, the chief judge of the 
Constitutional Court, "the army is not taboo." The obvious 
question is who would know better in Turkey, a country run by a 
constitution, than the head of the Constitutional Court? 
  Days after Gures' hard-hitting speeches on how dearly the 
army wanted to stay out of politics, how some circles were 
harping on about the fact that the army was not a taboo subject, 
and how there were plots against the command center of the armed 
forces, Turkey decided to freeze discharges of military 
personnel. Little could be said against such a decision, with 
so much talk around town. 
  Two weeks ago, the Mehmetcik Vakfi, a foundation to care for 
soldiers and their families broadcast a program in which it 
showed families of the martyred. All businessmen and 
individuals were invited to donate. After all, these children 
are indeed dying for their country. Those wounded deserve more 
care and better treatment. Those who have been martyred need 
their families to be cared for. And so on. 
  The program showed a youngish woman in a headband, 
explaining 
the good treatment she was getting. As a widow of martyred 
soldier, she was getting approximately 100 dollars every three 
months (about 35 dollars a month) as compensation. 
  On Dec. 20, under pressure from the Chief of Staff, the 
government faced the task of taking the "absolute decision" to 
extend military service. It froze the discharge of conscripts. 
Then the bureaucracy started to work. Orders were written and 
distributed. 
  All the time, not a single government official wanted to 
take 
the responsibility. All the time the ministers remained silent. 
No one wanted to take the burden of having to announce such a 
decision which would suddenly affect the life of about 540,000 
soldiers and their families. Some two to three million human 
beings. 
  Recently there have been reports that there is an increase 
in 
desertion from the army. The left-wing press especially, such 
as the daily AYDINLIK and the pro-Kurdish OZGUR GUNDEM, are 
playing the issue up. AYDINLIK is a newspaper which claims to 
be devoted to labor and human rights. OZGUR GUNDEM is known by 
all. The TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN], on the other hand, is a 
newspaper known for its objective and precise reporting. Thus, 
claims penned by AYDINLIK and OZGUR GUNDEM have been included in 
TDN reports as "claims." But, when questioned on the TDN, 
AYDINLIK and OZGUR GUNDEM reports on Tuesday, Chief of Staff 
spokesman Col. Dogu Silahcioglu makes a statement. "It means 
that the sources of bogus news have been activated as part of a 
concerted plan," he boldly says. 
  Turkey shall indeed see who has the real plan and who is 
truly caring for the country. Turkey shall see these very soon 
for those with their plans will not be able to wait too long. 
The storm is brewing. 
  On Wednesday, the TDN checked with the proper authorities on 
the conditions of those serving the Turkish Armed Forces. We 
wanted to know how the recent extension of military service is 
to affect their lives--what, for instance, the tens of thousands 
of soldiers whose service period have been extended will get in 
return. 
  And the results... 
  The monthly salary paid to a Turkish private--and this is 
for 
real--is still 37,000 Turkish Liras. In other words, a Turkish 
private gets approximately 2 dollars and a quarter every month 
for protecting his country, risking his life on an hourly basis. 
The monthly salary for a Turkish corporal is 57,000 liras and 
the salary for a sergeant is 75,000 liras. 
  A Three month extension per soldier costs Turkey only about 
111,000 liras in all. This excludes the accommodation and food 
which, naturally enough, are free. 
  For 111,000 liras in today's Turkey (three months wages for 
a 
soldier), one can make many choices. In the three months, one 
could make two taxi trips in the city (and short ones at that), 
or buy six packs of Marlboro cigarettes, or even get two bottles 
of Raki. 
  But, obviously soldiers neither need taxi trips, nor to 
smoke 
Marlboro or drink Raki. But with the 111,000 for three months, 
they can't buy a ticket for the Ankara-Istanbul bus. 
  On Jan. 3, 1961--only seven months after the 1960 military 
intervention--the Turkish Armed Forces created a new 
institution. Its name is OYAK, standing for Army Mutual 
Assistance Establishment (or fund). 
  OYAK was founded according to law number 205 and has 
flourished incredibly rapidly over the past three decades 
expanding more and more after each coup. 1971 was another 
turning point for OYAK as was 1980. 
  Today, OYAK employs a labor force of approximately 25,000 
and 
is listed among the largest 500 companies in Turkey. It is also 
a shareholder in eight major companies. 
  OYAK's current annual turnover is reported at 5 billion 
dollars or seventy-five trillion liras. It is active in the 
automotive sector, the cement industry, Turkey's petrochemical 
industry, the food sector, electronics, agricultural chemicals, 
service industries and banking. In the last days of 1993, OYAK, 
acting along with its smaller shareholding Turkish investors, 
bought a huge share of the Turk-Boston Bank. 
  Some claim that with this move, the Turkish Army is the 
second army in the world, after that of Guatemala, to own a 
bank. All the time, OYAK's aims were clearly cited in its 
articles of foundation, of which one is clearly important: "In 
order for members of the armed forces, who constitute a great 
mass, to be forced into mutual assistance and solidarity with 
the aim of guaranteeing a better future for themselves..." 
  Turkish commissioned officers and petty-officers are members 
of OYAK. But the non-commissioned officers, who every month pay 
OYAK contribution money, are not. They join the army, get a 
salary, pay their share, which is five percent of their whole 
salary, and are discharged. In return, they get none of the 
OYAK benefits enjoyed by their superiors. 
  Petty-officers, who also pay OYAK part of their salaries, 
number around 18,000 members of this fund-turned-enterprise. 
But there is not a single petty-officer in OYAK's management. 
Soldiers are not members of OYAK which has clearly become a 
substantial economic force in Turkey. 
  And, privates, who die every day for their country, only get 
two dollars and a quarter every month for their services. 
Talking to an ex-general who has had much say on post-coup 
developments last week, the TDN found him complaining bitterly. 
"In our time," he says, "people would see military service as a 
step towards manhood. Youngsters would be sent off as conscripts 
with parades and ceremonies." 
  "Now the situation is different." 
  One of the chief characteristics of OYAK is that its 
membership is made up of officers from the Turkish Armed Forces, 
and technically it is a mutual-assistance fund. Officers, 
whether they like it or not, pay 10 percent of their salaries to 
this institution. 
  But OYAK does not like to share. It does not share its 
income with the soldiers which are the mainstay of the Turkish 
armed forces. It does not share with the non-commissioned 
officers and it does not share with the "state" either. 
  The annual turnover of this "corporation," some 75 trillion 
liras in total, is tax-exempt. In other words, OYAK does not 
pay tax on its commercial activities. 
  There are strong laws and regulations which protect the 
interests and immunity of the armed forces in Turkey. Thus any 
criticism of this "taboo area," is regarded only as a deliberate 
plot to lower the morale of the armed forces. The Turkish armed 
forces, however, is made up of Turkish youngsters. Youngsters 
who are there not for the two dollars and a quarter they earn 
every month but for the honor of it. They are not there as 
"professionals," looking at the job as an opportunity to get a 
good salary and other benefits. Nor are they there to become 
shareholders in a great economic enterprise. They are there to 
serve their country. 
  Defending their rights is thus to defend the principle 
rights 
of the Turkish army. Because these people are human beings, 
with families to care for and jobs to keep. And these people 
are owed an explanation if they are to be asked to risk their 
lives for even longer periods. Some explanation must be given. 
  Once the decision on freezing military discharges was 
revealed, there arrived a "leak" of information to the Turkish 
press. A leak that, along with this order, all retirement and 
resignations from the armed forces had been frozen as well. 
Later, it was formally announced that this was not true. But 
the word was out and the denial had little meaning. For it was 
made public that something of that sort could happen. The 
Turkish public is thus prepared. 
  For instance, with the clashes in southeast Turkey 
intensifying, Ankara could decide to upgrade the legal dimension 
of the problem and adopt decisions for national mobilization, 
extending the Emergency Rule throughout Turkey and even 
declaring Martial Law or wartime conditions. 
  If and when this happens, then all "retirement and 
resignations" from the armed forces could be stopped "until a 
second order." Or indefinitely. 
  Thus, expectations for retirement in August of some high 
level commanders would also be shelved. 
  This would, in other words, be the result of an escalation 
in 
tension. And not if the tension is diffused. 
  And just some footnotes, again without comment: 
  1. Gen. Dogan Gures, the Chief of Staff commander, will hold 
his office up to the end of August. In fact in August this year 
there will be a major change in the top echelons of the Turkish 
military. 
  2. The government last year extended Gen. Dogan Gures's term 
of office for a whole year according to a decree issued with the 
authority of the cabinet. 
  3. The Constitutional Court, entrusted with the duty of 
making sure that everything works in harmony with the 1982 
constitution, abolished the authority by which Gures' term had 
been extended. 
  4. Because the necessary application with regard to Gures 
was 
not made on time, despite the court ruling that the 
reappointment was unconstitutional, the chief of staff remained 
in situ. 
  Turkey is on a head-on collision course with Kurdish 
separatists in the southeast and there is an immense buildup of 
troops and weaponry in the region these days. 
  Some 40,000 troops out of the current 160,000 in the region 
will not be discharged. Additional forces will be sent there 
and the manpower will increase dramatically. 
  A military official said this week that the reason for 
freezing military discharges was because troops could not be 
transferred to the region from other parts of the country and 
because a professionally trained force was needed. 
  Newspapers reported on Wednesday that in a recent clash with 
the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] in the remote province of 
Sirnak, two soldiers attached to the Turkish navy were killed. 
They were based in Izmir with the Naval Forces Command. 
  They were martyred in Sirnak. Again Sabah's Zulfu Livaneli 
reported the same day the plight of 700 teachers who were 
recruited by the army. 
  In November 1993, they were invited to join the army as 
privates but in the "teaching class," to aid educational 
schemes. Their service terms were two months only. Thus, 
leaving behind installment payments and in their own words, 
"houses in a sorry state," they joined. 
  They joined for two months and they have now been told that 
they are to serve for 15 months. But this was not all. They 
joined the army as teachers. 
  And all aged between 28 to 35 among the 700 were taken aside 
and told they were going to become commandos. 
  They are now to serve 15 months and serve as commando 
soldiers fighting in the southeast. This alone shows how 
desperate the situation has become and how many lives it is 
affecting. 
  The next stage is probably to be an escalation along with a 
freezing of all resignations and retirements for officers. But 
no one yet knows what will come after that...

  [Text] Turkey is in the middle of the route the drug 
traffickers use to transport their narcotic substances from 
Central Asia to Europe. The opium produced in Afghanistan, 
Pakistan, and Iran, which are known as the Golden Crescent 
countries, is transported through Turkey to Europe, either 
through highways or sea ports. 
  The production of narcotic substances significantly 
increased 
in the region after the Soviet Union collapsed. For example, 
the production of narcotic drugs increased by 10 times in 
Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the effort made to place the production 
of narcotic substances under control in Uzbekistan, 
Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan, which became independent republics 
after the Soviet Union disintegrated, has not been successful. 
Nearly three-quarters of the narcotic drugs used in West Europe 
come from the Golden Crescent countries and Central Asia. 
  The narcotic substances produced in the Golden Crescent 
countries and Central Asia are smuggled into Turkey in three 
ways. The first is the route from southern Afghanistan, which 
crosses through Iran and reaches Turkey. The drug traffickers 
also use the authority vacuum in northern Iraq as an opportunity 
to smuggle their narcotic substances into Turkey. The second 
route is the sea ports. Narcotic drugs are transported from the 
Golden Crescent countries to Karachi in Pakistan. They are then 
loaded on ships that carry them to the Mediterranean Sea through 
the Gulf of Aden, the Red Sea, and the Suez Canal. The vessel 
Lucky-S was placed under custody in the Mediterranean Sea for 
carrying narcotic drugs in 1993. The narcotic substances were 
loaded on the vessel in Karachi. Officials impounded 14 tonnes 
of narcotic drugs on the Lucky-S. 
  The vessel Kismetim-1 also picked up a cargo of narcotic 
drugs in Pakistan in 1993. The crew members reportedly sank 
that vessel to prevent the police from impounding its cargo. 
  The third route through Turkey is from the Caucasus, a 
region 
that has been troubled by internal unrest since the Soviet Union 
collapsed. Narcotic substances are transported from the Golden 
Crescent countries to the Caspian Sea through Turkmenistan. 
From there, they are transported to Azerbaijan and Georgia 
either in ships or in vehicles, which use the highways to the 
north of the Caspian Sea. The internal confusion in Azerbaijan 
and Georgia facilitates the activities of the drug traffickers 
in that region. The narcotic drugs, which are smuggled into 
Turkey in ships or TIR [Transit Highway International] trucks, 
are later transported to West Europe either in similar trucks, 
which cross through the Balkan countries, or in ships, which 
call at several ports in the Mediterranean Sea.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "GATT Director Meets European </F>
Commission"; as released by Brussels TEXTLINE database] 
  [Text] (EUROPE) -- GATT Director General Peter Sutherland 
on Monday [17 January] met the President of the European 
Commission Jacques Delors, the Commissioner for external 
commercial relations Sir Leon Brittan and Commissioner for 
Agriculture Rene Steichen. Two subjects were at the center of 
talks: The implementation and possibly improvement of the 15 
December agreement on the Uruguay Round; preparing the 
post-Uruguay Round. The Commission repeated the importance it 
attached to this last aspect, both for creating the new 
Multilateral Trade Organization and the negotiations to envisage 
later on "trade and competition" and "trade and the 
environment." As for implementing the 15 December agreements, 
the EC considers that improvements should still be made to the 
offers of certain third countries over market access, be it for 
textiles (Asian countries) or financial services (Japan), etc. 
In the field of agriculture, it is rather the Community which 
is under pressure: Certain third countries are calling for 
improvements in its offers. Thus, in the Sutherland-Steichen 
talks, there was special mention of: 
  (a) Chile's request to enlarge its export quota for apples 
to 
take account of the quantities it traditionally exports to the 
Community (114,000 tons instead of 98,000 tons), otherwise Chile 
may take the case before a GATT panel; 
  (b) Australia's request for an increase in its sheep meat 
quota, this country claiming to be badly treated compared to New 
Zealand; 
  (c) a problem for Canada regarding the timetable set for the 
presentation of improved offers (to 15 February); 
  (d) the rejection, notably by Guatemala, of the Community 
offer for an amicable settlement of the dispute on the EEC's new 
rules in the banana sector. The problem of the audiovisual 
sector was not explicitly discussed during Mr. Sutherland's 
talks in Brussels, however, it continues to be the source of 
controversy between the EC and the United States. Mr. Kantor's 
view is that the lack of a specific arrangement in the Uruguay 
Round means that current GATT rules apply, and the United States 
plans to attack EC policy (in particular limits on the broadcast 
of non-European programs under the TV without frontiers 
directive). The United States could respond to these 
restrictions, which it considers unlawful, with retaliation 
measures. In contrast, for Mr. Delors, the matter has been 
settled in that the parties can apply their own rules and the 
matter will not be reexamined. Sources close to Sir Leon 
Brittan limit their observations to saying that it would not be 
easy for the United States to prove injury as a result of the 
European policy before the GATT, since American audiovisual 
works account for 70-80 percent of the Community market.

<F P=106> [David Dodwell report: "GATT Condemns EU Over Bananas"] </F>
  [Text] A potentially embarrassing report criticising 
Europe's controversial banana import regime was released last 
night by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade after the 
collapse of negotiations intended to persuade Latin American 
complainants to withdraw their backing from the report. 
  Contents of the report are unlikely to be made public for 30 
days, but participants confirmed yesterday that the GATT report 
condemns the European Union's [EU] preferential trading 
arrangements with former colonies. 
  The five Latin American states which last year brought a 
formal complaint to the GATT over Europe's banana import regime 
-- Costa Rica, Colombia, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Guatemala -- 
have come under intense pressure from the EU to drop their 
complaint. Over the past four days, all but Guatemala appeared 
inclined to bow to EU pressure, which was linked to offers of 
improved quota access to Europe's protected banana market. 
  However, at the eleventh hour the Latin Americans backed 
away 
from compromise when it emerged it would lead to deep divisions 
among them. 
  Apart from Guatemala which accounts for a tiny 1.5 per cent 
of EU banana imports and has remained adamantly opposed to the 
EU proposals, it emerged yesterday that Costa Rica, which 
accounts for 20 per cent of EU imports, was also paralysed ahead 
of general elections on February 6. 
  One Latin American negotiator yesterday voiced regret that 
no 
compromise had been possible: "A solution is still necessary," 
he said. "If time conspired against agreement today, then we 
must still aim to find a solution in the month ahead." 
  It was unclear yesterday whether the EU would keep on the 
table an offer made in December to give Latin American suppliers 
improved quota access to its banana market. Letters written to 
Latin American ministers in recent days insisted that the offer 
would be withdrawn if compromise was not reached before the GATT 
panel report was released. 
  The deadline for releasing the report passed at the weekend. 
GATT officials agreed to delay for two days as the EU and Latin 
Americans sought compromise. 
  A hard-hitting first panel report on the EU banana import 
regime was released in July last year. This upheld Latin 
American complaints and ruled that the Lome convention of 
preferential trading arrangements between EU members and their 
former colonies could not be defended as a free trade agreement 
or a customs union. 
  Negotiators have insisted that a GATT ruling in favour of 
the 
Latin Americans would be embarrassing, but otherwise a pyrrhic 
victory, since the report is unlikely ever to be adopted. GATT's 
rules require that a dispute panel report is supported by all 
GATT contracting parties before adoption.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Transatlantic Meeting Allows for </F>
a General Exchange of Views"; as released by Brussels TEXTLINE 
database] 
  [Text] Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, accompanied 
by Foreign Affairs Minister Andre Quellet and the Minister for 
Fisheries and Oceans Mr. Brian Tobin, took part for the first 
time in one of the "EC-Canada Transatlantic meetings" provided 
for by the Euro-Canadian declaration of November 1990. For the 
Commission, there was President Delors, Mr. Van den Broek and 
Sir Leon Brittan. Mr. Tobin, moreover met European Commissioner 
for Fisheries Mr. Paleokrassas. The Transatlantic meeting 
allowed for an overview on: 

  -  the economic situation in the 
EC, Canada and at world level; 
  -  strengthening Euro-Canadian 
relations; 
  -  the prospects for NAFTA (North Atlantic Free Trade 
Association); 
  -  APEC's role (Forum for Asia/Pacific Economic 
Cooperation which held a meeting in Seattle, the United States, 
in November, without Europe having been invited). Mr. Delors 
said that the Community would like to have a "minor role" in 
these meetings, at least as observer: Mr. Chretien said that, 
given the traditional links between his country and Europe, it 
was up to Canada to transmit European concerns to the APEC 
countries; 
  -  the situation in Bosnia (Canadian troops are in 
Srebrenica), Russia and Ukraine (Canada has a large Ukraine 
minority). 
  At the specific meeting over fishing, the following subjects 
were raised: 
  (a) ratification of the new EC-Canada fisheries agreement. 
Both parties hope that the ratification will be over on both 
sides sometime this year; 
  (b) access for Community vessels to Canadian ports, as 
provided for in the new agreement (this access has been closed 
since 1987); 
  (c) the question (raised by Minister Tobin) of European 
vessels fishing off the Canadian coast under flags of 
convenience.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EU Parliament Wants Owen Replaced as </F>
Balkan Mediator"] 
  [Text] Strasbourg, 20 Jan (ANSA) -- The European Parliament 
passed a resolution here today asking that David Owen be 
replaced as the European Union's [EU] mediator for the crises in 
the Balkan region. The resolution was proposed by the 
center-right and Greens and was passed with 109 in favor, 90 
against and 13 abstentions. 
  The text of the resolution sharply criticised the "strategy 
and lack of success for the part of the United Nations and 
European Union negotiators, who constantly sought to divide 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on an ethnic basis, despite the fact that it 
was a member state of the United Nations". 
  The Socialist group, which holds the majority in the 
Strasbourg Assembly, voted against the resolution which also 
called for the re-opening of the Tuzla airport, in central 
Bosnia, and for an `active' intervention for the part of 
international forces to protect the `security zones' drawn up by 
the United Nations and to end the strangle-hold on Sarajevo. 
  According to the backers of today's resolution, United 
Nations peace-keeping forces (UNPROFOR) should be modified "into 
a force capable of making peace, given that it has failed in its 
effort to keep peace." 
  Owen yesterday voiced his pessimism over the latest EU-UN 
plan for Bosnia, remarking how now even the Muslins were using 
the peace talks as a tool to buy time and reconquer territory.

Azerbaijan"] 
  [Text] The European Union is deeply concerned at the fact 
that large-scale fighting has been going on again in the 
Nagorno-Karabakh region since mid-December. 
  It would request the opposing parties to display 
self-control 
and not inflict further suffering on a civilian population 
already sorely tried by the war. 
  It reaffirms its support for the principle of the 
territorial 
integrity of Azerbaijan and calls for a peaceful solution to the 
conflict. Given the danger of internationalization, which could 
aggravate the situation, it would urge the parties concerned to 
cease fighting and implement the relevant resolutions of the 
United Nations security council. 
  The European Union requests the opposing parties to resume 
current negotiations immediately under the aegis of the CSCE 
Minsk group and fully backs those negotiations.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Steichen Makes Positive Appraisal of </F>
Common Agricultural Policy Reform"; as released by Brussels 
TEXTLINE database] 
  [Text] On the occasion of the Gruene Woche [Green Week], 
the Berlin agricultural trade fair, European Commissioner Rene 
Steichen announced that oilseed producers in the new German 
Laender will soon be allowed another 150,000 hectares to solve 
their problem of overruns of areas allocated to the cultivation 
of colza. The Commissioner also announced that he would begin 
intensive study of the future of relations with the countries of 
Central and East Europe in the field of agriculture. He also 
presented the farmers with a "much better assessment and 
prospects than some of us had thought some months ago, even 
weeks ago." The implementation of the reform of the Common 
Agricultural Policy [CAP] allowed for the withdrawal of 4.7 
million hectares (more than the forecasts for this year), which 
largely contributed in maintaining cereal production at a level 
which "is not excessive," 165 million hectares. The set-aside 
regime will, moreover, become more attractive as premiums are 
increased, its applications widened and the administrative 
procedures simplified. Finally, the agreement on the Uruguay 
Round allows for protection to be increased and to enlarge the 
Community's market shares "in third solvent countries" while 
substantially lightening its budget thanks to the lifting of 
export refunds. But, to take full advantage, the agricultural 
sectors and the food industry will, in his opinion, have to try 
to "export less raw material and more processed products making 
sure that the labor used and added value remain here in Europe."

Clinton on relations between Europe and the United States, the 
Socialist leader in the European Parliament, Jean-Pierre Cot, 
welcomed the "important political message" of the speech. 
Concerning the opening of the Community market to products from 
East Europe, however, he stressed that this must be a gradual 
process as "we cannot afford to get into a major economic and 
social crisis by opening up completely our trade to East 
European countries just as the United States cannot afford to do 
so." Mr. Cot feels that Europe has already "done more than its 
share and the American side could do a bit more."

the statement made by Guy Coeme at noon on Friday [21 January] 
after the announcement that he is resigning as deputy prime 
minister, minister of communications and public enterprises. 
  "I have decided, as a free man, to resign my ministerial 
duties. 
  "I believed, wrongly, that a man who is innocent has nothing 
to fear. 
  "I believed, wrongly, that I could continue working in peace 
while defending myself. 
  "I am having to face harassment, which is growing by the 
day; 
political harassment, as this affair has now become political; 
and media harassment fueled by rumors, lies and slander. 
  "I am sickened. Now that this climate has been created, I 
find that I can no longer continue to discharge my ministerial 
duties in peace. 
  "I am quite clear in my mind. I do not want the government 
to suffer. I do not want my party to suffer and, more 
generally, I do not want the population to suffer because I am 
unable to work under normal conditions in the service of the 
people. Freed of these duties, I will be able to devote all my 
energies to defending myself and revealing the truth. My 
innocence will be proved. 
  "Before the special committee, I will attest that there has 
been no wrongdoing, no unjust acts, that I have nothing to 
reproach myself for. My conscience is clear. 
  "I thank all those who have supported me and who have 
treated 
me correctly. I thank the prime minister, Mr. Philippe Busquin, 
my party president. 
  "I also thank with all my heart all those who trust in me; I 
will continue to fight with them for the ideals we share. 
  "I will be back."

Backing for Zhirinovskiy"; as released by Brussels BELGA 
Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 20 Jan (BELGA) -- The Global Money 
Management trust (GMM)-- with its headquarters in Amsterdam and 
headed by Russian financial advisor Anton Nenakov -- asserted on 
Thursday [20 January] that it had never given a single ruble to 
support the campaign of Russia's leader of the far right, 
Alexander Zhirinovskiy. 
  At a Brussels press conference, Mr. Nenakov added that -- to 
the contrary -- he was a Yeltsin supporter and that information 
suggesting that he had funded the nationalist leader's campaign 
had been circulated in order to harm his company. 
  The Russian daily, SEVODNJA, reported in December last year 
that GMM had provided 800 million dollars (more than 28 million 
Belgian francs) to support Zhirinovskiy's campaign, adding that 
the company was operating without a license in Russia where it 
is involved in speculation. 
  Mr. Nenakov denied these claims, stating that the newspaper 
who accused him was in fact in the hands of one of his 
competitors and that they were seeking to harm his professional 
activities. 
  He indicated that he had instigated proceedings for 
defamation against SEVODNJA and that the journalist who wrote 
the article had already admitted that he had no document able to 
prove his claims. 
  As regards GMM's activities in Moscow -- where the Global 
Money Management trust has a subsidiary -- another company 
representative, financial adviser Mr. Liozner, stated that his 
company has met with no difficulties with the Russian central 
bank, even if it attracts private Russian capital for 
investments abroad. He pointed out that relations between GMM 
and the central bank had "normalized," apart from few purely 
"technical" difficulties mainly due to differences between 
Russian and Western banking legislation.

<F P=106> [Tim Kelsey report: "British Mercenaries for Azeri War"] </F>
  [Text] The Government has given tacit support to an 
illegal scheme to supply Azerbaijan with military backing in its 
war with Armenia, according to a British peer who has admitted 
his own involvement. The Foreign Office also agreed yesterday 
that it knew of the project. 
  THE INDEPENDENT has learnt that a group of British and 
Turkish businessmen are negotiating with the Azeri authorities 
for the supply of arms and a large number of mercenaries, mainly 
from Britain. The Foreign Office confirmed that there is a 
British arms embargo against Azerbaijan, which is fighting a 
vicious war with the neighbouring former Soviet republic of 
Armenia over disputed territories. It is illegal for a Briton 
to be a mercenary soldier. 
  Lord Erskine of Rerrick confirmed last week that 
negotiations 
had taken place between the Azeri authorities and a consortium 
for which he is acting as a consultant. The existence of the 
negotiations has been confirmed by a senior Turkish politician 
and by a British arms trader, who has extensive experience of 
dealing with the Caucasus region. 
  Lord Erskine said a British registered company, Summit 
(Consortium) Limited, is arranging the deal. The company, he 
said, was involved in trade with Azerbaijan and with negotiating 
the provision of military support. Lord Erskine said his role 
was to provide introductions as a consultant to senior Azeri 
government ministers. 
  Two men identified as directors are based in Turkish Cyprus, 
where it is not illegal to trade in arms to Azerbaijan. Lord 
Erskine named one of them, Mustafa Mutlu, as the man helping to 
coordinate the negotiations with Azerbaijan. He could not be 
traced last week. 
  Most of the negotiations are being conducted by a British 
businessman whom Lord Erskine declined to identify. In the past 
three months this man has made three trips to Azerbaijan to talk 
to the local authorities. 
  Lord Erskine said he is to be paid a consultancy fee for his 
work for Summit and that the deal runs into millions of pounds. 
Other sources -- one of whom is a Turk close to the Azeri 
authorities -- said that they were aware of the negotiations, 
and that the proposal is for the provision of soldiers and arms. 
The Azeris are said to be prepared to pay an annual fee of as 
much as 150 million pounds. 
  It is understood that the negotiations are still not 
complete, but privately chartered Russian aircraft have been put 
on standby to fly mercenaries into the area. The first phase of 
the scheme is to provide British military trainers. 
  The Azeris would pay the bills mainly in the form of oil. An 
American oil company is reported to have provided training for 
Azeri soldiers by former members of the U.S. armed forces in 
breach of American embargoes. The U.S. State Department is 
investigating the allegations, which were made by foreign 
diplomats based in Baku, the Azeri capital. 
  Lord Erskine was named last year by Michael Mates, when 
Northern Ireland minister responsible for security affairs, as a 
"member of the security services." The Government has denied 
that Lord Erskine has ever been a member of the security 
services but he said last week that he provided information, for 
which he was unpaid, to the Foreign Office. He told them last 
year, he said, of the plans to supply men and weapons to 
Azerbaijan during a meeting with a senior official at the 
Foreign Office. 
  Lord Erskine, 68, lives in Turkish northern Cyprus but is to 
return to the UK within a month. 
  His Foreign Office contact, whose identity is known to THE 
INDEPENDENT, is listed in the Diplomatic List as a first 
secretary. He confirmed last week that he spoke to Lord Erskine 
"at least once a year" and had been told of the plan to supply 
mercenaries to the Caucasus. He denied that he had been told 
that British companies were involved.

  [Excerpt] Hanover (DPA)--Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, 
chairman of the Free Democratic Party, has come out in favor of 
further close cooperation with Russia. At his party's national 
conference in Hanover today of representatives for the European 
elections, Kinkel said: "Russia remains a very important 
security partner in the East for us." 
  The more successful cooperation with Russia is, the quicker 
the prospect of NATO membership for the candidates among the 
Eastern reformist states can become a reality. It should be 
made clear to the reformist states, however, that no new rifts 
must be created, Kinkel stressed. Russia and Ukraine must not 
be excluded. "This would be the most stupid thing we could do." 
  The foreign minister went on to say that economic 
stabilization in the East is a basic precondition for lasting 
security in all of Europe. The response to the electoral 
success of old and new enemies of democracy in the East is the 
Partnership for Peace offered by NATO. This would also take the 
wind out of the sails of the right-wing nationalists in Russia 
for the time being. 
  Commenting on the European elections to be held on 12 June, 
Kinkel said these elections will be crucial because the process 
of European unification is important for Germans in particular. 
"We must use these elections to mobilize the citizens of 
Europe." Today, the national economies in Europe are so closely 
interlinked that growth, employment, and competitiveness can 
only be created by joint efforts. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) - A Somali was shot dead by Bundeswehr 
soldiers last night as he tried to enter the fuel depot at the 
Bundeswehr base in Beledweyne. The Defense Ministry said in 
Bonn today that the incident occurred at 0200 local time. The 
German soldiers first fired several warning shots, which the 
Somali and his accomplice did not heed. 
  The Defense Ministry said in its account of the incident 
that 
the Somalis were observed by German guards using nightvision 
equipment. The soldiers fired warning shots in the direction of 
the Somalis when they triggered an alarm. The ministry said one 
of the Somalis was hit. A doctor immediately called to the 
scene was only able to confirm the man was dead. 
  The Defense Ministry said according to information so far 
available, the conduct of the German guards was in accordance 
with the "rules for the use of weapons by the German support 
unit in Somalia." Colonel Holger Kammerhoff, the unit 
commander, suspended all humanitarian operations in Beledweyne 
following the incident. The freeze will remain in force until 
the incident has been clarified with the Somali authorities and 
UN representatives, it was said.

  [Excerpt] Hamburg (DPA)--German Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe has defended the Bundeswehr soldiers involved in the fatal 
shooting in Somalia. Ruehe told BILD newspaper (Saturday [22 
January] edition): "This is a tragic incident, but I cannot see 
that the German soldiers in Somalia acted incorrectly." With 
regard to the forthcoming German withdrawal from Somalia, Ruehe 
said: "I hope and wish that the good relations between our 
soldiers and the Somali population will continue." [passage

  [Text] [No dateline as received] Colonel Horst Kammerhoff, 
the commander of the German unit in Somalia, announced this 
evening that the humanitarian aid process in Somalia would be 
continued. In a telephone conversation with ZDF, the officer 
said that the Bundeswehr would build three new schools and a 
dike. He did not think that the good relations with the Somalis 
would worsen. Kammerhoff stressed that the local police chief 
and the chairman of the district council belonged to the same 
clan as the man killed. Both had inspected the scene of the 
incident with the commander and expressed their opinion that 
"anyone who intrudes here and intends to steal must reckon with 
being killed."

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The return to Germany of the 1,300 
Bundeswehr servicemen still in Somalia is to be accomplished by 
a combined air-sea operation for security reasons, German 
Defense Minister Volker Ruehe decided today, a ministry 
spokesman announced. The operation is to start at the beginning 
of February and -- just like the return of the Americans -- be 
completed at the end of March. 
  The Defense Ministry's plans currently envisage first of 
all, 
transporting German servicemen from the Somali capital of 
Mogadishu by German naval vessels, probably to Mombasa (Kenya). 
The return flight to Germany will then be from there. 
  According to the ministry, Ruehe intends to avoid the 
possible risks of transporting them by air in the Mogadishu 
area, and thus to aim for a higher degree of security for the 
servicemen. The plans were closely connected with the U.S. 
Government decision to transport its personnel initially by sea.

  [Excerpts] Berlin (DPA) -- In view of Defense Minister 
Volker Ruehe, the European continent still lacks the stability 
needed for it to grow closer together. Nevertheless, the NATO 
summit two weeks ago has set decisive signals with its 
Partnership for Peace initiative, Ruehe said at a security 
policy conference in Berlin on Monday [24 January]. [passage 
omitted] 
  Polish Deputy Defense Minister Jerzy Milewski demanded a 
"political shield" for his country against external threats. 
The agreed Partnership for Peace was "good for tomorrow, but 
not good enough for today." The existing threat was less of a 
military than of a political nature, and had arisen after the 
fall of the Berlin Wall and the disappearance of the old Soviet 
Union. Hence, Poland was also seeking less military than 
political support. Integrating his country into NATO would, in 
Milewski's view, not in any way be directed against Russia. 
With reference to Moscow's fears of encirclement, he said it 
was impossible to see how Moscow's security depended on Poland 
or Estonia. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The German Government has upgraded the 
status of the unofficial representation of the Palestine 
Liberation Organisation (PLO) in Bonn. This was confirmed today 
by the German Foreign Ministry. It said the `Palestinian 
Information Office' will be upgraded to the rank of `Palestinian 
Delegation General' [General-Delegation], following the visit to 
Bonn by PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat in December 1993. 
  'Abdullah Franji, the long-term PLO spokesman and the new 
delegate general, will be entitled in the future to raise the 
Palestinian flag in front of his office headquarters in the Bonn 
government district, but will not enjoy diplomatic immunity nor 
other privileges which are reserved for regular embassies. The 
`Delegation General' and its staff will, however, be included in 
the `List of Diplomatic Missions and Other Representations' 
issued by the Foreign Ministry. 
  For its part, the German Government intends to set up a 
German representation -- officially a German aid coordination 
office -- as Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel announced during 
'Arafat's visit.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has 
called on the Asian countries to give German companies easier 
access to their markets. The Federal Government expects 
conditions comparable to those existing for Asian products and 
businesses in Germany, the FDP [Free Democratic Party] chairman 
said today in opening a conference attended by 21 German 
ambassadors in Bonn. He promised "political support" for German 
companies, which want long-term involvement in Asia. The 
promotion of economic interests in the region has priority in 
Germany's Asian policy. 
  In Kinkel's view, Germany and Europe should have access to 
the growth markets of Asia in order to retain their 
competitiveness. "We are faced in our country with the challenge 
of achieving a necessary thrust for modernization through 
restructuring and innovation." More intensive contacts on a 
political level are also required, however. On the grounds of 
their economic strength, the major Asian states are in the 
process of asserting their right to have a say internationally . 
  Kinkel said the Bundeswehr would continue to be involved "in 
an appropriate manner" in international operations in the 
region, as in Cambodia most recently. Bonn would also comment 
in future on gross violations of human rights in the region. 
  The main points of future German Asian policy are to be set 
out at the three-day conference, which is also attended by 
German industry representatives.

  [Excerpts] Bonn (DPA) -- According to government spokesman 
Dieter Vogel, the government and the German Bundesbank are "in 
full agreement" in their assessment of the economic situation. 
After the severe recession in 1993, Bonn is expecting economic 
growth of 0.5 to 1 percent this year in western Germany and 6 to 
8 percent in eastern Germany, but there is still an unemployment 
figure for western Germany, which will be up to 450,000 higher. 
  Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer has said at the session 
of the economic cabinet of the federal government in Bonn on 
Friday [21 January] that the Bundesbank fully agreed with the 
outlines of the government's annual economic report, Vogel told 
the media. Tietmeyer said this applied, in particular, to 
avoiding forced interest rate reductions and to a policy of 
devaluation. 
  Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who chaired the session, stressed, 
according to Vogel, "the firm intention of the government to 
adhere to the cooperation between the government and the 
Bundesbank, as in the past." 
  Vogel said Economic Affairs Minister Guenther Rexrodt told 
the economic cabinet, which includes 10 of the 19 government 
ministers, that the starting point for economic development this 
year was "relatively favorable." This applied to both eastern 
and western Germany. In eastern Germany, however, there was 
still no self-sustaining upturn in sight. [passage omitted] 
  The government's main justification for its relatively 
optimistic assessment of the economy in the draft annual 
economic report is "better prospects for exports." The economic 
situation was improving in most parts of the world and slowly in 
Europe too. The economic revival was increasing investment 
activity. This fitted in with the type of goods German industry 
offers. For this reason, Bonn is expecting a rise in exports of 
3 to 4 percent in real terms in 1994, following a fall of 11.1 
percent last year. [passage omitted] 
  The government is expecting, at best, a small increase in 
investment in the company sector in western Germany and a rise 
of 12 to 14 percent in eastern Germany. This means a rise of 3 
to 4 percent in real terms for all of Germany. On the other 
hand, public investment would fall markedly because of the 
difficult budgetary situation. There was no indication of a 
rise in infrastructural investment in eastern Germany either, 
where it had risen so much in the last three years.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- The German Bundesbank has 
made any further relaxation in fiscal policy dependent on the 
behavior of wage negotiating partners and the public 
authorities. The more stability-oriented their attitude, "the 
more scope the Bundesbank has for interest rate reductions," 
Edgar Meister, member of the Bundesbank Directorate, said in 
Cologne today. He attributed a "decisive role" to the 
forthcoming wage negotiations in the public service sector and 
the metalworking industry. "It must be hoped that the wage 
negotiating partners will meet their special responsibility for 
the overall economy and won't send any wrong signals." 
  The Bundesbank Council decision last week to reduce the 
minimum reserve ratio for banks' sight deposits with the 
Bundesbank from 1 March, according to Meister, will bring the 
banking system additional net liquidity of nearly 18 billion 
German marks [DM]. "This is accompanied by a corresponding 
reduction in costs which should generally open up scope for a 
further reduction in bank interest rates," Meister said. 
  Meister again rejected all demands for the Bundesbank to 
pursue an accelerated policy of reducing interest rates to 
revive the economy. That is not its task. Moreover, the 
experience of many countries has shown that active use of 
monetary policy to stimulate the economy has led "in the end to 
higher inflation rates with by no means higher employment 
levels." Accelerated interest rate reductions will also "have a 
counterproductive effect" on the exchange rate and capital 
market interest rates. Last year, for example, about two-thirds 
of issues by public authorities were underwritten by foreign 
participants. 
  Meister described the cuts in expenditure adopted to 
consolidate public budgets as "the first important steps in the 
right direction." In the future, however, a greater 
concentration on "investment spending at the expense of 
consumption expenditure" is unavoidable and will continue to 
"require utmost efforts." With public debts at present standing 
at nearly DM2 trillion, the state's room for maneuver is already 
severely reduced. Interest payments are "now the second largest 
item after social welfare expenditure" in the federal budget. 
Meister said the demands on the national product must "be more 
modest in the foreseeable future." 
  Meister assessed current economic developments in cautiously 
optimistic terms. If oil prices continue to remain low and 
exchange rates do not have any pronounced inflationary impact, 
Meister believes that an inflation rate of around 2 percent "in 
individual months" of the current year is "quite realistic."

  [Text] Karlsruhe (DPA) -- The investigating judge of the 
Federal Court of Justice (BGH) has issued an arrest warrant for 
a 51-year-old businessman from the Munich area on suspicion of 
espionage activity. The Federal Prosecutor's Office announced 
in Karlsruhe today that the man, who is alleged to have spied 
for the former GDR for at least 11 years, has been in 
investigative custody since 14 January. 
  The accused is said to have supplied the former GDR Ministry 
of State Security (MfS) with computer hardware and software as 
well as files on military technology. The "betrayed extensive 
and valuable material" is said to have been handed over during 
at least 80 meetings on the highway to Berlin. 
  According to the Karlsruhe authority the accused was in 
regular secret service contact with the science and technology 
section of the MfS Main Administration from 1978 to November 
1989. The Federal Prosecutor's Office has commissioned the 
Federal Criminal Investigations Office (BKA) with the 
investigations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Francois de Rose by unidentified LE POINT </F>
correspondent; place and date not given: "The Clinton Project 
Threatens NATO"] 
  [Text] Francois de Rose, ambassador of France and former 
representative to NATO, is one of the best French experts on 
strategic issues. 
  LE POINT: How do you view the future Atlantic summit, which 
must define future relations between the Atlantic alliance and 
the countries of Central and East Europe? 
  Francois de Rose: President Clinton presented to the allies 
a 
project called Partnership for Peace. This project takes into 
account his compatriots' reservations vis-a-vis overseas 
obligations and their new demand for "zero dead wars" [preceding 
three words in English]. Thus the document seeks a formula that 
would allow the United States to remain present in Europe 
without the risk of becoming implicated in possible conflicts... 
However, it should also be viewed within the context of a 
priority in U.S. policy, that is, assistance to the 
consolidation of the regime in Russia, where more than 30,000 
nuclear weapons are stored. The complex ambition in this 
undertaking translates into a program that would like to 
associate Western allies, neutral nations, members of the former 
Warsaw Pact and successor states in the former USSR, including 
Asian countries, to this partnership. "It is thus difficult to 
understand what distinguishes this partnership" from the CSCE or 
from the Committee for North Atlantic Coordination (COCONA). 
Since the project additionally contemplates the eventual 
adherence of all the participants, and hence of Russia, to the 
alliance, how could one not see in it a threat to the Alliance 
itself? By being everyone's ally, one ends up being no one's 
ally. 
  LE POINT: And how about our Europe in there? 
  Francois de Rose: West Europeans naturally share 
Washington's 
interest in the consolidation of the changes under way in 
Russia. And they prove it by contributing 80 percent of the 
economic assistance provided. However, this does not mean that 
American and European priorities are necessarily similar. Ours 
is -- or should be -- that Central and East Europeans should be 
given the security assistance necessary for their course toward 
democracy and a market economy. When voices in Moscow are heard 
protesting the adherence -- even long-term -- of some of these 
countries to the alliance in the name of the so-called threat 
this would represent for Russia, one must see in it the survival 
of the worst impostures of the Soviet false language. Must we 
let this language obstruct the measures that we would deem to be 
in the interest of security in Europe? 
  Let us be frank: what these Central and East European 
countries are seeking in a close association with the Atlantic 
alliance is assurance against a possible return of the Soviet 
danger. While waiting for the WEU [Western European Union] to 
provide a steady foundation for its structures and forces, only 
NATO possesses the trump cards indispensable to make deterrence 
credible. 
  For the alliance to bring to East Europe this "plus" it 
alone 
holds, its members -- including the United States -- must 
entrust it, not only with peacekeeping missions, but with 
missions aimed at reestablishing peace. Bosnia, however, has 
taught us that Europeans have opposed air strikes against Serb 
artillery positions, and that the United States subordinates the 
dispatch of land forces to a stop in the fighting, which would 
mean that the problem is solved. 
  This summit should decide to create "groups of combined 
interarmy forces" used for peacekeeping operations. The question 
would then be to know whether their mobilization would depend on 
the UN, which allows the murder of its blue helmets to go 
unpunished, or on the CSCE, or on the alliance itself. Thus we 
could begin thinking of stationing such a group right away in 
Macedonia to maintain the peace in this very fragile area 
bordering on Kosovo. Because who can think that such a decision, 
already difficult enough within the Alliance, could be made by 
the UN or by the CSCE? 
  The cruel punishment for our hesitation is that Russia seems 
to hold more precise, but negative, views on NATO enlargement 
than the allies themselves. Nevertheless, if the alliance loses 
its credibility, the only direct influence remaining in Central 
and East Europe would be that of Russia and Germany. Ours, the 
French one, would only be part of the common foreign policy of 
the European Union. This should lead us to reflect on the place 
that we should hold in NATO leadership structure.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Relevant Decrees Published, </F>
Vote-Extention Decree in the Works"] 
  [Text] Rome, 18 Jan (ANSA) -- The 11th legislature 
officially came to an end today when the presidential decree 
dissolving parliament was published in the Official Gazette. At 
the same time, the relevant decrees were also published which 
set March 27th as the date for coming general elections and 
April 15th as the date for the first meeting of the new 
legislature. 
  Meanwhile, Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi conferred separately 
here Tuesday [18 January] morning, first with the Senate 
Speaker Giovanni Spadolini at Palazzo Giustiniani [residence of 
Senate speaker], and then with House Speaker Giorgio Napolitano 
at Montecitorio [parliament], on a decree extending voting into 
a second day, March 28th, so that Orthodox Jews could cast their 
ballots once the sun went down on their Passover holiday during 
which time they cannot participate in other than religious 
activity. 
  Coming out of the meeting, Spadolini said he had the 
impression that once the consensus was assured of the various 
parliamentary caucuses, the decree could be launched this very 
day. Spadolini said he would be contacting caucus leaders by 
telephone, noting that complete unanimity was not required. 
  In reply to a journalist's question, Spadolini noted that 
customarily the government did not present electoral decrees 
once parliament was dissolved and elections were called but that 
this exceptional procedure was resorted to, given the 
exceptional circumstances, although there was no constitutional 
veto on such a move. 
  A similar assessment was made by Napolitano who also 
proceeded to sound out causcus leaders in the Lower House.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "NATO: Ciampi and Andreatta on Air </F>
Strikes in Bosnia"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 11 Jan (ANSA) -- Italian Premier Carlo 
Azeglio Ciampi said here today at the conclusion of the NATO 
summit that decisions already taken by the United Nations 
Security Council open the doors to the possibility that allied 
military commanders might unleash eventual NATO air strikes 
against Bosnia while, however, keeping in constant contact with 
the UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  For his part, Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta 
said it was "unimaginable" that Butrus-Ghali would not authorize 
interventions which, basically, would be directed at the 
alleviation of the difficult situation in which UN ground forces 
find themselves in Bosnia. 
  Ciampi and Andreatta were speaking to journalists here in 
connection with that part of the summit's final statement which 
deals with Bosnia and, in particular, with the confirmed standby 
readiness of alliance members to launch air strikes to break the 
stranglehold on Sarajevo, to rotate out the Canadian blue 
helmets blocked at Srebrenica and to reopen the Tuzla airport to 
humanitarian airlifts. 
  Dire situations like those at Srebrenica and Tuzla are all 
too concrete and call out for United Nations forces to be put in 
a position to carry out their mandate, even if that means 
intervention by NATO planes, Ciampi said. However, any step in 
this direction must be carefully analyzed, taking into account 
all possible consequences, including reprisal action and the 
difficulties of pinpointing with certainty those responsible for 
the situations one wants to remedy, Andreatta added. 
  However, it is not with fighter bombers that the Bosnia 
problem will be solved, but by convincing the belligerents that 
a military solution to the conflict has already been tried and 
cannot be repeated, the Italian diplomatic chief continued. 
  "The illusion of a spring offensive" is today the worst 
enemy 
for chances of peace in the former Yugoslavia, he said. 
  The NATO summit ended here Tuesday without reaching 
agreement 
on new wording for a threatened air strike on Serb forces. The 
final communique only called on the UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] command in Bosnia to "urgently draw up plans to ensure 
the rotation of the UN forces at the Muslim enclave of 
Srebrenica and to examine how to reopen the airport at Tuzla," 
without referring to military action that NATO might undertake 
to achieve these goals. 
  The document reiterated last August's reference to air 
strikes that may be undertaken by NATO -- at the request of UN 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali -- to prevent the 
"strangulation" of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo and the other 
Muslim safe areas in the former Yugoslav republic. 
  United States President Bill Clinton expressed the view that 
today's declaration, while not making substantive changes to the 
August stance, "increased the possibility of the use of air 
strikes in Bosnia."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "NATO: Ciampi Has Talks With Clinton </F>
and Major"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 11 Jan (ANSA) -- Italian Premier Carlo 
Azeglio Ciampi today had separate bilateral talks here with 
United States President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister 
John Major on the sidelines of the NATO summit. 
  Speaking to newsmen prior to his departure for Rome, Ciampi 
said that in his conversation with Clinton, who will be going to 
Moscow in a few days, the focus was on the Group of Seven summit 
to be held this July in Naples where the world's leading 
industrial countries will discuss Western economic aid to Russia 
and the continuing dialogue with Moscow. 
  In this context, Ciampi confirmed that, in accordance with 
precedent, although Russia is not a part of the G-7 club, its 
head of state has been invited to the Naples gathering for a 
joint meeting with the summit participants. 
  Asked by a journalist if he expected to still be the Italian 
head of government in July, Ciampi said that the Naples summit 
would be organized by whoever was the premier at the time. He 
noted that it was he, as governor of the Bank of Italy, [who 
was] to organize the celebrations marking the institution's 
100th birthday, but that he had already left for the premier's 
office by the time the anniversary rolled around. Continuity 
was the watchword in such cases, he said. Institutions last 
longer than the people who keep them running. 
  As to the NATO summit which wound up this morning, Ciampi 
described it as having been "extremely positive." He said he 
would not go so far as to use the word "historic," as that would 
be up to historians to decide in some 30 or 40 years' time, but 
that it was important in that it confirmed that NATO was an 
instrument in evolution, and not tied to a particular moment 
which, once passed, relegated it to the dustbin. Other seasons 
lay before the alliance now that the era of the Cold War is over. 
  Furthermore, the summit of the sixteen alliance partners has 
confirmed Europe's growing weight within NATO, the American 
committment toward Europe and NATO's opening to the nations to 
the east, he underscored with satisfaction. 
  Particularly gratifying to Italy was the fact that the NATO 
partners outspokenly recognized for the first time, the ever 
growing importance of the Mediterranean region with regard to 
North-South relations, Ciampi said. 
  The Group of Seven could associate the Russia of Boris 
Yeltsin with its politicial decisions, while retaining the 
validity of the G-7-plus-one formula for the group's analysis of 
economic matters. The was the upshot of some of the thinking 
that Ciampi and Clinton did together today, according to 
diplomatic sources here. There was also talk of issuing 
additional special drawing rights to bolster Russian reforms, 
the sources said. 
  Italy currently holds the G-7 duty presidency and 
preparations for the July summit in Naples were brought up 
during the consultations which, besides Ciampi and Clinton, also 
included Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta and U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Both sides were found to 
be deeply in sync on strategic matters. 
  Ciampi and Clinton reconfirmed the political value of the 
current G-7 format which, since 1991, includes talks with the 
top Kremlin leader right after the final summit session, but 
they now envisage the possibility of opening up the political 
discussions to include Russia. 
  As if to underscore the cordiality of the American-Italian 
encounter today, it was noted that Clinton will report back to 
Ciampi telephonically as soon as he has concluded his trips to 
Prague, Kiev, Moscow, Minsk and Geneva. The call will be placed 
on January 17 and the briefing will also serve to prepare for 
the G-7 summit this summer, the sources said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "NATO: Andreatta on Greater </F>
Commitment to the Mediterranean"] 
  [Text] Rome, 19 Jan (ANSA) -- The possibility of a greater 
NATO commitment towards the Mediterranean, including forms of 
cooperation with countries in the region, was analyzed here 
today by Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta during a meeting 
with students of the Gorizia Institute for International and 
Diplomatic Sciences. 
  At the recent NATO summit, it was agreed that the Alliance 
presence in Europe should be bolstered and, in this context, the 
partners discussed the possibility that the Western European 
Union [WEU] might conduct military operations, using NATO 
logistical support, he continued. This could provide an element 
of flexibility whereby the Europeans could resort to the use of 
force in a particular situation, without automatically involving 
the United States, he explained. 
  The minister went on to discuss the possibility of 
projecting 
the Alliance farther into the Mediterranean both in terms of a 
formal extension of the partnership to other nations in the 
region, and in terms of cooperation between the WEU and friendly 
nations such as Egypt or Morocco, always within the NATO 
framework. 
  At present, this would be a dangerous hypothesis, but if the 
Mideast peace process goes forward it could be seen as a 
possible development, Andreatta said. 
  Moving on to matters of development cooperation, Andreatta 
said that the fundamental problem was the study of technologies 
more suitable to nations of the south and to their transfer.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Somalia/Italy: Maximum Security for </F>
Italian Withdrawal"] 
  [Text] Rome, 12 Jan (ANSA) -- Plans for guaranteeing "the 
maximum framework of security" for the withdrawal of Italian 
forces from Somalia were outlined today for the Senate Defense 
Committee by Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri who confirmed that 
the pull-out of some 2,500 troops with the United Nations 
peacekeeping operation (UNOSOM) will be completed by March 31. 
  Following a meeting yesterday of the Defense Chiefs of Staff 
and other military authorities, Fabbri reported that the first 
substantial contingent to return home will be about 600 men 
making the trip before the end of this month. He explained that 
the general plan is for the "redeployment of the contingent in 
the Belet Uen area, in the north of Somalia, towards the main 
base at Balad and then, towards the Mogadishu port and airport." 
  All phases of the gradual repatriation of the Italians, said 
the minister, have been "agreed to with the UNOSOM command and 
the commands of the U.S. and German contingents" and the plan 
"provides for the replacement of the Italian troops with the 
troops of other nations." 
  On maximum security, Fabbri said that though no large scale 
military operations against the departing Italians were 
expected, "the risks of possible displays of hostility from 
local elements, especially in the phases when our forces are 
most vulnerable, cannot be ignored." Thus, "information 
activities managed by national sources, making use of the 
cooperation of competent agencies in the United States and 
within the United Nations," will be drawn on, he said and 
reported that among the first to return to Italy will be 
logistics units, leaving to last tank divisions, armored units 
and the helicopters, "the most effective components for defense 
purposes." 
  The minister cited as "of special significance" for security 
the decision to deploy a naval unit with helicopter, medical and 
logistics support off the coast of Mogadishu as of March 1 for 
"the most critical phase of the withdrawal process." 
  Another step in this area of planning will be the arrival of 
Italian Air Force planes to the Nairobi airport, just across the 
border from Somalia, and alert status for "some aircraft in 
Italy for possible emergency interventions." 
  Fabbri told the committee that the ship off the Somali coast 
"will give our command and their units a high degree of 
operating autonomy by allowing the departure of men aboard 
landing craft from areas outside the Mogadishu port or airport, 
which could be tied up." 
  Concluding his remarks to the committee, the minister noted 
that the "reconciliation process among the Somali factions has 
not yet taken the path likely to lead quickly to agreement" and 
underscored the need for further political and diplomatic 
efforts in this area. 
  On December 29, the cabinet confirmed the withdrawal of 
combat troops from Somalia and Mozambique and the defense 
minister said the pull-out from Mozambique should be completed 
by April 30, the same date set by the UN for the end of its 
mission there. There are some 2,500 Italian troops in Somalia 
and about 1,200 in Mozambique. The former operation began for 
Italy on December 11, 1992. Five Italian soldiers have been 
killed in Somalia and two in Mozambique. 
  Other Italian forces are taking part in UN missions in 
Albania, Cambodia, Pakistan, Kuwait, El Salvador, Slovenia, 
Morocco and Egypt, Fabbri said at the time.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italy's Andreatta Not Optimistic on </F>
New Peace Plan"] 
  [Text] Rome, 19 Jan (ANSA) -- Italian Foreign Minister 
Beniamino Andreatta is not very optimistic on the possibility 
that opposing forces in Bosnia will accept the latest peace 
proposals put forward by the European Union. "The reactions of 
Muslims, Croats and Serbs have left little room for optimism" 
Italy's diplomatic chief said here during a debate on the 
ex-Yugoslavia, adding how they seem more "prone to military 
confrontations" than accepting the European plan for 
three-republic confederation. 
  The Muslims, he added, appear to have now also adopted the 
negotiations as a tool to buy time to re-conquer lost territory, 
and gaining influence among them were "external" forces and 
local "fundamentalist tendencies." 
  Also taking part in the debate, organized by the Rome 
vicariate, was Cardinal Roger Etchegaray who underscored how a 
peace based on land swapping could not be a long lasting one. 
  In Geneva, the self-proclaimed Serb and Croat republics in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina announced how they had hammered out an 
agreement to "sign a long-lasting peace" and establish "official 
relations...in the interest of promoting economic and political 
ties" adding how "no bilateral problems exist which cannot be 
resolved through peace means." 
  The official negotiations in Geneva on Bosnia, mediated by 
the European Union and the United Nations, were postponed today 
until February 10, with the European Union's chief mediator, 
David Owen, underscoring how "the situation is very dangerous 
and serious" and that negotiation must continue.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia: Defense Minister Confirms </F>
Italian Commitment"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome, Gioia del Colle, Italy, 20 Jan (ANSA) -- 
Italy "is prepared to set up a logistics base and the point of 
departure for possible operations" in Bosnia, said Defense 
Minister Fabio Fabbri at an Italian Air Force base here where 
British Royal Air Force planes flying missions over 
ex-Yugoslavia are based. 
  The minister stressed that as regards air strikes under 
discussion in United Nations and NATO quarters, "to avoid the 
strangulation of Sarajevo" and guarantee the safety of 
humanitarian convoys, "all the decisions are up to the United 
Nations and, at the level of operations, NATO. As a NATO 
member, we are ready to go along with these decisions." 
  Speaking to reporters at the home of the 36th Air Force Wing 
in the southern Puglia region, Fabbri said: "The duty which 
would be up to Italy appears evident and natural." 
  Striking a balance of the past year of the Italian armed 
forces' involvement in humanitarian operations, including those 
in ex-Yugoslavia, the minister said: "We have always acted in 
support of all international operations, because we are now the 
international community's base camp. Without our help, no 
humanitarian relief would have been developed." 
  With reference to the blockade applied in the Adriatic, 
Fabbri spoke of Italy's "leadership" role and said the balance 
of the armed forces' activities has been "extremely positive," 
that the military "has never before, in the post-war period, 
been so esteemed and respected as today." All this derives from 
the "extraordinary commitment" of the Italian military, he said, 
and went on to cite humanitarian missions in Albania, operations 
under way in Mozambique with the UN peacekeeping force and the 
Italian presence in Somalia. On Mozambique, he declared: "Our 
units are the reference point for everyone and everyone is 
asking us to stay on." 
  In Mogadishu, "our armed forces have allowed political 
authority to develop with success and there was, for the first 
time, an initiative within the international community which 
concluded with recognition that Italy's humanitarian line was 
the right one, the one due, and the one which conforms most to 
the interests of the international community." 
  On the domestic front, the minister spoke of the 
"extraordinary success" of operation Sicilian Vespers, the 
deployment of Italian Army troops in Sicily in 1992 to flank the 
Carabinieri and National Police following Mafia bombings in 
which two magistrates, the wife of one, and eight police agents 
in their escorts were killed. 
  For upcoming international missions, Fabbri named the 
deployment of the first Garibaldi Brigade, which would be made 
up entirely of professional soldiers. [passage omitted]

(NCC) were responsible for the two-kilogram bomb which exploded 
outside the NATO Command Defense College offices in Rome shortly 
after midnight Sunday [9 January] evening. 
  The caller said other sites had been targeted in various 
Italian cities, including the La Brera railway car plant in 
Pozzuoli, some ten kilometers outside Naples. 
  Police were investigating the credibility of the claim that 
the NCC was responsible, a group which has boasted of other 
attacks in the past.

<F P=106> [Article by Silvano Costanzo: "Borrelli Says Elections Will </F>
Not Stop the `Clean Hands' Operation"] 
  [Text]--Rome The chief district attorney of Milan 
says companies are cooperating because they have no more money 
for bribes. 
  "Candidates must certify their honesty." 
  "The truth is that there was no more money. And that is why 
the Clean Hands investigation could uncover the Bribe City 
scandals." Francesco Saverio Borrelli, chief district attorney 
of Milan, is speaking. He is speaking about "how everything 
started." That is, about one of the crucial points in the 
judicial affair that is changing the face of the country. But he 
is also speaking about the future, about possible solutions. And 
he issued a warning to politicians who intend to confront the 
new elections as protagonists: "If you have any skeletons in 
your closet, hurry up and take them out. Or we will get them out 
for you." 
  Francesco Saverio Borrelli is speaking. He does it by giving 
a long interview to the Viennese daily DER STANDARD. And by 
appearing before the microphone of Paolo Garimberti, head of 
Television News Channel 2. 
  Borrelli explained to the Austrian daily why his prosecuting 
attorney's office had "better luck," with respect to others, in 
the investigations into bribes. 
  The chief district attorney said "As long as there was 
plenty 
of money, the deals could be paid. But when the profit margins 
narrowed and the individual company's struggle for survival 
became more severe, the burden became unbearable. And that is 
just how it happened. But there was another important reason: 
The prospect of the European Single Market and the need to stand 
up to competition with foreign companies convinced Italian 
business men that the system imposed by politics (a hidden 
system and parallel to that of the state) could not and should 
not be maintained. Business men thus helped bring about its 
collapse." 
  Instead, at Paolo Garimberti's microphone for Television 
News 
Channel 2 yesterday evening, Borrelli even spoke of the future. 
He said, "Our work will not slow down in connection with the 
forthcoming political deadlines." In brief, there will be no 
electoral-type slowing down. On the contrary. "Personalities 
stepping into the political limelight are the first to know 
whether there are episodes in their past that might compromise 
their image. We shall not stop our investigations even during 
the elections. Therefore, I advise these persons to provide a 
certain self-certification concerning the transparency of their 
past to the political forces that are backing them." 
  About the Cusani trial, Borelli denied the existence of an 
"oligarchy" at the summit of Bribe City. "There is no cupola, in 
the Mafia sense of the term. Instead, there is a progressive 
slipping and decline in political morals and ethics. Not only 
concerning the leading class but, I should say, on the part of 
the Italian population in general." 
  Borrelli did not express optimism about the timing and the 
possible closing of this dark page of the First Republic. "A 
submerged and potentially limitless universe has been discovered 
over these two years. I do not know whether the new Parliament 
intends to put a political type of end to the matter. Nor do I 
know whether Italians would be pleased with such a choice. What 
I do hope is that all the trials will be held. The 
investigations could meet with obstacles only if the political 
situation regressed to the levels of two years ago. And perhaps 
one would not stop even in such a case. But, in my opinion, the 
danger is something different; namely, that a future parliament, 
stronger and sounder thanks to the uninominal system, might give 
in to the temptation to reduce judicial power." 
  And then there could no longer be any revelations of 
possible 
new Bribe Cities.

<F P=106> [Article signed D.V.: "Dehaene's Post-Agusta Projects"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Is the prime minister a follower of the 
autosuggestion method? In presenting the government's future 
projects during a BRT [Dutch-language Belgian Radio and 
Television] radio program on Monday 24 January, was Jean-Luc 
Dehaene seeking to drive out the demons -- no doubt of every 
shape and size -- which lurk on the fringes of the "affair": 
further risks of discrediting our politicians, the prospect of 
future conflict relating to the same old community refrains, the 
promise of heated debates on the subject of the division of the 
social security system and, in short, of the State itself? 
  Anxious to reduce the temperature, the prime minister wants 
to turn the page as soon as possible on this painful episode 
which has struck at some of the very bases of democracy which 
has found itself caught between the judiciary and politics. 
Jean-Luc Dehaene has opened up the future of his team to the 
third of the government's three main priorities: after the 
institutional and budgetary priorities, completion of State 
reform and achievement of the government's global plan without 
a social pact, there is now the famous contract promised to the 
citizen in favor of a society of greater solidarity. 
  But is this no more than a means of shifting the public's 
attention away from this annoying "Agusta" affair? Jean-Luc 
Dehaene seems serious when he speaks of the need to get to grips 
with the ultimate priority of a reconstituted government. He 
points out that the party presidents have confirmed their 
determination to implement the governmental agreement and to 
continue their cooperation until the end of the present 
parliament: "It is the only way to achieve results with respect 
to the three priorities of the governmental agreement" says 
Jean-Luc Dehaene. 
  Conceding that following the institutional reforms and 
budgetary affairs, the government's next priority of a society 
of solidarity -- or what is referred to by some as the "contract 
with the citizen" -- had remained rather in the background, the 
prime minister adds that: "This is not to say that nothing has 
been done in this area." By way of example, he cites the 
modernization of the administration, the depoliticization of 
appointments, the appointment of an ombudsman, a better 
functioning of the legal system, security contracts, etc.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan. 19 (CNA) -- Taiwan and Belgium have 
decided to form a "quarantine task force" to facilitate 
bilateral agricultural trade, the Taipei Economic and Cultural 
Office in Brussels announced Wednesday [19 January]. 
  Problems involving inspection and quarantine practices have 
stood in the way of farm trade between Taiwan and Belgium, a 
spokesman for the office pointed out, adding Belgian traders 
have been longing to sell fresh flowers to Taiwan. 
  The quarantine task force will be composed of officials from 
Belgium's Ministry of Agriculture and Taiwan's Council of 
Agriculture, the spokesman said. 
  Meanwhile, he noted, the first meeting of the task force 
will 
be held in Taipei in April or May.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan. 19 (CNA) -- The Belgian Government's 
decision to further simplify visa procedures for Taiwan 
businessmen and tourists will certainly help boost ties between 
the two countries, a spokesman for the Taipei Economic and 
Cultural Office in Brussels said Wednesday [19 January]. 
  Belgium's Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a notice to all 
its consular offices on January 10 announcing new visa measures 
for Taiwan visitors, the spokesman noted. 
  Under the new measures, Taiwan tourists or businessmen will 
be issued visas at the Belgian Trade Association in Taipei. 
  And when applying for a Belgian visa in a third country, 
Taiwan visitors who were granted a visa in the previous two 
years will be processed without the need for approval by 
Belgium's Foreign Ministry. 
  Earlier, the Brussels government simplified visa procedures 
for Taiwan students who want to pursue advanced studies in 
Belgium.

<F P=106> [Article signed RF: "Delcroix Sings Praises of General </F>
Briquemont: `An Unusual General Who Listens to the People'"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, in the Senate, Defense Minister Leo 
Delcroix found special words of praise for Belgian commander in 
chief of the United Nations in Bosnia, General Francis 
Briquemont, who stepped down in dissatisfaction early this month. 
  Delcroix was asked about the general's departure by Pierre 
Scharff of the PSC [Social Christian Party], Hubert Van Wambeke 
of the CVP [Christian People's Party], Francis Vermeiren of the 
VLD [Flemish Liberals and Democrats], and Claude Bougard of 
Ecolo [French-speaking Green Party]. The minister made use of 
the opportunity to heap praise on this "unusual general who 
listens to the people, who is not out looking for war, and who 
does not allow himself to be led by personal ambitions." 
  "Briquemont was driven in Sarajevo by a personal concern to 
prevent bloodshed," said Delcroix. "He rightly refused to 
resign himself to the senseless tragedy that was taking place 
around him." In saying these words, the minister took out an 
article from the OSLOBODENJE, the last newspaper in Sarajevo, 
praising the general. 
  "General Briquemont has not neglected to alert the outside 
world and international organizations to the weak points of 
their intervention," continued the minister. He then said that 
Briquemont "had not seen much" of the additional 4,000 troops 
that had been promised months ago. 
  Delcroix reported how Briquemont had told him he intended to 
write a book about his experience in Sarajevo, entitled "Do 
Something General." That was the message delivered by "the 
various diplomats who sometimes came to visit him." The 
minister then subtly added that "the military must be given 
precise orders to be able to function properly." 
  Delcroix decided that he has no regrets about letting the 
general speak his mind freely. Once again he showed 
understanding for "the physical exhaustion and mental fatigue" 
of someone "who, in seven months never had a substantial night's 
rest, continually had to negotiate with unreliable dialogue 
partners, and also had to lead an army under the most difficult 
circumstances."
