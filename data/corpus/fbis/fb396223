<F P=106> [Article by Paul Vaute: "Community Service Is To Be </F>
Considered--Leo Delcroix's Idea, Launched When National Service 
Was Abolished, Is Now Being Studied"] 
  [Text] The idea of launching a young people's community 
service scheme was first proposed two years ago, close on the 
heels of the termination of obligatory national military 
service. Since then it has hardly reappeared, to the point that 
many people probably believed it had been buried. But this was 
not the case. 
  In fact, the project has reached the stage of active 
preparation among Defense Ministry advisors. Leo Delcroix will 
present the cabinet with a document on the subject next month. 
Most of the material was ready last December, but the social 
situation, more than tense at the time, was hardly propitious 
for the project's advancement. 
<H5>  Supply and Demand </H5>
  What is in the document? There is no doubt that any 
obligatory and/or unpaid formula will be avoided. The 
possibility of civic, social or cultural service will be 
addressed to volunteers and will include payment at least 
comparable to that given to conscripts, but there will be no 
wages (with their share of social payments, pension payments, 
etc.). 
  Although Delcroix has been made responsible by his 
colleagues 
for clearing the terrain, the formula is not linked specifically 
to the Defense Ministry. The Army will be only one of the 
sectors open to those entering the scheme. In the Army scheme, 
they will be able to follow in-depth training in an active unit 
and then can be added to the reserves. In addition, there will 
be a considerable range of social or cultural positions which 
could be filled. "The question is to create a demand which 
meets the supply of young people who want to put their ideals at 
the disposal of society," they say at the Defense Ministry. 
<H5>  Reserves </H5>
  A scheme of this sort, for which no budget has been fixed, 
nevertheless raises reservations in some circles. Besides the 
fact that no real equivalent exists abroad, Delcroix will 
obviously have work to do in convincing sceptics that he is not 
seeking to form a new low social category or a way of getting 
unemployed people to work. 
  On Tuesday [18 January], when questioned by Ecolo 
[French-speaking Green Party] MP Philippe Dallons in Parliament, 
the minister stated that the service would last for a short 
period, its start-up would not be linked to the problem of 
employment and the objective would be to counter social problems 
which presently have no ideal solution. 
  Evidently, joint action with the language communities and 
regions will be necessary, but the framework will be set at the 
federal level. Insofar as there is agreement with its aim.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 22 (AFP) -- Belgian soldiers 
protesting about pensions and plans to trim the Armed Forces 
pelted police and the Defence Ministry building with eggs and 
tomatoes during a demonstration Saturday [22 January] in 
Brussels. 
  Around a thousand soldiers in civilian dress protested 
against the non-payment of pension increases and the plans to 
cut the Armed Forces. 
  While a delegation from the protesters met officials in the 
Defence Ministry, the crowd outside threw eggs and tomatoes at 
the building and police guarding it. 
  Several members of the delegation were hit as they came out 
of their meeting. 
  The crowd later dispersed without incident.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dirk Achten: "No Longer Any Choice"] </F>
  [Text] They are going. Vice Prime Minister Guy Coeme 
first, publicly and bitterly. Bitter because, in his own words, 
he was the victim of a sustained, merciless campaign in both the 
media and political circles. The daily bombardment became too 
much for him. Now Coeme is free to organize his defense, as it 
were. 
  Shortly after, he was followed by Guy Spitaels, who resigned 
as minister-president of the Walloon region. Walloon Interior 
Minister Guy Mathot who had been named in a whole list of 
scandals, and is heavily suspected of involvement in the 
Agusta-Cools affair, was -- very noticeably -- the last to go. 
Impudence beyond all measure. 
  The PS [Walloon Socialist Party] dropped Coeme to save the 
government. About time. In the last three weeks, the party had 
remained firmly behind the three PS ministers, claiming that 
they were innocent; that there was nothing for which to reproach 
them; that it was a party political maneuver, a plot on the part 
of resentful Flemings who could not bear to look the new, 
pragmatic Wallonia in the face. This life raft was deflated 
rapidly, in just a few hours. The situation became untenable 
particularly when it emerged unmistakably that the main evidence 
against the PS ministers came from within the party itself. 
  The result is a historic blow against the PS leadership, 
which is shaking the party to its foundations. Torn by internal 
disputes and vendettas, crushed and humiliated by the forced 
resignation of three ministers, Party Chairman Philippe Busquin 
has been left standing knee-deep in the rubble. What still 
remains of the dream of socialism? What still remains of the 
most powerful party in Wallonia? 
  Are the hard times for the PS now over and done with? Does 
it mean that the Agusta story is now a closed book? No. Not 
only because by no means all the information about this Italian 
helicopter order has emerged yet. The role played by the 
economic minister at the time, Willy Claes, remains disputed. 
And what about the senior army commanders? Why was Commander 
in Chief Jose Charlier so enthusiastic in his defense of Guy 
Coeme? 
  However, above all, the murder of Andre Cools remains 
unsolved. The theory of a link with the Agusta affair, of some 
dreadful vendetta within the PS, is gaining ground. We need to 
know who issued the orders, who knew, and who carried out the 
act. This inquiry must not be allowed to come to a halt. The 
resignations of the PS ministers must be the cracks of the whip 
that urge an accelerated denouement of the affair. 
  The damage caused to the government cannot be estimated for 
the time being. However, one thing is certain: A political 
earthquake of these proportions has left the Dehaene team 
shaking at the knees. The PS is a shadow of its former self, and 
many members of the party are thinking of revenge. In such a 
situation, and with even more revelations hanging over them, who 
would want to commit themselves fully to budgetary measures or 
contentious bills? Who will dare -- or can afford -- to pretend 
that there is nothing wrong? 
  The entire political sphere is being turned upside down, and 
a murder was required to make this happen. Over the years, 
people have gotten away unpunished with far too much. That is 
disturbing. Even more disturbing are some reactions, especially 
in Wallonia, which give rise to suspicions that people find it 
normal for politicians to do their best for the region, party, 
and supporters, even if their actions do not really comply with 
the rules. These kinds of Italian practices must disappear. 
And not just in Wallonia, but here too. The resignation of the 
PS ministers, or even a government crisis, must not be allowed 
to stand in the way of the process of purification. The 
political class no longer has any choice.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jean-Paul Duchateau: "Still A Matter of </F>
Urgency"] 
  [Text] The PS [Socialist Party] turns the page. It could 
have come up with a formula clearly stating the temporary nature 
of the situation, the resigning members expressly being invited 
to return to their responsibilities as soon as "the matter has 
been cleared up" and their innocence confirmed by the courts. 
By contrast, the vast game of musical chairs conducted by 
Philippe Busquin and the choice of Elio Di Rupo as deputy prime 
minister bears witness to a very strict "realpolitik," staking 
all on a lasting revival of the coalition. 
  Such an attitude may, however, lend credence to the idea 
that, in fact, over and above the inevitable expressions of 
solidarity, the Socialist Party is sacrificing the three Guys. 
Because it doubts in some way their complete innocence, or 
because that is the price which must be paid in order to restore 
its image. 
  But will this quick fix then be enough to allow the 
coalition 
to get off again on the right foot, almost as if nothing had 
happened? Even if they are both bound by the same fear of 
electoral defeat, the PS and the CVP [Christian People's Party] 
have seen their old differences once again exacerbated by the 
recent events. Busquin and his colleagues cannot get it out of 
their heads that it is harassment by Flanders, and by the 
Flemish partners in the coalition in particular, which drove 
them to the episode of the triple resignation and which for 
several days created a Titanic-like atmosphere in the Socialist 
Party. 
  If a full-blown political crisis, with elections thrown into 
the bargain, has been avoided as a result of these three 
resignations and wide-ranging reshuffle, there is reason to fear 
a resurgence of a muffled community war which will trigger a new 
separatist dynamic, at present dulled rather than eradicated, 
which, due to the increasing confusion of public opinion, will 
serve to break the fragile balance struck by the latest state 
reforms. 
  Perhaps, therefore, the Agusta affair may no longer directly 
threaten the coalition, but it does continue to undermine 
political life and the foundations of Belgian society. It is 
still a matter of urgency that the truth, and the whole truth, 
be revealed.

<F P=106> [Article by Theo Westerwoudt: "Netherlands Helps Bulgaria </F>
Solve its Energy and Environmental Problems"] 
  [Excerpts] Zoetermeer -- "The Netherlands is aiding us with 
technology and with major showcase projects that are helping us 
to solve our energy and environmental problems," says Bulgarian 
Deputy Environment Minister Evgeni Angelov enthusiastically. "I 
am extremely grateful for this cooperation." 
  Angelov is visiting Energy &amp; Environment Netherlands 
(E&amp;EN) 
in Zoetermeer, the organization set up two years ago to help 
Netherlands companies secure contracts within the context of aid 
for Central and East Europe. Over the past few days, he has 
established contacts for projects concerned with the improvement 
of gas supplies, the generation of electricity, coal 
vaporization, the cleaner combustion of lignite, and 
technological training in his country. 
  Bulgaria relies heavily on Russian supplies of natural gas, 
nuclear energy, and lignite for its energy requirements. 
Lignite is the only energy source that is amply available in 
Bulgaria, but the processing and combustion of lignite cause 
tremendous environmental pollution, forming dust and emitting 
sulfur into the atmosphere. Consequently, Deputy Minister 
Angelov is enthusiastic about the new technology that the 
Rotterdam-based company Ecofire is implementing at a lignite 
mine to the northwest of Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, following 
arbitration by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and E&amp;EN. 
"The 
pilot project that Ecofire is putting into practice in 
conjunction with us is working superbly. I hope that it will be 
extended rapidly on a commercial scale, because we want to 
comply with Western environmental standards as soon as 
possible." [passage omitted] 
  Over the past few days, Angelov has also signed a contract 
with several Netherlands companies covering technological 
training for Bulgarians who are going to set up a gas 
distribution system in his country. A next step, which could 
also mean orders for the Netherlands, will involve the 
construction of pipelines, control equipment, pumps, and 
compressors. The engineer Hans de Ruiter, the CEO [chief 
executive officer] of E&amp;EN, believes that Netherlands energy 
companies like Gasunie, and the major distribution companies in 
this sector, can do far more to conquer a share of the East 
European market. "Look at what British Gas, Gaz de France, and 
German companies are doing in Hungary, Poland, and the Czech 
Republic. They pay for the first feasibility studies and then 
receive contracts as a matter of course." De Ruiter believes 
that the shareholders of Gasunie -- Shell and Esso -- are 
clinging to the brakes. As a result, the ideal envisioned by 
Prime Minister Lubbers, who saw a leading role being set aside 
for Netherlands companies with his energy plan for East Europe, 
is materializing slowly. 
  Probably together with the Delft-based company Hagoort, 
Gasunie will advise Bulgaria on the storage of natural gas in an 
empty gas field to the north of Sofia. Bulgaria urgently needs 
a buffer of this kind, because the supply of Russian gas is 
being interrupted due to technical or political problems.

  [Text] The Hague, Jan 20 (AFP) -- A French container ship 
has been seized and its owners asked to pay $2.6 million 
compensation after thousands of sachets of toxic pesticide were 
washed up on Dutch beaches, officials said Thursday [20 January]. 
  Transport Ministry officials said the French-registered 
Sherbro had been docked at Amsterdam since Wednesday evening 
following the discovery of the sachets during the day Wednesday. 
  The sachets, which the ministry said were lost overboard in 
December, contained two highly toxic agricultural fungicides. 
The substances can be fatal if inhaled or ingested and can 
seriously damage the eyes in case of contact. 
  A ministry spokesman said the Sherbro was identified with 
the 
help of the Lloyd's register of ships. The Sherbro is owned by 
SCAC Delmas-Vieljeux, based in Dunkirk, and is insured by the 
British company P and I. 
  The Sherbro lost 88 containers containing 500,000 sachets 
last December 8 and 9, while weathering an overnight storm off 
the French coast. Thousands of sachets have already been washed 
up on French and Belgian beaches. 
  Delmas's representative here said the ministry was claiming 
five million florins (about $2.6 million) in compensation to pay 
for the clean-up operation. 
  The worst of the pollution discovered Wednesday occurred 
near 
Amsterdam, the ministry said. Most beaches along the Dutch 
coast were affected but most of the sachets were found at Velsen 
and Ijmuiden near Amsterdam. 
  Police sealed off the beaches on Wednesday night and 
clean-up 
teams, equipped with protective clothing and goggles, began 
cleaning up the beaches on Thursday morning. 
  In some spots there were six sachets per square meter 
(yard), 
the ministry spokesman said. 
  Clean-up work should take two days, the spokesman said, 
declining to estimate the cost. He added that two cigarette-box 
size objects had also been found near Amsterdam, also from the 
Sherbro. 
  They were being investigated to determine whether they were 
detonators, he said. 
  The Dutch subsidiary of Swiss chemicals giant Ciba-Geigy 
offered to cooperate in the operation, offering to transport the 
recovered sachets and dispose of them in a specialised plant 
near Rotterdam. 
  It said it too would seek payment for its services from the 
container ship's owners, or their insurers.

  [Text] London, Jan 24 (CNA)--Britain's Foreign Office 
described as "rumours" late Monday [24 January] a front page 
article by a British daily, suggesting that the Turkish-occupied 
areas in Cyprus were used as negotiating ground for the supply 
of military aid to Azerbaijan. 
  "THE INDEPENDENT" wrote Monday that the British Government 
had given "tacit support to an illegal scheme to supply 
Azerbaijan with military backing in its war with Armenia." 
  The military backing, according to the newspaper, included 
both the supply of arms and "a large number of mercenaries." 
  Moreover, "THE INDEPENDENT" wrote that the negotiating 
sides' 
representatives were based in Cyprus' Turkish-occupied areas 
"where it is not illegal to trade in arms to Azerbaijan." 
  The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared independence in 
1983. The illegal entity is recognised only by Turkey, which 
occupies 37 percent of the island's territory since 1974. 
  The transactions were confirmed by Lord Erskine of Rerrick, 
68, who, according to the daily, lives in these areas but is to 
return to the U.K. within a month. 
  Lord Erskine confirmed to the daily that the negotiations 
had 
taken place between Azeri authorities and a consortium for which 
he is acting as consultant.

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri is continuing his 
visit to Britain. He met yesterday with British Prime Minister 
John Major, leaders of the Lebanese community, and members of 
the Lebanese businessmen association. 
  Prime Minister al-Hariri affirmed that Lebanon can only 
survive on the basis of partnership, balance, and coexistence 
and that whoever tries anything else will fail. He said that 
without the cooperation of all Lebanese, the country cannot be 
rebuilt or achieve complete sovereignty and independence. He 
hoped Lebanon will be a vanguard country in the fields of 
culture, democracy, liberties, economy, trade, finance, and 
tourism. 
  Speaking at a reception held last night at the house of 
Lebanese Ambassador Mahmud Hammud, and attended by leaders of 
the Lebanese community and a number of Arab and foreign 
diplomats and officials, Prime Minister al-Hariri said: Lebanon 
needs your contribution. It cannot be rebuilt by an individual, 
a group of people, a party, a community, or a sect. It will 
only be rebuilt by the people from the different sects and 
communities. 
  Regarding the peace negotiations, the prime minister said 
that they may produce a result. Lebanon, he said, can face the 
challenges of peace. If peace does not take place and the 
Israelis do not withdraw, Lebanon can also face the challenges 
of steadfastness. We are preparing the country to face both 
possibilities. Through unity and cooperation of all Lebanese, 
we can face the cultural and all other challenges. 
  Prime Minister al-Hariri expressed his confidence in the 
Lebanese people's ability to overcome all difficulties. He 
expressed the belief that if peace is established, Lebanon will 
be an important center in the Middle East and the spearhead in 
the cultural and economic competition in the future. He said: 
The big loss is for us to enter the multilateral negotiations 
before the Israeli withdrawal takes place. Lebanon must not be 
deceived by Israeli enticements because Israel has not yet made 
a decision to withdraw. What happened after the Geneva summit 
proves this point. 
  Following his meeting with Prime Minister Major in the 
presence of the members of the Lebanese delegation, Prime 
Minister al-Hariri met in the Manchester Hotel with members of 
the Lebanese businessmen association in Britain and informed 
them of the British Government's readiness to support Lebanon 
and its position in the negotiations with Israel. Britain also 
supports the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory and is 
eager to see peace established and Lebanon regain its role in 
the area. 
  Al-Hariri described his talks with his British counterpart 
as 
successful and very positive. He explained that Major informed 
him of his government's agreement to provide 50 million pounds 
in credit guarantees for British exports to Lebanon. He 
affirmed that Britain expressed readiness to contribute to 
Lebanon's reconstruction, equip and strengthen the capabilities 
of the Internal Security Forces and the Lebanese Army, and 
participate in electricity and development projects. 
  The prime minister invited his British counterpart to visit 
Lebanon, and he promised to do so. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Robert Shrimsley: "Recovery Before Tax Cuts -- </F>
Clarke"] 
  [Text] Mr Clarke, the Chancellor, signalled his 
determination yesterday to push ahead with substantial tax 
increases despite new Treasury figures showing that from April 
the average family will be paying 35 percent tax compared with 
32.2 percent under the last Labour government. 
  The last two budgets will now cost the average family an 
extra 12.52 pounds a week. 
  Responding to the Treasury figures, which dented the Tories' 
claim to be the party of low taxation, Mr Clarke said he would 
continue to "impose whatever tax is necessary" to secure growth 
and boost employment. 
  He seemed unabashed by the figures and said he would 
continue 
with the tax rises to bring down public borrowing. That would 
ensure that the confidence in the recovery was maintained. 
  "I will do what is necessary, some of it unpopular, in order 
to create the right conditions for growth to continue," he said. 
"First you have to create the wealth. Helping business get the 
jobs has to be the first priority. Then my aims of low taxation 
can be achieved." 
  Tories were clearly shaken by the figures, which were 
released by Mr Stephen Dorrell, Financial Secretary to the 
Treasury, in response to questions from Ms Harriet Harman, 
Labour's Treasury spokesman. 
  Senior backbenchers said it was now politically essential to 
cut taxes before the next election. 
  Although Mr Clarke said the Treasury figures were 
meaningless 
because take-home pay had risen significantly, Tories fear that 
the loss of their most potent political claim could be extremely 
damaging. 
  Mr John Townend, chairman of the backbench finance 
committee, 
said: "We are the party philosophically of low taxation. If we 
lose that label we are in trouble." The Treasury figures show 
that a married couple with two children, living on an income of 
19,450 pounds will now lose 21.9 percent of their income in 
income tax and national insurance contributions, compared with 
20.9 percent when Labour was last in office in 1978/79. 
  Once VAT [value-added tax] and other indirect taxes are 
added, the figure rises to 35 percent. 
  The Treasury says that the overall rise in average earnings 
has increased the average family's income by 14.40 pounds a week 
-- but only 1.88 pounds of that will be left after the tax rises. 
  A family with an income of 14,590 pounds a year -- three 
quarters of average earnings -- will have to pay 9.52 pounds a 
week more in tax from April, while the bill for a family on 
21,175 pounds will leap by 21.58 pounds. 
  Mr Gordon Brown, Shadow Chancellor, said the Conservatives' 
failure to admit the truth about their tax policies meant that 
"the country will never trust them on tax again." 
  Mr Clarke, interviewed on BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost 
programme, stoutly defended his decisions and those of his 
predecessor, Mr Norman Lamont, to raise tax. 
  "I have to impose whatever tax is necessary to get us more 
jobs and more growth," he said. "That is my duty and no 
Chancellor can ever tell people that he will never put up taxes." 
  He remained committed to delivering "the lowest taxation 
that 
would be responsible in the circumstances. It is only if you 
actually create the wealth the country needs...then you are able 
to keep taxation down and carry on spending on the great public 
services. 
  "But first you have to create the wealth. Helping business 
get the jobs has to be the first priority. Then my aims of low 
taxation can be achieved." 
  The Government had demonstrated its commitment to sound 
finances and his aim was to allow people to keep as much of 
their money as possible. "I will put down tax when I possibly 
can," Mr Clarke said. "It is one of my political aims. Taxes 
will always be lower under me than they would be if I were 
replaced by a Labour Chancellor or a Liberal Chancellor." 
  He remained upbeat about Britain's economic prospects: "We 
are on course to get rid of the borrowing," he said. "I think 
that has given a great boost to confidence, to the economy, and 
we see the growth emerging, every prospect of the recovery 
getting stronger. 
  "My judgment had to be: can this recovery stand the tax, 
will 
the horse get over Becher's Brook when it gets there in April?" 
  Mr Clarke went on: "I was confident that it would when I 
had the Budget in November. I am more confident now because all 
the figures coming out show that we have restored confidence. 
The economy is growing in a way no other major economy in West 
Europe is." 
  Mr Brown accused Mr Clarke and Mr Major of attempting to 
deceive the country. 
  "The Conservatives are now making the biggest tax demands in 
history," he said. "The Chancellor cannot deceive his way out 
of the Tory tax embarrassment." 
  Mr Townend echoed the views of many Tory backbenchers' when 
he said it was now "absolutely essential" that Mr Clarke should 
reduce taxes to at least the level they were in l992 and 
preferably lower, before the next election. 
  "All those spending ministers who were saying it was more 
politically damaging to cut spending than to put up taxes have 
now seen their chickens coming home to roost," he added.

<F P=106> [By Rowan Dore, PRESS ASSOCIATION political staff] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Hong Kong 
Governor Chris Patten today urged China to get back to the 
negotiating table and reach a solution on the future of the 
colony. 
  After a 45 minute meeting at Downing Street of the Cabinet 
subcommittee, which oversees Hong Kong, chaired by Prime 
Minister John Major, both Mr Hurd and Mr Patten warned the 
Chinese that time was running out. 
  Mr Hurd said "no decisions" had been taken on the "timing or 
content" of the second part of the legislation -- which mostly 
concerns the format for future elections in the run-up to the 
hand over of Hong Kong to the Chinese in 1997. 
  "That legislation needs to be in place by July this year in 
order that the preparations for the elections in 1994 and 1995 
can be made in an orderly way. We are entirely ready to resume 
discussions with the Chinese on the points which remain in 
disagreement. Obviously there is limit to the time that can be 
spent in discussion before legislation has to be tabled on the 
second part." 
  Mr Patten said: "We would very much like to see a resumption 
of talks. We are still prepared to negotiate and I very much 
hope the Chinese are as well." He was speaking after China 
attacked the Governor again at the weekend over the way he has 
conducted negotiations, which have currently reached a stalemate. 
  Lu Ping, China's top official for Hong Kong, said: "The 
series of performances by Patten recently show that he has a 
`doomsday mentality.'" 
  Mr Patten was flying back to Hong Kong tonight to try to 
bring the Chinese back to the negotiating table. 
  The first part of the legislation, which is largely 
uncontroversial, is currently going through Hong Kong's ruling 
legislative council. Mr Patten has revealed he was obliged to 
go ahead on the first part without China's help.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Patten Should Stay"] </F>
  [Text] The current visit to London of Mr Chris Patten, 
Governor of Hong Kong, comes at a watershed. Within the next 
month or so, the colony's Legislative Council [Legco] will vote 
upon his proposals for the first phase of electoral reform, 
extending democracy. It is probable, though by no means 
certain, that these proposals will pass, and that later in the 
year more controversial aspects of the package will be 
considered. 
  Since the Chinese government has made plain its 
irreconcilable opposition to Mr Patten and his plans, relations 
with Beijing are likely to remain deadlocked, and even perhaps 
to worsen if the Governor's proposals are implemented. Some 
prominent British businessmen, both in Hong Kong and London, 
have expressed great concern about this prospect. Since the 
Chinese will have the power and, some believe, the will to 
unscramble anything Britain decrees between now and 1997 they 
argue that the belated Patten reforms are futile. They are even 
more alarmed by the prospect that the Chinese will respond by 
squeezing British business out of the huge opportunities opening 
up in China. 
  These are serious issues, and they have caused much heated 
private discussion in Westminster and Whitehall. The 
controversy over Hong Kong coincides with a low point in the 
Tories' fortunes at home. Minister after minister has lamented 
privately that Chris Patten, among the ablest of Tory thinkers 
and strategists, is absent from the bridge in the Government's 
hour of need. Once Legco has voted upon the Patten reform 
package, goes an argument heard at the most senior levels, will 
there be a real job left for the Governor to do? Could not the 
Prime Minister kill two large flying objects with one stone, by 
appointing a new governor who might be better able to build 
bridges with Beijing, and bringing home Mr Patten to bolster the 
Government? It has been suggested that he could become the 
principal behind-the-scenes strategist and fireman, or, more 
ambitiously, could be elevated to the House of Lords and given 
one of the great offices of state. 
  It is understood that Mr Patten himself has now acted 
decisively to kill all speculation on this front. First, he 
dismisses the suggestion that his job in Hong Kong will be 
completed once Legco has dealt one way or another with his 
reform package. A long and increasingly sensitive period lies 
ahead, and he feels a strong personal commitment to seeing his 
job through. Second, he sees no plausible scenario for his own 
return to British domestic politics this side of a General 
Election. The House of Lords holds no charms for him, and the 
British public would be unlikely to be impressed by the dramatic 
return of Lord Patten to the political battlefield, when it 
would be so obvious that this was because voters would refuse to 
reinvent Chris Patten MP at any by-election. 
  We believe that Mr Patten's calculations are correct and 
honourable on all three counts: the interests of Hong Kong, of 
himself, and of the Government. We have been critical in the 
past of the manner in which he embarked upon his democratic 
initiative. The Chinese regime in Beijing is indeed despotic, 
geriatric, and thus unstable. But it remains highly debatable 
whether Mr Patten's approach was the one most likely to serve 
the long-term interests of the people of Hong Kong. Today, 
however, that phase is history. We are where we are. Legco 
will make its own decision about the feasibility and 
desirability of Mr Patten's plans. Whichever way this goes, 
Hong Kong will need a committed governor with visible political 
authority to safeguard the stability af the colony in the run-up 
to 1997. Even leaving aside the major difficulty of identifying 
a credible replacement for Mr Patten, the mere fact of his 
departure would be bound to heighten fears and uncertainties in 
Hong Kong, and could even incite the old men in Beijing to act 
more ruthlessly. We share the view that there is, anyway, no 
convincing route by which Mr Patten, much as he is missed, can 
re-enter British politics in the next three years. 
  He deserves all credit if he is willing to see his Hong Kong 
assignment through. The removal of any uncertainty on that 
score should be welcomed both in the colony and at Westminster.

  [Text] An agreement has been reached between Mario Segni's 
Pact for Italy and the Northern League. Segni, who was 
accompanied by [Rocco] Buttiglione, held a meeting this morning 
with Northern League Deputy [Roberto] Maroni. The meeting was 
described as positive and one which helped to resolve many 
differences. Segni said the meeting, which lasted four hours, 
was successful. A short time ago, a joint document was 
released. The document says, among other things, the Italian 
Republic is united and indivisible. This declaration was 
demanded by Segni, and it puts an end to the many secessionist 
statements made by the Northern League. 
  Now that the path has been smoothed over, the birth of a 
moderate alliance, which should also include [Silvio] Berlusconi 
and the Christian Democratic Center [Party], is set to go ahead. 
Observers are now waiting for a reaction from [Mino] 
Martinazzoli's Popular Party [new name of the Christian Democrat 
Party].

<F P=106> [Interview with Fausto Bertinotti, newly elected secretary </F>
of the Communist Refoundation Party, by unidentified 
correspondent; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] Fausto Bertinotti is the new secretary of the 
Communist Refoundation Party. He was elected by 160 out of 193 
delegates at the party congress last night--in other words, by 
the majority which favor opening up to the other parties on the 
left. Let us hear what Bertinotti has to say in this interview. 
  [Correspondent] Three years ago the Refoundation Party and 
the Party of the Democratic Left chose different paths. Today 
they find themselves sitting together at the table of the 
so-called progressive alliance. What is the true reason for 
this change of policy? 
  [Bertinotti] The reason for the coming together is found in 
the grave economic crisis in our country, in the failure of the 
ruling classes in this country, and the grave danger from mass 
right-wing reactionary forces. We stand together against these 
dangers; and in order to change things, a united left is 
necessary. 
  [Correspondent] You were one of the leaders of the Italian 
General Confederation of Labor [CGIL]. The number one problem 
in Italy today is unemployment. What could any future left-wing 
government do differently compared to what is being done today 
to fight this problem? 
  [Bertinotti] We would do many things differently because the 
problem of unemployment bears the stamp of what the governments 
of Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and Guiliano Amato have done. This is 
why we must change; this is why we must give life to a strategy 
that will cut working hours and that will guarantee equal pay in 
order to start up the economy. There are many needs to be met, 
and there is a great need for work. 
  [Correspondent] Who is your closest ally and who is your 
most 
dangerous adversary? 
  [Bertinotti] Our closest allies are the mass movements in 
Italy, and the struggles of the workers and the students. Our 
most dangerous adversaries are people like Gianni Agnelli 
[chairman of FIAT], who want to fire workers or lay them off, or 
close factories, and like Silvio Berlusconi, who are running the 
risk of provoking an authoritarian evolution in our country. 
  [Correspondent] At the congress there emerged differences on 
the risk of sitting at the same tables as the progressives. 
There is a fear of sliding towards the moderates. 
  [Bertinotti] Of course there are risks, and the Refoundation 
Party is very alert to these dangers. The moderates will not be 
defeated by following their line. They will be defeated by 
offering an alternative.

<F P=106> [Article by Renzo Di Rienzo: "First, Pay the Doctor"] </F>
  [Text] Berlusconi's platform advocates private health 
care; pension funds; and for the very poor, vouchers to be spent 
in hospitals. These are his proposals, stolen from Ronald 
Reagan. 
  Berlusconi's program for governing ("A plan for the future 
of 
democracy in Italy") is modest in appearance, in the style of 
the Knight of Arcore. Having settled on the title, various 
committees of professors who are involved in the "Seekers of 
Good Government" association went to work before Christmas. But 
because the egghead consultants were working at a leisurely 
pace, Silvio Berlusconi's staff [preceding word in English] in 
the meantime quickly set about distilling certain truths into 40 
points that will be the centerpiece of his election campaign. 
Each point is studied as if it were a minor political 
provocation--a hammer blow designed to demolish everything that 
has been done heretofore with respect to the economy, pensions, 
and welfare. In this way, 40 resounding blows were struck--blows 
that will not allow TV or the press to divert their attention 
for so much as one day from Silvio Berlusconi. 
  His program is ready, however, and has even been condensed 
onto colored cards that the candidates of the new party "Forza 
Italia" are committing to memory. In reading these cards, one 
gets the impression tht the only way to enter fully into the 
Berlusconian neofree-enterprise universe is to picture Italy as 
an enormous supermarket in which all citizens are basically 
potential consumers and are differentiated among themselves in 
terms of the differences in income that they individually 
represent. And so you have the superconsumers; the medium 
consumers; the anticonsumers (these are the worst, because they 
are that way ideologically, not because of their income); and 
finally, those who have little or no income: the very poor. 
Anyone who believes, however, that Berlusconi's proposed reforms 
are grimly classist in nature--as might appear at first 
sight--is mistaken. He also has an idea and a proposal to 
benefit the so-called new poor (estimated--in one study by the 
office of the prime minister--to number approximately 3 million 
citizens). For them, the Knight proposes the distribution of 
free "vouchers" (as they are defined in the "Forza Italia" 
programs), which resemble meal tickets except that they cannot 
be spent at lunch counters, to be sure, but at private clinics 
or in the very same USL's [local health units] which operate in 
merciless competition with the private clinics and all of which, 
in any case, require payment. 
  Here is the great change that Berlusconi would like to make 
in the system: Welfare will no longer be the responsibility of 
the state and guaranteed to everyone; the very poor will have 
their vouchers, and the others will pay for their own health 
care by purchasing the best coverage they can obtain in the 
market. All of us should, therefore, become more judicious and 
think of the future, because Mother State that today provides 
for our health and our old age will gradually be dismantled. 
  But will all Italians be foresighted enough to provide 
health 
care insurance for themselves? And who is giving a thought to 
the overconfident and the irresponsible? The truth is that 
Berlusconi has not neglected them either: his recipe is a kind 
of American-style free enterprise system (the one propagandized 
throughout the world during Ronald Reagan's reign), diluted by 
Milanese circumspection. Everyone--even the improvident--will 
accordingly be compelled to acquire--at their own expense--an 
insurance policy that will cover at least the major risks 
(accidents, serious illnesses, operations, and lengthy 
hospitalizations), as occurs today in the case of compulsory 
automobile insurance. 
  Under the Berlusconi free-market system, of course, social 
differences will be felt even more strongly than today. That is 
to say, those who are well off will be able to obtain complete 
and reliable health insurance, while those who cannot afford it 
will have to be content and be very careful not to get sick. 
  The Arcore party platform also includes a complete change in 
the pension system. If Berlusconi were to govern the country, 
the entire system would be privatized within 10 years, at which 
point the insurance companies would compete ruthlessly with each 
other for life insurance policies and with the INPS [National 
Agency for Social Security], which would have to function on the 
basis of decidedly privatistic standards. Provision is of course 
made for a transition period: those who have already made many 
payments to the INPS should continue to do so until they reach 
the age at which they qualify for a pension, but those who start 
work in future years will be able to select any insurance 
company that suits them. 
  As at present, professionals, artisans, and businessmen will 
acquire life insurance policies that are entirely private. 
Employed persons, on the other hand, will tend to use the 
pension funds (consisting of sums withheld monthly from their 
pay and passed on to a private insurer) that will subsequently 
be taxed at reduced rates. Professor Antonio Martino--the brains 
behind the Berlusconian economic plan and the future economy 
minister if the ticket of the moderates wins--is already 
preparing a plan to make these pension funds more attractive 
because they will become in fact the instruments for 
accumulating the sums set aside for the pensions of employees in 
the public and private sectors. A small percentage of the sums 
thus withheld will be diverted into a kind of social fund that 
will finance the minimum pensions for those millions of 
low-income Italians who will be unable to provide for their own 
pensions. 
  Will Knight Berlusconi have the courage to announce these 
resounding innovations that have been elaborated by his 
economists? And above all, will they bring him votes? 
  For the present, he is only considering it, but he will 
eventually propose a law to set a ceiling on government 
spending--in order to prevent excessive expenditure--that will 
be similar to the proposal he has already made regarding tax 
revenues. Although this part of his platform may even displease 
many Italians and may lend itself to the accusation that he is 
scrapping all that has heretofore been regarded as social gains, 
Berlusconi will be betting heavily on an economic recovery. 
Could he--an incurable optimist--stand idly by in the face of 
declining production and the tragedy of unemployment? Two 
splendid ideas have occurred to him in this connection, but they 
will require a sacrifice on the part of the national treasury. 
The first would allow a businessman not to pay taxes on profits 
from his business that are reinvested immediately, and the 
second would authorize him to hire workers without paying the 
corresponding social taxes until such time as the economic 
recovery has been consolidated. Would these two strategems serve 
to give a major boost to the Italian economy? "They would not 
work, inasmuch as apprenticeship contracts and various forms of 
incentives for investment already exist," says Professor Felice 
Mortillaro, despite the fact that he himself is a member of the 
Good Government Association. "An entrepreneur invests or hires 
when the production cycle is set in motion, and certainly does 
not do so in order to save on his taxes."

  [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- The "political revolution in 
Europe" is not yet over, in the view of German Defense Minister 
Volker Ruehe. Germany wants to contribute toward integration 
and cooperation with East and Central Europe very much in the 
spirit of the last NATO summit, through an international 
security policy conference entitled "Stability as a Pan-European 
Task," which began in Berlin today, the minister said prior to 
the start of the conference. 
  As can be seen by the composition, with representatives of 
14 
European countries and the United States, this is a conference 
at the heart of Europe, "where -- as people used to say -- East 
meets West." 
  This is also important for Berlin, Ruehe stressed. He knew 
of no better place, "when it is a matter of extending the 
stability we enjoy to all of Europe." 
  Asked about a possible NATO mission in Bosnia, Ruehe said it 
is a matter for the United Nations to decide. In any event, 
things cannot continue as they have until now. The world 
organization has "to stand by what it has said." Germany has "a 
perfectly normal influence" on the United Nations, Ruehe said. 
  The defense ministers of Denmark, Austria, and Slovakia, 
high-ranking officers and civil servants as well as leading 
academics, are taking part in the conference. They intend to 
work out specific steps for fashioning fresh political prospects 
in Europe. The individual rounds of talks at the German defense 
minister's official residence in Berlin will deal mainly with 
NATO and the European Union transfering stability, as well as 
central Europe's security expectations. The conference will 
conclude tomorrow with an exchange of opinions on European 
stability as a focus of Russo-American security interests.

  [Text] The cooperation has just started. The advanced 
party of almost 1,000 technicians from former Yugoslavia are 
repairing old machinery in the Libyan desert, building 
factories, and carrying out maintenance work on Libyan bombers. 
However, Saleh Ferjani, head of Libyan Arab Airlines, has 
grander plans. The manager is thinking of forming a 
Serbian-Libyan air company, as well as a joint fleet, and of 
closer military cooperation. 
  Leader of the revolution Mu'ammar Qadhdhafi is pleased with 
the cooperation. Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic is fond of 
recalling the historic friendship between the two peoples -- an 
axis is being established between the two pariahs of the 
international community. Both regimes are internationally 
disdained: That is the case with Belgrade, because of its 
aggression in the Balkans and with Tripoli, because of its 
support for Arab terrorist organizations. 
  Because unlike Libya, rump Yugoslavia has lost its UN seat, 
it does not feel bound by the Security Council's sanctions 
catalogue and can at least conduct trade freely in one 
direction. Belgrade has found a useful loophole: Serbian 
companies are investing millions, flight capital from arms sales 
and smuggling is flowing into Colonel Qadhdhafi's country. 
  From Libya, Serbian trading activities are being extended to 
other countries in the Middle East and the entire world: from 
Cairo to Nicosia and via New York and Ottawa, as far as the 
Caribbean Cayman Islands. Succeeding the largest Yugoslav 
foreign trade concern, General-Export, which was dissolved in 
1989, the Serbian syndicate now operates under the name of Genex. 
  Acting in a manner that is a combination of gangsterism and 
secret service activities, 45 department heads and 200 former 
Communist Party functionaries are organizing the worldwide 
transfer of booty from the war in Bosnia and the laundering of 
money from criminal business transactions -- it is the main 
lifeline for the regime of Greater Serbian warlord Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
  "Only this network of deals permits the financing of the war 
in Bosnia," reports a Belgrade agent who is tired of taking 
risks, "the secret reserves have been used up and the economy is 
on its knees." 
  There is no doubt that the Serbian military apparatus 
consumes huge sums every month, the domestic defense industry 
lacks spare parts as well as electronic logistics, and the 
generals also are becoming increasingly worried about troop 
morale. With earnings of under $10 a month, there are fewer and 
fewer troops going to war voluntarily. 
  Since the beginning of the year, most wages in Milosevic's 
poor house are being paid out in goods. Wage packets usually 
consists of 10 kilos of potatoes, as well as bread and milk 
coupons -- four-fifths of families live below the official 
poverty line. Inflation, which reached the surreal level of 1 
million percent in December, has eliminated the last savings 
that people had. 
  Milosevic was aware of what was happening at the beginning 
of 
the war: In view of the UN sanctions, the regime could only 
survive on dollars earned abroad through trade. Above all, Arab 
states that were founders of the nonaligned movement along with 
Tito's communist Yugoslavia, became important centers of 
activity for the Serbian leader. "We are running around there, 
the way the Italians used to in Chicago," says the Genex 
dissident. 
  One important Genex center is on Cairo's Nile island Gasira. 
Retired Colonel D. Dragan Petronjevic, who represents the 
import-export company Direkcija za Robe Rezerve, a company that 
deals solely in parts for defense machinery lives there in a 
luxurious residence. 
  Vladimir Jovanovic, military attache at rump Yugoslavia's 
Cairo embassy, is behind all the deals and transfers money to 
accounts in the Greek part of Cyprus. There, his aide, Miodrag 
Savicevic, who only recently turned his back on Milan, his home 
town of choice, because of the general anticorruption drive in 
Italy, sees to the laundering of money and looks for new 
investment possibilities in the Middle East. 
  Some of the assets also flow into dozens of Belgrade trading 
company branches that have addresses on the Mediterranean 
island. The jungle of about 500 Serbian subsidiaries is 
coordinated by Vladimir Delic, Petronjevic's predecessor in 
Cairo, who also looks after the construction of retirement homes 
and refuges for a select few: Thus, Serbian Tsar Slobodan 
Milosevic has bought a luxurious villa close to Larnaka where 
members of his clan already reside, protected by an army of 
bodyguards. 
  However, the days when these Balkan friends could conduct 
large-scale business deals on Aphrodite's island without 
attracting attention are over. 
  The Cypriot Government increasingly is coming under pressure 
from the European Union and the United States to investigate the 
rapid growth of these branches of companies and to uncover the 
illegal machinations of the gangster cartels. 
  The World Bank estimates that, in the past three years 
alone, 
$20 billion have been transferred from states formerly belonging 
to the Soviet Union via Cyprus, a further $10 billion came from 
East Europe, and possibly as much as $5 billion from Serbia. 
Genex bosses already talk of Cyprus being a "financial parking 
place" that should be used, but with caution. That is because 
there are agents of all political colors there, from the CIA to 
pro-Bosnian Arab circles. 
  That does not discourage Israeli arms dealers from also 
getting involved in Serbian business on the island. Jezdimir 
Vasiljevic, a Belgrade banker resident in Tel Aviv, has been 
running a lucrative deal benefiting both sides for over a year. 
Jewish firms have received prospecting rights for several gold 
mines in Serbia, and, in return, the Israelis are providing 
electronic equipment for military purposes. The bank accounts 
are being administered by Daniel Roman, president of the 
Serbian-Jewish Friendship Society based in the Cypriot capital 
Nicosia. 
  Sofia, Bucharest, and Budapest also serve as centers for 
such 
activity. Genex trade representatives used the Bulgarian 
capital to arrange the purchase of Russian T-55 tanks worth $360 
million, forged documents in Bucharest for the transportation of 
goods via the Danube, and in Budapest, they negotiated a long 
term contract, one that will extend until the year 2013, for the 
supply of 3.3 billion cubic meters of Siberian natural gas at a 
price of $270 million. 
  However, the Genex traders nevertheless prefer business in 
the Arab world. It is easier to pull things off there and the 
profits are better. Thus, the weapons dealer Bekir Trhulij 
(whose nickname is Georgy) outbid the Russian and Slovakian 
competition to obtain handguns worth $290 million from the 
Lebanese Kataib Christian militia. 
  Military equipment can be sold at a high price to buyers in 
Latin America and black Africa -- some items get back to the old 
country by way of the Danube. There was a second coup a few 
weeks ago: Along with his friend Copa Babic, nicknamed Peg Leg, 
Georgy supplied electronic equipment manufactured in Serbia 
under U.S. and Swiss licenses, worth $100 million to Saudi 
Arabia. 
  During the Gulf War, he supplied 40 M-84 tanks, based on the 
Russian T-84, to the Saudis and thus gained their confidence. 
  Through Riyad, he has thus been able to set up arms deals in 
all the regions of the world. That was at a time when official 
Belgrade was helping out Iraqi leader Sadam Husayn with the same 
equipment: It was a double game that the Iraqi leader still 
holds against his Serbian friends. 
  Relations between the two nonaligned states are strained. 
The visit that Zivota Panic, the former head of the general 
staff, paid in March of last year did not produce the 
fundamental change that had been hoped for. 
  The Iraqis maintained their reserve vis-a-vis Belgrade, and 
Milosevic's wish to acquire Scud missiles and the know-how for 
long-range missile systems remained unfulfilled. Only by 
acquiring such weapons would Milosevic have been in a clear 
position to win the war in Bosnia -- Colonel Qadhdhafi in the 
role of mediator is Belgrade's new hope now. 
  Time is running out. Research carried out by U.S. secret 
services indicates that Bosnian Muslims, Croats, and Albanians 
are trying to develop international criminal syndicates. 
  Milosevic's opponent in the war, Alija Izetbegovic, is 
organizing the supply of weapons through Pakistan, Malaysia, and 
the Algerian military government with apparent success. That, 
at least, is what the Muslim president has been suggesting. 
  Over the last few weeks, his troops stopped the Serbian 
advance and gained substantial territory from the Croats. 
Izetbegovic's optimism provides some puzzles: "We will shortly 
succeed in beating back the Serbs on all fronts and regain the 
territories inhabited by Muslims."

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The Federal Government today 
confirmed reports that chemicals, the export of which to Iraq 
would have violated the UN embargo against that country, have 
been discovered on board the German freighter "Asian Senator." 
Government spokesman Dieter Vogel announced in Bonn that the 
Federal Government received information in mid-December that two 
containers with ammonium perchlorate were being transported from 
China to Beirut. The freight was described as harmless material 
in the manifest, whereas in fact it was fuel ingredients for the 
Iraqi missile program.

in mid-February to support the withdrawal of German blue helmet 
soldiers. According to information received by the Bonn studio 
of Second German Television, ZDF, this is intended to be a 
precautionary measure for the safety of the Bundeswehr units. 
It was said that the troops would board the ships in Mogadishu, 
while the equipment that was taken to Beledweyne will return to 
Germany on civilian freighters.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Exercises in the East?"] </F>
  [Text] A controversy on security policy has broken out 
between the governments in Bonn and London. Britain would like 
to transfer several units of its Rhine Army to eastern Germany 
for exercises. Last week, the Foreign Ministry categorically 
rejected Britain's request. The background lies in disputes 
about the Two-Plus-Four Agreement on German unity. Under that 
agreement, all of Germany will be counted as NATO area once the 
Russians have pulled out. However, the agreement stipulates that 
"foreign armed forces" would "neither be deployed in nor 
transferred to" the former GDR. In 1990, the allies agreed with 
the two German states to leave it to the united Germans to 
interpret the term "transfer." The British request has 
maneuvered Bonn into a dilemma. The Russian Government might 
regard the authorization of Rhine Army exercises in eastern 
Germany as an affront and slow down the faster-than-planned 
troop withdrawal. Yet, Bonn does not want to put off the 
British either, which is why the Federal Government is playing 
for time at the moment.

<F P=106> [Article by Jochen Thies: "Germans Shy Away From </F>
Partnership in Leadership"] 
  [Text] Unification has turned Germany into one of the major 
actors in international politics. Yet Bonn continues to prefer 
keeping a very low profile in terms of foreign and security 
policy. German foreign policy suffers from a lack of concept and 
orientation. One reason for this is that the Foreign Ministry 
continues to be affected by the fact that under Hans-Dietrich 
Genscher it used to focus on positions -- both regarding 
personnel and contents -- many of which have become shaky since 
1989 or turned out to be wrong. 
  Only four years ago, it looked as if Bonn had really risen 
to 
a real partner at the side of the United States during the 
two-plus-four process, while, meanwhile, the picture has 
changed. Not only since the Brussels NATO summit one has the 
feeling that German foreign policy, particularly in East Europe, 
is sailing in the tow of the Americans. As far as the Balkans 
is concerned, UN Security Council members Britain and France can 
determine what is going on at Germany's doorstep. Bonn has 
conformed itself to the role of junior partner. Would the same 
be conceivable in Northern Ireland or in Algeria under reverse 
circumstances? 
  In view of Germany's recent past, the current conditions in 
Europe, and international politics, no one will endorse a 
foreign policy that undertakes actions of its own in East Europe 
and the rest of the world. The request cannot be: the Germans 
to the front. [preceding five words in English] Nevertheless, 
it is necessary for Germany to formulate interests of its own. 
  One dilemma of Germany's current Russia policy is, for 
example, that the United States has put high stakes on the 
Moscow card and neglected the remaining East European area. 
Thus, Germany has been maneuvered into dangerous tracks. After 
all, the laws of history and geography are valid and they make 
German politics vulnerable should it turn out wrong one day to 
exclusively have banked on Gorbachev and, subsequently, Yeltsin. 
  If Germany has learned a lesson from the last century and if 
there is a moral requirement for Germany, then it is the 
following: Under all circumstances cooperate as closely as 
possible with those countries of East Europe to which it has a 
major historic obligation; first of all, Poland, Hungary, and 
the Czech Republic. Germany must not become once again a 
barrier between West and East, and, thus, a special case in 
politics. 
  This requirement has been neglected in the past few months. 
Amid major efforts to include the French into the GATT 
agreement, Bonn's ostpolitik has been ignored. Along with 
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, Clinton has taken the 
initiative here. Although one hears of close coordination with 
Bonn, one feels very little of it in practical politics. 
  In the 1980's, the politicians travelled too much, whereas 
now they do not meet often enough. In his European tour, 
Clinton conspicuously left out Germany. The short previous 
visit by Vice President Gore to Oggersheim cannot change this 
fact. Characteristically, the chancellor now has to pay a 
lightning visit to the United States at the end of the month to 
compensate for the "canceled meeting." 
  The Balkans conflict has become almost the only reason that 
West Europeans still meet, while they have achieved nothing 
there but only pile up flight kilometers and conference hours. 
As a superpower, the Americans discuss things with Russia 
while, otherwise, concentrating on domestic policy issues and 
their neighbors in the Pacific. Clinton met Yeltsin for the 
first time in Vancouver and received the Pacific Basin neighbors 
in Seattle. Now there is the danger of civil-war like 
developments in the neighboring country -- NAFTA partner Mexico 
-- which might reduce America's interest in East Europe, while 
Germany can be happy to see the last Russian withdraw by August 
without the interference of Zhirinovskiy. 
  Under these extraordinarily dramatic circumstances would it 
not be necessary to finally practice that partnership in 
leadership, which George Bush offered the Germans in his famous 
speech in Mainz on 31 May 1989? Bonn is still hesitating, but 
even the Bundestag election year is no reason to abstain from 
world politics.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ostpolitik: `Go Ahead, Boris'"] </F>
  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin is personally 
trying hard to give the Germans preferential treatment. The 
Kremlin head sent his election manager Nikolai Ryabov to Bonn on 
a special mission: To explain the Russian December election. 
  The messenger from the Moskva River brought attenuating 
news. 
Russia intends to "end for good the legend of the evil bear," 
Ryabov stressed at the Rhine last week, adding that there would 
be no return to violent, imperial policy. 
  It is true that several ministers in the Cabinet in Moscow 
would be exchanged, and that "a change of course" in economic 
policy "was on the agenda." However, Ryabov ruled out the 
failure of the entire reform process: "We cannot go back any 
more." 
  Such soothing words are necessary. There are mounting fears 
among Germans regarding the future of Russia. 
  The success of the nationalists and old communists in the 
December election had worried the Germans. The anti-Western 
tirades of hatred of nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy nourished 
old fears that Russia might return to the imperialist foreign 
policy of Czarist and communist origin. 
  Last week even those on whom the West had pinned all its 
hopes seemed to have opted for reorientation. First, Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who has so far been appreciated 
as a fierce advocate of a foreign policy guided by Western 
principles, caused some irritation by uttering old national 
tones. The foreign minister was understood as saying that, 
after all, Russia was not intending to release the Baltic 
Republics from its sphere of influence, and might even send in 
troops, if in doubt. 
  After that, the West's friend, Yeltsin, failed to oppose a 
Cabinet that was deprived of almost all its radical reformers. 
Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar and Finance Minister Boris 
Fedorov also stayed out. 
  German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, of the Free Democratic 
Party of Germany [FDP], only shortly before stressed that it was 
a signal for the future of reform policy and the West's Russia 
policy if the two men remained in the Cabinet. They stand for 
reform based on the market economy and close ties with the West, 
Kinkel said. If both were to go, it would result in a 
"considerable loss of confidence for Moscow." 
  And now it has happened. One high-ranking Foreign Ministry 
official stated that the government reshuffle has had "a very, 
very great sobering effect" on Foreign Ministry officials. 
  Now that the opponents to rapid privatization are gaining 
the 
upper hand in Moscow, the major German enterprises are also 
"worried," Karl-Hermann Fink, of the German Economy's East 
Committee said. Last year German companies sold to and bought 
from Russia goods worth some 22 billion German marks [DM]. 
  Yet, according to the result of a survey carried out among 
business people by the East Committee, the shortage in foreign 
currency of the Russian trading partners, legal uncertainty, 
unclear responsibilities and property conditions, and "the 
general political and economic instability" are making business 
"more and more difficult." 
  Hardly any German enterprise dares to invest in Russia, 
anyway. If anything, they accept barter deals -- goods in 
exchange for goods. 
  Among Russian experts of the German business community there 
is an intensifying debate on how much longer Yeltsin would be 
able to resist the pressure -- physically and politically. The 
crisis scenario of the managers: If Yeltsin were to step down, 
fascist Zhirinovskiy would seize power, push the armament 
industry, and sell the nuclear bomb to the Third World. 
  The confusion in Moscow has aroused the conservatives. 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Secretary General Peter Hintze 
is already speculating to score for Helmut Kohl in the 1994 
election campaigns with the "massive insecurity emanating from 
Russia." 
  "The situation is still too confusing" for a profound 
judgment, Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the CDU/Christian 
Social Union [CSU] Bundestag group, said. Yet, circumspect 
foreign-policy experts of the CDU/CSU, such as Karl-Heinz 
Hornhues, have unemotionally emphasized that the changes are 
"not as dramatic as some like to present them." 
  And the chancellor is trying to signal optimism, even in 
Moscow: "Boris, go ahead with your reform course," Kohl 
encouraged his friend on the telephone last Friday [21 January]. 
"The entire world is looking at you." Yeltsin stressed that he 
would be able to cope with the new government. 
  Kohl's Russia experts regard Yeltsin's optimism as 
well-founded. Even after the departure of Gaydar and Fedorov, 
the president would be able to implement his reform course -- 
albeit at a lower pace. Moreover, abandoning the radical 
market-economy course might even help to settle things there and 
stabilize Yeltsin. 
  In Western government headquarters, the professional 
observers had noted with concern for some time that, with his 
capitalist recipes, Gaydar was producing great social tension in 
Russia -- which he himself denies. 
  "The pace was too stiff," as one leading official in Bonn 
argued, and it is obviously a "false belief that the market is 
regulating everything in the finest way." New U.S. Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has also recommended "less 
shock, more therapy." One can only hope that the change in the 
government improves the disastrous mood in the country and thus, 
takes the "wind out of the sails" of Zhirinovskiy (Hornhues). 
  Just prevent things from hardening -- that is the motto of 
Bonn's Russia policy. Carefully, but consistently Russia should 
be guided into the market economy with Western aid. 
  At the same time, this dual strategy says, the security 
needs 
of the countries between the NATO area and Russia should be 
contented and their move toward European integration be speeded 
up. A tricky balancing act. 
  Any shift of interest in favor of Moscow upsets Germany's 
neighbors in the immediate East. The Central European countries 
-- from Latvia to the Czech Republic and Croatia -- feel left in 
the lurch by the entire West, anyway. 
  Their drive to get under NATO's military protective umbrella 
quickly is being slowed down by the Western powers. The Eastern 
countries have the impression that the World Bank and the IMF 
are applying double standards: While Warsaw and Prague have to 
fulfill strict conditions, the Russians get what they want. 
  Disappointment about Bonn is greatest among the Poles and 
the 
Balts. Politicians and publishers in Warsaw already see the 
effects of an "appeasement ideology," which might lead to new 
brotherhood between Germans and Russians. 
  Diplomats from Warsaw have noticed with great attention that 
Klaus Kinkel did not contradict his Russian counterpart, 
Kozyrev, who, in late December, enthusiastically spoke of the 
"German-Russian axis." They were also shocked when Kinkel spoke 
out against a Kohl visit to Poland at the moment on the grounds 
that Russia was more important. 
  After the Balts also stepped up their criticism of Bonn's 
allegedly over-friendly attitude toward Moscow, Foreign Minister 
Kinkel invited his counterparts from Latvia, Lithuania, and 
Estonia to Bonn for "consultations." 
  According to staffers of Kohl, the chancellor is "still 
optimistic." Based on the trust in his sauna-companion Yeltsin, 
Kohl ordered in the Cabinet last week that the defense budget be 
cut from the planned DM48.6 billion to DM47.3 billion in "a 
haggle as in an Oriental bazaar" (Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe). Helmut Kohl stressed in public: "I want Boris Yeltsin 
to succeed." 
  Yet, the Federal Government is pursuing an austerity course 
in foreign policy, too. It no longer wants to issue blank 
checks for huge programs. Bonn's purse "is empty," as Kinkel 
put it: "Now it is the others' turn."

<F P=106> [Report signed "ay": "A Long List of Deficiencies in Trade </F>
With the CIS States"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf -- There are many reasons for the 
problematic development of economic cooperation with Russia: a 
shortage of foreign currency on the part of Russian trading 
partners; general political and economic instability; a lack of 
clarity about legal regulations, especially with regard to 
investment; unclear powers and property relations; rising 
inflation; a growing tendency to delay payment and to disregard 
the terms of contracts; and shortcomings in transportation and 
communications. 
  The Bundestag Commission for German Economic Ties with East 
Europe has just produced a report on the results of a poll on 
the development of economic relations with CIS states and former 
Soviet states (a comprehensive report is to be released in the 
spring). 
  What has been established less surprisingly is that of all 
the CIS states, Russia still remains the most important trading 
partner for German exporters. With exports totaling almost 5 
billion German marks [DM], the volume of trade is almost twice 
as high as it is for exports to all the other CIS countries, 
which are considerably below DM2 billion. Russia is followed by 
Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and the Baltic states. On the 
imports side, Russia is of even greater importance: More than 
80 percent of German imports from the CIS come from Russia and 
amount to somewhat more as DM5 billion. 
<H5>  Fewer Problems With the Baltics </H5>
  The poll shows that fewer problems have only been 
encountered 
in trade with Baltic states and some German companies have 
reported that they are satisfied with their Baltic trading 
partners. In the case of all other CIS members states, the 
problems are similar to those experienced in trade with Russia. 
Many companies believe, however, that positive political and 
economic conditions are also lacking in the Baltic states. 
  In contrast to other former Soviet states, assessments of 
Baltic partners in terms of deliveries and payment range from 
satisfactory to good. 
<H5>  Less Readiness To Pay </H5>
  According to the poll, a serious factor in the development 
of 
trade relations with Russia is that Russian partners have become 
much less willing to pay. This applies to almost all partners 
and has in the meantime become the most important factor 
disrupting trade with Russia. There have been cases of payment 
extending over a long period of time, and delays have already 
led to the use of Hermes guarantees. In the case of barter 
trade, there has been a considerable deterioration in the 
quality of goods. 
  An old experience is being confirmed: There is a lack of 
clarity about decisionmaking structures at both company and 
state administration levels. The general trend to 
decentralization is also partially being countered by 
recentralization trends. 
  In the personnel field, the motivation of Russian employees 
is considered high, technical training adequate, and management 
skills low. In almost all countries, it is considered that 
competitors from Western states possess advantages in the form 
of state subsidies or a combination of commercial loans and 
state loans (soft loans) on favorable terms.

<F P=106> [Report signed "lrs": "69 of 72 Votes for Candidate Kohl"] </F>
  [Text] Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, of the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU], was reelected as a candidate to the 
Bundestag for his party in the Ludwigshafen constituency late on 
Friday [21 January] night. 
  Kohl, who is running for Ludwigshafen the sixth time, 
received 69 of the 72 valid votes in the meeting of the 
constituency delegates. Three delegates voted against the CDU 
federal chairman. 
  Kohl's Social Democratic Party [SPD] opponent in the 
constituency is Doris Barnett (40), head of the social 
administrative office in Ludwigshafen, who was nominated in late 
November 1993. In his nomination address to an audience of 300, 
Kohl strongly warned against slackening determination to 
struggle for European unification. Germans would have "to pay 
bitterly" if they wanted to opt out of the unification process. 
  Kohl called for a rethinking process, and said people should 
not expect the level of benefits and rights to continue to rise 
forever. To maintain international competitive strength, 
enterprises in Germany must be made more flexible. The current 
round of wage talks offers an opportunity for this, as can be 
seen by the agreement achieved in the chemical industry.

  [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN)--A meeting of the presidiums of the 
CDU [Christian Democratic Union] and CSU [Christian Social 
Union] began this evening. On his arrival at the venue--CSU 
headquarters in Munich--Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber 
criticized the CDU sister party. The CSU will ask at the 
meeting, which is to deal with preparations for the election 
campaign, "what position" CDU politicians such as Heiner 
Geissler, [Bundestag President] Rita Suessmuth, and Friedbert 
Pflueger, who will "block" decisions by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 
would have, Stoiber said. 
  He has also heard too little about how the CDU intends to 
integrate "the democratic right," Stoiber added. In this 
context, questions must be asked about the consequences of the 
fact that, in the meantime, more than half a million work 
permits have been issued to foreigners. "Unemployment is being 
imported," Stoiber said. 
  Theo Waigel, CSU chairman and federal finance minister, said 
the SPD [Social Democratic Party] was the main opponent in the 
coming election debates and that the FDP [Free Democratic Party] 
was a "competitor." He said the CSU will tell even the CDU what 
it thinks when necessary. CSU General Secretary Erwin Huber 
said he is confident that "a closing of ranks between the CDU 
and CSU" will come about at the meeting.

  [Excerpts] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- In the 1994 election 
campaign, the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] and the CSU 
[Christian Social Union] intend to concentrate on the topics of 
internal and external security, and the securing of Germany as a 
location for business investment. This was announced by CSU 
Chairman Theo Waigel on Monday evening [24 January] after a 
meeting of the CDU and CSU Presidiums in Munich. The current 
president of the Federal Constitutional Court, Roman Herzog, is 
to be nominated as joint candidate for the office of president. 
  CDU Chairman Helmut Kohl decisively rejected speculation 
about a grand coalition. The chancellor said that the intention 
was to continue the coalition with the FDP [Free Democratic 
Party]. Moreover, the voters had a right to know who the SPD 
[Social Democratic Party] would work with after the elections. 
Kohl conceded that there had been mutual criticism at the 
strategy summit of the Union parties [CDU and CSU]. "We are not 
a mutual admiration society in which everyone adores everyone 
else," he said. Waigel stressed before the summit that the 
Union parties see the SPD as their main opponent. [passage 
omitted] 
  Talking about the issue of Europe, the chancellor stressed 
that the CDU wanted to remain the "classical party for Europe." 
There were no ifs and buts in its support for European 
integration. In the European elections it had to be made clear 
to the citizen that peace and freedom could only be lastingly 
secured on the basis of the Maastricht Treaty.

<F P=106> [Report by Eckart Spoo: "Kinkel Comes Out in Clear Support </F>
of Europe"] 
  [Text] Hannover, 23 Jan -- At the Free Democratic Party 
[FDP] meeting of federal representatives to prepare for the 
European elections, FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel discussed the 
reservations against the process of European unification that 
were voiced by Bavarian Minister President Edmund Stoiber, of 
the Christian Social Union [CSU], and of former FDP official 
Manfred Brunner He warned against the assumption that "we 
could be saved again by pursuing a special national course." 
The federal foreign minister emphasized that there was "no 
contradiction" between the national interests of German and 
European integration. On the contrary, the unifying Europe was 
"the right place to enforce vital German interests," Kinkel 
said. In Europe and even beyond Europe Germany is dependent on 
open competition. "Only that way can our economy fully use its 
strength," Kinkel explained. 
  The foreign minister said that another reason why Germany 
needs Europe was that "due to our past, the world is watching us 
closely." He argued that without Europe reconstruction and 
prosperity would not have been possible after 1945. Now Germany 
must safeguard this prosperity together with Europe. Kinkel 
emphasized: "The European Union accounts for 1.3 percent of the 
surface of the earth, 6 percent of its population, but 22 
percent of the international product. There is not much one 
could add to that." 
  It is essential, therefore, to conclude the Economic and 
Monetary Union. Kinkel stressed, however, that the joint 
European currency must be as stable as the German mark -- "or we 
will not have one." 
  At its meeting of representatives, the FDP agreed on the 
principles of its European policy, calling for more 
privatization, flexibility, and a fundamental reform of the 
social and tax system to make Germany more attractive as a 
European center for production and investment. To make sure 
that the European Union is accepted by the people it is 
inevitable that the community has a social dimension, though it 
must be developed "carefully." The establishment of levels for 
social benefits must not go beyond minimum standards. The less 
developed member states must be "given a chance to develop their 
social systems in accordance with their economic possibilities." 
The FDP principles also plead for a "reduction of 
over-regulation" in European environmental policy. 
  The FDP representatives nominated Bundestag deputy Uta 
Wuerfel as their leading candidate for the European elections, 
while Mechthild von Alemann came second.

<F P=106> [Report signed "uhl": "The Temporary Acceptance of Loss of </F>
Real Income"] 
  [Text] In its 1994 annual economic report, the government 
has once again stressed that there has to be an improvement in 
conditions for industry in Germany, the consolidation of public 
finance has to be continued in a determined manner, and there 
have to be further tax reductions to raise competitiveness. 
  So as not to discourage companies from investing, fiscal 
policy must, above all, "dispel the fear" that the increase in 
the budget deficit will lead to a further taxation burden in 
either the short term or long term. Thus, at all state levels, 
there has to be a high degree of "savings and discipline 
regarding expenditure" to gradually reduce the state's share of 
GDP to the same level as in the period before unification by the 
year 2000. 
  The government advises the partners to wage agreements to 
show "moderation" and has stressed its intentions of achieving a 
wage freeze in negotiations with public sector employees. In 
the old laender, a drop in real incomes will have to be accepted 
to improve employment opportunities. An increase in 
productivity should only lead to an increase in real incomes 
when a high level of employment has been achieved once again. 
  In the new laender, it should be borne in mind that economic 
performance will only reach western German levels over a longer 
period of time. A strategy of catching up in economic terms so 
that incomes reach western levels will "increasingly be an 
obstacle to more investment and employment." Wage policy cannot 
bear the entire burden for the process of economic adjustment in 
eastern Germany. It is, however, "imperative and reasonable" for 
wage policy to contribute to closing the gap between wage levels 
and enterprise performance. 
  The government regrets that in western Germany and above all 
in eastern Germany, wage policy currently does not take 
sufficient account of the differences in economic performance in 
terms of sectors and companies. There is much to be said for 
"new directions" in wage policy. So, for example, more freedom 
for companies and plants would provide a meaningful stimulus for 
"more wage policy creativity." Profit sharing could also reduce 
the burden on wages. 
  The partners to collective agreements should consider the 
possibility of concluding agreements covering several years to a 
greater extent than has been the case until now. Agreements 
could, for example, be reached guaranteeing a share of profits 
if earnings develop favorably. 
  Finally, the Federal Government is calling on the partners 
to 
wage agreements to make working hours more flexible to reduce 
company costs and to better satisfy the individual wishes and 
needs of employees and those seeking work. The new labor law 
will thus increase what room for maneuver there is. More 
flexibility in working hours should not, however, be a burden on 
the Federal Office of Employment.

<F P=106> [Report by Otmar Lahodynsky: "Final Spurt to Agriculture"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- The European Union [EU] membership 
negotiations will be continued on 21 January. Solutions 
regarding car component suppliers and the brandy monopoly are in 
the offing. Then the final spurt will begin. 
  Up to four more chapters can be settled in a new round of 
negotiations at the level of ambassadors on 21 January. Thus 17 
of 29 chapters would be checked off for Austria. Once agreement 
is achieved in the areas of competition, free trade in services, 
the customs union, and foreign trade, "we will have our hands 
free for the political finish," said Austria's EU Ambassador, 
Manfred Scheich. 
  In the next round at ministerial level on 8 February, "the 
course must be set for solutions" to the important issues of 
transit traffic, second homes, and agriculture, said Scheich. 
  A solution was found to the problem of Austrian supplies for 
the Japanese automobile sector, which are coupled to import 
quota. The EU Commission is ready to consider this traditional 
agreement between Vienna and Tokyo in the scope of its annual 
negotiations with Japan on import quotas for private cars for 
the whole of the European Union. In the area of competition, 
after the three-year transition period for the tobacco monopoly, 
a one-year transition period has now also been agreed upon for 
the brandy monopoly which must be abolished in the sales area. 
  Agriculture is the largest hurdle in the final heated phase 
of the membership negotiations, which are to be concluded by 
March. Until recently, Vienna did not have a clear position on 
the EU proposal that as soon as Austria is a member, it will 
have to reduce farm prices, and that at the same time, 
compensation will be paid for the farmers through direct income 
subsidies. The new "single market model," which is now being 
discussed among EU member states, no longer envisages price 
adjustments of several years -- as was the case in the past when 
new members were admitted -- by "membership compensation 
payments" being collected for imports and exports of 
agricultural products at the borders. 
  In Vienna, the option was examined to carry out this system 
of price adjustment levies (on imports) and refunds (on exports) 
without border checks, which is preferred by farmers' 
representatives, by way of using trade statistics at home. This 
would mean, however, that during a transition period of several 
years, Austria's consumers would have to continue to pay higher 
food prices than are paid in the other EU member states. 
  The European Union wants to see the losses of Austrian 
farmers compensated for by direct income subsidies. It is not 
yet clear who is supposed to pay. 
  Meanwhile, EU Council Chairman Theodoros Pangalos has said 
he 
does not rule out different membership dates for Austria, 
Finland, Sweden, and Norway. According to Pangalos, the 
European Union, who has also received membership applications 
from Cyprus and Malta, will presumably begin negotiations with 
Cyprus on 1 January 1995.

<F P=106> [Report signed "ett": "Vienna Fixes EU Positions"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna -- At a "government summit" on 19 January, 
Austria's negotiation positions on the three major remaining 
problems -- agriculture, transit traffic, and real estate 
transactions -- were fixed for the negotiations on European 
Union [EU] membership. Officials subsequently told DIE PRESSE 
that consensus was achieved. 
  For agriculture, a "mixed system" is envisaged, containing 
elements of a single market concept and a concept involving 
transition periods. This is considered a defensible compromise 
variant. 
  There is also agreement on the settlement of transit 
traffic. 
Austria intends to accept the "environment-friendly" EC demand 
that bilateral transit traffic, which was originally not 
considered for the ecological point system, will now be taken 
into account. Austria now also intends to get a mixed model for 
the real estate issue (second home) accepted in the membership 
negotiations. 
<H5>  Regulation of Regional Planning </H5>
  Specifically, this mixed model is a combination consisting 
of 
a regional planning regulation (including the ban of second 
homes through the dedication of land) and a regulation of real 
estate transactions (so that dedicated construction ground 
cannot be used for second homes). 
  In an interview with DIE PRESSE, foreign policy spokesman 
Andreas Khol of the Austrian People's Party [OeVP] said he 
assumes that "another great breakthrough" will be achieved at 
the EC Council of Ministers' meetings on 6 and 7 February. Then 
only "a few hard nuts" would still have to be cracked. 
  In addition to Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, Vice Chancellor 
Erhard Busek, Foreign Minister Alois Mock, and State Secretary 
Brigitte Ederer, Ministers Fischer, Lacina, Klima, and Weiss 
also took part in the detailed two-hour discussion on European 
Union. 
  In an interview with DIE PRESSE, Chancellor Vranitzky said 
regarding the EU time schedule that the government believes 
there is a "good" chance of completing the membership 
negotiations by March. Austria was trying to keep to this goal, 
said Vranitzky. Regarding the touchy problems that were still 
open, it would not have been necessary to agree on a common 
language: "We know anyway what we want." 
  In any case, the chancellor said in the interview, 
government 
contacts with EU member states would now be increased at the 
bilateral level. He will go to Athens on 26 January, because 
Greece is currently holding the presidency. Mock will be more 
active at the foreign ministers' level, said Vranitzky. 
  President Thomas Klestil said in a NEWS interview that a 
delay in the EU negotiations would be "regrettable, but not a 
tragedy." He said he believed, however, a referendum in June 
and a conclusion of the negotiations with the EU in March would 
be possible. He said, prior to the referendum, he would make 
his position very clear and would "comment very clearly on the 
pros and cons of the European Union." 
  The EU membership negotiations were also the focus of a 
statement made by Foreign Minister Alois Mock (OeVP) in 
parliament on 19 January. He said, if both sides really wanted 
it, the EU negotiations could be concluded by March. Austria 
would make "every effort" to achieve this. Mock: "It is a 
chance we are trying to take. We will see whether we will be 
successful." However, the government would in any case be 
guided by the principle that the negotiation result is important. 
  According to the foreign minister, the most difficult 
problems are related to agriculture, transit traffic, and second 
homes. But he was optimistic that they would be solved. Mock 
also made clear, however, that in the agricultural area, the 
financing problem could not be borne by Austria alone. 
Regarding real estate transactions, it was indispensable to 
protect housing requirements for the local people by 
restrictions in connection with the acquisition of second homes. 
<H5>  Mock Praises NATO Proposal </H5>
  The foreign minister also dealt with the Partnership for 
Peace concept offered by NATO to all CSCE members. He said that 
this initiative, which implied a possibility for countries to 
make use of it in an individual way, was of particularly great 
importance for the Central and East European countries that are 
currently in a security policy vacuum. Since the stability of 
these countries is extremely relevant to Austria, Partnership 
for Peace would also have a favorable and important impact on 
Austria, said Mock. Austria welcomed this initiative, but was 
seeking security in integration within the EU, which also 
implied its "docking with the Western European Union."

<F P=106> [By Gavin Cordon, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Text] Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind today confirmed 
that Britain may pull its troops out of Bosnia in the summer. 
He said the withdrawal of the 2,500-strong British contingent 
serving with the UN Protection Force was being seriously 
considered by the Government. However, speaking on LWT's 
[expansion unknown] Walden programme, he stressed that no 
decision had yet been reached. 
  His comments would appear to go further than those of 
Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd who, on a visit last week to the British 
UN force, said simply that no decision on withdrawal was 
"imminent." 
  Mr. Rifkind said British troops had helped saved tens of 
thousands of lives and any withdrawal move would be taken only 
in conjuction with Britain's UN partners. "It is certainly an 
option that countries -- not just the United Kingdom -- are 
having to look at very seriously," he said. "There are very 
powerful arguments both for staying in Bosnia and there are some 
powerful arguments for withdrawing." 
  He denied that his comments were intended to prepare the 
ground for a decision to pull out that had already been taken. 
"We are certainly indicating the possibility that that may be 
the sensible thing to do, but that reflects the reality of what 
has happened over the last year or so," he said. 
  "We have not even taken any view in principle as to the 
desirability of withdrawal. What we have said is that the 
circumstances are deteriorating -- the situation has got more 
difficult. On several occasions we thought there was a 
possibility of peace between the various warring factions that 
would enable the situation to begin to materially improve but 
that is not happening. 
  "It is therefore inevitable that the countries do begin to 
address the question as to where the balance of our moral duty 
-- as well as our political common sense -- lies." 
  He said the UN operation had been successful in terms of 
distributing aid to thousands of people who would otherwise have 
starved to death. "At a humanitarian level, the UN has been 
more successful in Bosnia than in probably any other civil war 
in recent years around the world," he said. "It is for that 
reason one can't simply rush to the judgment that withdrawal 
must be the option to pursue." 
  However, there was an argument that the UN's presence was 
prolonging the conflict by enabling protagonists, who would 
otherwise be forced to seek peace, to carry on fighting. 
  "If we came to the sad but undeniable judgment that the UN 
presence was actually prolonging the war then obviously the 
course of action we would have to follow would then become much 
clearer," he said. 
  In reaching a decision, the Government would have to 
consider 
whether troops were still able to carry out their mandate to 
distribute aid and whether the risk to British forces was still 
"acceptable." 
  Mr. Rifkind defended Lord Owen's role as the European 
Union's 
mediator in Bosnia, following the European Parliament vote that 
he should be replaced. 
  "I don't think anyone could fault the commitment, the 
dedication and the integrity that Lord Owen has shown during the 
period that he has been the mediator," he said. 
  "On one or two occasions it has looked as if he might almost 
have been able to pull off a settlement but what has become 
sadly obvious is that at this moment in time the will of the 
three factions in the fighting is not in favour of reaching a 
settlement." 
  Later, Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said it would 
be 
"unthinkable" for Britain to pull out of Bosnia unilaterally and 
cause the humanitarian operation to collapse. 
  But he told the BBC TV On The Record programme that it was 
quite possible, once the spring offensive got under way that 
"the only thing left to us will be to withdraw". 
  He said: "Mr Major might like to reflect that he is not 
going to be left out of the opprobrium. Here is a Conservative 
Prime Minister who devalued the pound, raised tax more than 
Labour and whose total failure of policy has led to British 
military withdrawal. 
  "I have always said that if we did not act, and act 
strongly, 
then at the end of the day we would have no action to take but 
to withdraw. Any action we now take is more dangerous and more 
risky than if we had taken it two years ago."

  [Text] Rome, Jan 21 (AFP) -- Italian Interior Minister 
Nicola Mancino tendered his resignation Friday [21 January] over 
a scandal involving secret service funds but saw the offer 
rejected by Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, officials said. 
  Mancino offered to quit saying that Rome prosecutors had 
gathered documents which could lead to his being investigated in 
connection with the Sisde (intelligence service) affair 
involving corruption in the funding of the secret services. 
  The documents in question had been sent to the three 
investigating judges who could launch legal proceedings against 
him, officials said. 
  But Ciampi said in a statement that he had "full confidence" 
in Mancino, adding that the transfer of documents for 
consideration by the judges "is an obligatory measure, which 
does not constitute a formal charge." 
  Mancino was implicated in the Sisde affair along with three 
former interior ministers, including current Italian President 
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, by former members of the secret services.

  [Text] Oslo, Jan 21 (AFP) -- Palestine Liberation 
Organisation (PLO) chairman Yasir 'Arafat arrived in Oslo Friday 
evening [21 January] to attend Saturday's funeral of Norwegian 
Foreign Minister Johan Joergen Holst. 
  'Arafat was met at Oslo's Fornebu airport by Foreign 
Ministry 
advisors Terje Rod Larsen and Mona Juul and Norwegian PLO 
representative Omar Kitmitto. He was sombre on his arrival. 
  "I have come to say good-bye to a good friend," was his only 
comment upon his arrival at the SAS Scandinavia Hotel where a 
large gathering of Norwegian and international journalists 
greeted him. 
  Holst helped broker the Palestine-Israel peace deal last 
year 
in a series of secret meetings in Norway. He died last week of 
a stroke at the age of 56. 
  The PLO leader will also hold talks with Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shimon Peres and US Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher during his stay in Oslo in a bid to resolve the 
stalemate plaguing the Middle East peace process. 
  Israel and the PLO have reached deadlock in their 
negotiations on border crossings between the Gaza Strip and 
Egypt and between Jericho and Jordan. They also disagree on the 
size of the proposed autonomous city of Jericho. 
  On Friday evening 'Arafat was due to meet with Peres who 
arrived earlier in the day. No talks are planned for Saturday 
as Peres must respect the Sabbath and not work. Christopher was 
also expected to arrive in Oslo late Friday.

<F P=106> [Lionel Barber report: "Brittan Warns on Protectionism"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU [European 
Union] trade negotiator, yesterday said that moves to put 
environmental protection and labour standards at the top of the 
agenda for future world trade talks could be a pretext for 
protectionism. 
  Cautioning against "fashionable and politically correct" 
solutions to trade problems, Sir Leon distanced himself from 
recent suggestions made by U.S. President Bill Clinton during 
his maiden trip to Europe as head of state. 
  In an address to the Centre for European Policy Studies one 
month after the successful conclusion of the GATT Uruguay round, 
the senior British commissioner also warned the U.S. against the 
use of unilateralism in trade disputes, and against 
strengthening retaliatory powers under Section 301 of the U.S. 
Trade Act. 
  "The U.S. will have to understand that it has committed 
itself to the multilateral process that I have described however 
tempting domestic policy considerations may be to resort to 
unilateral action." 
  His words may irritate the Clinton administration, which has 
pledged to be "even tougher" in tackling unfair trading 
practices in the post-Uruguay round era. It may also raise 
hackles in the U.S. Congress, which is due to consider 
ratification of the Gatt accord this year. 
  In his speech, Sir Leon described the agreement last month 
as 
just as significant as the creation of the GATT itself in 1947. 
It provided a new framework for open trade in services, a clear 
timetable for resolution of trade disputes, significantly lower 
tariffs in industrial products, and a binding agreement to 
reduce subsidies and protection in farm products. "It is more 
difficult for the law of the jungle to prevail," he said. 
  Before leaving for talks in Brussels with Mr Peter 
Sutherland, director-general of GATT, Sir Leon added that it was 
important to produce better offers on market access before the 
February 15 deadline. 
  He singled out Japan as needing to improve offers on white 
spirits and liqueurs, though Tokyo has countered that the EU and 
U.S. deal on agriculture and offers on electronics is also 
unsatisfactory. 
  On labour standards, Sir Leon expressed concern that it 
could 
lead the EU into unprofitable arguments over human rights and 
could be hard to administer. He also noted that the agreements 
attached to the NAFTA free-trade agreement by the U.S., Canada 
and Mexico provided only for signatories to apply their own 
rules rather than impose standards from the outside.

<F P=106> [Article by Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor of the </F>
exchequer: "The Tories Lied About Taxation"] 
  [Text] As April approaches, not only are taxes going up, 
but all trust in a Conservative Government on matters of 
taxation has broken down. As the typical family prepares to pay 
an extra 10 pounds a week, rising to 16 pounds next year, the 
full extent of the Tory tax deceit is becoming apparent. The 
typical British family is now paying more of its income in tax 
than in 1979. By focusing attention on the headline rate of 
income tax, Mr Major and his ministers thought they could get 
away with freezing tax allowances, lowering tax thresholds and 
cutting mortgage tax relief. They even thought that they could 
obscure the doubling of VAT [value-added tax] since 1979 and a 
50 per cent rise in National Insurance. The attempt has failed. 
The facts are out. 
  The Conservatives will never be trusted on tax again. In 
1988, George Bush famously called on American electors to "Read 
my lips: No new taxes." Taxes rose once and he was never 
trusted again. In 1992, John Major told people to read his 
manifesto commitment not to increase tax. Now taxes are set to 
rise--not just once, but in 20 separate ways over the next two 
years. Mr Major will never be trusted again. 
  Both the tax rises themselves and the sense of betrayal will 
get worse. When Labour left office, 34.75 per cent of national 
income was taken in tax. This year, tax will take 35.5 per 
cent, rising to 37 per cent next year, 37.5 the year after and 
38.5 per cent by 1998. Never again can the Tories claim to be 
the low tax party, or that they have an "instinct" for low 
taxation, when they have had to admit that in every year until 
the brink of the next century, taxation will take more and more 
of national income. 
  Almost all of us are now paying for the Government's 
mistakes. Families on half average income have seen an increase 
in the share of this taken in tax, and so have families whose 
income is twice the average. Even families which have benefited 
from cuts in top rate income tax--those on four times average 
income, nearly 80,000 pounds a year--will be paying more than 
they did in 1979. 
  The only beneficiaries of Conservative tax policies have 
been 
a tiny minority very close to the Tory party. The top I per 
cent, earning more than 120,000 pounds a year, received 30 per 
cent of the tax cuts in the big handout of 1988. Only a 
fraction of that is being taken back. It is still possible for 
someone earning 1 million pounds a year to pay virtually no tax 
at all. But because this tiny minority pays less, the rest of 
us have to do more. 
  Yet Tory tax-cutting promises were not incidental 
commitments, the accidental result of casual remarks in the heat 
of the election campaign. The tax promises were the centrepiece 
of the Tories' political strategy and their attack on Labour. 
They were the cornerstone of Mr Major's attempt to secure 
re-election, and they are at the heart of the question of 
integrity in politics. 
  In 1992, Mr Major promised that "we have no plans and no 
need 
to extend the scope of VAT." He now claims his statements were 
to be taken as aspirations, rather than undertakings. Yet the 
evidence is against him. For he also categorically stated 
"there will be no VAT increase." His party even issued a 
special campaign briefing which said that "following a series of 
unfounded and irresponsible scares by the Labour Party, the 
Prime Minister has confirmed that the Government has no 
intention of raising VAT further." 
  The promises given on national insurance and income tax 
were, 
if anything, even more explicit. The Tory party chairman called 
national insurance rises "a backdoor stealth tax," while Michael 
Portillo said that "higher tax and national insurance would hit 
those who work harder and do overtime." 
  It was not only that Mr Major promised not to raise income 
tax. He went far further. He promised that he would cut it 
"year on year." 
  The Government now claims that circumstances changed. But 
when Norman Lamont was asked at the election whether he would 
increase taxes, he replied: "We will not have to increase taxes. 
I cannot see any circumstances in which that will be necessary." 
  What annoys people is a Conservative Government making 
promises one year and refusing even to acknowledge breaking them 
the next. The Prime Minister's "back to basics,'" if it were to 
mean anything, should mean telling the truth, and there can be 
little sympathy for a Government that simply refuses to do what 
it asks of the rest of the public: to be honest in its 
promises, to face up to the consequences of its commitments and 
to understand the difference between right and wrong. 
  Tax is the cash nexus between people and government. Trust 
is therefore essential. The Tory deception is therefore 
betrayal of a central trust. 
  A new confidence needs to be established between people and 
government on tax, a confidence the Conservatives are incapable 
of achieving. The Labour party has made it clear that it will 
not tax for taxation's sake. There will be no sleight of hand. 
By linking the benefits that people receive to the taxes they 
are charged, we will show what they are getting for what they 
are paying. And Labour--unlike the Tories on VAT--will be fair 
in its approach. 
  Honest disclosure, full consultation, open debate and full 
accountability for how money is spent are the means to 
reestablish trust between government and electorate. Only 
Labour can do that now.

<F P=106> [Gianluca Luzi report: "2000 Attend Christening of </F>
`Demo-Centrists'"] 
  [Excerpts] Rome -- [passage omitted] The Democratic 
Christian Center [CCD] was established at Rome's exhibition 
center yesterday morning. It comprises the former Christian 
Democrats who did not join Mino Martinazzoli's People's Party 
and who will seek an alliance with the League and Berlusconi to 
contest the elections. With [National Alliance Secretary] Fini, 
too? Maybe. In the South, very probably. 
  Only 24 hours and a few kilometers separated the birth of 
the 
People's Party from that of the CCD, but the differences are 
very sharp. 
  "Who are these people?" Casini asked delightedly, surrounded 
by his fans. "They are Christian Democratic supporters," he 
replied triumphantly. "I am very optimistic because, though it 
is true that Martinazzoli and Bindi have been followed by the 
sector of the Catholic world that looks to the left, we still 
have all the rest." Including those who voted for the right in 
the local elections. Those who voted for Fini in Rome and whom 
the center wants to claim, under the new symbol of the sail with 
a tricolor band and the crossed shield. It is there on the 
CCD's new symbol, too but, perhaps to avoid legal problems with 
the People's Party, it lacks the word, "libertas," it is blue, 
and the cross is white. 
  "Never with the PDS" [Democratic Party of the Left], 
Ombretta 
Fumagalli proclaimed, and the audience rewarded her with lengthy 
applause. "This," Andreotti's former heir apparent in Milan 
went on, "both before and after the elections; and we say `no' 
to any kind of institutional government, because that would mean 
a government with Occhetto." Rosy Bindi is their bete noire. 
"In the past six months," Casini said, "in the DC [Christian 
Democratic Party] there has been not only a necessary cleansing 
operation and change of leadership. There has also been an 
outright genetic mutation of our identity. The party was 
entrusted to a limited sector of Catholic associationism that 
has always had a distorted perception of the left." Alberto 
Alessi, one of the 23 former DC deputies who opted for the 
Center, expressed this concept crudely: "Bindi stands with 
respect to the People's Party as Lorena Bobbit does with respect 
to her husband." And there is nobody now who does not know what 
Lorena Bobbit did to her husband. 
  The left-wing cartel is the enemy to be defeated in the 
elections, but the real adversary is Martinazzoli -- "Bindi's 
hostage." It is the People's Party leader's strategy that is 
criticized, of course: "Isolation is not neutral now; it 
contributes to the victory of the left. Isolation is an option 
that leads toward [PDS Secretary] Occhetto." The CCD, however, 
presents itself as "something new on Italy's political scene: 
There is no other national force," Francesco D'Onofrio said, 
"that is liberal-democratic, federalist, and presidentialist. 
This permits us to pursue a strategy of alliances for the 
Second Republic." 
  Yesterday the Democratic Christian Center began this 
venture. 
Mastella promised a battle: "Many friends in the People's Party 
have been telling me recently: Let us not harm each other in 
the elections; let us seek a technical agreement. But we reject 
any such possibility. We will field candidates wherever 
possible, including in the North with the League and Rooting for 
Italy." What about with the MSI [Italian Social Movement] in 
the South? "We shall see. Their political stance is evolving." 
A real war, then. And soon a war will be waged over the 
inheritance. "We are paying for everything out of our own 
pockets, including the rent on this room," Casini pointed out. 
Carlo Giovanardi, a deputy, warned: "I am not moving out of my 
DC office in Modena. Just like them."

  [Text] A new round of consultations on the Cyprus issue 
was inaugurated in Nicosia today with the aim of promoting the 
confidence-building measures [CBM's]. Joe Clark, the UN 
secretary general's representative on the Cyprus issue, and 
Gustave Feissel, UN secretary general's acting representative, 
met with President Glavkos Kliridhis this morning. The meeting, 
which lasted almost two hours, was attended by UNFICYP [UN 
Forces in Cyprus] political adviser John Paul Kavanagh, on 
behalf of the United Nations, and by Foreign Minister Alekos 
Mikhailidhis, Deputy Minister to President Pandelis Kouros, and 
government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis. 
  In a statement after the meeting, Joe Clark avoided 
commenting on the contents of Rauf Denktas' letter on the CBM's. 
Asked if Rauf Denktas accepts the CBM's, the UN official 
avoided giving a straight answer but said that he is obliged to 
discuss the Turkish Cypriot leader's letter with both President 
Kliridhis and Mr. Denktas and would only comment on it 
afterward. Asked by a CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] 
correspondent whether he agrees with President Kliridhis' 
position that discussions on the substance of the Cyprus issue 
should be conducted at the same time, Mr. Clark said that he had 
always thought that the CBM's cannot be an end in themselves. 
Joe Clark said finally that he would not like to comment on 
anything before he meets with the leaders of both communities. 
  Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis, in a statement 
after the meeting, said that Mr. Clark had handed President 
Kliridhis a copy of Mr. Denktas' letter. The spokesman added: 
President Kliridhis told Mr. Clark that he remains ready to 
discuss ways to implement the CBM's when the Turkish sides 
clearly accepts in principle the UN Secretary General's three 
documents. As for the concern expressed publicly by Rauf 
Denktas that security problems will increase because of the 
CBM's, President Kliridhis told Mr. Clark that security problems 
probably do exist, especially for our side, and that if Denktas 
insists on it these questions can be discussed. Mr. Kasoulidhis 
concluded: As you know, President Kliridhis has already made a 
proposal for demilitarization.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 24 (AFP) -- The European Community 
launched its second "democracy programme" here Monday [24 
January] to fund the activities of non-governmental 
organisations in East Europe and the former Soviet Union. 
  The EC's executive European Commission said ECU12 million 
(13 
million dollars) would be made available to such organisations 
as trade unions, media bodies and human rights monitoring 
organisations. 
  To be eligible, they must work with similar bodies in the 
European Community on projects to "promote the concept of 
democratic societies governed by the rule of law and the 
expressed wishes of free citizens," an EC official said. 
  The first pilot democracy programme, launched in 1992, 
attracted 350 applications for a share of ECU5 million (5.5 
million dollars). Some 52 projects from East Europe were 
finally selected. 
  The second programme for which applications are now being 
invited has been expanded to include countries of the former 
Soviet Union. A third and larger programme is expected to be 
announced later this year.

<F P=106> [Renaud Girard report: "Red Carpet for Qian Qichen"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The French Government of cohabitation did 
everything in its power for Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen 
who arrived in Paris on Saturday [22 January] morning for a 
three-day official visit. 
  The man who has the rank of vice premier in Beijing had 
access to all hierarchical levels of French diplomatic 
decisionmaking: The Elysee [presidential residence] and then 
the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] the day before yesterday, 
and the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office] this morning. 
In addition, to complete the success of his visit, Mr. Qian 
Qichen will give a luncheon at his embassy in avenue George-V 
for U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, himself on an 
official visit to Paris. 
  Saturday's talks were "constructive and positive, in a very 
warm atmosphere," according to the Chinese delegation spokesman. 
In diplomatic language, when the expression "frank exchange of 
views" is not used it means that no unpleasant subject was 
raised. The Tibet, Hong Kong, and Taiwan questions were not 
raised. 
  With regard to respect for human rights in China, the French 
leaders showed much greater discretion than they had four or 
five years ago, the time when the republic invited the students 
who had escaped from the Tienanmen Square massacre and the 
ensuing police repression to hold a march on the Champs-Elysees. 
  [French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe, for whom "France does 
not use double-talk," nonetheless expressed the hope that 
China's economic progress will be accompanied by progress in the 
sphere of human rights. [passage omitted] 
  During a wide-ranging "review" of major international 
issues, 
Mr. Juppe and Mr. Qian Qichen discussed the situation in Bosnia 
at length. The Chinese minister must not have been particularly 
embarrassed, because Beijing, despite its seat as a permanent 
member of the UN Security Council, has always carefully kept out 
of the numerous abortive Western attempts to end the Serbian 
aggression against Sarajevo. 
  The former Yugoslavia is a very long way from China for 
which 
the best policy in the Balkans is still abstention. 
Nonetheless, the French minister expressed the hope that the 
big powers will be more committed to supporting the Twelve's 
plan for Bosnia -- which is consistent with the Owen-Stoltenberg 
UN plan for a partition of the young republic into three 
ethnically homogeneous areas. 
  The UN Security Council is a real possible sphere of 
agreement for Chinese and French foreign policy. According to a 
French official, the two ministers "agreed that a reform of the 
Council was necessary to take account of the changes which have 
taken place in the world since 1945, but that, at the same time, 
it was necessary to maintain the current status of the permanent 
members." Indeed, without daring to say it openly, France and 
China are opposed to the expansion of the Council to new 
permanent members. 
  Beijing has no desire to see Tokyo -- its hereditary enemy 
and rival -- gaining political influence equivalent to its own. 
Paris (like London) has always given a cool reception to the 
idea of giving up its right of veto to a Europe whose political 
efficacy still has to be demonstrated. It is therefore probably 
in New York that the first fruits of the Franco-Chinese 
"normalization" will be produced.

  [Text] Madrid, Jan 21 (AFP) -- Britain, Germany, Italy and 
Spain agreed here Friday [21 January] to cut the costs of their 
jointly-developed Eurofighter project by 30 percent, the Spanish 
defence ministry said. 
  The heads of the respective air forces which signed the 
accord at the Toreejon air force base near here confirmed their 
support for talks currently under way with the manufacturers to 
reduce the price of each aircraft. 
  The Eurofighter project, a lighter version of the original 
European Combat Aircraft, was launched in December 1992 in the 
wake of defence budget cuts and changing requirements after the 
end of the Cold War. 
  The aircraft is being funded 37.5 percent by Britain, 3O 
percent by Germany, 19.5 percent by Italy and 13 percent by 
Spain.

<F P=106> [Jose Maria Brunet and Josep Gisbert report: "Rubalcaba </F>
Tells Pujol That He Will Be Received by Gonzalez `When He 
Wishes'"] 
  [Text] Madrid, Barcelona -- Minister of the Prime 
Minister's Office Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told Generalitat 
[Catalan autonomous government] premier Jordi Pujol the evening 
before last that he will be received by Prime Minister Felipe 
Gonzalez at the Moncloa Palace "when he wishes." Pujol said in 
reply to the minister that this meeting is not opportune right 
now, and told him that he deems it essential first to restore 
cohesion within CiU [Convergence and Union]. The brief 
conversation between the two political leaders took place in a 
room at the Ritz Hotel in Madrid, where the Generalitat premier 
had just presented the Blanquerna Prize to Fernando Lazaro 
Carreter. 
<H5>  Political Asset </H5>
  Rubalcaba was present at the ceremony with the aim of 
conveying to Pujol the idea that the government acknowledges his 
full authority as interlocutor on behalf of the Catalan 
nationalist coalition. In short, this is a gesture aimed at the 
Generalitat chairman not with a formal or institutional purpose 
but in order to intimate to him that the government regards his 
leadership of CiU as a political asset to be preserved. 
  In fact, Pujol took it this way, and, according to his 
colleagues, felt pleased at the explicit support given to him by 
the government as an interlocutor overall, and especially on 
such an essential point in his political program as be believes 
linguistic normalization to be. In this connection, the Catalan 
premier viewed the presence of two ministers -- Rubalcaba 
himself and Education Minister Gonzalo Suarez Pertierra -- at 
the Blanquerna Prize presentation ceremony also as an expression 
of support against those who criticize his conduct in the 
matter, so that, in the opinion of those close to him, "he felt 
bolstered in the sense that the presence of the government 
representatives and of other officials, such as Congress [of 
Deputies] Speaker Felix Pons, represented support for not 
allowing himself to be intimidated by those who question the 
Generalitat's linguistic policy." 
  In government circles it is believed that the meeting will 
take place soon, despite Pujol's reservations about meeting with 
the prime minister now because of the tensions in CiU. In any 
event, the same circles respect the strategy which the Catalan 
nationalist coalition leader wishes to employ in order to 
reestablish his authority: Hence Rubalcaba's "when he wishes," 
uttered in the double sense that Pujol could go to the Moncloa 
Palace tomorrow or postpone it until he sees fit. The 
hypothesis mooted in CiU circles is that the meeting could take 
place at the beginning of February, by which time it is believed 
that the coalition will have fully recovered its internal 
cohesion -- something that could be resolved this very week -- 
although the Generalitat premier's wish is to hold the meeting 
with the utmost discretion in order to avoid the external 
pressure which would otherwise be applied to his negotiating 
process with Gonzalez. 
  In addition, the government wishes to act cautiously in 
CiU's 
crisis, without doing anything that could add further elements 
of tension. In this connection, Democratic Union of Catalonia 
has proof that, during the budget debate, the government tried 
to meet its demands without jeopardizing the overall dialogue 
with the coalition, and its aim now is also that relations with 
CiU should operate very smoothly again.

<F P=106> [Article by Arto Astikainen: "Relative Strengths Reversed </F>
Again: Proponents of EU Membership More Than Opponents"] 
  [Text] The relative strengths of proponents and opponents 
regarding EU (European Union) membership in Finland have again 
swung in the opposite direction. While in November the opponents 
of EU membership appeared to be for the first time slightly 
greater in number than opponents, at the end of December 
supporters have climbed back with a narrow lead. 
  According to a poll conducted in December by Suomen Gallup 
Oy, 42 percent of Finnish voters supported EU membership and 35 
percent opposed it. Twenty-three percent refused to state a 
position. In November, supporters were 36 percent and opponents 
41 percent. 
  The Suomen Gallup poll, which was commissioned by Helsinki 
ILTA SANOMAT, was conducted through telephone interviews between 
Christmas and New Year's Day. The number responding was around 
2,000. 
  They were asked whether Finland should become a member or 
remain outside of the EU. 
  Those who did not express a stand were asked to still try 
and 
consider what position they favored. In this manner, the 
proportion of those with no opinion dropped from 23 percent to 
14 percent. At the same time, the percentage of supporters rose 
to 46 percent and opponents to 40 percent. 
  If the percentages are calculated using only the for or 
against responses, 53 percent of respondents supported 
membership in the EU and 47 percent opposed it. 
  At the time of the November poll, a lively debate was taking 
place in Finland regarding the EU Commission's stand on 
Finland's goals for its agriculture. The Commission was regarded 
as acting negatively to Finland's wishes. During the time the 
December survey was being conducted, this discussion of 
agriculture issues had already died down. Coming to the fore 
then were such events as the strong showing of Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy in the Russian elections.

<F P=106> [Article by Jan Syse, Nordic Council president: "Brussels, </F>
the Baltic, and Nordic Cooperation"] 
  [Text] The activities of the Nordic Council this past year 
have shown anything but the attitude of "Stop the world, I want 
to get off." In both word and deed, the organization has 
demonstrated that it does not merely want to remain on the 
political scene, but also that it has a role to play. 
  To be sure, this year there have also been such turbulent 
political developments on the North European continent that it 
is difficult to keep up as both observer and actor. The 
elections in the Baltics and Poland, the attempted coup and 
elections in Russia, the complicated process involved in 
concluding the Maastricht treaty, and the repeated postponement 
of the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement have dominated the 
political agenda and demanded great attention from the 
politicians and the press. 
  The most important task of the Nordic Council for now is to 
serve as an arena for the strong forces that are seeking a 
uniform Nordic position toward the EC. A solid majority in the 
council, with the exception of the Norwegian opposition group, 
wants full membership for Finland, Sweden, and Norway. It is 
just as clear that the overwhelming majority would not like to 
see each country go its own way. As a result, simultaneous 
referendums in all three countries would be an absurdity or even 
a catastrophe and could increase the risk of a permanent rift 
among the Nordic countries, unless the combined results would be 
decisive for all three countries. That might be considered 
genuine Nordic solidarity, but it is not particularly realistic. 
  What, then, has the Nordic Council accomplished this year? 
  Because the prime ministers decided a year ago to take 
greater responsibility for promoting cooperation--a decision 
long called for by parliamentarians--we now have clearer 
priorities for the areas of cooperation that are to be on the 
agenda. The governments decided to concentrate on cultural 
issues, environmental cooperation, and trade policy. This is 
reflected in the Nordic Council's 1994 budget, which was adopted 
at the session in Mariehamn last fall. 
  The prioritizing of cultural cooperation in the budget is 
both correct and important, but it must not allow us to overlook 
the other important aspects of Nordic cooperation today. 
  Foreign policy issues have given the council new vitality, 
even though these issues have no impact on the budget. 
Environmental issues in and around the Nordic countries are of 
vital significance, as demonstrated by the Nordic Council's 
major international conference on the Arctic, held in Reykjavik 
last fall. The council has also taken the initiative with 
respect to the Sosnoviy Bor power plant in St. Petersburg. New 
initiatives will also be taken in these areas. 
  At the Mariehamn session, the council held a broad debate 
over what we in the Nordic countries can do together to 
stimulate new growth, thereby creating new jobs and more faith 
in the future among individuals. The finance ministers will 
propose concrete measures well before the next session (this 
March in Stockholm). Then, in April, the council will bring 
together representatives of the governments, parliamentarians, 
researchers, and labor market representatives to continue this 
work. A successful campaign against unemployment is a 
prerequisite for maintaining confidence in our democratic and 
social systems and for stopping the racism that is beginning to 
develop in our countries. 
  The Nordic Council became a pillar of support for the 
liberation of the Baltic nations at a very early stage. We have 
received grateful recognition of this from Baltic politicians. 
Now the three Baltic nations are developing a system of 
cooperation similar to that of the Nordic Council. The center of 
this cooperation is an advisory parliamentary assembly, the 
Baltic Assembly, but it has now been decided that the 
governments will be drawn into this organization, which will be 
given the name Baltic Council. 
  The parallels to our own organization are striking. 
  From the very beginning, we have had a cooperative agreement 
with the Baltic Assembly. I have personally participated in all 
three sessions held so far by the Baltic Assembly. There is 
reason to be impressed and happy over the way in which it is 
approaching its work. It is a victory for democracy. 
  But there are still Russian troops in Estonia and Latvia, 
and 
the Nordic Council is strongly pressuring Russia to withdraw 
them quickly. The outcome of the elections in Russia merely 
emphasizes how important this is. 
  Our involvement in northwestern Russia also increased during 
the past year. The environmental threat gives us particular 
cause to direct our attention at these areas, but we must also 
utilize the opportunity to stimulate a better and more 
coordinated development of trade. 
  Of course, the main thrust of our non-Nordic activities is 
aimed at the EC and the EEA. The council is in contact with the 
European Parliament at many levels, forming a valuable 
compliment to the direct, bilateral contacts between countries. 
  It is interesting, by the way, that in our contacts with 
politicians from other European organizations we have found that 
they are placing more and more emphasis on the significance the 
Nordic Council can and should have as an actor in Northern 
Europe and the Baltic region. These are relatively new signals 
that are a clear result of the regionalization and 
decentralization that we are seeing in the EC, for example. I 
believe that this application of the principle of geographic and 
functional proximity in European cooperation will become more 
prevalent in the months and years to come. In this case, it will 
become increasingly important to have an established forum for 
the exchange of political opinions on European issues that are 
related to the Nordic countries. We of the Nordic Council 
Presidium have taken up this challenge this year. 
  Clearly, this "foreign policy" activity by the council 
cannot 
occur in a political vacuum. Obviously, it is guided by the main 
principles set forth by the Nordic governments and national 
assemblies, but it is also dependent on the changed 
international climate in Europe. 
  In this connection, I would like to mention the situation 
that has arisen in Russia following the parliamentary elections. 
Although Boris Yeltsin still has executive power and expanded 
authority through the new Constitution, the political landscape 
of our powerful neighbor has changed. This affects us, as well. 
As German Count Lambsdorff so aptly put it, Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy of the so-called Liberal Democratic Party is 
neither liberal nor democratic. He has ambitions and views that 
must give rise to reflection and caution in the West. The Iron 
Curtain is gone, but the uncertainty remains. We in the north 
must realize that close cooperation not only with one another, 
but with the rest of West Europe, is the key to future security 
in a changing Europe. While the situation in East Europe is as 
unstable as it unfortunately is, we must at least make sure we 
stabilize the factors we can control. EC membership is one such 
factor we can make use of if we want and dare to do so. If we 
miss this opportunity, then isolation and insecurity here in the 
north could increase considerably, particularly if Norway is the 
only Nordic country (apart from Iceland) left outside the EC. 
  Nordic cooperation, particularly in the economic field, 
cannot be genuine cooperation because we are so similar. Quite 
simply, the Nordic nations do not compliment one another. This 
is also why there was no Nordec [as published]. 
  Together, in the EC, we could be a significant factor that 
could complement and enrich the rest of Europe. This applies to 
the security, economic, and cultural spheres. My vision, which I 
share with many in the Nordic Council, is a strong Nordic region 
within Europe. As I have said so often before, albeit in another 
context, we must hang together, or we will hang separately. 
  In conclusion, let me add that the Maastricht treaty states 
that regional councils shall exist within the framework of EC 
cooperation. Here in the Nordic region, we already have such a 
council: the Nordic Council. Consequently, the Nordic Council 
will not cease to exist if we join the EC. On the contrary, it 
will be a forum that can prosper in cooperation with other, 
similar councils within what has been called the "Europe of 
regions." 
  Based on the examples mentioned here and as a general 
evaluation of the Nordic Council's work, I can state with 
satisfaction that Nordic cooperation is in a period of 
revitalization.

<F P=106> [Article by Trygve Monsen: "Brundtland: Conservatives No </F>
Alternative"] 
  [Text] The Conservatives are no longer a total alternative 
to the Labor Party, Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland told 
the Norwegian Wire Service (NTB). Kaci Kullmann Five denied the 
charge. 
  "This is an evasive maneuver on the part of the prime 
minister. We are pursuing the same policy we presented before 
the election. At that time, Brundtland said the Conservative 
Party was the only government alternative," the Conservative 
leader said. 
  In the NTB interview Brundtland said she was very satisfied 
with 1993. "This has been a good year for the government, the 
Labor Party and especially for Norway." 
  The prime minister said there is still a lot of turbulence. 
She believes the Center Party will again emerge as a clear-cut 
nonsocialist party when the EC issue has been clarified. The 
Center Party is pursuing an EC strategy and laying all other 
issues aside. When the EC fight is over, the Center Party will 
be back in the nonsocialist camp, in her opinion. 
  "All parties act as special-interest parties and present 
special profiles on individual issues. They pursue a critical 
opposition policy. The election campaign has continued in the 
Storting. We are not confronted with any comprehensive policy, 
not even from the Conservatives. I feel the Conservative Party 
is operating to a greater extent than before with random 
political standpoints that seem unconnected. This developed 
during the current year and we saw it clearly in the fall," 
Brundtland said. 
<H5>  No Basis </H5>
  The Conservative Party leader repudiated the prime 
minister's 
statements and asked her to be concrete when she criticizes the 
Conservatives for not being a total alternative and trying to 
present a "special profile on individual issues." 
  "I don't think she has any basis for saying this. We are 
still pursuing the economic policy we announced before the 
election. And when it comes to two major areas--defense policy 
and education policy--we are continuing to work on what we 
promised. We are following up the proposals from the Defense 
Committee report that had broad majority support, and we think 
there should be more serious study than fun and games in school. 
Therefore we have proposed an increase in the total number of 
teaching periods," Five said. 
  "The prime minister is quite preposterous and she also 
disagrees with what her own party leader said in the Storting's 
budget-balancing debate before Christmas. Thorbjorn Jagland 
spoke of the Conservatives in quite a different way than she 
does now," Five said. 
  The prime minister is optimistic about the prospect of 
reducing unemployment. 
  "It now looks as if we will stabilize the unemployment 
figures. In the last two months, jobless figures have flattened 
out, and each weekly figure has tended to be lower than the one 
in the same period last year. Now this year's and last year's 
curves have crossed, and we are at a lower level than we were 12 
months ago. This means that for the first time in several years 
the January unemployment figure could be lower than it was a 
year ago," she said. 
  Once again she stressed that the favorable development in 
1993 is not due to an economic boost from other countries or 
favorable oil prices. 
  "It is our own economic policy that has changed Norway's 
circumstances," she concluded.

<F P=106> [Article by Ole Mathismoen: "SFT Fears Hidden Environmental </F>
Catastrophe"] 
  [Text] Norway's Pollution Authority [SFT] fears that the 
tolerance threshold for environmental toxins will soon be 
reached in Norway. 
  "We are concerned. There are enormous gaps in our knowledge 
about the effects of environmental toxins. We know they are 
extremely toxic even in small quantities and that they become 
concentrated in the food chain and in nature because they fail 
to break down," said SFT Director Harald Rensvik. 
  Yesterday SFT published its new comprehensive report on 
environmental toxins in Norway. The previous one came out six 
years ago. 
  The main conclusions are clear: Norwegian emissions have 
been 
radically reduced since 1985. In the case of many environmental 
toxins, industrial spillage into the waterways has been reduced 
by more than 90 percent. Nevertheless, environmental toxins 
are a greater threat to nature and the health of Norwegians than 
ever before. The problem is that, once emitted, pollutants 
remain in nature, and with the constant influx of toxins from 
abroad, environmental authorities fear that the tolerance 
threshold will soon be reached. Although unable to predict what 
will happen, where it will happen, or when, environmental 
authorities know that serious environmental problems are 
developing in the natural world around us. 
  We receive greater quantities of many of the most dangerous 
environmental toxins from abroad than we produce ourselves. The 
major portion is carried on the air and wind from power plants 
and industries on the continent. Some also come on the ocean 
currents. 
  "Approximately four tons of cadmium is dumped on the 
Norwegian environment each year. Three of these come from other 
countries, while our own emissions account for just one ton. The 
proportions are similar for other toxins," said Rensvik. 
  SFT says in its report that the work of reducing Norwegian 
emissions must continue. "We used the easiest and cheapest 
methods. The percentage that remains must also be eliminated if 
the fjords and nature areas ruined by Norwegian pollution are to 
be completely restored. There is still a long way to go before 
crabs can be fished out of the Frie Fjord. But it is entirely 
within the realm of possibility to get there," Rensvik said. 
  While most Norwegian toxic waste has a concrete source that 
can be identified and cleaned up, it is harder in the case of 
foreign pollutants. Norwegian pollutants harm one end of a fjord 
or the flora and fauna of a limited region. Pollutants from 
abroad are spread over the entire country by means of rain, 
wind, and ocean currents. This means that the authorities have 
limited knowledge of how long it will be until nature's 
tolerance threshold is reached: 
  "In terms of climate, the Norwegian environment is in grave 
trouble. We fear that unforeseen harm can arise as a result of 
constantly increasing amounts of cadmium, mercury, and other 
environmental toxins that are out there," said Rensvik. 
  The director of SFT points out that scientists know too 
little to say what will happen on the day the tolerance 
threshold is exceeded. But Rensvik can mention several 
possibilities: severe poisoning, species that become extinct, 
species that have problems with reproduction, mutations, injury 
to the nervous system. Because substances are concentrated in 
the food chain, they can affect people through eating such 
things as reindeer meat. 
  "We conclude that Norway must continue to work for further 
reductions both at home and abroad. Because even though our own 
emissions have been cut down, the danger to Norway's natural 
resources has not been dramatically reduced," said Rensvik. 
  The report reveals that scientists have discovered 
disturbing 
amounts of the environmental toxins PCB [polychlorinated 
biphenyl] and PAH [expansion unknown] in the Skagerrak trough 
and the Norwegian channels, in addition to the known quantities 
of imported pollutants. Recent investigations have also 
evidenced high concentrations of PCB's in the fatty tissues of 
polar bears and Arctic foxes on Spitzbergen. It is believed that 
PCB's can lead to a reduced capacity to breed, a weakened immune 
system, and behavioral disturbances--especially in sea mammals. 
The toxins congregate far from the source, and the effects of 
this are unclear. 
  The reason why advisories have been issued to those who eat 
fish and shellfish caught in the fjords is because of earlier 
toxin emissions from Norwegian industries. For some of these 
fjords, the restrictions have been reduced. In the meantime, 
they have been expanded somewhat in other areas because new and 
better studies have been done.

  [Excerpt] President Glavkos Kliridhis will not participate 
in talks on the so-called confidence-building measures nor in 
proximity talks on this package as proposed by UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. According to information received 
by I SIMERINI, President Kliridhis told the UN envoys Joe Clark, 
Gustave Feissel and John Paul Kavanagh, who presented him with a 
copy of the official reply letter of the Turkish Cypriot side, 
that, "this cannot be considered a positive answer on the 
package of confidence-building measures." 
  The same sources told I SIMERINI that the UN officials asked 
President Kliridhis to set aside the terms and conditions raised 
by Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf Denktas so that talks may begin 
immediately. "Consider that the terms have not been set and 
that a the issue of the confidence-building measures will be 
resolved during the talks," the UN envoys insisted. But the 
president was not convinced. Things will certainly be clarified 
today when the UN secretary general's envoys again meet with 
President Kliridhis and Denktas. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Laskarina Yerasimou] </F>
  [Excerpt] During this evening's debate on the Skopje issue 
by political party leaders, which was on the agenda of the 
Chamber of Deputies, different views were expressed. 
  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, who during his follow-up 
address noted wide acceptance of the government's positions, 
accepted [Political Spring Chairman] Andonios Samaras' proposal 
to convene the Council of Political Leaders under the 
chairmanship of President Konstandinos Karamanlis as soon as 
conditions are right. Papandreou said that the resumption of a 
dialogue on the Skopje issue under the auspices of the United 
Nations depends on whether Skopje abolishes all offensive 
demands and decides not to choose a name that contains the word 
Macedonia or its derivatives. The prime minister was firm on 
the name issue and called on the European countries to stand by 
Greece, not for solidarity reasons but to maintain stability in 
the area. 
  The differences raised by New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis 
Evert regarding the government's foreign policy were minimal. 
In reality, Evert expressed faith in the government's 
positions. He warned that a possible dissolution of Skopje 
would be dangerous. Evert asked for the establishment of a 
permanent council on foreign policy, which would meet weekly. 
  On the contrary, Political Spring Chairman Samaras strongly 
attacked the government and official opposition [New Democracy 
is the second-largest party in the Chamber of Deputies]. 
Samaras mainly criticized [former Prime Minister] Konstandinos 
Mitsotakis and the other political leaders for hypocrisy, 
inconsistency, and mithridatism [as heard]. He repeated his 
proposal for convening the Council of Political Leaders, which 
was accepted by the prime minister, and asked the Chamber of 
Deputies to adopt a resolution on the name issue, which will be 
send to the parliaments of European countries. 
  The positions of Aleka Papariga, KKE [Greek Communist Party] 
general secretary, were radically different. The KKE general 
secretary proposed a dialogue with Skopje without raising the 
name issue. She said that, if during the dialogue Greek demands 
are not satisfied, the issue should be dealt with then. 
  Former Prime Minister Mitsotakis also intervened in the 
discussion and criticized Samaras, calling him young and weak. 
Mitsotakis called on the government to return to a dialogue 
under the United Nations and not to bilateral talks. He 
described the direct dialogue with Skopje as a mistake and 
indirectly but clearly favored a composite name [that would 
contain the term Macedonia but not by itself]. [passage omitted]

  In a declaration to the private television station SKY, the

attack on the former National Bank director. The declaration 
said that Vranopoulos and the former New Democracy government 
were responsible for the scandalous sale of the public cement 
company Ayet Iraklis. The declaration added that many people 
believed 17 November had dissolved because it had not attacked 
for some 13 months. Police are investigating the declaration. 
  According to other information, 17 November said the police 
have wrongly accused it of attacks it did not perform.

<F P=106> [Article by Dhimitris Petykhakis: "Who Lost and Who Won From </F>
GATT"] 
  [Text] The question of who won and who lost from the GATT 
agreement that was finally reached not only has no clear-cut 
answer, but to find the right answer one must first define the 
meaning of "good" and "bad." For instance, if one considers the 
temporary "accommodation" of a certain sector or a certain 
product a good thing, there is one kind of answer. Then again, 
if delivering one sector or product to the depths of 
international competition is bad, then the answer is different. 
  Let us take up first the issues of "strictly Greek 
interest": 
  1) Textiles. It is certainly not good that we (and Portugal 
as well) failed to secure from the Europeans the capital that 
would help our textile sector better face the naked competition 
to which it will be exposed after the agreement. While Portugal, 
of course, will be even more affected, it did succeed in 
securing ECU400 million in community funding, and 500 million in 
community loans (under favorable terms). We accomplished nothing 
of the sort. [GATT negotiator] Theodhoros Pangalos said that 
"the programs aimed at strengthening the textile sector had not 
been ready" to be submitted to the Community so as to ask for 
the relative financing. According to information from reliable 
officials, our country submitted to the EC three years ago a 
five-year program for restructuring and modernizing the Greek 
textile sector amounting to ECU1.9 billion. Community officials 
had led us to believe there was hope "for at least some 
assistance." It is also certain that our Portuguese competitors 
will enjoy some advantages over us. 
  2) Maritime transportation. Our merchant marine will surely 
be favored by the fact that agreement was reached and that as a 
result, international trade will expand, thus increasing the 
demand for the services our sector "sells." The protectionism 
the United States demanded, which would have been unfavorable to 
us because we have a more competitive and flexible merchant 
marine, did not come to pass. However, it will again surface 
very soon, as will also the cabotage issue. We are doing all 
right for the time being in preventing foreigners from 
interfering in the Greek sector by invoking mainly national 
security, but let us not forget for one moment that the war 
continues and that many battles will still take place. 
  3) Agriculture. Our olive oil, produce, and wine sectors 
will 
surely be affected. Especially with regard to produce, our 
argument that production in the southern European countries does 
not affect international trade was not accepted; as a result, 
the reduction of supports and export subsidies agreed upon means 
lost income for our producers. While the Community has more or 
less undertaken to secure financial offsets from the CAP (Common 
Agricultural Policy), restrictions in the Community budget are 
such that some doubt the restrictions will actually materialize. 
Others are more optimistic, citing the precedent of other 
products that were handled in similar fashion last year in the 
Blair House pre-agreement (tobacco, meats, dairy products, oil 
seeds, cereals). We shall soon know who is right. 
  Let us now proceed briefly to a more general review. It is 
indeed difficult to understand the French, who are claiming 
victory in the audiovisual sector. If their films, broadcasts, 
and songs are of lower quality and marketability than 
Hollywood's, no national legislation will avert the shrinkage of 
the Francophone culture's share of the world market. The same is 
true for Greece and the other countries in the Union. 
  For the rest, the opening of international trade and the 
increase of the worldwide production of goods and services will 
surely be to the advantage of Greece and all others. However, 
those possessing competitive national companies and good lobbies 
to influence public opinion and, hence, consumer behavior, will 
be most favored. It is thus up to readers to decide who are the 
losers and the winners from the famous GATT agreement.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Israeli President Ever 
Weizman received Prime Minister Tansu Ciller at his hotel and 
conferred with her for some time. During the meeting, which 
lasted approximately 45 minutes, Weizman extended to Ciller a 
letter from Israeli Prime Minister Rabin inviting the Turkish 
prime minister to visit Israel. Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin 
also attended the meeting. 
  In a statement to TRT in connection with the meeting, 
Ambassador Volkan Vural, chief adviser at the Prime Minister's 
Office, said that Ciller informed the visiting president that 
Turkey supports the Middle East peace process and wishes to 
contribute to it. Vural noted that within this framework, 
Ciller touched upon the development of regional economic 
cooperation and the introduction of new institutions in the 
region. Vural added: 
  [Begin recording] The prime minister underlined that new 
institutions are needed in the Middle East. She suggested that 
these institutions could encompass the development of economic 
cooperation among regional countries, the creation of joint 
projects, and the introduction of new structures that would meet 
the regional security needs of all the countries in this area. 
[end recording] 
  According to Vural, Israel's water demands from Turkey were 
also discussed during the meeting. Agreement was also reached 
to expand cooperation in the struggle against terrorism. 
  Weizman then received Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut 
Yilmaz. In a statement after the meeting, Yilmaz reported that 
he told Weizman that, as the main opposition party, ANAP will 
support future moves to develop relations with Israel. Pointing 
out that there is still a significant distance to be covered in 
bilateral relations, Yilmaz expressed the hope that there will 
be an acceleration in the development of relations in light of 
the new political developments. 
  President Suleyman Demirel will host a dinner in Weizman's 
honor at the Cankaya Mansion this evening.

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has declared that Turkey 
would like the countries in the Middle East to expend their 
energy and resources for the economic development of their 
peoples and to solve their problems through constructive 
dialogue. 
  Demirel hosted a dinner in honor of Israeli President Ever 
Weizman. In a dinner toast, Demirel welcomed the beginning of 
the Middle East peace process. He explained that the courageous 
steps taken by Israel and the Palestinians last year enabled 
Turkey to transport its efforts for cooperation and peace 
southward. The existing desire to perpetuate peace will be 
reflected widely and positively in the world, Demirel stressed. 
  Recalling that the relations between the Turkish and Jewish 
people began a long time ago, Demirel noted that Turkish 
citizens of Jewish origin contribute significantly to the 
country and its cultural heritage. 
  In his speech, Weizman said that he came to Turkey, knowing 
that it is a country with an influential role in the future 
course of the Middle East. Underlining that Turkey has always 
contributed to peace, Weizman remarked: The leaders and people 
of the Middle East should embrace Kemal Ataturk's motto of peace 
at home and peace in the world. 
  There are many factors that connect the two nations and the 
two countries, Weizman recounted, adding that Israel will never 
forget that the Jews were accepted by the Ottoman Empire when 
they were expelled from various European countries some 500 
years ago. Weizman pointed out that thousands of Arabs and Jews 
were killed in the wars waged before it was understood that 
Israel's existence in the region is a living reality. He added 
that the agreement with the Palestinians constitutes the 
beginning of a change in the region.

  [Begin Weizman recording, broadcast in progress] ....to send

hope that he will continue to lead his country on the road to 
peace. I believe that President al-Asad, when he says Syria 
made a strategic decision for peace, I believe in his sincerity 
and integrity. He is a man of honor, but he has to understand 
that in peace, like in war, one has to recognize the mentality 
of one's counterpart. It seems to me that in Geneva, he failed 
to understand the expectations of public opinion in Israel. I 
do hope that in the near future he will make a bold decision and 
meet Israelis, meet the prime minister, meet the foreign 
minister, talk to them, understand them, and know the spirit of 
the country. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller by Ziya Osman </F>
Acikel in Ankara; date not given] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Developments in Russia Are Cause for Concern </H5>
  [Acikel] The leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who made a very strong showing in the 
Russian elections, is constantly making statements against 
Turkey. How do you assess this? 
  [Ciller] Winds of nationalism are sweeping across our 
northern neighbor Russia. But it would be incorrect to say that 
President Yeltsin is also thinking along these lines. 
Nevertheless, Zhirinovskiy's election victory shows that this 
sentiment exists among the people. Therefore, we must be 
careful. I am not saying that this is a threat to us, but it 
poses a risk. We told the entire world that it stands to lose 
if it shapes its policy based on Yeltsin alone. There are 
serious developments there that are cause for concern. Turkey 
cannot act with laxity. 
<H5>  Warning to Papandreou </H5>
  [Acikel] Prime Minister Papandreou is moving fast on the 
Greek front. He sent military advisers and hardware to the 
Greek Cypriot sector, and started oil prospecting in the Aegean 
Sea. What will the future ties between Turkey and Greece be? 
  [Ciller] Papandreou is doing wrong. To enter into an armed 
clash jointly with the Greek Cypriots, or engage in oil 
prospecting to the dismay of Turkey would bring no gains to 
Greece. These are not sound things to do. Whenever Papandreou 
comes to power he resorts to activities disagreeable to Turkey. 
We will act according to developments. We will respond to 
friendship with friendship and understanding, and will give the 
necessary reply to wickedness. I am not saying this just for 
something to say. We are powerful. We have never given, and 
will not give, any concession of our power. 
<H5>  They Will Be the Losers </H5>
  [Acikel] Judging from your statements, it appears that 
feelings of enmity at Turkey's periphery have become pronounced. 
What are you going to say to these negative stances by Russia 
and Greece? 
  [Ciller] Disappointment awaits those countries that are not 
friendly to us. They will not get what they are after and will 
suffer enormous losses. I am stating this openly. I am saying 
this with a pride derived from being an Islamic country and a 
Muslim. They might threaten us and shout war cries, but they 
cannot give the slightest trouble to us. They will be the 
losers. I am not engaged in empty talk, and I am not issuing 
threats. We are an extremely powerful country. We are a very 
dynamic country in international forums. Threats are not the 
object of our power. No one should fear Turkey. I repeat, we 
will do what is required in case of any development to the 
detriment of Turkey's interests. Let them not harbor enmity, 
they will be sorry for it. 
  [Acikel] Britain and France are working to establish an 
independent Kurdish state within Iraq. They want to use their 
power as big states. What will Turkey's stance be on this issue? 
  [Ciller] We are opposed to the violation of Iraq's 
territorial integrity; we will not allow it. Those are oil 
regions. Any change or wrong move will set the place ablaze. 
Iraq's territorial integrity should be preserved not only for 
Turkey's interest but also for international stability. The 
creation of a Kurdish state will push that region into a 
historic mistake. World peace might be disrupted. Turkey is 
opposed to the creation of an independent Kurdish state; we will 
never allow it. 
  [Acikel] Why were discharges from army service postponed for 
three months? Do you not think that those who completed their 
service to the country were adversely affected by this decision? 
  [Ciller] As you can see, there are problems all around 
Turkey, undesirable developments are taking place. We extended 
the discharge periods to forestall painful developments. The 
situation in the north, west, and south is obvious to you. We 
could not have moved troops from our borders with Greece to the 
southeast, and from the southeast to our northern borders. We 
are thinking of Turkey's interests, and are protecting our 
people and country. We could not have pretended not to see 
these developments just because we are peace-loving and friendly 
country. To reduce the number of troops in these regions 
through discharges would have been a blow to our deterrent 
power. Neighboring countries might have taken advantage of it.

  [Text] Paris, Jan 24 (TANJUG) -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher said in Paris on Monday [24 January] that the 
United States was prepared to engage in the implementation of 
NATO's decision to launch air strikes against Bosnian Serbs if 
such an action was demanded by military commanders on the ground. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said after meeting 
Christopher it was important to implement NATO decisions when 
Tuzla and Srebrenica were concerned. 
  It is difficult to conclude from the two statements whether 
Paris and Washington had agreed over what Washington described 
as the insufficiently clarified diplomatic initiative launched 
by Paris to help resolve the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  At the recent NATO summit in Brussels, France was the 
staunchest advocator of the use of air power against Bosnian 
Serbs for their alleged refusal to reopen the local airport in 
Tuzla, the Moslem enclave in northeastern Bosnia, and allow the 
replacement of Canadian U.N. troops in another Moslem enclave, 
Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Bosnian Serbs have reached agreement with the U.N. Bosnia 
command to allow Dutch peacekeepers to replace the Canadians in 
Srebrenica in early February, but rejected to reopen the airport 
in Tuzla before a general peace accord has been signed, fearing 
that the facility may be used for arms shipment to Bosnian 
Moslems.

  [Text] Diplomats are desperately looking for a way out [on 
Bosnia], desperately, in the literal sense of the word. The 
American secretary of state, Warren Christopher, was in Paris 
today. Stephane Manier reports: 
  [Manier] Warren Christopher was not expecting this. He was 
not expecting the French to bring up for discussion the Bosnian 
issue with so much insistence, including with President 
Mitterrand this evening. It was also the case one hour earlier 
with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. The French repeated what 
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said this morning. 
  [Begin Juppe recording] However precious humanitarian aid 
may 
be, it is not sufficient to settle the problem, of course. A 
political settlement is the only way out. [end recording] 
  It is obvious that the French did not want the Americans to 
say only that they were ready to bomb Serbian artillery at any 
time, but that they would become involved on the ground. 
However, the Americans have not changed their position since 
the NATO summit in Brussels. 
  [Begin Christopher recording in English with superimposed 
French translation] The United States is not ready to have 
ground troops in Bosnia to impose a solution in this conflict. 
[end recording] 
  So the Americans have appeared really annoyed by the French 
insistence, and Christopher's entourage speculated this evening: 
aren't the French trying to make us take the blame for their 
future withdrawal next spring? It is indeed difficult for the 
Western side to speak with one voice. As for him, Warren 
Christopher preferred to get into his limousine quickly.

  [Text] France will make proposals on Bosnia soon. They 
will be announced as early as this week. This is what Francois 
Mitterrand told the American secretary of state, Warren 
Christopher, whom he received for 45 minutes at the Elysee 
Palace. The American foreign minister also met Alain Juppe and 
Edouard Balladur. 
  Meanwhile, in Bosnia, British General Michael Rose has 
replaced Belgian Francis Briquemont as the head of the UN 
soldiers. He said straight away that he was not coming to 
organize the departure of the UN Protection Force forces.

  [Text] Prime Minister Esko Aho calls for a speedy adoption 
of Russia as a member of the Council of Europe. Speaking at the 
Council of Europe session in Strasbourg today, Aho stressed that 
Russia and the other applicant countries should be adopted as 
members as soon as the conditions are fulfilled. He pointed out 
that only membership will guarantee commitment to the Council of 
Europe's principles. 
  According to Aho, the Russians have clearly chosen democracy 
and entry into the Council of Europe would be a significant step 
on this road. Aho, who addressed the parliamentary general 
assembly, believes it is vital both for Russia and the rest of 
Europe that Russia should take a full part in the European 
process. He emphasized that Russia must not be isolated or 
allowed to drift into isolation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Kooijmans Seeks Change in EU </F>
Negotiator Owen's Mandate"] 
  [Text] After France, the Netherlands now also wants to hold 
emergency consultations by the European Union [EU] on the 
situation in Bosnia and the mandate of the British negotiator, 
Lord Owen. According to Foreign Minister Kooijmans, it is unfair 
that the EU negotiator is now being used as the scapegoat for 
the international failure to achieve a peace settlement in the 
former Yugoslavia. 
  Kooijmans affirmed on Friday [21 January] that the action 
plan has failed. The member states must, therefore, ask 
themselves whether or not to further pursue the present path. 
The EU should not be considering whether or not to send Lord 
Owen home, but rather a change in his mandate. As to the nature 
of the change he envisages, he is not prepared to say at 
present. The motion by the European Parliament, which demanded 
Lord Owen's departure, was received poorly in The Hague on 
Friday. At a press conference in The Hague, UN Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali praised the wonderful work by Owen and 
Stoltenberg. He said he would continue to support them as their 
work required patience, political will, and stamina. 
  The four largest groups in the Second Chamber see the 
replacement of Owen as being of little value, as it does not 
bring an end to the conflict any nearer. They agree with 
Kooijmans that the real problem is not Owen, but the impotence 
of the international community.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 24 (AFP) -- Over 1,000 bee-keepers 
converged on European Community headquarters here Monday [21 
January] to demand aid for the declining European 
honey-producing industry and protection from cut-price honey 
imports. 
  The bee-keepers, mainly from France and Spain, presented a 
petition to Greek Agriculture Minister Georges Moraitis, 
chairman of the European Community's Council of Agricultural 
Ministers, ahead of a meeting of the Council later in the day. 
  They were protesting the scheduled phase-out of tariffs on 
cut-price honey imports, particularly from China, Argentina and 
Mexico. 
  The bee-keepers also want honey to be reclassified as an 
agricultural rather than an industrial product so that they can 
claim a share of EC agricultural subsidies. 
  They carried signs such as "Saving the bees means saving 
jobs" and "Do not let European agiculture die." There was also 
a threat. "Today we bring honey (to Brussels). The next time we 
bring the bees," one poster warned. 
  John Horn, a member of the British Bee-keepers Association, 
said the decline of the bee-keeping industry meant that the 
pollination of flowers and hence their cultivation was at risk 
throughout the European Community. 
  "Honey bees are responsible for 85 percent of all flower 
pollination," he said, adding that the European honey-bee would 
perish if bee-keepers were driven out of business and could no 
longer protect it against parasites. 
  The bee-keepers have rejected a European Commission proposal 
for anti-dumping tariff protection against imports because this 
might disqualify them for direct financial aid, an EC official 
said. 
  Farmers' associations claim there are about 450,000 
bee-keepers in the European Community -- including 16,000 
full-time professionals. 
  The demonstration was timed to coincide with the first 
meeting of EC agriculture ministers under Greece's six-month 
presidency of the Community because Greece is considered 
sympathetic to the bee-keepers' cause. 
  EC officials predicted that the European Commission would be 
asked to look at ways to help protect the local apiculture 
industry.

<F P=106> [Report by Ian Verchere: "Germany Hands the Lead Role to </F>
Well-Again Britain"] 
  [Text] The sick child of Europe is better. Once renowned 
for sloppy work practices, an over-unionised workforce, 
lacklustre merchandise and low productivity, Britain is today 
leading a field of overweight European economies towards 
recovery. 
  And bringing up the rear is Germany, the one-time home of 
the 
economic miracle. Nothing, it seems, lasts forever. 
  These changes are borne out by a survey of 100,000 companies 
in eight European countries undertaken by the European Chambers 
of Commerce. The report finds that Britain's economic recovery 
paints the most optimistic picture for the future while 
Germany's is one of the gloomiest. 
  The findings mirror THE EUROPEAN's own 1994 forecasts, 
published earlier this month. Described as the largest economic 
survey in the world, this new report says 1994 will be a turning 
point. However, the degree of improvement will not be 
sufficient to reverse the key problem of rising unemployment or 
to encourage entrepreneurs to raise investment. West German 
entrepreneurs are highly sceptical about future propspects with 
one-third predicting that developments for their company will be 
unfavourable. Recovery -- not expected until late this year 
will be "a long and difficult process." As a consequence 
recovery in eastern Germany is being hampered, although 35 
percent of entrepreneurs count on favourable development for 
their company, albeit from a low baseline. 
  British entrepreneurs are at the other end of the spectrum. 
"The UK has experienced a steady climb out of recession since 
the beginning of 1991," says the report. "The withdrawal of 
sterling from the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in September 
1992 improved their competitive position further." 
  Nearly 60 percent of UK companies expect beneficial 
developments in 1994. Despite a slowing of exports, the UK 
picture is now one of a gradual return to growth. 
  Although European recovery is largely unsynchronised, 
improvements in the UK economy may augur well for other member 
states. However, this premise should be treated with caution 
because structural, monetary and social circumstances differ 
between countries. In Ireland, changeable interest and currency 
levels created serious difficulties for firms. 
  In Italy, devaluation of the lira in September 1992 
engendered cautious optimism among exporters. 
  In the Netherlands, last year was perceived as a 
disappointing year with prospects for this year gloomy. "In 
1993, turnover fell, investment decreased and the number of jobs 
fell for the first time since 1982," says the survey. 
  Although Greece's economic climate was poor in 1993, 
companies reported an increase in turnover and investment. 
Spain was also hard hit but the outlook for this year is 
brighter as exports increase and business experiences a modest 
recovery. 
  Completion of the single European market in January last 
year 
has not proved a landmark for companies because steps towards 
greater integration had already been introduced. 
  The study says a strengthening market will boost the economy 
in the medium term. Despite progress, many companies complain 
about barriers which still exist in the areas of customs 
procedure, statistical declaration and standards.

  [Text] Vienna -- Indifferent to the media war that has 
erupted over his person and the crisis in his marriage, 
President Klestil stated that he is optimistic and full of 
energy. "I will go through this difficult period," he stressed. 
Thus, the president will give a speech at a ceremony of the 
pope's UN representative in Vienna on the occasion of World 
Peace Day under the slogan "Year of the Family." "I will 
naturally underline the value of the family, but I will also 
point out that I have seen in my personal life recently how 
these values can be endangered easily," Klestil told DIE PRESSE 
yesterday. 
  The main speech at the ceremony, organized by Nuncio 
Squicciarini, will be delivered by State Secretary Cardinal 
Sodano from the Vatican. In the interview with DIE PRESSE, 
Klestil left no doubt that he does not have any intention of 
resigning because of this private matter.

Background to Letter Bombs Unpleasant for Haider"] 
  [Excerpt] Vienna -- Two of the four suspects in the 
letter-bomb affair who are still in prison "were involved in the 
attacks in one way or another," Interior Minister Franz 
Loeschnak stated on Sunday [23 January] during the "Meet the 
Press" program. Loeschnak hopes that the judiciary will be able 
to present an "intermediate result" for a bill of indictment by 
the end of the month. The interior minister considers it a 
proven fact that the attacks were carried out by "perpetrators 
completely familiar with the right-wing scene in Austria, and 
clearly xenophobic." 
  He believes that the suggestion by Joerg Haider, chairman of 
the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe], that by investigating the 
right-wing scene the authorities were following a "dead-end 
road," can only be explained by the fact that this is 
"unpleasant" for Haider. After all, Horst Jakob Rosenkranz, the 
husband of Lower Austrian FPOe deputy Barbara Rosenkranz, "was 
clearly recognizable" on a video together with one of the 
suspects. 
  This statement led to furious protests among the FPOe. 
Haider described Loeschnak's attacks as "unjustified." He 
stresed that, together with the ORF, Loeschnak is attempting to 
disparage the whole FPOe. 
  Loeschnak admitted that government forces were "surprised" 
at 
the strength of the right-wing extremist scene. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by Arnaud Rodier: "Armament -- France Reassures </F>
`Dragons'"] 
  [Text] It is no accident that [Foreign Trade Minister] 
Gerard Longuet -- intent on reaffirming that France does not 
intend to burn all bridges with Taiwan -- chose to make this 
statement in Singapore. 
  Industry and External Trade Minister Gerard Longuet wants 
everybody to be happy. He reaffirmed yesterday in Singapore 
that, on 12 January, France did not undertake to cease selling 
weapons to Taiwan altogether, but only those weapons "deemed 
offensive for mainland China" or "likely to threaten its 
integrity or its security." 
  This is a way for Mr. Longuet to expand on statements made 
by 
Defense Minister Francois Leotard, who insisted last week on the 
fact that Paris reserved the right to continue selling 
"nonoffensive" equipment to Taiwan. 
  However, choosing to do it from Singapore was no accident. 
  France, which will supply 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighter aircraft 
and their weaponry to Taiwan, knows that it must give up hope of 
selling it three assault submarines worth 20 billion francs. 
<H5>  Making Up For Lost Time </H5>
  However, France has not given up its intention of selling 
assault armored vehicles as well as Roland missiles, since such 
equipment can very well be considered as defensive weapons. And 
above all, France does not want to lose other customers in the 
region, including Singapore. 
  "The agreement signed with Beijing is likely to open markets 
which were hitherto closed to France, but it also creates a risk 
of destabilization for noncommunist countries, including 
Southeast Asia's `dragons,'" says a weapons manufacturer. 
  This analysis applies not only to the defense industry, but 
also to civilian sectors. And, as reaffirmed yesterday by 
Gerard Longuet, France wishes to position itself in Singapore so 
as to be better placed in Malaysia, India, and Vietnam. 
  France did not prove active enough in this region. It needs 
to "make up for lost time," insists Mr. Longuet. 
  As for manufacturers, from Aerospatiale to Thomson to 
Alcatel-Alsthom, if the government works toward smoothing things 
out, so much the better. Improved relations between Paris and 
Beijing are expected to help Airbus Industries sell its aircraft 
in China. However, this does not justify ignoring other 
countries, which would immediately turn to the United States 
anyway. 
<H5>  Minister Seeks To Reassure </H5>
  Singapore is one of them. Its influence in the region is 
substantial. Accordingly, Gerard Longuet waxes reassuringly 
toward those who fear France might focus on China to the 
detriment of everyone else.

"Lamassoure Tries To Reassure Baltic Leaders With Regard to 
Menacing Statements by Russian Diplomats"] 
  [Text] Vilnius -- Alain Lamassoure, French minister 
delegate for european affairs, has repeatedly told his Baltic 
contacts: "The security of the Baltic states is an integral 
part of European security." Mr. Lamassoure was to complete a 
three-day tour of the region in Riga (Latvia) on Saturday 22 
January, following his visits to Tallinn (Estonia) and Vilnius 
(Lithuania). 
  The French minister, who had originally not planned to make 
the tour until the spring, finally decided, after the Russian 
elections and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's emergence, to bring the 
visit forward to "try and reassure the Baltic states and convey 
to them our solidarity at a time when they could be frightened 
by what they are hearing from Moscow." The French minister was 
able to gauge at first hand the concern of his interlocutors 
(not to mention their youth: The Estonian prime minister is 35 
years old, and his foreign minister is 27) in the light of 
recent statements made by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev on the subject of the regions, which include the Baltic 
states, and "which over the centuries have constituted the 
sphere of influence of Russia." These statements -- even if 
they have been denied -- added to those of the Russian 
nationalists, who feel that they have the wind in their sails, 
show glimpses of a rebirth in Russian imperialism which gives 
the Baltic states constant cause for concern. 
<H5>  Notion of `Close-by Foreign State' </H5>
  In addition, many Baltic leaders consider that certain 
Western powers, and in particular the United States, implicitly 
show too much complacence with regard to Moscow's favorite 
"close-by foreign state" notion. Estonian President Lennart 
Meri told us on Friday 21 January: "If you accept this Russian 
notion of the close-by foreign state, then one day it will be 
extended to France itself...." He added that all indications 
were that Catherine the Great's imperialist dream had not 
deserted Moscow: "That is the tragedy of Russia, which has 
always believed that it had a special mission for the world. 
This vision is very popular today with the Russian generals." 
  He continued by saying that now there is a great threat of 
Russia trying to make people forget its domestic problems "by 
rallying the Russian people around a nationalist flag." At the 
risk of using "language that is too romantic," Mr. Meri stressed 
the fact that Europe's problem was not, currently, a question of 
military strategy but more of a moral problem: "Does Europe 
still have the will to remain European? Here we are in Europe's 
front line, but for a front line to be solid we need to feel 
that behind us we have a Europe that wants to remain faithful to 
its guiding principles." In Vilnius, former President 
Landsbergis also stressed to Mr. Lamassoure the need to "not 
harbor any illusions about Russia." He warned of "the 
Kozyrev-Zhirinovskiy doctrine" and spoke of his fear that one 
day Europe would again be split into areas of Russian and 
American influence. 
  The French minister for European affairs tried to reply to 
these fears. He assured his interlocutors of France's desire to 
establish closer ties between Europe and the Baltic states and 
pointed out that France will play its part in ensuring that the 
planned trade agreement between the European Union and each of 
the Baltic states also has a political aspect, the content of 
which would be similar to the agreements concluded concerning 
the four countries in the Visegrad group (Hungary, Poland, the 
Czech Republic, and Slovakia), and Romania and Bulgaria.

<F P=106> [Paul Guilbert commentary: "The Shadow of the Presidential </F>
Election"] 
  [Text] After Chirac, Juppe: The rejection by the 
president and then the secretary general of the RPR [Rally for 
the Republic] of the idea of heading the majority's list in the 
European elections, goes beyond reasons of personal comfort in 
both cases. "It is not the course I planned," the Chirac said. 
"I cannot see myself in that role," the Juppe said. If we add 
to this Edouard Balladur's variations on the theme, we quickly 
understand that the plan to attach no more than a European value 
to the June 1994 election, dissociating it from the presidential 
election, was pure otherworldliness, and that instead the 
calculations of strategy for the presidential election 
determined the motives for refusal or uncertainty by the various 
people. 
  It is not the essential issue which is under debate: 
Everybody knows that the single RPR-UDF [Union for French 
Democracy] list is not only possible, but technically agreed, 
that the formal conditions laid down by Valery Giscard d'Estaing 
are scarcely in dispute, that there is a return to the 
commonsense thinking shown initially by the prime minister: How 
could people tasked with implementing the same policy in March 
1993 put themselves forward on different lists one year later? 
Therefore the resolution to draw up a joint program, which 
could be drafted "in 15 minutes at the corner of a table," to 
cite Balladur, is merely a pretense: It enables, in the 
meantime, the clarification of what individuals symbolize, which 
is particularly important for what comes later. 
<H5>  The Pros and Cons </H5>
  Why did Chirac, "approached" by his comrades, say no? What 
is interesting in his sudden reply is less the expected decision 
than his speed in ending the scenario. He could have allowed 
the pressure to mount, and maintain the suspense about his 
intentions. It is easy to imagine the debate between the pros 
and cons. Pro: The opportunity to return to the front of the 
stage, to end a tiresome wait, to bring his image into line with 
a heroic tradition of Gaullism, which brings him the 
unconditional support of the members. 
  And also the opportunity to be seen as a unifying figure in 
the majority. Con: Becoming bogged down in bargaining among 
the parties and also the risk of failing in his demonstration of 
unity. It is important to remember that, of all the right-wing 
leaders, Jacques Chirac is the only one to have formulated a 
philosophical condemnation, and not just an empirical rejection, 
of Le Pen's policy. In a one-round election without 
responsibility, there would be a loss of votes from that side. 
  By prematurely ruling out the hypothesis of his candidacy as 
head of the European list, Chirac simply wants to show that he 
is a candidate for a different position, in other words the 
presidency of the republic, in keeping with a logic predating 
the parliamentary elections, the one which led him to turn down 
the leadership of the government, which went by agreement to 
Edouard Balladur. On the candidate's part, this is consistent 
with availability and distance with which to draw up a plan for 
a seven-year term of office. Although disputed or jeopardized 
since by the prime minister's omnipotence, it has the merit of 
continuity. 
  Mr. Juppe's refusal is more to do with the present 
situation. 
The suggestion and then rejection of his name by Mr. Balladur 
leads him naturally not to hurry into a role in which he would 
be seen as a puppet. His success in the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign 
Ministry], his intellectual grasp of problems, his skill as a 
negotiator who attaches importance to a degree of Gaullist 
rigidity, although seen as a handicap initially, now constitutes 
one of his best investments in the future and makes him a more 
and more essential figure in political life. In short, Mr. 
Juppe is no longer negotiable. 
<H5>  The Myth of Delegation </H5>
  Does the prime minister's change of attitude toward his 
foreign minister as regards the European elections take account 
of these facts? Can a man who is bound to be regarded as a 
candidate for the presidency of the republic afford to entrust a 
man like Mr. Juppe with the formidable springboard of heading 
the European campaign? Especially in view of the fact that the 
RPR secretary general, Jacques Chirac's favorite candidate, 
would then embody the myth of delegation, the lieutenantship of 
Gaullist legitimacy, which, as Mr. Balladur is in the best 
position to know, can be put to good use. 
  Amid the obstacles to be overcome and the influences to be 
sought within the political world with a view to the 
presidential election, it is clear that the candidate Chirac and 
the candidate Balladur will not be subject to the same 
necessities. Where the RPR leader will have to give assurances 
to the UDF -- the reverse of Valery Giscard d'Estaing appointing 
a member of the UDR [Union of Democrats for the Republic] as 
prime minister in 1974 -- the prime minister, already a UDF 
herald, will have to win over the new barons of the Gaullist 
family. Did not the hasty statements of [Social Affairs 
Minister] Simone Veil and especially [Defense Minister] Francois 
Leotard in favor of Balladur standing as candidate have the 
effect of countering, by anticipation, the inevitable RPR 
obstacles in the prime minister's path? 
<H5>  The Big Issue </H5>
  The big issue, currently the realm of the opinion polls, 
will, when it comes to taking action, be played out in the 
strange inner circle of these men who, in keeping with their 
custom, tear each other apart but hunt in packs. Will the pack 
maintain its unity? Hence the importance of [Interior Minister] 
Pasqua, who has not had his say. Of Mr. Seguin [National 
Assembly president], who is also capable of showing his wrath. 
And of Mr. Juppe, who is in control of his destiny. 
  Chirac or Balladur? Whatever happens, there will always be a 
Gaullist to say: The other would have done better.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Michel Rocard, former prime minister and </F>
Socialist Party secretary general, under the "Opinion" rubric: 
"France's Image Questioned: `Spineless Diplomacy Hurts France's 
Image'"] 
  [Text] Sarajevo, Taiwan, Bern; what is the connection 
between these three distant places? Answer: A policy which is 
a disgrace to France. Let us review the facts. 
  Sarajevo. General Cot, like all his predecessors, denounces 
the absurd conditions imposed on the troops he commands and 
whose dedication is nothing short of admirable. He has barely 
finished speaking when we -- government included -- unanimously 
proclaim our approval and our hope that his urgent warning will 
precipitate the Security Council meeting which will make the 
required decisions. What happens instead? Not only is the 
general prematurely discharged by the United Nations, but we 
hear that the government, which lauded him so last week, has 
agreed to the disciplinary measure this week! France keeps its 
mouth shut. 
<H5>  Government Decisions </H5>
  Taiwan. A communique written in Beijing and endorsed in 
Paris tells us that France purely and simply aligns itself on 
mainland China's position and foregoes the relationship it had 
begun to establish with Taiwan. 
  Forgotten, the Tiananmen massacre; forgotten, the human 
rights violations; forgotten, the fact that all other countries 
have managed to establish balanced relations both with Beijing 
and Taipei. 
  The question would simply be to let it be known that under 
no 
circumstances would France condone any attempt from China to 
forcibly regain control of Taiwan, and that it is therefore 
committed to fulfilling the island's military needs. But China 
demands that France -- and only France -- give it its undivided 
attention. And France complies. 
  Bern. Two Iranians facing murder charges in Geneva have 
sought refuge in France. Switzerland asks that they be 
extradited. The French Government quietly flies them off to 
Tehran. No explanation given. Not a word to the opposition, 
even though it was ready to listen to the language of national 
interest. 
  Not a word to Switzerland, even though it was ready to 
listen 
to the voice of reason. But instead, a shady deal: "Free our 
executioners, and there will be no bombing in your country." 
Such a deal -- which is what France's friends are suspecting 
may have taken place -- is not only shameful, it is also 
ineffective. A deal with terrorists is always a fool's deal. 
  I do hope that this is not what happened in this case, but 
the government has done everything it could to give substance to 
this accusation, which foreign newspapers do not hesitate to 
relay. France spreads dismay. 
  In all three cases, the decisions were made exclusively by 
the government. In all three cases, we made quite a poor show 
of ourselves with the whole world watching. Spineless diplomacy 
hurts France's image. And to think that we owe it all to 
self-styled spiritual heirs of De Gaulle...!

<F P=106> [Article by Jean Pichot-Duclos, director of the Institute </F>
for Economic Intelligence Studies and Strategy: "Toward a French 
`Economic Intelligence' Model"] 
  [Text] As we announced in our December 1993 issue, 
this article will present a model in the economic intelligence 
sector that is desirable for our country. 
<H5>  An Unsatisfactory Situation </H5>
<H5>  The Facts </H5>
  With the collapse of the USSR and the profound change in the 
strategic stakes, France, even more than other countries, finds 
itself forced to redefine its priorities. In the intelligence 
sector, economic and technological concerns are becoming as 
important as they are in the military and political sectors. The 
time has come to improve the system for the acquisition, 
processing, and dissemination of knowledge--a system that is 
deemed inefficient. And so the formulation of the economic 
intelligence concept comes at just the right time in terms of 
meeting the vast and urgent needs of our country in this sector. 
  An examination of the national apparatus holds few 
surprises. 
It resembles a railroad map, with all the government 
intelligence bodies (ministries, secretariats, departments, 
agencies) converging on the central administration in Paris, 
while what is missing is transverse communications routes! Thus 
we have a perfectly centralized system, one that is designed to 
serve the state alone (that is, its function) but lacks internal 
flexibility. Most important, it does not have natural channels 
to the business sector, even though that is the nurturing medium 
in which the life of the whole complex develops. 
  Another schematic, expanded to include all of the public and 
private sources, of which there are many, shows a dispersed 
network in which the only strong link is that between the state 
and the nationalized enterprises. Each of the other client 
categories (territorial collectives, large enterprises, PME 
[small- and medium-size businesses]-PMI [small- and medium-size 
industries], banks, and trade unions) has very little 
communication or poor communication--or none at all--with its 
other economic partners. 
  Thus, one can identify the principal gaps in our system. 
There is an absence of state policy on economic intelligence; 
global disinterest in the matter on the part of the elected 
officials; an almost total failure to exploit the remarkable 
resource represented by the French-speaking world; very little 
transfer of knowledge from the military-industrial complex to 
civilian enterprises; very little use being made of intelligence 
by the PME-PMI; total inactivity on the part of the trade 
unions, contrary to the practice of their German counterparts; 
and heavy foreign domination of the offices of private 
consultants who, as everyone realizes, know everything about a 
business after an audit. 
  Considering the matter from the point of view of the 
business 
sector, for the moment, we see that in the most important 
businesses, the economic intelligence function is inadequately 
integrated in the strategies of the top management and general 
staffs. In the PME-PMI, the problem is most often ignored, or is 
not dealt with due, one must assume, to the lack of resources or 
the lack of time. The CCI [Chambers of Commerce and Industry], 
for their part, are beginning to open up to economic 
intelligence, some of them quite dynamically. 
  Overall, the use made of economic intelligence is limited, 
for the most part, to the establishment of centers for 
documentation or oversight, the creation or consultation of data 
banks, and the organization of industrial safety or security 
teams. It is true that these elements, often dealt with very 
capably, are indispensable, but they are but a part of the 
whole. They are scattered tools the use of which is not 
integrated on the basis of a vision of the whole, much less a 
collective dynamic. Having made this statement of what is 
missing overall, it is useful to look for the causes thereof. 
<H5>  The Causes </H5>
  An earlier study devoted to intelligence[.sup]1[/] 
provided me with an opportunity to express my regret that our 
French character is hardly such as to direct us toward 
collective effort, nor toward the somewhat strict disciplines 
required for the mastery of information. Economic intelligence 
is the twin of information--without being identical to it, if 
only because of its open nature--"to a sufficient extent" to 
justify using the same reason to explain the same effects. At 
the outset, there are many cultural characteristics that result 
in blockages in the structures, ways of thinking, and behaviors. 
  Where institutions are concerned, the longstanding trend 
toward centralization, the cult of regalian power, the 
difficulty of establishing procedures for dialogue--all of these 
things are basically opposed to the circulation of information, 
which, while it is not handed down the line willingly, does not 
move up the line any more easily. Information is power, and it 
will therefore be generated with such caution that it may 
perhaps be obsolete even before it has served anyone's purposes. 
The hierarchic procedures used in government departments for 
disseminating information might thus prove counterproductive in 
some cases. Moreover, the indispensable rules for protecting 
confidentiality constitute obstacles, in a number of cases, such 
that the sharing of the wealth contained in information is 
impossible. And so it is that overall the norms for classifying 
information in the public departments and the private sector, 
with all texts being drafted in isolation, constitute a jungle 
of prohibitions and procedures rather than a clear and 
consistent system adapted to the operational needs imposed by 
the new stakes in world economic competition. 
  The difficulty is even greater if the problem is considered 
on the European level. The Europol project designed to combat 
the traffic in drugs is coming up against national regulations 
that are blocking the creation of a complete central index for 
the use of the police and customs authorities in all of the 
signatory nations. 
  Thus, the government departments, which are oriented more 
toward the upper levels and toward themselves than downward, or 
even toward their neighbors, constitute in themselves the 
framework for constraints and major contradictions that are 
hindering the establishment of a state economic intelligence 
dynamic. 
  In the majority of the enterprises, the absence of an 
economic intelligence background is reflected in numerous ways. 
The problems include the intermingling of espionage and open 
research (the only realm of interest to us here), the inadequate 
mastery of the realities in the war of competition, the 
resistance to the compartmentalization of sensitive intelligence 
because of the fear of internal repercussions on human 
relations, the difficulty of expressing information needs, the 
refusal to recognize that useful information has its price, the 
limitation of practical use to the single realm of technological 
oversight, the lack of awareness of the collective aspect of the 
problem on the part of personnel, and a decision-making process 
that gives the owner's intuition priority over a rational 
analysis of the factors involved. Within the context of the war 
of competition, these errors spell eternal doom for those 
enterprises--particularly those in the key industrial 
sectors--that fail to learn to correct the situation through the 
specific integration of economic intelligence, specifically in 
their patterns of thinking and their practice. 
  In the banking sector, which is a pillar of the economy and 
the information crossroads, one must mourn the lack of a global 
apparatus for collecting and processing information. This is 
"each man for himself" elevated to a system that does not work 
to the benefit either of the cost price of information or the 
adoption of a veritable economic intelligence process. For those 
who realize that the banks are fundamentally more patrimonial 
than speculative (despite the recent real estate disaster) or 
industrial, this attitude comes as no surprise. Unlike the 
Anglo-Saxon banks, they hesitate to take risks. They differ from 
the German banks in that they reject commitments over the very 
long term, as well as the partnership with businesses without 
which there can be no veritable industrial policy.[.sup]2[/] 
Thus they are more inclined to defend than to attack. In 
pursuing this course, they carefully protect their own little 
patch, and they have, for example, thus far effectively 
contained the Japanese competition in the deposits sector, 
thanks to a well-established network and extremely functional 
internal organization. Although that is true, their offensive 
approach is less well-established. Does the Credit Lyonnais 
still remember that at the beginning of this century it had such 
an exemplary information system that some Swedish banks sent spy 
missions to Paris to learn how it operated? Are our commercial 
banks offering our enterprises services as complete and dynamic 
as those the German banks routinely provide to their clients? 
Didn't the recent disaster in real estate investments cost 
vastly more than would have been the case with a reasonable 
economic intelligence apparatus involving a minimum of 
structures, some resources, a special training plan, and, above 
all, a minimum of exchange of information? 
  Thus, the same cultural causes give rise to the same losses 
and inadequacies. Our well-known individualism is naturally 
opposed to the sharing of information and to its joint 
enrichment. It is indeed true that powerful networks exist, for 
example that of the "old boys" who are the products of 
prestigious crucibles (the "great schools") and who do 
communicate, but mainly among their peers. And the sum of the 
private interests does not always coincide with the overall 
collective interest. Moreover, our Latin fondness for the spoken 
word does not make us paragons of discretion. And in addition to 
that, our curiosity is opposed to the application of the 
frustrating "need-to-know" rule, which limits access to 
information. And then, too, we prefer the appearance of 
immediate results to the essential nature of long-term 
undertakings. That having been said, self-flagellation is not an 
end in itself, and we are not, after all, without certain 
weapons for waging the necessary battle--with a view to winning 
it, of course. 
<H5>  The Planning Laboratory </H5>
  The globalization of the economy and the stakes in the 
integration of France into the European Community have led the 
departments under the prime minister (General Planning Board, 
Technological and Industrial Development Service) to reflect on 
our industrial capacity to compete and, in particular, with Mr. 
Henri Martre presiding, on the subject of "economic intelligence 
and strategy in the business sector." For one whole year 
(September 1992 to October 1993), therefore, some 50 
representatives of all of the participants in economic life 
(businesses, social partners, local agents, public authorities, 
and members of the European Commission) labored on this new 
theme, putting together a very important and original base of 
knowledge, as presented in this article. Three working subgroups 
studied the following complementary themes: comparative analysis 
of the economic intelligence systems throughout the world; 
economic intelligence within the enterprise sector; and national 
considerations, prospects, and actions. 
  The first positive consequence of this work was that it 
brought together the main agents in economic activities and the 
professional users of information, which circumstances (and 
compartmentalization) usually keep separate. An evident 
synergetic effect favoring a subsequent horizontal 
demultiplication of activity (proceeding within networks) could 
be noted. A single example illustrates this statement. The work 
done revealed that there has usually been a lack of studies 
undertaken following commercial failures. As a result, the idea 
of looking for the causes of an exemplary failure, such as the 
failure to sell a weapons system to a foreign country because a 
competing product won out, was born. The study pursued led to 
pertinent conclusions that could be used immediately by the 
interested parties, the most important being the great 
difficulty encountered in using an approach of the economic 
intelligence type. The second consequence was the identification 
of the main sources of dysfunction, some of which have been 
described above. The third consequence was a number of 
recommendations that can provide a guide for perfecting a model 
of a system adapted to our needs and our culture were inspired. 
<H5>  A Possible National Model </H5>
  The established importance of cultural factors in economic 
intelligence points to the need for a French model. Thus for us, 
it is a matter of incorporating the methods tested elsewhere and 
deemed transposable, on the basis of what we are and the 
nonvariable factors in our general organization, while at the 
same time enriching this experience with the many contributions 
our natural flexibility will make possible. While it is clearly 
understood that business must be at the heart of the desired 
system, it must also be noted that today it will be possible to 
reach the critical mass needed for the efficiency of the whole 
only with the power of the state apparatus. The German and 
Japanese examples are explicit in this regard. Our lengthy 
experience in mixed state and private sector structures may 
prove a decisive trump, if we are able to make the mechanisms 
run more smoothly and truly put them in the service of the 
enterprises. It is in this way that it should be possible to 
find "the most French solution." 
  In our research, we immediately rejected the Japanese model 
based on a collective organization, real estate discipline, and 
a desire to dominate that we do not have. We will maintain some 
distance, as well, from the Anglo-Saxon model, the liberal 
certainties of which are debatable. This will not be easy, for 
the majority of our elite personnel have been steeped in this 
model, and our training schools are not prepared for such a 
development. However, the facts will force them to admit, along 
with Christian Harbulot, that "an effective information strategy 
today must be built around a national economy dominated by an 
objective alliance between the private sector and the public 
sector." 
  With this in mind, it could be noted that the German model 
is 
of great interest to us. Its power rests, on the one hand--we 
saw this earlier--on a synergy realized among businesses, banks, 
insurance companies, and the public authority, which includes 
both the federal departments (information project-study 
department) and the Lander (bodies working to develop 
mixed-capital commercial ventures). We have noted that in France 
the main poles of economic intelligence have been the 
enterprises, the state (central departments and various bodies), 
and the territorial collectives. The recommendations as to the 
desirable directions to be pursued in the effort to make our 
model, properly adapted and efficient, a reality, remain to be 
proposed. 
<H5>  The Role of the State </H5>
  Without in any way taking the place of the enterprises, the 
state should play a major role in the prospective path that 
concerns us. It should be an institutional role, first, defining 
a veritable economic security doctrine, which is the 
indispensable framework for the articulation of the various 
mechanisms making up the desired intelligence apparatus. The 
existing texts were drafted with the prospect of a wartime 
economy in mind. They must be adapted to the economic war in the 
peacetime in which we are living our daily lives. This means, 
first of all, a review of the conditions governing access to the 
information in the hands of government departments[.sup]3[/]; 
a still more refined definition of economic crimes, including 
those affecting information; and, finally, a drastic escalation 
of the applicable penalties. It is true that the new Penal Code 
will not go into effect until March 1994. 
  A second series of efforts will focus on the mastery of 
information, both on the national level, where the complete 
cycle should be improved, and on the level of Europe, with a 
view, in particular, to the new threats of major economic crime. 
A third improvement will involve filling in the prevailing gaps 
separating the central and regional administrations and the 
private sector. A special effort to make good use of the foreign 
trade networks is also needed. Much could be done to make 
standard information generally available.[.sup]4[/] On all 
levels, the formats for access should be modified in order to 
separate the portion of information that is protected from that 
which can be disseminated. A veritable commercial logistics 
system for information must be created to let the public know of 
the existence of studies and reports that are not confidential, 
to automate access to them and to organize independent 
dissemination. All of this can be entirely profitable, because 
information today has its price. Cooperation between government 
experts and those in the user enterprises could also be 
organized. 
  The role of the state in providing incentives might involve 
sponsoring the development of new careers in the information 
field, establishing pilot programs at the nationalized banks to 
implement an economic intelligence policy of collective interest 
in this professional sector, and encouraging individual and 
group undertakings oriented toward the development of economic 
intelligence. Thus, without creating additional structures, and 
at the same time seeking out new sources of income, the state 
could encourage the establishment of a veritable information 
project-study system. 
<H5>  The Territorial Organizations </H5>
  The primary role of the territorial organizations should be 
the coordination of activities. Each of these entities (regions, 
departments, communes, CRCI [Republican Committee for Trade and 
Industry], CCI, and professional associations) have, in fact, 
quasi-independent relations with the state and with foreign 
countries. One can imagine the duplication, the loss of 
information, the blurring of our image abroad, and the bargains 
made available to foreign competitors. On the basis of the 
observations made in countries as dissimilar as Germany, South 
Korea, and Sweden, it appears clear that the key role in the 
organization of the circulation of economic information is 
played by the regional councils, which have the power and the 
financial means, and the chambers of commerce. Situated halfway 
between the enterprises and the government departments, they 
comprise the privileged level for contact with the PME-PMI. This 
explains, for example, why they have given priority to 
scientific and technical information (because of the proximity 
of the ARIST's,[.sup]5[/]) as well as the protection of 
assets (the main concern of the enterprises). On a parallel 
basis, the 21 regional chambers and the 162 local chambers of 
commerce should, then, make the best possible use of the 
potential offered, first by the 25 ARIST's, which employ 150 
information experts and 750 assistants distributed among the 25 
regional centers, by helping them to develop their activities 
and to play a larger role; and then by the 184 economic 
information centers, the 25 regional international documentation 
centers, the 29 "Euro-infocenters," etc. They could also 
identify the relationships among the commercial forces in order 
to establish the levels and the intersecting points for the 
circulation of information and the improvement of operational 
information. They could develop a broad sensitivity to economic 
intelligence and training for the designated agents. They could 
report on the use of the very numerous national data banks 
(Delphes, Telefirm, Firmexport, Perene) and various others, of 
which there are scores. They could further develop local 
training and commercial English, the inevitable key to the 
export sector. The field of desirable and possible actions 
available to the regional councils and the chambers of commerce 
is thus limitless. 
<H5>  The Business Sector </H5>
  For the business sector, the base of the economy, the 
frequent source of, and the logical terminus for information, 
the task involves giving the economic intelligence function the 
place it deserves, on an urgent basis. If this is not done, it 
will mean bankruptcy or the loss of autonomy. Business 
structures must, first of all, explicitly integrate the 
intelligence function in general management in which the 
dominant information triad ideally includes strategy and two 
principal adjuncts. One is "intelligence," which dictates what 
one should do as a function of the "prior information" available 
on the sector and the competition. Then there is the "logistics" 
adjunct, which dictates what one can do with the existing 
resources. Strategy then issues its instructions to the 
operational agents. We have moved far away from our habitual 
civilian and military practices. It is essential that it be 
possible, within each enterprise, to identify the director of 
"intelligence" as such. His authority will extend to the 
"economic intelligence" structure, to the resources, the 
procedures, and the training. 
  The structure should include a department 
responsible for sponsoring research, the utilization of the 
results, their dissemination, and information 
security,[.sup]6[/] as well as cells in the various 
departments of the enterprise. One employee will deal with 
economic intelligence locally in each of its basic and daily 
aspects. Experts will occupy the positions requiring lengthy 
training. 
  Resources are absolutely essential. A budget must 
be agreed upon, one sufficient to guarantee the establishment 
and activity of networks, the tracking of competition, the 
gathering and processing of documents, various equipment, 
security, and training. 
  The procedures used must be precise, diversified, 
and adapted to all the activities in professional life--contacts 
and travel, conduct in the field, active security, the gathering 
of information, accounting, the daily attitude toward internal 
and external information, and daily protective procedures. 
  Training must be simultaneously broad (general 
consciousness-raising) and specialized (for the economic 
intelligence employees and the experts in utilization and 
security), and it must have precise objectives (specific phases). 
  It is necessary to develop the conviction that economic 
intelligence as a new weapon can only be effective in an 
enterprise at the price of definitive commitment on the part of 
the general management and real support from the personnel, and, 
a fortiori, its representatives. Today, the threat of 
unemployment is giving powerful impetus to the needed 
development of thinking. Also, of course, the concept of 
economic intelligence will inevitably contribute to the cohesion 
of the enterprise. 
  Thus a mastery of understanding in the economy should lead 
to 
a whole spectrum of specific measures designed to produce a 
French model, the characteristics of which might be summarized 
as follows. 
  A flexible and well-adapted state structure: 
Following the revision of the legislative and regulatory texts 
and the establishment of an efficient administrative information 
network oriented toward the business sector, specific measures 
would allow a collective culture and practice to emerge, 
particularly regarding auxiliary activities in the realm of 
training and the sponsorship of innovative public and private 
projects. 
  Territorial organizations taking the initiative, 
financing projects, and more efficiently coordinating and 
demultiplying information, to the direct benefit of businesses. 
  Banks making more dynamic prospective utilization 
of information to the benefit of the client enterprises, which 
ask only to become partners. 
  Simplified enterprises, routinely receiving 
information from the government departments and the banks, and 
experienced in aggressive and legal economic intelligence 
practices. 
  It is therefore clearly with a view to a collective and 
aggressive information culture that all of the protagonists in 
our national economic life must unite their efforts. The 
tribulations experienced by the SME [European Monetary System] 
during the summer and the dispute about GATT have clearly 
demonstrated that this national framework is not yet obsolete, 
however necessary the search for a homogeneous European complex, 
united against the two other continental economic blocs being 
established, remains. We, too, can legitimately seek to have an 
economic intelligence system adapted to our individual 
characteristics and our interests. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  The increasingly keen economic competition on the 
international level has long since made the productivist logic 
of Taylor obsolete. We have proceeded from "produce, first" to 
"sell at any price," and this imperative has had as its 
corollaries increasingly "harsh" practices, even approaching 
criminality. This competitive confrontation has become a complex 
phenomenon. With the globalization of the economy, everything is 
developing as if the planet had shrunk. The commercial 
opportunities are dwindling steadily, and competition is 
becoming visible on various levels in the international market. 
The business sector thus finds itself at the point where the 
tensions and multiple contradictions described in the first part 
of this article intersect. Management of this complexity 
requires various tools, and economic intelligence is one of 
those in the front rank. 
  Since our country failed to appreciate the dimensions of the 
phenomenon in time, we find ourselves faced with the situation 
familiar to all of us. The damage done is considerable, and it 
has not yet been fully assessed. We note the unemployment, but 
not the slow takeover of our best enterprises by foreign 
capital--capital that in some cases is not even European. Is 
anyone aware that a third of our PME-PMI that have more than 250 
employees are no longer French? 
  Within this critical context, we can no longer afford to 
savor the delights and the horrors of Gallic discord. We must 
make the cultural leap recommended by Toffler because today 
"knowledge is moving to the top of the list of resources," and 
it can only be obtained on the basis of "the free flow of 
information." And that, in turn, depends on the organization of 
information channels. To achieve all this, we must change our 
assessment of the world around us and learn to interweave 
information and strategy, on the one hand, and innovation and 
the assessment of competitive forces, on the other. Only a 
collective advance in economic intelligence can enable us to 
resolve this new and complex equation. 
  However, the game is far from lost. What has been our 
weakness can become our strength. It has now been established 
that only those information systems backed by the power of the 
state can achieve critical mass. Our long tradition of ongoing 
relations with the establishment gives us a real advantage--for 
example, over the American society. Our Latin nature, keen and 
curious, intuitive and "Cartesian," predisposes us to 
intelligent research and the sensible employment of useful 
information. There must be better coordination between these two 
phases, just as down the line the distribution of information 
must be organized. This latter is the realm in which the 
Japanese and the Germans excel. 
  What we need now is a collective desire, properly adapted 
tools, and coordinated undertakings by the practitioners 
themselves, operating on functional levels. The state must 
introduce some flexibility into its powerful and diversified 
machinery. The territorial organizations must play their 
intermediary role more effectively. Our banks must draw 
inspiration from the German banks. And our enterprises must be 
daring! In these times of grave crisis, this national ambition 
can only be transformed into a reality through the joint actions 
of the citizen--the individual economic operator whose concern 
is his job--and the public and private enterprises and 
bodies--the collective economic protagonists who are focused on 
their tasks or their balance sheets. Let us all remember that 
economic intelligence is a state of mind, that it is a matter of 
a collective information culture...and that it will reward each 
individual information recipient one hundredfold. 
  Following the end of the Cold War, this is the challenge of 
the hour: the mastery of useful information, which is the new 
key to power because it makes the adoption of decisions based on 
a strategic perspective possible. Let us state it plainly. 
Economic intelligence is legitimate, and all advanced countries 
make use of it. This will not be easy, but we no longer have a 
choice. And then, "where there is a will, there is a way." Let 
us boldly take up the challenge that economic intelligence 
represents.

  1. "Toward an Intelligence Culture," DEFENSE NATIONALE, May 
1992. 
  2. It must be said in their defense that the 1981 
nationalizations affected the private banks owned by the 
industrial groups in particular, interrupting a process "in the 
German fashion" that is well-adapted to economic competition. 
  3. For example, the protection provided Ministerial 
Instruction No. 486 by the notation "limited distribution" is 
counterproductive. This useful document should be freely 
circulated. 
  4. The Beatrice customs authorities' data bank, for example, 
is not sufficiently well-known. 
  5. Regional scientific and technical information agencies. 
  6. There is an academic dispute between the advocates of 
autonomous security and those who urge integrated security. 
Since the real situations vary infinitely from one business to 
the next, the proper solution is that which proves best adapted 
locally.

  [Text] Geneva, Jan 25 (AFP) -- The 39-nation UN Conference 
on Disarmament opened here Tuesday [25 January] with French 
Ambassador Gerard Errera denouncing North Korea's [DPRK] refusal 
to allow international inspections of its nuclear sites. 
  Errera, chairman of the conference, said Pyongyang's refusal 
cannot be "treated as only a regional issue." 
  He said the world's major nuclear powers -- the United 
States, Russia, France, Britain and China -- could not "accept 
to impose nuclear constraints on themselves if other countries 
continue to secretly develop nuclear weapons programs." 
  North Korea suspended inspections of its nuclear sites by 
the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in January 1993 and 
three months later threatened to pull-out of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, sparking fears that it was developing 
or had already developed a nuclear bomb. 
  Errera added that Iraq had also raised fears within the 
international community that it was developing its nuclear 
capability and that the breakup of the Soviet Union was 
threatening the implementation of the non-proliferation treaty. 
  There are fears that stocks of fissionable material have 
been 
sold or otherwise channelled from former Soviet bloc countries 
to countries secretly engaged in nuclear research. 
  The UN conference here, aimed at securing pledges from the 
nuclear powers for a comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT), is to 
set up an ad-hoc committee to negotiate the treaty. 
  The United States has already expressed reservations about 
Iraq being a member. 
  UN representative Vladimir Petrovskiy said Tuesday that he 
would be in favor of enlarging the committee to include 
additional members. 
  Errera, in his opening statement, also said that "today's 
reality does not reflect the past where two superpowers could 
negotiate between themselves a disarmament treaty and then 
present it for ratification by the international community." 
  The five nuclear powers nevertheless have their own 
reservations about a CTBT. 
  The United States, Russia, France and Britain have for 
example suspended their tests, whereas China carried out an 
explosion as recently as last October and appears in no hurry to 
conclude testing. 
  In any event, signing a test ban treaty would in no way 
imply 
that the nuclear five were ready to give up their nuclear 
stockpiles or abandon the doctrine of nuclear deterrence. 
  Errera said he could not predict how long the conference 
would last. "The main thing is that the talks should be taken 
seriously so that we can work towards a treaty acceptable to 
everybody." 
  It appeared unlikely that they would conclude before the 
1995 
expiry date of the current Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
(NPT) which the Western powers wish to extend for a period of 
several years.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has called on the 
Syrian president to cover some more distance in order to meet 
Israel halfway for peace and to offer Israel a higher degree of 
security, one that would reflect Damascus' long-term intentions. 
The prime minister added that the al-Asad-Clinton meeting gave 
rise to the hope that Syria genuinely desired peace, the same 
kind of peace sought by Israel. 
  In an address before the Council of Europe, Mr. Rabin 
rejected the possibility of introducing any changes into the 
Madrid format. He stressed: We seek to achieve bilateral 
agreements in each of the negotiating tracks in a bid to attain 
comprehensive peace in the region. 
  Mr. Rabin urged the Palestinians not to permit religious and 
political zealots to divert them from the path of peace, 
promising that Israel would continue striking out at terrorism. 
  The prime minister reminded his audience that as the Six Day 
War chief of staff, he swore to be the last chief of staff 
forced to defend Israel from unreasonable lines of defense. Mr. 
Rabin added that Israel would not compromise on its security, 
although it is prepared to take calculated risks. 
  Toward the end of his address, the prime minister said: We 
yearn for 1994 to be a year of peace, and not a year of fiascoes.

  [Excerpts] Currently the plenary session of the 
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe is debating the 
situation in former Yugoslavia, more precisely, the effects of 
the embargo instated against former Yugoslavia [by the UN 
Security Council] on the economy of the neighboring countries. 
The afternoon session began with the speech of Thorvald 
Stoltenberg. [passage omitted] 
  The floor was also taken by Dumitru Buzatu, Romanian Chamber 
of Deputies member [and Vaslui deputy on behalf of the Social 
Democracy Party of Romania], who pointed out that, currently, 
further losses are registered in Romania's economy, which so far 
amount to over $7 billion. Senator Adrian Paunescu also took 
the floor to discuss that issue. He asserted that the embargo 
should be lifted and the principle of dialogue should be 
introduced. Romania is suffering, the PSM [Socialist Party of 
Labor] senator said, merely because of the wish to make Serbia 
suffer. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Annick Van Wallendael: "Belgian Blue Helmets </F>
Blocked by Fighting--Bosnia Road II Operations Delayed"] 
  [Text] Split (Croatia) -- The 81 UN troops who set out from 
Melsbroek yesterday to take part in the Bosnia Road II 
humanitarian aid operation were immediately faced with 
considerable difficulties. The engineering corps from Burcht, 
Jambes, Amay, and Peutie are supposed to relieve their 
French-speaking colleagues who have been stationed for the last 
four months in Kakanj, 40 km northwest of Sarajevo. However, 
fighting has turned this plan upside down. 
  A first group of 38 men from among the newcomers got caught 
up in Sarajevo, from where they probably headed for Zagreb. The 
second group of 43 men had to wait in Split. The withdrawal of 
the French-speaking detachment also went completely wrong. 
Their convoy was stopped by the Serbian militia 20 km outside 
Sarajevo. They will probably try to reach Sarajevo again today. 
  The fresh troops were meant to be flown in UN aircraft from 
Split to Sarajevo, in two groups. Armored cars were then 
supposed to take them on the last part of the journey to Kakanj. 
The departing troops were meant to cross with them in Sarajevo 
and fly back to Split in the same aircraft. Up to Split 
everything ran smoothly. As planned, the group split up into two 
sections. A first group of 38 men quickly boarded the plane for 
Sarajevo. However, fighting to the north of the city forced 
them to divert the flight, probably to Zagreb. 
  The failure of the rendezvous raises another problem: The 
fresh troops were supposed to receive bulletproof vests and UN 
helmets from the colleagues they are relieving. The shortage of 
bulletproof vests and helmets has long been the subject of 
debate.

<F P=106> [Article signed PL: "Inverted Salami Policy in Former </F>
Yugoslavia -- WEU Secretary General Van Eekelen"] 
  [Text] The United Nations is following inverted salami 
policies in the former Yugoslavia. Every week there is a new 
slice or resolution, without it becoming clear what is really 
wanted. These inverted salami policies are leading one general 
after another to leave the UN forces. 
  That is the opinion of W.F. Van Eekelen, the secretary 
general of the Western European Union (WEU). Looking to a 
possible peace settlement in the former Yugoslavia, he called 
for stronger policies yesterday. In a speech to the Belgian 
Netherlands Association, Van Eekelen denied he was seeking a 
military solution to the Yugoslav problem. But military 
resources must be deployed better to achieve the objectives. 
However, that presupposes that the objectives are formulated 
clearly. And so far that has not been the case. 
  Originally the WEU was responsible for enforcing the embargo 
against Serbia and Montenegro, and now it is also responsible 
for enforcing the Danube embargo. The organization is prepared 
to contribute to organizing the administration of Mostar by 
taking over police duties and other tasks related to public 
order. 
  The WEU was set up in 1948 and has 10 members: All the 
member states of the European Union [EU] except Ireland and 
Denmark, which are observers. Turkey, Norway, and Iceland are 
associate members. The Maastricht Treaty makes the WEU 
responsible for implementing the EU's decisions and measures in 
the field of defense. However, Van Eekelen pointed out that 
collective defense was no longer the priority of the WEU 
countries. After all, the former East Bloc is no longer an 
immediate threat. At present the military-operational aspect is 
becoming particularly important: How can the soldiers be 
deployed? 
<H5>  European Leadership </H5>
  Like NATO, the WEU presently is also unable to offer the 
East 
European countries full membership, Van Eekelen said. Countries 
which have not joined the EU cannot become members of the WEU. 
WEU members are obliged to offer each other military assistance 
if one of them is attacked. Such a guarantee could be offered 
only to countries which followed the same policies, according to 
the WEU secretary general. 
  For Van Eekelen, the recent NATO summit was virtually a 
revolution. He has long said that it must be possible for the 
armies of the countries concerned to be able to operate in both 
NATO and WEU contexts. The NATO summit decided, following a 
U.S. proposal, that NATO resources could be made available to 
the WEU. This brings an end to the competition between the 
United States and Europe. The U.S. military presence in Europe 
will be maintained, but that does not mean that the United 
States will take part in all operations in Europe. U.S. 
leadership therefore will no longer be the same as in the past. 
It seems self-evident that this U.S. leadership will be 
replaced in Europe by a European leadership. But that is easier 
said than done, according to Van Eekelen. Because this European 
leadership must not become French, German, or British 
leadership. Therefore convergence is the watchword in this area.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with General Philippe Morillon, former </F>
UN commander in Bosnia, by Philippe Paquet and Christophe 
Lamfalussy; place and date not given: "General Morillon: We 
Need Air Power"; first paragraph is LA LIBRE BELGIQUE 
introduction] 
  [Text] Believe and dare! You have to be 
General Morillon to give such a title -- at a time of such 
disillusionment -- to a book about the war in Bosnia. But, 
although he is seeking to bring a message of hope, particularly 
to the younger generations who may be tempted to believe that 
the world has gone mad in the former Yugoslavia, the former 
commander of UN peacekeeping operations in Bosnia qualifies 
these words six months after his departure from Sarajevo. 
  "Today, I would be inclined to say `dare to believe' as this 
is something which is becoming increasingly difficult to do," 
admits Philippe Morillon in an interview granted to LA LIBRE 
BELGIQUE. "I refuse to despair. I want to believe that peace 
is still possible, that the ethnic divisions are not so deep as 
to prevent a return to community life in the future. In the 
field, in any case, our men believe in this because they see the 
usefulness of what they are doing. But they need the full 
backing of public opinion; if ever doubt takes hold, then we 
must pull them out." 
<H5>  Reply And Retaliation </H5>
  Such doubt could stem from what General Morillon refers to 
as 
"a misunderstanding, or lack of understanding," among the 
general public and also on the part of certain politicians "to 
whom we have not sufficiently explained exactly what the 
military is calling for in Bosnia." 
  "We need a sufficient reply capability, which should not be 
confused with a retaliation capability which we are not asking 
for. It is a question of guaranteeing legitimate defense and to 
do that air power is essential. It is the only way of replying 
to artillery attacks with the necessary precision as the 
batteries which must be taken out are often located behind 
civilian shields -- hospitals and schools, etc. -- which must 
not be touched. An armed plane or helicopter can fulfill this 
mission as was shown in the Gulf War. Also, this force would 
also have a deterrent value. People may be brave, they are not 
necessarily reckless." 
<H5>  The Somali Trap </H5>
  "The one thing we must avoid," continues Philippe Morillon, 
"is to confuse intervention and humanitarian aid as we did in 
Somalia. That is a mistake, a disastrous confusion of different 
kinds of activity. Our task is to see that humanitarian aid 
gets through, without which no survival is possible -- at least 
during winter -- and we must not fall into the trap of those who 
claim that by providing this aid we are simply prolonging the 
war. And if we have chosen not to intervene -- that is not to 
side with any of the belligerent parties -- it is because we 
believe the remedy would be worse than the disease, that we 
would be serving to deepen the divide between the communities." 
<H5>  There Is Still Time </H5>
  General Morillon believes that "it is not too late to stop 
the ethnic cleansing, but the situation gets worse by the day, 
due to the continuing destruction which deepens the divide, and 
people being exiled. This is an absolute necessity. We must, 
for example, oppose the creation of a Muslim state in the heart 
of Bosnia because that would give a doomed hope to Muslim 
fundamentalism and create a Gaza Strip in Europe. This is why 
the Western objective is to reestablish a multicultural 
democracy in the former Yugoslavia." 
  Despite the protracted Bosnian conflict, Philippe Morillon 
wants to believe that this objective can still be met but, he 
stresses: "We must be careful not to become impatient. The new 
international order cannot be established overnight. This 
country will escape from its present drama when its citizens 
have understood that they must no longer allow themselves to be 
led to collective suicide by a handful of extremists who hold 
power. I believe that if free elections were held in Bosnia 
today, the extremists would be driven from office. Failing 
this, we must give notice to all the protagonists to act in 
accordance with the desire for peace they profess." 
<H5>  Stop the Hypocrisy </H5>
  In the meantime, concludes the hero of Srebrenica, 
"countries 
must stop the hypocrisy of refusing to grant the United Nations 
the necessary resources to implement the missions they confer 
upon it. Countries which do not even pay their debts with 
respect to an international organization which -- in any event 
-- we simply cannot do without."

<F P=106> [Report by Sophie Huet: "According to a Senate Report: </F>
Schengen Agreements Inapplicable for One Year"] 
  [Text] The Senate fact-finding mission formed 31 months 
ago to verify the conditions for the implementation of the 
Schengen agreement, which eliminates the internal borders and 
makes provision for the free movement of people and goods within 
the European Union, yesterday issued its final report concluding 
that the system is inapplicable. "This is our third 
postponement," Xavier de Villepin (centrist, representing 
expatriate French citizens), chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Affairs Commission, stressed. 
  As the author of the mission's report, de Villepin 
reaffirmed 
that the free movement of people had originally been set for 1 
January 1993 when the single market came into force, then it was 
postponed until October 1993 (Madrid Conference), until December 
1993 (Paris summit), and again postponed until 1 February 1994, 
the date put forward as "an essential deadline." Even before 
the Senate report was published, Bernd Schmidbauer, the German 
secretary of state to the Chancellery responsible for European 
questions, said yesterday morning that the elimination of 
identity checks at the borders of the nine European Union 
countries would have to be postponed again because it is 
"totally impossible on 1 February." 
  The implementation of this agreement is encountering one 
main 
difficulty: The establishment of the Schengen Information 
System (SIS), the joint computer facility which should make it 
possible for the Schengen signatory states (namely the Twelve 
minus Britain, Ireland, and Denmark) to consult police and legal 
data. Paul Masson (Rally for the Republic, Loiret), chairman of 
the Senate fact-finding mission, blames "the dilution of 
responsibility," the "bad choice of technicians" responsible for 
designing the SIS, the conditions in which the contract was 
awarded, and the loss of control over technical tests. "The 
current failure of the SIS results from a series of dysfunctions 
in the Schengen system without it being possible to identify a 
single culprit," the report stresses. "The failure is 
collective. It is grave, serious, and bitter, and it undermines 
the credibility of an entire organization.... It is the system 
as a whole which must be reviewed." 
  The Senators' disappointment is particularly great because 
France has launched a complex process of adapting its 
Constitution (twice), its legislation (six laws passed), and its 
regulations to conform to the Schengen agreement. 
<H5>  Cornerstone </H5>
  The Senate mission also heard European Affairs Minister 
Alain 
Lamassoure on 11 January and he confirmed this assessment: "The 
internal legal provisions we have made in connection with the 
implementation of the Schengen convention will not be 
implemented on 1 February," the minister stressed, explaining 
that internal border controls and the police system would not be 
relaxed "until the Schengen convention is implemented." 
  In the view of Xavier de Villepin and Paul Masson, the delay 
in the implementation of the SIS cannot be made up in less than 
a year. This computer network, costing 30 million francs (France 
contributed 26.8 percent of its financing), was designed badly 
from the start, and it is, in a way, "the cornerstone" of the 
Schengen agreement. The direct result of this is that all the 
joint policies drawn up in the Schengen framework (in the area 
of the right to asylum, the granting of visas, external border 
controls, airport equipment, combating illegal immigration, and 
drug trafficking) are blocked "for an indefinite period" 
creating "a major legal and technical vacuum."

<F P=106> [Report by Wilhelm Ortmayr: "`New Army Structure:' An Army </F>
Is Slimming Down"] 
  [Text] "At 0800 [0700 GMT] on 9 February, you have to join 
your unit for a one-day special military exercise. Please bring 
along all the military clothes and equipment that you received." 
These weeks and months, all over Austria, tens of thousands of 
militia soldiers will receive similar call-up orders. He who 
has a company commander who is generous with information may 
learn from an accompanying letter that this is a measure within 
the framework of restructuring the Federal Army and that the 
exercise will be held in civilian clothes. This is necessary 
because some men will turn in their military clothes. No 
further details are mentioned. 
  The largest organizational reform of the Federal Army in 20 
years is taking place almost without people noticing. 
"Heeresgliederung (HG) neu" ["New Army Structure"] is the 
catchword, and it will lead to a reduction of the real 
mobilizing strength from 240,000 to 120,000 men. The new 
definition of tasks provides for disaster relief, assistance 
operations (Burgenland), and border protection operations 
(Slovenia 1991). A limited defensive action is regarded as less 
probable, although manageable. 
  In the future, potential threats are to be warded off at the 
border. For this purpose, a 15,000-men reaction force should be 
available by 1995, two-thirds of which will consist of 
professional soldiers. How much the new army structure focuses 
on operations is also reflected in the fact that there is no 
longer a differentiation between organization for peace and for 
operations. 
  The new structure provides for three corps, each consisting 
of one command battalion, one telecommunications battalion, one 
engineering battalion, and one reconnaissance battalion. 
Moreover, there are artillery, medical, and supply units at 
regiment strength. The 3d Corps (Lower and Upper Austria) has 
one extra regiment of engineers and the three Army brigades of 
armored infantrymen. 
  In the sphere of the military command of Carinthia, Styria, 
and Burgenland, two brigades of infantrymen each -- each with 
4,000 men -- and several units of guards and blocking troops 
will be set up. In the remaining six military commands, only 
brigades of infantrymen and guards and blocking troops will be 
established. 
  With the establishment of the new army structure, almost all 
area-bound units (such as blocking battalions) have been 
dissolved. Only the personnel of the fixed installations retain 
their assignments. The futures of militia soldiers of dissolved 
units will depend on their qualifications, their abilities, and 
the personnel needs of the new units. What is certain is that 
all militia soldiers who have reached the new 35-year age limit 
will be discharged. Those who are younger and have not yet 
served all compulsory 60 days of exercises have to continue 
service until the age of 35, unless they are no longer needed 
because there are enough men or because of insufficient 
qualifications. 
  The establishment of the new 120,000-man task organization 
will be concluded by the middle of 1995. "The conversion is 
going really well as far as the militia are concerned," 
Brigadier Friedrich Hessel, head of the General Staff Department 
in the Defense Ministry said. All troops receive Field Uniform 
75 and Automatic Rifle 77. The old uniforms and the 58-rifle 
will no longer be used. 
  The restructuring process will take somewhat longer in the 
area of training units. "Service regulations and ossified 
structures will cause delays," Hessel said. The 
Landwehrstammregimenter (LWSR) (infantry parent regiments), 
which were needed in the past as recruit schools for the militia 
army, have ceased to exist at the beginning of the year. In 
Lower Austria, for example, the LWSR 32 (Korneuburg) and 33 
(Mautern) will become Motorized Infantry Regiment 3. The 
facilities will be kept. 
  Basically, one can say that each unit will train its own 
recruits. He who starts his basic military service at Motorized 
Infantry Regiment 8 in Salzburg, will be used as a militia 
soldier within the framework of Motorized Infantry Brigade 8. 
  Even in the restructured army, somewhat more than half of 
those doing basic military service will serve eight months in a 
row. Then they will be assigned to a task organization for a 
few years without, however, having to participate in any 
exercises. Those who used to serve six months will now have to 
do seven months, with the last 30 days mainly being dedicated to 
operational exercises. Then the remaining 30 days will have to 
be served in two-year intervals in the form of six-day exercises. 
  Social hardship -- that is to say the dismissal of 
professional soldiers -- should be avoided whenever possible, 
although some officers and noncommissioned officers might be 
forced to commute to other facilities. "A soldier has to be 
that flexible," Brigadier Hessel said.

  [Text] [Announcer] Joerg Haider, chairman of the Freedom 
Party of Austria, commented on President Thomas Klestil's 
marital problems today. He does not want to assume the role of 
a marriage guidance councilor, but he believes that Klestil 
should either settle his problems quickly or resign from office, 
he pointed out. 
  [Haider] I believe that political reason commands him to 
settle his matters in a way that restores public respect. The 
public discussion of the private affair of an official figure 
should be prevented. Doing nothing would be the worst thing in 
the current situation. Thus, I think that the damage for the 
country must now be limited. This is the most important thing. 
Our international standing has certainly not improved as a 
result of this affair. For this reason, it is important to 
settle it quickly. I do not want to say any more at present. 
If he is not in a position to resolve the matter, he will have 
to relinquish his office anyway. Somebody else will then have 
to fill this position.

  [Text] "Scandalo rosa all'Hofburg," writes Milan's 
CORRIERE. This evokes pictures of a horse-drawn carriage, 
curtains drawn, that takes Mary from the ballet to the crown 
prince's chambers. 
  Good for tourism, bad for the republic. Seriously: The 
image of a scandal-ridden operetta-like Austria, unable to 
govern itself properly, suits the plans of certain political 
groups very well. The Vienna correspondent of the nationalist 
conservative FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE has been writing for years 
that only the German nationalist Joerg Haider can "renew" the 
country. Haider's Pan-Germanic guru Andreas Moelzer justifies 
his anschluss fantasies with the argument that Austria "is 
unable to survive without outside help." A "pink scandal in the 
presidential office" perfectly suits the plans of a change to 
the "Third Republic."

<F P=106> [Gerfried Sperl editorial: "Every Day Everything -- or </F>
Nothing"] 
  [Text] In his decision to talk publicly about his 
problems, President Klestil only told half the truth. Now the 
whole truth has become apparent. The word "resignation" 
appeared for the first time on the front page of a daily -- as 
though NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG had decided to abandon him after it 
had insinuated, with the help of a few readers' letters a few 
days earlier, that people believed that he ("and his family") 
should be left alone. Has Thomas Klestil caused this media war 
through carelessness? Will he receive EVERYTHING EVERYDAY -- or 
will he be left without anything in the end? 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton is also facing media reports 
about former mistresses. Still, the population apparently 
judges him by his domestic achievements and his performance as 
President. Polls have been showing large popular support for 
some time -- for good reasons: Clinton did not offer stories 
about his past to the media, and he did not appoint beauty 
queens as members of his cabinet. His political program is not 
shaped and influenced by a mistress -- even if only optically. 
  On the other hand, the interviews with Edith Klestil have 
shown how eloquent and quick-witted the "First Lady" is. It has 
become clear that she might have been able to assume political 
tasks beyond the duties laid down in the protocol, that she 
might have become a mini-Hillary at the Hofburg Palace. Thus, 
it is all the more understandable that, as a first conclusion, 
she left the official villa and not her husband, who must have 
left her a long time ago as far as his feelings are concerned. 
  Even though Klestil's resignation might seem obvious to 
some, 
and even though some of his friends in the Austrian People's 
Party might not be too unhappy about that, resignation should 
not be offered as an easy solution to the president -- all the 
more so because the idea was launched by tabloids. Moreover, a 
resignation by the president is not covered by the Constitution 
-- as though the rules of the monarchy were still valid. 
  Naturally Austria has not plunged into a state crisis 
because 
of this affair. The president continues to be able to act 
politically. However, the need for the president to settle his 
private matters that even effects his closest aides at the 
office is all the greater. What is the real problem? 
  First, a clarification is required regarding the private 
sphere that was sold to the population as intact during the 
election campaign. Klestil should try to win back his wife on 
her conditions or seek a divorce. In both cases, his aide 
Margot Loeffler would have to return to the Foreign Ministry, 
which could be ordered by the foreign minister, who is her 
official boss. 
  Second, the office itself must be examined. Klestil has 
always considered his German counterpart, President Richard von 
Weizsaecker, as his ideal. This is probably no longer topical, 
even though a solution of his private problems might save some 
of his public authority. It would probably take months to 
restore it. 
  If it is not possible to repair the presidency, the public, 
the Austrian People's Party, Klestil himself would have to think 
about resignation. The president still has a little time to 
prevent this and to prove that he is still capable of fulfilling 
his duties as president. 
  Otherwise, there is the danger of a greater damage and of a 
lasting weakness: Whereas anger, bitterness, and withdrawal 
characterized Waldheim's term of office, the worst of all 
judgments is now threatening -- that of ridicule.

<F P=106> [Article signed ABS (ADB): "Expected Postponement of </F>
Schengen Measures Until Latter Half of Year"; as released by 
Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 14 Jan (BELGA) -- The implementation of 
the Schengen accords (Benelux, France, Germany) on exempting 
travelers from controls at stations, ports, and airports is 
unlikely to take effect before next July. Belgian aviation 
circles (Sabena, BATC, aviation authorities) and the European 
Affairs Ministry (office of Robert Urbain) expect this further 
delay following the postponement of deadlines set previously (1 
November 1993 and 1 February 1994). 
  The software of the central computer (in Strasbourg) 
containing vital programs for identification, formalities, and 
other control operations linked to the application of Schengen 
are apparently not yet perfected and do not permit a normal 
functioning of equipment. 
  The decision has therefore been made in principle to 
postpone 
once again the application of the accords. But it is not until 
a meeting of the relevant European ministers -- scheduled for 
February -- that a decision may be made on the exact date for 
implementing the accords. It seems this date will be in the 
second half of 1994, according to a spokesman for Mr. Urbain. 
  A Sabena spokesman believes the application of Schengen is 
now likely to be very close to the date for the final opening 
(next November) of the new Brussels-National air terminal, which 
would simplify the problem of making provisional arrangements in 
the old airport terminal to separate the flow of passengers 
coming from or going to the five Schengen countries. If there 
remains just a short period between the new date of entry into 
force of Schengen and the opening of the Brussels airport 
terminal, the aviation authorities believe a pragmatic solution 
could certainly be found, making it possible to apply the 
provisions of the accord (almost total elimination of the risk 
of fraud, and in particular the exchange of travel documents 
between Schengen and non-Schengen passengers) to a sufficiently 
effective degree for a few months. 
  The Schengen accord is soon to be extended to include 
Portugal and -- in subsequent stages -- Greece and Spain, and 
finally the British Isles and Denmark.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Council President Pangalos To Tour </F>
Scandinavia"; as released by Brussels TEXTLINE database] 
  [Text] The president-in-office of the General Affairs 
Council and Greek minister for European affairs, Theodoros 
Pangalos, announced on Monday [17 January] that he was off this 
week on a round of the capitals of three of the four states 
currently negotiating their accession to the European Union 
(Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden), i.e. the Scandinavian 
countries, with a view to opening the final phase of 
negotiations. Due to what October's special European Council 
agreed in Brussels, these negotiations should be over for 1 
March, so that the European Parliament can give its assent under 
the current legislature. The outcome of this trip will, to a 
great extent, determine the possible convening of extra 
ministerial negotiations sessions in February, after the General 
Affairs Council of 7/8 February, or even a special summit. As 
we already mentioned, Sweden seems close to this result, already 
having most of the difficulties behind it (thus, it did not ask 
for many exemptions in the field of the Common Agricultural 
Policy [CAP] and, as for regional policy, obtained recognition 
of "Objective 1" status of an area -- connecting Norwegian and 
Finnish regions which have been guaranteed this status -- for 
which it appears it had had no intention of fighting). Norway, 
however, (came later than the three other countries in the 
negotiating process) continues to raise a certain number of 
sticky issues (fishing CAP, mainly), even if the energy dossier 
now seems to be moving forward smoothly; according to well 
informed European sources, the Norwegian Government has 
benefited from a kind of right to have a look in at the "joint 
position" adopted by the Council over the right of exploiting 
resources and is alleged to be prepared to accept it as long as 
this question is the subject of an annex in the accession 
treaty; this latter requirement is said to still be causing 
problems for some member states which intend to be sure that 
this clause should only be valid for Norway, thus in the case 
where this country actually does accede at the end of 
negotiations and, especially, the referendum which (as in the 
other candidate states) should give the "green light of the 
people." Concerning this, EUROPE recalls that the dates for 
these different referenda have still not been set. It does, 
however, seem that Sweden would like to organize its own in the 
wake of the Finnish referendum (the latest events in Russia 
could encourage the population to see accession with a little 
more enthusiasm), and, in any case, before the Norwegian 
referendum (this country seems the least certain seen from the 
population's point of view). The Norwegian authorities 
responsible for managing whaling explained to the press their 
country's position as regards this; in their opinion, this could 
lead to complications in accession negotiations but without it 
posing an obstacle to their conclusion. EUROPE will return to 
this aspect.

<F P=106> [Report by Robert Taylor: "Brussels Wants To Stop UK Social </F>
Policy Opt-Out"] 
  [Text] The European Commission wants to end Britain's 
social policy opt-out after 1996, it emerged yesterday. 
  In a confidential document sent to member governments on the 
working of the social protocol agreed at Maastricht two years 
ago, the commission makes clear the British opt-out must not be 
allowed to continue indefinitely. 
  "The commission firmly believes the conference of 
representatives of the governments of the EU's [European Union] 
member states to be convened in 1996 must find a way to return 
to a single legal basis for community action in the social 
field," it argues. 
  British ministers see the opt-out as a lasting achievement 
that will improve the country's competitiveness by keeping down 
labour costs. They believe they are winning the argument inside 
the EU on the need for a more flexible European labour market 
through less regulation of social affairs. 
  Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of 
British Industry, yesterday criticised the commission's efforts 
to press for a shorter working week or job-sharing as answers to 
European unemployment. "These are not viable long-term 
solutions," he told a meeting of European business leaders. "If 
high employment could be brought about by short working hours 
than Europe would have no unemployment at all." 
  Mr Davies said European workers already worked fewer hours a 
year than their American or Japanese counterparts and many of 
the proposals on job sharing would merely add to employer costs 
and increase not reduce unemployment. 
  He also denounced the commission's determination to 
introduce 
European-wide works councils for large companies with plants in 
more than one member state. It was inconceivable this could 
contribute to competitiveness or generating employment.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. IP/94/36: "European Union Establishes </F>
Elections Unit in South Africa"] 
  [Text] Today, the European Union announced Professor Jacob 
de Ruiter, former Netherlands minister of Justice and minister 
of defense, has been appointed to head the European elections 
unit which is to be established in South Africa [footnote 1 -- 
the South African election is scheduled to take place on 27 
April 1994]. 
  Mr. de Ruiter, who will be traveling to South Africa this 
weekend, will head a team of experts in the areas of the 
electoral process, law, the media, conflict resolution, 
security, and logistics. 
  The unit, which will work closely with South Africa's 
Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), will be responsible for 
the coordination of the European Union's support for the 
forthcoming election and for the deployment of some 312 EU 
observers. 
  This support constitutes an essential element of the joint 
action decided by the European Union on 6 December 93 to 
underpin the transition of South Africa to a democratic and 
multiracial country. 
  The European Union will provide advice, technical assistance 
and training, and continued support for non-partisan voter 
education, as part of an overall international effort 
coordinated by the United Nations. 
  In this context, the European Commission has allocated about 
ECU12 million (rand 43 million) to assist the South African 
election. This does not include direct support by EU member 
states. Further financial resources can be made available for 
this initiative, if required.

  [Text] The Vice President of the European Commission, Mr. 
Manuel Marin, met PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis on 
Thursday afternoon [13 January]. The two mainly discussed the 
conditions of application of Community aid to the organization 
and, in particular, the appropriation of ECU500 million decided 
by member states immediately after the signing of the Treaty of 
Washington in September between Israel and the PLO. Mr. 'Arafat 
has announced that an estimated budget will be brought to the 
Community's knowledge and that of other donors in order to 
enable them to determine the cost of installation of the 
Palestinian authorities in the occupied territories and in the 
first phase in Gaza and Jericho. Mr. Marin recalled the 
priorities laid down by member states in the use of Community 
aid, especially toward social sectors: education, health and 
training. A Palestinian delegation of experts will be in 
Brussels, probably in February, for more in-depth talks on this 
matter.

  [Text] "We discussed all problems. We did not avoid any of 
the difficult issues," said Jacques Delors at the conclusion of 
his meeting on Tuesday [11 January] with Turkish Prime Minister 
Mrs. Tansu Ciller. The president of the Commission mentioned 
the following: 

  -  Customs union. Mrs. Ciller outlined her 
country's efforts to complete union by the deadline that has 
been fixed (1995); 
  -  The EC/Turkey financial protocol, which is 
still deadlocked. "I have an idea about how to break the 
deadlock," said Mr. Delors; 
  -  Cyprus. "I think that if we find a 
solution for Cyprus, many of the obstacles now in our path will 
be removed, to Turkey's advantage," commented Mr. Delors. He 
added that the EC observer to the UN negotiations will only have 
the task of "keeping us updated on the negotiations"; 
  -  The 
Kurdish problem. "The Prime Minister explained her analysis of 
the situation and the efforts she is making to make the country 
more democratic and decentralize decisions. She hopes to 
promote a more active democracy enabling all citizens to 
participate in public affairs," said the president; 
  -  Former USSR. 
The southernmost countries of the former USSR were discussed. 
Mr. Delors commented: "It was very interesting for us to 
benefit from the experience of Turkey, which provides 
considerable aid for these countries." Mrs. Ciller then took 
part in an enlarged meeting with her minister of foreign 
affairs, Mr. Hikmet Cetin, and European Commissioners Sir Leon 
Brittan and Hans van den Broek.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Netherlands Wants To Keep Out </F>
Asylum-Seekers From Safe Countries"; as released by The Hague 
ANP NIEUWSBERICHTEN Database] 
  [Text] The Hague, 20 Jan (ANP) -- A request for asylum by 
somebody from a "safe country" will be immediately declared as 
unfounded. That is the crux of the bill Netherlander Justice 
Minister Hirsch Ballin and State Secretary Kosto submitted to 
the second Chamber on Thursday [20 January]. Under this bill, 
the justice minister can designate certain countries of origin 
as being safe countries. 
  Safe countries must be countries where there is no fear of 
persecution in the sense of the Geneva Convention on Refugees. 
Nigeria and Russia come to mind. An asylum-seeker from such a 
country can have his application for admittance as a refugee 
immediately rejected as unfounded. 
  Under this bill, an application from such an asylum-seeker 
will only be considered if he can establish circumstances which 
depart from the general situation in the country of origin and 
which arouse suspicions that he does indeed have grounds to fear 
persecution. 
  According to Hirsch Ballin and Kosto, the proposed 
regulation 
is very similar to the change in asylum legislation that Germany 
passed on 1 July 1993. 
  With this regulation, Hirsch Ballin and Kosto want to 
prevent 
refugees from applying for political asylum in countries with 
the most favorable legislation. For drawing up the list of 
safe countries, justice officials will consult with the Foreign 
Affairs Minister. They do not, however, recognize the 
usefulness of an advice obligation by the advisory committee on 
refugee affairs in designating safe countries. The Council of 
State had left this up to Hirsch Ballin and Kosto to consider. 
  The country of origin is legally defined as the country 
where 
a refugee is "born and bred." 
  The Refugee Foundation was not available for comment on 
Thursday. Earlier the organization had raised strong objections 
to the idea of safe countries because as a result, refugees are 
more at the mercy of their own region, where the relief and 
asylum procedures are worse than in the Netherlands for example.

<F P=106> [David Owen report: "Those Other Ulster Talks Are on Again"] </F>
  [Text] With the UK-Irish peace initiative stalled, the 
delicate talks process aimed at securing an internal political 
settlement in Northern Ireland is poised to re-emerge from the 
shadows to which it has been consigned since November. 
  The talks, co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern 
Ireland minister, and involving Ulster's four main 
constitutional parties, have inevitably fallen out of the 
spotlight while it seemed the Downing Street declaration might 
persuade the IRA to renounce violence. 
  But now that the government has concluded that the odds are 
against an early end to the 25-year republican campaign -- 
clearing the way for Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to 
enter the political process -- this order of priorities is about 
to change. 
  This was signalled last week when Mr Ancram began a new 
round 
of bilateral meetings, seeing a delegation from the largest 
party in the province, the Ulster Unionists. 
  Yesterday he saw senior Alliance party members. Next week he 
is due to meet the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and 
Labour party [SDLP]. 
  The message to republican leaders is clear. Their hesitancy 
over the joint declaration will not be allowed to delay efforts 
to piece together a political settlement. After yesterday's 
meeting Dr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, added 
his voice to those calling for the government not to wait for 
Sinn Fein. 
  Those familiar with the talks say the focus of the 
minister's 
efforts is to pin down an agenda that would permit participants 
to move on from the current time-consuming bilateral format -- 
disparaged by some as "blind-date politics" to round-table 
discussions. 
  It will not be easy. Ministers have said in the past that a 
resumption of round-table talks would be counter-productive 
until agreement is achievable. An earlier round-table talks 
process broke up without success in 1992. 
  The hardline Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not 
return to the talks process, bilateral or otherwise, until the 
meetings between Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry 
Adams, the Sinn Fein president, end. 
  Sinn Fein, as might be expected, is scathing about the 
exercise's prospects of success. Mr Tom Hartley, the party's 
national chairman, says: "I don't think the dynamic for change 
can be found any more in those sorts of talks." 
  Mr Ancram is thought to have identified a certain amount of 
common ground on structures for devolved government in the 
province, including an 85-member Ulster assembly. But less 
headway has been made on "strand two" of the talks -- how to 
handle relations between the province and the Irish Republic. 
  Ulster Unionists are keen for efforts to be focused on 
setting this assembly up. But the SDLP is unlikely to consent 
to this without agreement on north/south relations, and on 
strand three -- relations between the two governments. 
  Mr Hume is said to have received assurances last week that 
the talks process would continue to embrace all three sets of 
relationships. But London is still waiting for a paper setting 
out Dublin's ideas on strands two and three which it requested 
last September.

<F P=106> [Report by David Owen in London and John Barham in Buenos </F>
Aires: "British Offer Over Falklands Oil"] 
  [Text] The British Government has indicated its readiness 
to allow Argentine companies to take part in the development of 
oilfields in the Falkland Islands' territorial waters provided 
they acknowledge that any oil extracted belongs to Britain. 
  Government sources think it unlikely that Argentine 
interests 
will end up operating installations on the islands themselves, 
but believe Argentina's coast could be a logical site for 
support operations. 
  Preliminary results from seismic surveys conducted last year 
around the Falklands suggested the possibility of finding oil 
across a zone 25 percent larger than the North Sea. 
  The disclosure of Britain's position follows a recent 
request 
from Buenos Aires for a meeting of senior foreign ministry 
officials to discuss joint development of oil resources. London 
has yet to agree to this meeting. 
  Reaching an oil accord with the UK is Argentina's next 
important policy objective, but it is unlikely to accept terms 
that implicitly recognise Britain's sovereignty over the 
islands. Buenos Aires has used recent talks on fish to press 
for a role in the development of possible oil and gas reserves. 
British Gas said last year it had discussed joint offshore 
exploration close to the disputed waters with YPF, Argentina's 
state-owned oil company. 
  Some Falkland islanders are said to recognise that 
rapprochement with Argentina would probably be necessary if an 
oil industry were to be developed. 
  Recent developments come against a background of steadily 
improving relations between the two former belligerents. 
  A year ago, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, became the 
first UK cabinet minister to visit Argentina since the 1982 
Falkland islands conflict. 
  Since then both Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy 
minister, and Mr Guido Di Tella, foreign minister, have visited 
Britain.

<F P=106> [Report by Ian Murray: "Regions Bypass Whitehall To Cash In </F>
on Helpful Brussels"] 
  [Text] Britain's regions are being urged to use Brussels 
as "a Whitehall bypass" to promote projects that are blocked by 
central government. They believe bureaucrats in Brussels are 
more accessible and sympathetic than their own Government. 
  Frustrated by the way in which government departments delay 
or refuse to support pet schemes, the regions are increasingly 
pleading their case directly with the European Commission 
instead of waiting for what they regard as half-hearted help by 
Whitehall. 
  Regional power has been recognised and strengthened by the 
Maastricht Treaty which set up a Committee of the Regions with 
the duty to advise and consult the Commission. The first 
meeting takes place next month and many of the 24 British 
representatives joined a Commission conference in Lincolnshire 
last week to discuss tactics and hear complaints from local 
organisations about central government. 
  Philip Jagger, of the TUC's [Trade Union Congress] Yorkshire 
regional council, summed up feelings. "We can hardly find 
anyone in Government to listen to us in London these days but in 
Brussels they are always prepared to give us time and help," he 
said. 
  William Newton Dunn, Conservative MEP [Member of the 
European 
Parliament] for Lincolnshire, agreed. "If you put things 
through the British Government then you will often find it sells 
you down the river," he said. "They do their best to balance 
things but they are more concerned about achieving something 
else." 
  Scotland and Wales, with their clear regional identities, 
have led the way in Brussels where the "Tartan Mafia" and the 
"Taffia" [Welsh mafia] are recognised within the Commission. 
They have their own offices in Brussels and their example has 
been followed in England by the North West, the West Midlands 
and Kent. Britain's nine other regions, designated after the 
Maastricht Treaty, are being actively encouraged to set up their 
own Brussels operations. Treasury sources at the conference 
urged delegates to learn quickly how to pull their weight. With 
Britain a net contributor of 2 billion pounds a year to the 
Community budget, the Treasury does not want to waste any chance 
of "getting our money back." 
  "This is subsidiarity in action," one official said. In the 
short term these offices are likely to be more effective than 
the Council of the Regions, which has no powers yet and only a 
tiny budget. However, local authority representatives at the 
conference were determined that it must quickly win influence 
and power in Brussels to fight for their interests. 
  "Whitehall seems happy for Europe to deal with the regional 
management of wildfowl but then it wants to do everything else 
itself," Tony Davies, of Yorkshire and Humberside regional 
association, said. 
  Britain nevertheless is lagging behind much of the Community 
in regional lobbying. Each German state has a Brussels office 
which operates almost like a national representative, lobbying 
for local interests, winning contracts for local firms and 
claiming every scrap of Community aid available. England's lack 
of clear regions has made it more difficult to organise. 
  A Foreign Office source assured delegates that the 
Government 
had "an underlying commitment and excitement about Europe." But 
he gave a warning against too much expectation and enthusiasm 
for the next moves towards European integration.

<F P=106> [Report by Nicholas Wood: "Cash Crisis Tories Forced To </F>
Fight Polls on a Shoestring"] 
  [Text] John Major will be forced to fight on a shoestring 
budget in the local council and European elections that are 
critical to his survival as Prime Minister. 
  Senior Conservatives said yesterday that the party would 
have 
far less than the 1 million pounds it spent five years ago when 
Margaret Thatcher launched her doomed crusade against the 
Brussels bureaucracy. 
  The indications are that for the first time in modern 
electoral history, Labour will not be financially outgunned. It 
spent just over 400,000 pounds centrally in 1989 and is poised 
to fight the June 9 Euro-poll on an equal footing with the 
Tories. 
  One Tory source said: "Money is a big problem. There is no 
slush fund, and we cannot borrow another million. We are right 
up against our overdraft limit." 
  The cash crisis, due to a slump in morale among party 
activists, has forced a drastic reworking of the campaign for 
the council elections, on May 5 and the European poll. In 
contrast to 1989, when Central Office spent heavily on a 
nationwide anti-Brussels poster campaign, funds will be 
concentrated on the 87 Euro-constituencies. 
  Under electoral law, a ceiling of around 30,000 pounds 
applies locally to each candidate for a Euro-seat. This sum is 
still big enough, however, for Sir Norman Fowler the party 
chairman, to divert some money from the centre. Conservative 
MEPs [members of the European Parliament] have received around 
440,000 pounds from the European Parliament this year to promote 
its work, but this cannot be used for campaigning and cannot be 
spent after February 9. 
  "We'd rather a constituency spent 10,000 pounds on keeping 
its agent in place or a couple of leaflet drops than put the 
money towards a page of advertising in a national newspaper," a 
source said. 
  Neither Mr Major nor Sir Norman, however, intends to give up 
without a fight. Central Office will move to a war footing well 
before the elections for district councils and London boroughs, 
and party chiefs are treating the two elections as a single 
campaign. 
  They concede that they have been blown off course by the 
uproar over Back to Basics and taxation, but intend to go on the 
offensive as soon as the dust settles. "What we want is the 
Labour Party voting against us clause after clause in the 
Criminal Justice Bill, attacking us over deregulation, along 
with the steady drip of good economic news," an insider said. 
  In 1989 the Tories lost 13 seats on a vote split of Labour 
40 
percent, Conservatives 35 percent. With their support now under 
30 percent in the opinion polls, Mr Major faces another 
drubbing, and some projections suggest that his party will be 
reduced to a rump of around a dozen seats.

<F P=106> [Article by Phillip Coggan: "CBI Survey Affirms Steady </F>
Economic Recovery"] 
  [Text] The UK economy is improving steadily with few signs 
of an upsurge in inflation, according to yesterday's 
Confederation of British Industry's [CBI] quarterly industrial 
trends survey. The survey endorses recent official data showing 
a pick-up in output and contradicts more gloomy reports, notably 
last week's survey by the British Chambers of Commerce. 
  Positive trends found by the CBI include improved business 
confidence, an increase in manufacturing orders and output, and 
the first sign of an increase in investment in plant and 
machinery since July 1989. 
  There appears to be continued downward pressure on costs 
with 
more manufacturers expecting to cut costs than at any time since 
the first survey in 1958. 
  However, the CBI said it had two main areas of concern about 
the UK's economic prospects in 1994. The first was the tax 
increases and government expenditure cuts which "will remove a 
significant proportion of purchasing power from the economy." 
The second was the recent appreciation of the pound "which may 
well hold back export growth." 
  Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs 
committee, said "the survey alone would not indicate a need to 
relax monetary policy further." But in view of "the shadow of 
those tax increases," he thought it would be "necessary and 
desirable to reduce interest rates." 
  Business confidence increased for the fifth quarter in 
succession, according to the survey. The number of firms which 
were more optimistic about business in general exceeded those 
which were less optimistic by 27 percent. This balance, which 
indicates the trend, compares with plus 1 percent in October. 
  Optimism has been fuelled by an increase in output and 
orders. The balance of companies reporting an increase in 
manufacturing output was the highest quarterly figure since July 
1989.

for New FRS 2 Sea Harriers Confirmed"] 
  [Text] 20 Jan -- A contract for 18 new FRS2 Harrier 
Aircraft was confirmed today by Jonathan Aitken, Minister for

Keith Mans MP, Mr Aitken said: 
  "In order to sustain the Royal Navy's sea Harrier force well 
into the future, I am pleased to announce the decision to 
purchase a total of 18 new FRS2 aircraft and to convert a

secure best value for money. The contract for the 18 new 
aircraft has now been placed with British Aerospace at a value 
of some 200 million pounds."

<F P=106> [Report by Philip Webster and Nicholas Wood: "Clarke's Tax </F>
Admission Puts Major on Defensive"] 
  [Text] The Prime Minister rejected fears yesterday that 
the recovery might be faltering after a warning from Kenneth 
Clarke that the barrage of tax rises due in April would check it. 
  John Major was thrown on to the defensive by the 
Chancellor's 
admission, in an early morning radio broadcast, that the 
increases would "take a bit of the edge off consumer demand." 
  Mr Clarke's acknowledgment, exploited gleefully by the 
Labour 
leadership, coincided with a new double warning of the fragility 
of the recent economic improvement. Labour was pressing home 
its attack in a week when millions of people have received their 
new tax codes showing the increases in the past two budgets. 
  Gordon Brown, the shadow Chancellor, said ministers had 
admitted this month that tax rises would slow the recovery. 
"Now the Chancellor is going further in admitting that tax 
rises will check the recovery. That means they will halt the 
recovery for the time being." 
  Verbal warfare over the economy intensified as a report from 
British Chambers of Commerce spoke of a "glass ceiling" holding 
growth to less than pre-recession levels. Another survey of 
consumer opinion found that households in London and the 
Southeast were bracing themselves for a year of austerity. 
  Mr Clarke and Mr Major brushed aside the latest figures to 
maintain that recovery was well under way. Their 
counter-offensive came as the Cabinet, in an 80-minute political 
session without officials, concluded that the brightening 
economic outlook offered the Tories their best hope of averting 
disaster in the council and European Parliament elections in the 
early summer. 
  "We have been through some difficulties but the opportunity 
to present our case is there and will build up towards the 
elections," one minister said. "It comes from growing evidence 
that the economic situation is getting better, which will have 
its effect." 
  Mr Clarke insisted that Britain was on course for a "steady 
recovery at a sustainable level" and added that it was silly to 
judge the economy on the strength of one month's figures. 
Appearing to rule out an early cut in interest rates, he said 
the important thing was to behave responsibly and keep inflation 
down. 
  He gave a buoyant assessment of the state of the economy. 
"We have manufacturing output up. We have unemployment that 
has been falling. Retail sales in these figures in December 
were 4 percent up on the year before," he said. "Our inflation 
record for the last 12 months is the best we have seen since the 
1960's. We are plainly on course for a steady recovery at a 
sustainable level. We have the chance of keeping inflation 
down. It is absolutely silly for people to keep reacting to one 
month's figures." 
  He added: "I want to see the recovery stronger than it is, 
but I think the actual position is, we do have the best recovery 
of any major economy in Europe." 
  Mr Major, challenged by John Smith over Mr Clarke's remarks, 
said there was "no doubt whatsoever that recovery is under way." 
He pointed out that Mr Clarke had also said that the recovery 
was now "strong enough not to be stopped." But the Labour 
Leader said that tax increases, equivalent to 7 pence on income 
tax, were "bound to hit family budgets for six." 
  As he was taunted by Mr Smith over Mr Clarke's'remarks, the 
Prime Minister hit back: "The economy has grown over 2 percent 
in 12 months and has risen for six successive quarters. Retail 
sales have grown 4 percent in the last year. Car production, 
manufacturing output and export volumes are all up. With low 
inflation and low interest rates there is no doubt whatsoever 
that recovery is under way." 
  Mr Smith, however, said that people were starting to see the 
full impact of tax increases on their standard of living. He 
asked: "Do you recall saying during the election campaign that 
greater taxation would kill economic recovery stone dead? If it 
was true then, why isn't it true now? Or is that one of many 
things you find it easy to forget you ever mentioned?"

<F P=106> [Report by Donald Macintyre: "MP's Career Threatened by </F>
Iraqi TV Appearance"] 
  [Text] George Galloway, the controversial MP for Glasgow 
Hillhead, was facing the most serious threat yet to his 
chequered Parliamentary career after taking part in friendly 
exchanges with Saddam Husayn on Iraqi television. 
  A furious John Smith, the Labour leader, ordered an 
immediate 
investigation into the conduct of Mr Galloway which could lead 
to the withdrawal of the Labour whip and the consequent risk of 
his eventual deselection. 
  Despite Mr Galloway's insistence that he had saluted the 
Iraqi people rather than Saddam Husayn, his troubles deepened 
last night when the BBC played a tape from its Caversham 
monitoring unit, appearing to confirm that he had spoken in the 
broadcast of the dictator's "courage, strength and 
indefatigability." 
  Mr Galloway said on his return yesterday: "I did not say 
anything in praise of Saddam. I was referring to the Iraqi 
people, their strength, their courage, their forbearance." Mr 
Galloway, and two Greek MPs who were also on the trip, are part 
of a group set up in Athens last year to lobby for an easing or 
lifting of the UN embargo imposed in response to Iraq's 1990 
invasion of Kuwait. Mr Galloway told BBC Radio Scotland that he 
had described Saddam Husayn just weeks ago as a "bestial 
dictator." 
  But the Caversham tape, played on BBC Radio's World Tonight, 
records Mr Galloway, apparently directly addressing Saddam, as 
saying: "Sir, I salute your courage your strength and your 
indefatigability and I want you to know that we are with 
you...." Mr Galloway then breaks into an Arabic phrase in which 
the word Nasir (victory) is audible. The Reuter news agency had 
earlier quoted Mr Galloway as saying that..."we are with you 
until victory." 
  Labour stood by a strongly worded statement from John Smith, 
party leader, warning that "the Opposition Chief Whip will see 
Mr Galloway immediately on his return to the Commons with a view 
to initiating disciplinary action." Speaking before Mr 
Galloway's denials, Mr Smith said: "I deeply deplore the foolish 
statement made in Iraq by Mr George Galloway. In no way did he 
speak for the Labour Pary and I wholly reject his comments." 
  While the whips will not recommend a specific penalty until 
they have established the facts, the controversial MP was still 
facing at least a stiff formal reprimand. 
  The anger of the Labour whips was intensified by the fact 
that Mr Galloway's unauthorised trip meant he missed at least 
two key votes.

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- The Western Group of Russian Forces 
has so far withdrawn 90 percent of its troops from eastern 
Germany. The withdrawal schedule for last year was therefore 
fully adhered to, Colonel General Matvey Burlakov, commander in 
chief [of the Western Group of Forces], told journalists in 
Berlin today. 
  The last soldier will return to Russia 31 August 1994 as 
planned. Official functions marking the farewell to the troops 
are to take place in the capital at the beginning of August. 
President Boris Yeltsin has promised to attend. 
  According to Burlakov, the remaining 68,000 personnel, 
including 32,000 servicemen and officers, as well as 17,500 
items of equipment, will be withdrawn this year. Not a single 
piece of ammunition will remain in Germany. 
  In contrast to the withdrawal of troops, only 65 percent of 
program for building apartments for the servicemen and their 
families returning home has been completed, Burlakov said, and 
40-45 percent of families are still without an apartment. 
  Another 25,000 apartments must be built this year with 
German 
funding and 22,000 with Russian funding. However, Burlakov 
doubts whether the program will be adhered to. Germany has 
promised to contribute 8 billion marks.

  [Text] Hanover (DPA)--German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
has expressed his support for Lord David Owen, the mediator in 
the Yugoslavia conflict who has repeatedly been called on to 
resign. On the sidelines of a Free Democratic Party conference 
in Hanover today, Kinkel said the German Government was grateful 
to Owen for his "untiring efforts." It has great regard for 
Owen's commitment and his unremitting endeavors. His work did 
not deserve the current negative criticism. Kinkel added that 
in this immensely difficult and complicated situation, it is 
much easier to criticize than to do it better.

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- Klaus Naumann, the general chief of 
staff of the Bundeswehr, spoke strongly in favor of changing the 
Constitution to enable the Bundeswehr to take part in all 
international UN missions. As a matter of principle, Germany 
should be in a position to fulfill its obligations as a UN 
member, or as a member of the Western European Union or NATO, he 
said. 
  "It is a matter of saying yes in principle, so that it is 
possible to say no in each individual case without raising 
issues of reliability," Naumann said today before the Hamburg 
Overseas Club. However, a military operation of this type must 
not always be the last resort: "It is by no means the case that 
we soldiers need such a mission for purposes of 
self-confirmation."

  [Text] Bonn, Jan 14 (CTK) -- The German Government 
approved a Czech-German Agreement on Border Area Traffic today, 
the German Interior Ministry said. 
  The document is ready for signing, the ministry said, adding 
that it enables people in both countries to cross the border 
into the other country regardless of official border crossings 
and to stay in the other signatory country's border area. The 
agreement includes third country nationals exempt from visa 
requirements for both of the two signatory countries and the 
European Union. 
  The agreement is a sign of good relations between Germany 
and 
the Czech Republic, German Interior Minister Manfred Kanther 
said, adding he hoped it would spark development in the tourist 
industry and other kinds of enterprise in the area. 
  The Czech Government approved a Czech-German Border Treaty 
on 
Thursday [13 January], Czech Government Office Spokesman 
Ladislav Pistora said, pointing out that the agreement on border 
area traffic approved by the German ministry is a separate and 
different document. 
  Governments of neighboring countries conclude agreements on 
border area traffic as a matter of routine, Czech Foreign 
Ministry Spokeswoman Lucie Pilipova said, adding that such 
documents include an arrangement on border facility maintenance.

  [Excerpt] Berlin (DPA) -- Russian security expert Sergey 
Karaganov has spoken in favor of a "very strong" NATO to deter 
the "worst militant elements" in Russia. At a security policy 
conference in Berlin today, Karaganov, deputy director of the 
Institute of European Affairs of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences, at the same time opposed the admission of East 
European countries into NATO. 
  Enlarging NATO by admitting the countries of East and 
Central 
Europe interested in joining the alliance would "water down" 
NATO's strength, Karaganov said. Russia's minimum security 
interest was not being excluded from new alliance structures, he 
said. 
  The Partnership for Peace offered by NATO to the former 
Warsaw Pact states opened up the prospect of an expansion of the 
Western defense alliance, said Walter B. Slocombe of the U.S. 
Defense Department. Failure of the reforms in Russia would also 
have destabilizing repercussions on Western countries, he said.

  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- In the view of the Munich-based Ifo 
Institute for Economic Research, uncertainty about future 
political developments in Russia will lead to great caution on 
the part of potential Western investors and the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) in the next two years as well. The Ifo 
Institute cites in particular Zhirinovskiy's success at the 
parliamentary elections in December 1993 and his goal to replace 
Boris Yeltsin as Russian president in 1996. The Russian reform 
and stabilization program adopted in the autumn of 1993 also 
contains problematic taxation plans. 
  In view of the massive tax evasion in Russia, it would be 
desirable to go back to administratively simpler taxes which are 
difficult to evade, the Ifo Institute writes. The institute 
also proposes property taxation. The Russian budget deficit for 
1993 will probably be 1.5 to 2 trillion rubles higher than 
planned. At the end of 1993 the government also approved a cash 
injection of 550 billion rubles for the arms industry and took 
emergency measures to alleviate the energy crisis in the CIS 
caused by the cold winter.

  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- The Ifo Institute for Economic 
Research believes a recovery is in sight following the sharp 
downturn in investments in German industry. "There are 
increasing signs that the rapid decline in industrial 
investments is coming to an end," the Munich-based institute 
writes in its latest analysis. 
  In the more probable event of a clear acceleration in the 
export sector and further, more pronounced interest rate 
reductions, a real increase of 3 percent (following minus 3 
percent in 1993) in plant investment can be expected in 1994. 
If, however, the pressures of the domestic economic situation 
were to increase, a further slight decline of 1 percent is 
possible. 
  In either case, the negative development in investment 
expenditure in industry is likely to continue, in the more 
favourable scenario by minus 6 percent, in the unfavorable one 
by minus 11 percent (following the minus 12 percent calculated 
for 1993). In 1992, investment expenditure in industry was 127 
billion German marks [DM] and DM721 billion for all economic 
sectors. Investment in the former east German states continues 
to rise, whereby the mining, energy, and services sectors -- as 
well as, in the medium term, transport -- predominate. 
  Investment in the former East Germany increased by around 15 
percent, despite the recession in 1993. In broad sectors of the 
west German economy, however, the downturn in investment was 
much more pronounced than even in the most unfavorable scenario, 
for example in trade, transport, industry, and also agriculture, 
according to the Ifo. In the medium term, the high investment 
level of the early 1990's could be regained in 1996 at the 
earliest. In the purchase of capital goods, data processing 
equipment and office machinery are likely to remain key areas of 
growth until 1998. The Ifo Institute warned against hoping for 
overly large economic impulses from the GATT agreement on the 
liberalization of world trade, reached in mid-December 1993. A 
definitive assessment of the outcome is not possible yet. The 
agreement is basically positive, although only partial success 
had been achieved in some areas. Failure has only been prevented 
by excluding some areas or giving compensation. To describe the 
agreement as a "huge" or "mega economic program" is certainly an 
exaggeration, the Ifo Institute writes. 
  It should be borne in mind that the liberalization will 
begin 
in early 1995 at the earliest and will be completed gradually in 
five or more stages. "At least some economic impulses can peter 
out as a result. In addition, it cannot be assumed that the 
tendency to solve structural problems through protectionist 
measures no longer exists." Sanctions were still not envisaged. 
The main reasons for the prolonged nature of the GATT 
negotiations -- the great conflict of interests between 
industrialized and developing countries in some areas and the 
large number of negotiating partners -- continues to exist and 
in the future will continue to make multilateral liberalization 
steps more difficult. The discussion on a GATT with several 
speeds therefore could remain topical.

  [Excerpts] Bonn/Hamburg (DPA)--For the first time in its 
history, the Federal Republic of Germany will have to face the 
Human Rights Commission of the United Nations. The Foreign 
Ministry confirmed reports today by the Hamburg news magazine 
DER SPIEGEL and by Sueddeutscher Rundfunk that three complaints 
against Germany had been lodged with the Human Rights 
Commission. [passage omitted] 
  The Foreign Ministry expressly denied that Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel would attend the meeting of the Commission in 
Geneva in connection with the complaints. 
  SPIEGEL reports that the Commission's 53 member states will 
deal with "complaints about xenophobic activity in Germany" at 
their meeting in Geneva on 31 January. The Foreign Ministry 
remarked that it was "highly unusual" that a Western state was 
facing charges of this kind. 
  Sueddeutscher Rundfunk also reported that a confidential 
examination was being carried out into allegations of xenophobia 
by a group of teachers from Thuringia who had not been admitted 
to the civil service. There was also a complaint by prisoners 
who said they were not receiving enough pay for their work in 
prison.

omitted] 
  The NPD party congress, which was attended by about 200 
delegates, is due to end this evening. The police had also set 
up cordons in the surrounding area. According to the federal 
chairman of the NPD, Guenter Deckert, the party congress was to 
nominate among others candidates for European elections. 
According to estimates by the Federal Office for the Protection 
of the Constitution, which says the NPD shows unconstitutional 
tendencies, the party has about 5,000 members throughout Germany.

  [Text] Bonn, Jan. 13 -- A Polish Sejm delegation led by 
Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy, who is currently on a visit to 
Germany, met on Thursday [13 January] with German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl. 
  Kohl assured the Polish delegation of his committment to 
improving Polish-German relations. He recalled Chancellor 
Konrad Adenauer's declaration of 1949 in which Adenauer 
considered German reconcilation with former enemies -- namely, 
the French, Jews, and Poles -- as one of his goals. 
  After the meeting, Oleksy told a news conference that the 
talks focused on the significance of the present stage of 
Polish-German relations for Europe and for overcoming the fears 
of the past. He also said he expected German support in 
negotiating the Partnership for Peace, for which Poland wanted a 
good agreement. 
  While addressing the Bundestag, Kohl stressed that the 
Partnership for Peace was one of the most significant results of 
the NATO summit in Brussels. He added that it opened up 
prospects for membership and there was no reason for 
disappointment. The German chancellor also stressed the values 
of the Partnership for Peace, although he said he understood the 
anxieties and needs of nations in East Europe, especially 
Poland. He added, however, that it was particularly Germany 
which should take into consideration Russia's fears of isolation. 
  Earlier in the day, the Polish delegation met with Bundestag 
President Rita Suessmuth. The two sides stressed the 
significance of parliamentary contacts. Suessmuth said they 
were marked by considerable progress, and added that the 
German-Polish parliamentary group had 108 members. 
  Oleksy said Polish-German relations were very good, but he 
stressed they still could improve. He also assured his German 
interlocutors that democracy in Poland was safe and did not 
depend on the results of each election. 
  The Polish delegation met also with Hans Stercken, head of 
the Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee. 
  Stercken and Oleksy emphasized the importance of 
parliamentary contacts in Polish-German relations. 
  Oleksy declared that Poland's Euroatlantic security was 
unchanging. "We see Poland's strategic security in European 
structures," he said, adding that Russia must not be isolated. 
  The Sejm speaker also said during the news conference that 
Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak was expected to visit 
Germany soon. According to unofficial sources, the visit could 
even take place in the first half of February. 
  "The opposition won the elections in Poland, but there was 
not an earthquake and nothing like this will happen. We are a 
country of high political stability, a country where extreme 
attitudes are put in their proper place and are marginal," Jozef 
Oleksy said while delivering a speech at the German-Polish 
Society on Thursday evening. 
  Present at the meeting were German industrialists with head 
of the commission for East German economy Otto Wolff von 
Amerongen. 
  Oleksy also pointed out that Polish political elites no 
longer feel hostility toward Poland's western neighbor, and 
stressed that he hoped prejudice against Poles no longer existed 
in Bonn. 
  Oleksy appealed to German industrialists to invest in 
Poland. 
He pointed to the fact that the Federal Republic, Poland's 
largest trade partner, placed sixth as far as the invested 
capital was concerned.

  [Text] Bonn, Jan. 14 -- A delegation of the Polish Sejm 
headed by Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy was received on Friday noon 
[14 January] by German President Richard von Weizsaecker. 
  Earlier in the day, the delegation met with German Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel to discuss security questions in the 
context of the NATO summit. The Polish side said it hoped 
Germany would support Poland during negotiations on the 
Partnership for Peace agreement. 
  Polish deputies met also with managers of the Association of 
Polish Servicing Enterprises in Germany, who pointed to their 
economic problems stemming from the fact that Polish 
construction firms were pushed off the east German market. 
According to the Bonn authorities, such a situation was caused 
by high unemployment in the former GDR, whereas in the opinion 
of Poles there is enough demand for construction workers in that 
region. The management of the association appealed to the 
delegation to take care of the case. 
  The Polish delegation was officially bidden farewell by 
Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth. 
  A speech at the German Foreign Affairs Society in Bonn 
delivered by Jozef Oleksy was last on the agenda of the four-day 
visit by the Polish Sejm delegation. 
  Oleksy stressed there were good investment conditions in 
Poland which was a politically stable country that reported an 
economic growth. 
  The meeting was attended by representatives of German 
industrial and financial circles. Present were President of the 
Krupp Foundation Berthold Beitz, Deutsche Bank President Wilhelm 
Christians, head of the East German Economy Committee Otto Wolff 
von Amerongen, and Deputy President of the European Investment 
Bank and SPD [Social Democratic Party] economic expert Wolfgang 
Roth.

  [Text] Budapest, 14 January (MTI) -- Hungarian 
Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee delegates led by Chairman 
Laszlo Kovacs in Germany this week invited by the Bundestag, 
talked to Bundestag President Rita Sussmuth and senior Foreign 
and Defence Ministry officials. 
  The Hungarian deputies told their German hosts that although 
the Partnership for Peace scheme was less than what East Central 
Europe wanted, it was more than this region had ever got before. 
The scheme does not draw new dividing lines in Europe but 
promotes the region's rapproachement to NATO, at the same time 
not making Russia feel that NATO is forging an alliance against 
it. 
  Hungarian deputies asked Germany to help fill the Hungary-EC 
association agreement with genuine content, and promote 
Hungary's integration into the common European foreign and 
security policy. 
  German negotiators said that admitting European Free Trade 
Association [EFTA] countries was now on the agenda in the 
European Union, a process that should end by January 1995. Then 
a Union conference will review experiences of new members, 
admissions, and the association agreements. Talks with the 
Visegrad countries on full membership will not start before 
1997, Kovacs quoted his German partners as saying.

  [Text] Karlsruhe (DPA)--The investigating magistrate of the 
Federal Court of Justice (BGH) has issued a custody order for 
Gerhard Fleischle, 55, the chief political editor of 
Deutschlandfunk radio (Cologne). The Federal Prosecutor's 
Office said today that the journalist is accused of having 
worked for the GDR Ministry for State Security's Intelligence 
Department since 1960. The man had been provisionally detained 
on Thursday [20 January]. 
  According to the investigation so far, the editor primarily 
supplied information about his colleagues and about journalistic 
projects to his employers in East Berlin until 1989. He is also 
assumed to have passed on information about the EC and NATO when 
he was a correspondent in Brussels between 1979 and 1984.

<F P=106> [Report signed "Lz.": "Militia Army By No Means Outdated"] </F>
  [Text] At the general meeting of the Officers' Society of 
the Canton of Zurich (KOG) on Saturday [14 January], Federal 
Councillor Kaspar Villiger said the militia system is still a 
good form of defense. The chief of the Swiss Military 
Department thinks that security policy openness is essential. 
In his opinion, the discussion of the future of national 
defense has to continue, but now the implementation of "Army 95" 
is in the foreground. 
  On Saturday a surprisingly large number of politicians, 
federal and canton parliamentarians, and government and Zurich 
city councillors gathered in the Zurich congress house, where 
the KOG general meeting took place. The focus of the event was 
the definition of security and defense policy positions by 
Federal Councillor Kaspar Villiger. In the introduction of his 
lecture entitled, "Topical Security Policy Questions," Villiger 
gave a general outline of the world political situation. It is 
now clearly proven that the Report 90 is a useful basis for 
Switzerland's security policy. There are no longer any islands 
of total security; Switzerland will also have to live in a gray 
area between peace and war, he said. 
  Afterward, the chief of the Swiss Military Department 
reported on the diverse efforts to establish security 
structures, particularly in Europe. In his opinion, a small 
state like Switzerland with a limited security policy scope has 
every interest in the establishment of such systems, for 
neutrality has largely lost its importance as a security 
strategy. In his representations, Villiger followed the line of 
the neutrality report in the addendum to the recently published 
foreign policy report. The principle that Switzerland still does 
not interfere in foreign controversies is still extant. It 
lends particular credibility to the Red Cross and later perhaps 
to Swiss blue helmets as well. Neutrality must not be 
abandoned, but adjusted to the changed general conditions. 
According to Villiger, neutrality that is understood in a modern 
way provides scope for security policy opening. In his view, 
security policy cooperation is indispensable. Establishing 
relations with NATO -- the federal councillor mentioned the 
invitation to Partnership for Peace -- and the Western European 
Union (WEU) is possible, but membership is not conceivable for 
reasons of neutrality, he said. 
  In view of the numerous unsolved conflicts and the absence 
of 
a solid European security system, it is necessary for 
Switzerland to continue to maintain an adequate defense 
capability. Villiger briefly dealt with the new defense 
doctrine, which is formulated in the "Operative Command 95" 
regulations. It translates the security policy strategy into 
military practice, and is now to be tested in exercises. In 
addition, the Army has to adjust its mission to the new spectrum 
of risks and to extend it. With a view to defense against forms 
of violence below the threshold of war, it is useful to employ 
troops to support civilian governments in extraordinary 
situations. Those who claim -- Villiger referred here to the 
"security policy" working group's report -- the Army wants 
additional tasks in order to legitimize itself anew do not take 
into account security policy realities. 
  Villiger got to talking about military peace operations that 
represent means to prevent crises and crisis management. 
Participation in UN operations with blue helmets is of solid 
military use for Switzerland; blue helmets would convey 
experiences of war that one would otherwise not have. Villiger 
knows that many officers are skeptical of such a commitment. 
This is not an existential question; the credibility of 
Switzerland's security policy is at issue, he said. Therefore, 
he appealed to the present cadres to consider this matter 
thoroughly and to deal constructively with the blue helmet file. 
At the same time, however, he intimated that a political 
opinion is not forced on anybody. In Austria, Finland, and 
Sweden, one is proud of being able to provide blue helmets. 
Villiger substantiated the "multiple functions" of "Army 95," 
which concerns the Army as a whole and not individual units. Of 
course, in the medical service, for example, it is possible to 
rely more on civilian structures and facilities. It is useful 
to use military means and military knowledge for disaster 
relief, however, even if some people do not understand this. 
The militia system is by no means outdated either. It is true 
that only professional armed forces can by used as intervention 
forces in international operations. However, Switzerland does 
not want to participate in them. Moreover, a professional army 
is out of the question for Switzerland for political and 
financial reasons. As for the rest, Villiger pointed out that 
armed forces assigned for defensive fighting are based on 
draftees or militia structures. Increasing interest in the Swiss 
militia system can even be internationally determined, he said. 
  The militia's power of cohesion must not be underestimated. 
"Army 95" has to be translated into reality now. The solution 
that has been found will be reexamined according to the 
development of the world political situation or because of 
changes in general internal conditions. The question of 
strength will certainly be put on the list again, since studies 
show that it will no longer be possible to ensure a control 
strength as of 2005. Villiger did not conceal that the project 
would be fundamentally affected in the event of further budget 
cuts and thus seriously endangered. Even though the 
implementation of reforms is in the foreground, the discussion 
on future development has to continue. Innovative ideas are 
always welcome, he said. 
  In the business segment of the event, KOG President Guenter 
Heuberger, major in the General Staff, reported on the 
importance of the officers' societies for Switzerland's military 
policy and also called on the officers present to deal 
objectively with the question of blue helmets. Heuberger will 
be replaced according to routine rotation by Peter Fischer, 
captain in the General Staff.

<F P=106> [SDA report: "Cooperation With NATO?"] </F>
  [Text] Bern, 11 January -- Switzerland wants to carefully 
study the Partnership for Peace plan offered by NATO. Since the 
program is explicitly also addressed to the neutral states and 
since "custom-made bilateral agreements" are possible, the two 
points of the U.S. proposal submitted in October that are most 
important for Switzerland have been taken up again, Daniel 
Eckmann, the spokesman of the Department of Foreign Affairs 
announced on Tuesday [11 January] upon an inquiry. Full 
membership, however, is impossible for neutrality reasons. 
  Yet since the document adopted by the NATO summit in 
Brussels 
is more comprehensive than the project outlined by U.S. Defense 
Secretary Les Aspin, its wording must be analyzed by the 
Military and Foreign Affairs Departments so that the Federal 
Council can discuss political steps. However, it is clear "that 
Switzerland neither wants full membership nor any kind of 
cooperation that might affect our neutrality," Eckmann stressed. 
  Owing to the character of the partnership treaties adopted 
in 
the Brussels document that makes possible custom-made 
agreements, anything from the exchange of information, 
cooperation in disaster relief, and operations that promote 
peace is conceivable. However, the spokesman of the Foreign 
Affairs Department ruled out joint field exercises with NATO 
units, as proposed by the Brussels document for this year. The 
goal of possible cooperation with NATO is ending Switzerland's 
"security-political blind flight" and establishing an open and 
structured dialogue with the Western military alliance.

<F P=106> [Article signed Bn: "Official Visit by the President of the </F>
Chinese Parliament in Switzerland: Meeting with Stich and 
Cotti"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern 23 Jan -- Qiao Shi, PRC NPC [National People's 
Congress] president, began a four-day official visit in 
Switzerland on Sunday [23 January]. On Monday he will meet Otto 
Stich, president of the Confederation, and Flavio Cotti, chief 
of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. At the heart of 
the talks will be bilateral economic relations and the question 
of Tibet. Two associations have protested against the visit of 
the former head of secret police. 
  Qiao Shi was received at Kloten Airport by Ricardo Jagmetti, 
president of the State Council. Besides economic relations 
between the two countries, the question of Tibet will probably 
be tackled, as John Clerc, secretary general of the Federal 
Assembly, indicated. 
<H5>  CERN and Chillon Castle </H5>
  The president of the Chinese NPC will be welcomed on Monday 
by Federal Counselors Otto Stich and Flavio Cotti as well as by 
Gret Haller, president of the National Council. On Tuesday, Mr. 
Qiao will visit CERN [European Organization for Nuclear 
Research] in Geneva and Chillon Castle, both in the French part 
of Switzerland. He concludes his visit on Wednesday with a stop 
at the federal polytechnic school. 
  Mr. Qiao, 69, is considered the third most powerful man in 
the Beijing regime. A member of the Politbureau permanent 
committee, he is also a former head of the secret police. 
  The visit by the president of the Chinese NPC has already 
resulted in protests. The Swiss German central PEN-Club, which 
protested on Saturday, stated that Qiao Shi is one of the 
principal authorities responsible for the bloody human rights 
repressions in China during the last decade. 
  The central PEN-Club points to thousands of people, 
including 
many writers, who have been imprisoned in China without judicial 
procedure. 
  They add that economic interests do not justify inviting 
Qiao 
Shi to Switzerland. 
<H5>  Colonialist and Soldiers </H5>
  On Friday, the association "Tibetan Youth in Europe" had 
asked the Federal Council to discuss the violations of human 
rights in Tibet with Qiao Shi. Due to the colonization politics 
and to the reinforcement of the Chinese military presence, 6 
million Tibetans are now confronted with 7 million Chinese 
colonialists and soldiers, the association stated. 
  The last visit to Switzerland by a high level Chinese 
visitor 
was in January 1992, when State Council Premier Li Peng had a 
talk with Confederation President Rene Felber and with Public 
Economic Chief Jean-Pascal Delamuraz. During that meeting, some 
200 Tibetans and members of human rights organizations held a 
demonstration.

<F P=106> [Article signed NI, SH: "The President of the Chinese </F>
Parliament Received in Bern; Human Rights on the Menu"; as 
released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Excerpts] Bern, 24 Jan (ATSA) -- Human rights dominated 
the conversations Qiao Shi, chairman of the Chinese National 
People's Congress, held in Bern on Monday [24 January]. Federal 
Councillor Flavio Cotti and National Council President Gret 
Haller expressed their concern about the human rights situation 
in China, particularly in Tibet. Confederation President Otto 
Stich promised China his country's support in case it seeks 
reintegration into GATT. 
  Mr. Cotti underlined that the human rights question 
particularly preoccupies Swiss public opinion. According to 
Franz Egle, his spokesman, the chief of the Foreign Affairs 
Department deplored the fact that China has not yet ratified the 
two 1966 conventions on human rights, which amend the 1948 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For his part, Mr. Qiao 
said the human rights situation had to be considered in light of 
China's development. 
<H5>  Reintegration in GATT </H5>
  The Chinese official's conversation with Otto Stich focused 
on Beijing's wish to rejoin the GATT, Federal Department of 
Finances spokesman Mario Carrera said. The Confederation 
president assured Qiao of Swiss support whenever China 
officially requests reintegration, once its commercial system 
has been modernized. Mr. Stich and Qiao also agreed that 
China's growth should keep pace with the development of social 
well-being. 
  Aside from the human rights question, Gret Haller, president 
of the National Council, raised the environmental problem, which 
often is neglected when a country such as China undergoes 
important economic and industrial changes. Qiao mentioned 
several laws that have been adopted in this field, but admitted 
that there sometimes is large distance between theory and 
practice. 
<H5>  Dalai Lama "Welcome" </H5>
  During his conversations, Qiao Shi called attention to Tibet 
and to the fact that the Dalai Lama would be welcome there for 
talks with the Chinese Government. The only thing "out of the 
question" would be independence. He also pointed out that the 
rights of minorities are written in the Chinese Constitution, 
and that freedom of worship also is guaranteed. However, up to 
a certain limit: The third most important Chinese explained that 
his country would accept no religious extremism whatsoever. 
[passage omitted] 
<H5>  Challenged Visit </H5>
  The Chinese official's visit to Switzerland already has 
caused protests. Some 30 Tibetans loudly protested his presence 
outside the Federal Palace, which was under the protection of 
grenadeers and dogs. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article signed HC; SH: "Breaking Windows at Iranian Embassy </F>
in Bern; Mujahideen Deny Being Implicated"; as released by Bern 
ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 25 Jan (ATSA) -- The mojahidin of the people 
of Iran have rejected any implication in the attack on the 
Iranian Embassy in Bern on Monday [24 January]. In a 
communique, the Bureau of the Mojahidin in Paris denies the 
"story fabricated" by IRNA, the official Iranian press agency. 
The spokesperson at the Public Ministry of the Confederation 
said the Iranian Embassy in Bern has three months to file a 
complaint. 
  Municipal police arrested two Iranian nationals on Monday 
for 
throwing stones at and breaking four windows of the [embassy] 
building. They were released early in the evening. According to 
the mojahidin, the Iranian regime hopes to impede the 
extradition of the murderers of Professor Kazem Radjavi by tying 
this action to their movement.

  [Text] Ankara (DPA) -- Germany's Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel met Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller in Ankara today. 
He was also received by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel. 
Kinkel held joint consultations beforehand with Douglas Hurd 
and Hikmet Cetin, his British and Turkish counterparts,. 
  Kinkel said in Ankara that Bonn backed cultural autonomy for 
the Kurdish minority and firmly rejected frontier alterations in 
the region. He spoke in favor of a stronger regional role for 
Turkey, which was an important partner for Europe. Germany 
supported Ankara's efforts on the path toward the European Union 
(EU). 
  The meeting with Hurd and Cetin, which was organized at 
Kinkel's initiative, also focused on developments in the 
Balkans, the Caucasus, and Iraq. Kinkel said the talks 
highlighted Turkey's special role in Europe's new security 
structure at the frontier with Asia as well as between 
Christianity and Islam. 
  Ankara would have to carry out domestic reforms in the field 
of justice, for example, and still had "a certain amount of 
homework to do," Kinkel said. In this context, he drew 
attention to the human rights situation, the Kurdish question, 
and the fight against the banned militant separatist 
organization PKK (Workers Party of Kurdistan), as well as to the 
burden that Islamic fundamentalism posed for the NATO state 
Turkey. 
  He reaffirmed Germany's obligation to look after almost 2 
million Turks, who must not, however, be allowed to settle 
political disputes on German soil. "My party and I support dual 
nationality as well as local election voting rights for 
foreigners, including citizens from countries such as Turkey, 
which are associate EU members," Kinkel said.

  [Text] Ankara (DPA) -- Germany and Britain have promised 
support to Turkey, as an important country on the border between 
Europe and Asia, but also warned it to adhere to human rights. 
After talks with Douglas Hurd and Hikmet Cetin, his British and 
Turkish counterparts, Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
underlined in Ankara today Turkey's role as a factor for 
stability in the region. 
  Kinkel and Hurd stressed Turkey's increasing importance as a 
country "on the border between Europe and Asia, between a 
disintegrating communism and an Islam that has regained 
strength." Turkey should therefore be supported in its regional 
role, which is important for the stabilization of conditions in 
the region, Kinkel said. 
  Kinkel, who also met President Suleyman Demirel and Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller as well as the national-liberal opposition 
leader Mesut Yilmaz, reminded Turkey to speedily implement the 
reform of the judicial system and improve the human rights 
situation. Turkey must conduct the struggle against the 
militant Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) in line with democracy 
and principles based on the rule of law. "We are not speaking 
with an admonishing finger, but with a well-disposed view of 
Turkey," Kinkel said. 
  Cetin said Turkey is conducting the struggle against the PKK 
in line with democracy and human rights. He confirmed that Hurd 
and Kinkel also raised the situation of the Orthodox Christians 
in southeastern Turkey. "However, it is not Turkey but the PKK 
which drove the Christians out of their villages, and the 
Christians themselves are calling on us to help them return to 
their villages," Cetin said. 
  Kinkel and Hurd confirmed their adherence to the 
inviolability of the borders of the states in the region. "What 
we want is not new states, but cultural autonomy for the Kurds 
to enable them to preserve and cultivate their identity," Kinkel 
said. He spoke in favor of supporting Turkey in overcoming its 
problems and bringing it closer to Europe as a politically, 
economically, and culturally important partner. 
  Other topics in the trilateral meeting, which, according to 
Turkish information, will be repeated in London this year, were 
developments in the Caucasus and in the Balkans.

<F P=106> [Article by Wio Joustra: "Risk Battalion in Bosnia </F>
Acceptable"] 
  [Text] Just over one-half of Netherlanders consider the 
risks run by Dutch soldiers in the former Yugoslavia to be 
acceptable. One in three Netherlanders find them unacceptable. 
According to an opinion poll conducted by the NIPO [Netherlands 
Institute for Public Opinion] and commissioned by the SMK 
[Foundation for Society and the Armed Forces], the figures are 
57 and 29 percent respectively. 
  The representative sample on which the figures are based was 
interviewed on 20 and 21 December 1993, at a time when there was 
still uncertainty regarding the dispatch of some 1,200 
Netherlander ground troops to eastern Bosnia. There are now 
around 2,000 netherlander troops in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Since the end of December, both the likelihood of sending 
out 
the reinforced light mobile battalion and of NATO air strikes in 
the area where Netherlander troops are stationed has increased. 
According to Defense Minister Ter Beek, if necessary the 
battalion will take "robust" action in order to fulfill its dual 
humanitarian mission -- to protect the Muslim population and 
humanitarian aid convoys. As many as 70 percent of 
Netherlanders are strongly in favor of using force if necessary 
in order to get this aid through -- even if this does increase 
the risk to Dutch soldiers. 
  At the same time, the Dutch are also becoming increasingly 
pessimistic regarding the likelihood of a lasting peace in the 
former Yugoslavia. At the end of 1991, half of public opinion 
no longer believed in a negotiated peace. One year later this 
figure had increased to 66 percent, and last month the figure 
had risen to 84 percent. 
  The SMK adds that, in an opinion poll, every vigorous 
proposal to do something about the war in Bosnia and the 
suffering of the civilians is welcomed, even if they involve 
greater dangers for their own soldiers. But as soon as these 
risks are separately scrutinized, the majority in favor 
decreases. Questions which make specific reference to possible 
dead and wounded apparently meet with just a minority in favor 
of the use of force which involves risks. 
  The high percentage of people who are pessimistic regarding 
peace in the former Yugoslavia does not really come as a 
surprise. There is in fact no optimism regarding any of the 
world's troublespots. Of particular note is the somber appraisal 
of the prospects for peace in the (former) Soviet Union: 64 
percent are pessimistic and 13 percent optimistic. The 
electoral success of the far-right nationalist Zhirinovskiy has 
"certainly not reduced" these figures. 
  Two out of three Netherlanders believe that Poland, the 
Czech 
Republic, and Hungary should be able to join NATO. The picture 
of an unsafe world is confirmed by the fact that 54 percent of 
the population believe that the number of armed conflicts will 
increase in the near future. 
  Against this background, the SMK does not find it strange 
that 74 percent -- a level not recorded since the end of the 
Cold War -- of people believe there is a need for the armed 
forces. 
  At 72 percent, participation in UN missions in general 
receives virtually the same level of support. This does not 
detract from the fact that the defense of one's own and allied 
territories is seen by most people (40 percent) as the most 
important task of the armed forces. Humanitarian aid is seen to 
be the most important by 35 percent, and worldwide crisis 
management the most important by 21 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 26 KYODO -- Britain will promote its 
trade with Japan in a new campaign starting April, David Warren, 
commercial counselor at the British Embassy in Japan said 
Wednesday [26 January]. 
  The campaign, named Action Japan, will focus on trade with 
Japan in nine specific industrial areas, Warren told a press 
conference at the embassy. 
  The areas are auto parts, electronic devices, construction, 
health care, fashion, textiles, food, environmental and marine 
equipment and projects in third world countries, Warren said. 
  Warren said British exporters should increase their efforts 
to successfully enter Japanese markets, which he termed 
"strategically the most important" for British firms operating 
in Asia. 
  He said he does not observe "significantly big institutional 
problems" in Japan that may hamper the smooth entry of British 
firms. 
  The campaign will replace the Priority Japan Program that 
began in 1991 and will expire in March this year, which called 
for raising annual British exports to Japan to 5 billion pounds 
(7.58 billion dollars). 
  Such exports totaled about 2.5 billion pounds in 1993, 
Warren 
said, noting more efforts are necessary both in governmental and 
private-sector levels.

<F P=106> [Article by George Jones: "Pay Review Bodies Reject Clarke </F>
Freeze"] 
  [Text] The Prime Minister faced a new challenge last night 
over pay for 1.3 million public sector workers as the Government 
was forced on to the defensive over Labour claims that taxes are 
set to rise for the next five years. Reliable reports at 
Westminster indicated that six pay review bodies, dealing with 
groups ranging from doctors to teachers, are preparing to defy 
the Chancellor's public sector pay freeze. 
  It is understood that the review bodies are taking as their 
base line the 2.7 percent pay rise which MPs voted for 
themselves from the beginning of this year. 
  They are expected to recommend rises that at least match the 
MPs' award and may be closer to the average increase of 3 
percent in the private sector. 
  The Government has frozen public sector pay bills at current 
levels, which means that any wage increases will have to be paid 
for through "efficiency savings" -- improved productivity or the 
loss of jobs. 
  Mr Clarke has already said he will not dip into the 
Government's contingency reserve as in previous years to fund 
higher pay. 
  Inflation-beating increases of 2 to 3 percent recommended by 
the review bodies will embarrass the Government. Ministers will 
face the difficult decision of trying to scale back the awards 
or letting them go ahead, stressing that they must be paid for 
by more redundancies among public sector workers. This could 
result in the closure of schools and hospital wards. 
  Downing Street confirmed last night that Mr Major had 
received the annual reports from the independent review body for 
doctors and dentists and that for nurses and midwives. 
  Reports from the other review bodies covering professions 
allied to medicine; teachers; top civil servants, judges and 
senior officers in the armed forces are to be published with the 
Government's conclusions next month. 
  Unions representing public sector workers have given a 
warning of a "spring offensive" if the Government seeks to 
impose a pay freeze and block the awards from the review bodies. 
  Curbing public sector pay is central to the Chancellor's 
efforts to hold down public spending and reduce the 50 billion 
[U.S. trillion] pound borrowing requirement. Any significant 
increase in pay levels would push up Government spending and 
lead to even higher tax levels. 
  Labour's allegation yesterday that official Treasury figures 
showing the tax burden would continue rising over the next five 
years overshadowed an optimistic report on the strength of 
economic recovery. 
  According to the CBI's [Confederation of British Industry] 
quarterly industrial trends survey, for the first time since 
1989 more firms are expecting to increase rather than decrease 
investment in plant and machinery over the next 12 months. 
  But the CBI voiced its concern that the 8 billion pounds of 
tax increases due in April could check the recovery. "The 
fiscal tightening introduced in the 1993 budgets has yet to 
impact fully on the economy," it said. "It will remove a 
significant proportion of purchasing power from the economy and 
hold back growth in demand." 
  At Westminster Tory MPs returned shaken by the disclosure 
that the average family's tax burden is about to become greater 
than it was under Labour in 1979. They are concerned that the 
Tories are losing their reputation as the party of low taxation. 
  Senior Tories are also worried that the Government appears 
to 
be lurching from one crisis to the next with no clear direction. 
  With New Year not yet a month old, the Government has become 
embroiled by allegations of "sleaze," by confusion over Back to 
Basics and now Labour claims that the Tories have misled the 
voters over taxes. 
  There was some relief for the embattled party managers last 
night when a threatened backbench Conservative revolt on VAT 
[value-added tax] on domestic fuel appeared to have fizzled out. 
  Tory rebels have decided not to join Labour in voting 
against 
VAT on fuel at the end of tonight's vote on the second reading 
of the Finance Bill implementing the November Budget. 
  The rebels were told that a Government defeat would have 
forced the withdrawal of the Bill, triggering a financial crisis. 
  The Government's nervousness over the accusation that it was 
taxing more than Labour resulted in a round of television 
interviews by the Chancellor to defend the tax rises. 
  Mr Clarke stressed that the increases, which include VAT on 
household fuel, were necessary to ensure Britain's recovery from 
recession could be sustained. 
  Both he and Downing Street described comparisons of tax 
levels with those in 1978-79, the last year of the Labour 
government, as bogus. They argued that people were better off 
now than they were in 1979. 
  Labour kept up the pressure, with Mr Gordon Brown, the 
shadow 
chancellor, saying voters would never again trust the 
Conservatives, who had "lied" on income tax, VAT on fuel and 
National Insurance contributions. 
  "John Major actually promised that he would have tax cuts -- 
as he put it -- year on year when it is tax rises year on year," 
said Mr Brown . 
  He released an analysis of Treasury figures which he said 
was 
a five-year Treasury plan of increased direct and indirect 
taxes, showing taxes rising to 35.5 percent of national income 
this year to 37.5 percent 1996-97 and 38.5 percent in 1998-99. 
  An analysis of the figures also showed that at the time when 
the new tax increases begin to bite, council tax is expected to 
rise 5-10 percent. 
  Sir Rhodes Boyson, Conservative MP for Brent North, told BBC 
Radio 4's "The World At One" program, "We shall have to get back 
to low taxes before the next general election, otherwise we will 
pay a heavy penalty. 
  "The electorate may exact their revenge on us."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Help From the Television Bureau"] </F>
  [Text] Astonishment and excitement on Lerchenberg in 
Mainz. ZDF [German TV Two], one of the biggest European 
broadcasting stations, had concluded a cooperation agreement 
with the Iranian state television, IRIB, in 1991. Now the 
people in Mainz had to learn from French judicial circles that 
their partners are said to be involved in the state terrorism of 
the mullahs. 
  "We are shocked," said Petra Zilken from the ZDF department 
for international affairs, "we have to think thoroughly about 
further cooperation." 
  The serious accusation is made in a charge that was filed by 
the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office in Paris and has been 
secret so far. The file sent to the Elysee Palace deals with 
the murder of former Iranian Prime Minister Shapur Bakhtiar. 
Three men killed the politician, who had escaped to French 
exile, by numerous knife thrusts on 6 August 1991. 
  Before the end of this year, the presumable perpetrators are 
to be brought to trial in Paris. 
  After several dozen assassination attempts in Europe, among 
them the assassination of exiled Iranians in the Berlin 
"Mykonos" restaurant, it has now become known for the first 
time: Iran regularly used its television correspondents to 
provide the logistics for the killers. According to the French 
investigators, in this way they organized papers, apartments, 
and cars. Their advantage: Because of their cooperation with 
big European televisions stations, they enjoy hospitality in 
many places and can move unhindered everywhere. 
  In the case of Bakhtiar's murder, the wirepuller was in the 
Rue de Liege 27: Mas'ud Hendi, 45, Paris bureau chief of the 
Persian television station, IRIB, and nephew of Ayatollah 
Khomeyni. Hendi procured the visas for the two Iranian agents 
who have to stand trial for Bakhtiar's murder. Hendi himself is 
also detained. 
  A document of the French prosecutors shows that the Iranian 
Ministry for Telecommunications, partner of ZDF and other 
television stations, is doing the preliminary work for the 
assassination commands. 
  The Swiss television station, SRG, which only concluded an 
agreement with the Iranians in November 1993, reacted 
immediately. "Until the accusations are clarified, our agreement 
will be suspended," said Oswald Sigg, spokesman of the SRG 
executive board. 
  Tehran's answer came promptly. Last Thursday [20 January], 
Rudolf Weiersmueller, Swiss ambassador to Iran, was called to 
the Foreign Ministry. He had to receive a sharp protest note 
from the mullahs -- a further leg in the controversy between 
Switzerland and Iran, which has been smoldering for some time. 
  The Alpine republic has an international arrest warrant for 
Mohsen Sharif Esfahani, 39, and Ahmad Taheri, 32. Together with 
others, they are said to have executed former UN diplomat Kazem 
Rajavi in his Geneva exile in April 1990. 
  The wanted persons were imprisoned in France. In the event 
of their extradition, which had been demanded by Switzerland, 
Tehran threatened a "fireworks of bombs" toward French mediator 
Jean Charles Marchiani. With success: The presumable 
terrorists were permitted to leave unmolested for Iran. 
  The German Federal Government was also well out of it 
because, before their trip to France, the presumed murderers had 
traveled from Frankfurt to Aachen -- watched by German security 
authorities. 
  On 17 November 1992, the Swiss police briefed the Federal 
Office of Criminal Investigation: "Ahmad Taheri and Sharif 
Esfahani, who were arrested in Paris, are suspects in the RAJAVI 
murder case." 
  The French received the decisive tipoff for the arrest from 
their German colleagues.

<F P=106> [Lothar Ruehl report: "NATO Initiative Meets With </F>
Resistance"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- Significant differences in the interests 
of the participating states were shown yesterday at a security 
policy conference in Berlin. FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe 
had invited experts from 14 nations to the Spree to develop with 
them concrete steps in the NATO initiative Partnership for 
Peace. At their summit meeting two weeks ago, the NATO states 
had offered close cooperation to all democratic countries of 
East and Central Europe -- as a possible preliminary step toward 
full membership. 
  The debate was dominated by the differences between Ukraine 
and Russia and the unchanged demand of Poland, Hungary, the 
Czech Republic, and Slovakia for speedy admission to NATO. 
These states see in this the only alternative to the 
development of a new "Russian sphere of interests" and a 
possible "threat to political stability" in East Europe. 
  Ukrainian Deputy and defense expert Serhiy Holovatyy 
resolutely rejected the admission of countries west of Ukraine 
to NATO. He even rejected the offer by the NATO initiative to 
consult the North Atlantic Council in situations threatening 
states outside NATO. Both might result in Ukraine's separation 
from West Europe, but also from its western neighbors in Central 
Europe, and in a new dependence on Russia. However, Ukraine 
does not want to find itself in a joint security zone with 
Russia, he said. 
  The security of the country is determined by certain Russian 
tendencies and political forces, the Ukrainian politician 
stated. He sees the danger that Moscow might support "Russian 
separatism in Ukraine" with the objective "of splitting off," 
for example, "the Crimea, the Don basin, and south Ukraine." 
However, such a Russian policy also endangers the agreement 
between Clinton, Yeltsin, and Kravchuk on the elimination of 
nuclear weapons on Ukrainian soil, which has just been 
concluded, he said. 
  However, Russian representative Sergey Karaganov denied that 
his country had such intentions or any Russian interest in a new 
annexation of Ukraine. He warned against the admission of new 
NATO members. This may weaken NATO politically and reduce its 
"deterrent power" toward aggressive Russian politicians and the 
security of East Europe. Russia, however, needs a strong NATO 
as a partner for securing its own democratic reforms and a new 
foreign policy orientation to international cooperation with the 
West, he said.

<F P=106> [Report signed "Ws": "Interim Stocktaking of Russian </F>
Withdrawal"] 
  [Text] Berlin, 25 Jan -- Colonel-General Burlakov, 
commander in chief of the Western Group of Russian Forces, has 
spoken out for a continued close military cooperation between 
Russia and Germany after the withdrawal of Russian troops from 
Germany. Burlakov, who is expecting the Bundeswehr chief of 
staff, General Naumann at the Western Group of Russian Forces 
headquarters at Wuensdorf south of Berlin this Thursday [27 
January], said in Berlin that such cooperation could include 
joint field exercises. 
  Taking stock of the withdrawal of Russian troops from 
Germany, Burlakov once again severely criticized the delays that 
have occurred in the housing program for soldiers returning from 
Germany. From the families of soldiers that returned home 
between 1990 and 1993, 40 to 45 percent are without apartments. 
The chief of staff blamed both the Russian Defense Ministry and 
the German side for the slow realization of the housing program. 
He accused the Defense Ministry, which did not decide on new 
locations in Russia until after the withdrawal had begun, of bad 
planning and mismanagement at the building sites and the German 
Economics Ministry of insufficient control of the German 
companies carrying out the building work. He said that some of 
these companies were lagging up to 10 months behind schedule. 
The part of the housing project funded by Germany with 7.8 
billion marks, is to provide 25,000 apartments by the time of 
the final withdrawal on 31 August. The part funded by the 
Russian Defense Ministry has to complete some 22,000 apartments. 
While the withdrawal of troops is on schedule, he doubts that 
the housing program will be completed on time, Burlakov said. 
  He said that of 546,000 former Soviet troops stationed in 
Germany up to mid-1990, only 68,000 had remained by 1 January 
this year. To date, 90 percent of war materiel and ammunition 
have been withdrawn. In this connection, Burlakov denied German 
reports saying that Russian statistics are missing some 81,000 
tonnes of ammunition that seem to have disappeared. Over the 
past years, the Western Group has conducted an intensive 
training program, during which a great quantity of ammunition 
was fired. Besides, the supreme commander said, not a single 
Russian bullet, bomb, nor shell will remain in Germany after the 
withdrawal. 
  The Russian commander in chief is concerned about the 
increasing number of crimes committed around the Russian 
garrisons. While a total of 277 unlawful acts were reported in 
1991, the figure had risen to 1,038 in 1992, and to 1,277 in 
1993. In 1992, 816 of these offenses were committed by 
"immigrants," 389 by German citizens; the rest of the offenders 
could not be clearly established. By "immigrants" Burlakov 
means people from the former Soviet Union's successor states -- 
including soldiers stationed here before -- who conducted their 
dark dealings near the Russian barracks, often organized in 
gangs. According to Burlakov, 23 Russian soldiers were killed 
in attacks over the past years. On the other hand, Russian 
soldiers committed 72 crimes since 1990, involving five deaths. 
  The colonel-general expressly rejected allegations that 
Russian forces are involved in liquor and cigarette trafficking. 
He said these are isolated cases and are severely punished by 
the military authorities. Close investigations into the Western 
Group by the Russian Public Prosecutor and other authorities 
have shown that the allegation of corruption and a reference to 
Mafia-like structures are unfounded. Yet, offenses by 
individual members of the Western Group cannot be denied. In 
this connection, Burlakov confirmed that the 10,000 sports 
rifles that were seized in mid-January had been brought to 
Germany illegally by a Russian company in aircraft belonging to 
the Western Group via the Sperenberg air base to be passed to a 
Hamburg company. 
  The supreme commander has already some specific ideas about 
the way to mark the farewell of Russian forces from German soil 
-- which after all means finally putting an end to World War II. 
Since the Germans do not want a joint farewell ceremony for the 
Russians and the French, British, and American forces, the 
Russians are now planning a joint function with the Germans on a 
state level. President Yeltsin and Chancellor Kohl have already 
been in contact over this matter. Colonel-General Burlakov, who 
wants to leave Germany as the last Russian soldier on 31 August, 
is thinking of celebrations in two stages. In the time between 
1 and 10 May, a "week of remembrance" should be held, with 
commemoration services honoring soldiers killed, not only in 
Germany, but also in Russia, if possible. In early August, an 
event should take place at the Soviet memorial in Berlin's 
Treptow Park with Yeltsin and Kohl attending, street festivals, 
and a meeting of veterans. The Russian side is now waiting for 
the German reply to these suggestions, said Burlakov.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Corpses in the Lake"] </F>
  [Text] Two weeks ago, two four-engine Antonov-12 freight 
planes carrying a mysterious load landed at the Sperenberg air 
base near Wuensdorf, the location of the supreme command of the 
Western Group of Russian Forces in Germany (WGT). The following 
day, the freight, a total of 327 crates, was taken away in a 
German truck, escorted by several cars. 
  But the trip came to an end after a few kilometers. German 
police stopped the convoy, having been tipped off by the 
military prosecutor at Wuensdorf. 
  They arrested 11 people, including an honorable Russian 
lieutenant colonel: Anatoliy Golubev (33), head of the Wuensdorf 
Army Hunting Club. 
  An inspection confirmed the suspicion against the 
recreational hunter. The freight documents indicated "sports 
guns" addressed to a Hamburg trading company, but what the 
crates actually contained was much hotter stuff: 9,810 9-mm guns 
of the "Makarov" type. 
  This mishap of the Golubev group showed for the first time 
to 
what extent Russian troops in Germany are involved in arms 
trading. Colonel General Matvey Burlakov, supreme commander at 
Wuensdorf has disputed such links up to now. 
  Concerned about the image of his troops, which will finally 
withdraw during 1994, the supreme commander emphasized time and 
again that his people were not involved in Mafia-like activities 
around the garrisons, where officers are blackmailed, wagons of 
cigarettes are traded, and supply goods trafficked. In the 
surroundings of the garrison, the jobbers, who mostly come from 
the CIS, carry out their rivalries with guns: police quite 
frequently recover corpses of dead gangsters from hotel rooms 
and lakes in Brandenburg. 
  On Christmas Eve, a Russian civilian died in a shootout 
among 
mafiosi near Sperenberg. When a fight among dealers in front of 
the WGT headquarters got out of hand last week, a guard fired 
his gun. An asylum-seeker from Azerbaijan was killed. 
  Colonel General Burlakov says that his garrisons are 
downright beleaguered by radical dealers: "The circle is getting 
ever closer." But the arrest of gun shipper Golubev shows that 
many an insider has a finger in the pie. Both the majority of 
officers at Wuensdorf and the Army leadership in Moscow have 
seen it that way for a long time. At the end of November, 
Burlakov received a very embarrassing coded telegram ("No. 2267, 
2268", "No copies"). In this telegram, Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev told his governor at Wuensdorf to increase discipline 
and order within his troops. Following this, Burlakov made a 
written note saying that he wanted to effect the direction 
"forcefully, if necessary." 
  The leadership in Moscow criticized generals and officers 
for 
increasingly misusing their ranks for private affairs. Grachev: 
"A lack of control in the distribution of funds designated for 
the troops encourages such affairs." 
  There have also been instances where high-ranking officers 
were involved, such as Colonel Alexeji Varlevich Belikov, who is 
stationed near Magdeburg. The son of a former commander in 
chief at Wuensdorf was suspected of smuggling cigarettes. 
  While the final withdrawal of the troops, scheduled for the 
end of August, is approaching, greed amongst the WGT troops is 
on the increase. Military prosecutors are investigating the 
case of officers selling off a complete set of aerial 
photographs of the former GDR territory from the headquarters 
"topography section" to a Berlin company via middlemen. 
  The 11,000 photographic plates on the scale of 1:22,000, 
were 
made in the early 1950's, and were used, among other things, to 
spot inherited environmental problems. The 48 crates were 
traded in return for a shipment of computers from Singapore 
worth 90,000 German marks [DM] -- a nice bargain for the 
Russians who are getting worried about their future: Later on, 
back home in Russia, a colonel has to make do with the 
equivalent of DM120 per month. 
  Even more bizarre is a deal that is currently being 
investigated by the military authorities, and that again 
involves Lieutenant Colonel Golubev, who has established a 
trading company at Berlin-Karlshorst, together with other 
partners. Recently, Golubev received 17 wagons containing parts 
for prefabricated houses produced by the Russian Army. 
According to Army lawyers, the imports are to be sold as 
hunting lodges in Germany for DM50,000 each. 
  The contract was signed by resigned Lieutenant General 
Maganov, the head of the Army's Hunting Club in the Moscow 
Defense Ministry. 
  Another officer who profited from good German contacts is 
the 
former deputy chief of staff of the Western Group, General 
Lieutenant Leonid Cherbakev. He was deputy head of the 
Konversion Wohnraum [living space conversion] company, which 
also owns Army enterprises and WGT land. 
  Investigators accuse him of trying to smuggle money and raw 
material out of the country in an Army aircraft last April, 
controlling the action from Moscow. When the load was checked, 
trading documents on weapons, raw material, and radioactive 
material were seized. 
  Another officer accused of embezzlement and customs offenses 
is General Lieutenant Seliverstov, a former general with the WGT 
Air Force. Seliverstov is considered the organizer of a 
sensational transfer of presents: In 1992, via middlemen, WGT 
officers had procured an S-class Mercedes worth over DM150,000 
for the leadership of the Defense Ministry and shipped it to 
Moscow. 
  The moral decline within the troops makes their boss gloomy. 
"The vices of society," Grachev tells his Wuensdorf governor 
Burlakov in a telegram, "are seeping ever deeper into officers' 
circles."

<F P=106> [Report signed "ay": "`Calmer' Reforms"] </F>
  [Text] Duesseldorf -- The economic reforms in Russia will 
continue, "but they will be more cautious, calmer, and more 
balanced," said Nikolai Ryabov, chairman of the Russian 
Federation Electoral Commission and vice president of the CSCE 
parliamentary assembly in Moscow, speaking to HANDELSBLATT. The 
removal of former Deputy Prime Ministers Gaydar and Fyodorov, 
whom Ryabov sees as having been "marginal figures in the 
cabinet," from the cabinet of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin in no 
way means the end of the reforms: "Those are guaranteed by 
Yeltsin and the Constitution." 
  However, Ryabov, who was vice president of the Supreme 
Soviet 
under putsch leader Khasbulatov last year, makes it perfectly 
clear that radical reforms, especially those involving the 
privatization of state plants, do not have much of a future. In 
the future, social considerations must come first. The 
privatization of state plants is also one of the main problems 
for Ryabov. Thus, the property ownership issue also has not 
been resolved: Which elements of a plant (the land, the 
machinery) belong to whom (the local community, the province, or 
the federation)? 
  The parliamentary elections in December did produce 
surprising results, but the many votes for the radical 
right-wing Liberal Democrats did not reflect political reality, 
they do not, above all, permit a general conclusion to be drawn 
that there is a radical nationalist trend in Russia. In his 
opinion, too much importance is being attributed to LDP [Liberal 
Democratic Party] leader Zhirinovskiy, especially abroad, 
although Ryabov also concedes that "in view of their history, 
Germans react with more sensitivity to political anomalies than 
other Europeans." Whereas Zhirinvoskiy was not that well-known 
among the Russians before the elections, "today, most Russians 
are not that indifferent." 
  According to Ryabov -- whose function roughly corresponds to 
that of the German federal election manager -- following the 
elections, his authorities began to check how parties' and 
groups' election campaigns were financed. He is familiar with 
Western media reports about the LDP election campaign being 
financed from abroad, and the LDP will also be questioned. 
"Should the investigation reveal any irregularities, then that 
will appear in a report to be given to parliament, and it is 
then up to parliament to pass resolutions on measures to be 
applied against the parties concerned." That will happen before 
June of this year, because provincial and municipal elections 
are to be held in June. 
  Ryabov defends unreservedly the foreign policy course being 
pursued by the government and President Yeltsin, who in recent 
months has pursued a massive campaign against admission to NATO 
for the Baltic states as well as the Central and East European 
states of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. The Partnership 
for Peace formula that the Western side has now come up with is 
also satisfactory for Russia, whereas admission to NATO for 
those countries would constitute "a threat to Russia and its 
interests." He termed the demands for NATO protection the 
product of "a hysterical campaign against Russia in the Baltic 
and East Europe countries."

<F P=106> [Report signed "rom": "Cooperation Treaty With China </F>
Signed"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf -- On Monday [24 January], North 
Rhine-Westphalia and the PRC signed a memorandum on economic, 
technological, and scientific cooperation. As North 
Rhine-Westphalia Economics Minister Guenther Einert explained, 
this should put an end to the "concept of nothing but the export 
of goods." 
  The cooperation treaty is the result of a visit paid to 
China 
by a delegation made up of 50 representatives of North 
Rhine-Westphalian companies led by the minister in October of 
last year. The main points of the agreement are: 

  -  The 
establishment of cooperation between interested companies from 
North Rhine-Westphalia and appropriate Chinese parties for the 
development and production of robust, inexpensive, numerically 
controlled machine tools that are simple to operate for the 
Chinese market; 
  -  The establishment of a technology center for the 
plants supplying the automobile industry in Wuhan. Under the 
recent initiative of the North Rhine-Westphalia Automobile 
Association, which was recently set up, partners will be sought 
who want to be based at the center and operate on a joint 
venture basis. 
  -  The development and construction of clean 
coal-fired power plants. The project should involve the 
participation of power companies and scientific circles. As 
Einert pointed out, China's coal reserves are estimated to 
amount to 970 billion tonnes. The growing demand for power on 
the part of industry, which is expanding, and private households 
has to be taken into consideration; 120 million people have 
still to be connected to the public power supply; 
  -  According to 
Einert and Wang Chunzheng, the deputy chairman of the PRC's 
State Planning Commission, cooperation should also involve joint 
research projects about structural change in the developed and 
newly industrialized countries; launching scientific and 
technical projects; and exchanging information about areas of 
interest for investment in both countries. The cooperation 
should be coordinated by a commission, which will meet twice a 
year and will establish a program for two-year periods. 
  As Einert explained, the cooperation with North 
Rhine-Westphalia companies should smooth the way to Southeast 
Asia and provide the Chinese economy with competent partners. 
The minister thus wants to involve Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg, 
and Hessen in this kind of cooperation and has already started 
negotiations with them. 
  Wang stressed that the State Planning Commission, which is 
the top coordinating body for the economic activities of 
individual ministries and determines a framework for the further 
development of the socialist market economy, nowadays hardly 
ever issues "plans of a directive kind." In this respect, 
decentralization is "well advanced." Since the beginning of the 
economic reforms in China 15 years ago, one has increasingly 
gone over from "a principle of commanding" to one of 
"instructing." Thus, in 1994, only about 4 percent of the 
country's industrial output is "organized" through directives 
issued by the State Planning Commission. 
  In addition, Wang has also been seeking longer-term 
involvement in China by German companies. China has a market of 
about 1.1 billion people that has to be supplied. Since 1990, 
industrial output rose by 6 percent in 1990, by 14.2 percent in 
1991, and by 21.7 percent in the following year. The Chinese 
GNP has also risen at a similar rate: The GNP rose by 13 
percent between 1992 and 1993 and is expected to increase by 
about 10 percent in 1994.

  [Text] According to Interior Minister Manfred Kanther, 
every month 14,000 illegal immigrants come to Germany. This 
number is "unbearably large," the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU] politician complained in a comparable meeting. Thus, what 
was reported by FOCUS two weeks ago has been officially 
established by the government: After the amendment to the Basic 
Law on asylum, almost the same number of foreigners come to the 
country illegally. The decrease in immigration only takes place 
in the statistics. Kanther reported that in 1993, 2,000 refugee 
smugglers were arrested; 97 percent of them had been foreigners. 
Otto Hauser, Baden-Wuerttemberg CDU land group chairman, called 
for a draconian punishment of up to 10 years' imprisonment for 
refugee smugglers. "There is no other way." 
  Kanther is now planning the employment of foreign officers 
as 
undercover investigators against foreign criminal gangs.

<F P=106> [Ludwig Rademacher report: "The Move Toward Instead"] </F>
  [Text] Associations of voters, such as the Hamburg Instead 
Party will change Germany's political scenery in the 1994 
superelection year. They might achieve almost 30 percent of the 
votes. This is the result of a poll conducted by the Institute 
for Applied Social Studies (Infas). 
  According to the poll, 6 percent of all voters are sure that 
they want to vote for such a group. Another 23 percent think 
they will "probably" vote for such a group. 
  In December, the Bonn-based institute polled 914 
representative voters for FOCUS, asking their opinion of the 
Instead Party. 
  The Instead Party was founded in the summer of 1993 by 
Hamburg Christian Democratic Union "rebel" Markus E. Wegner. It 
only ran in the repetition of the land parliament elections, 
which Wegner had finally achieved by court order. The party won 
5.6 percent of the votes and entered into a government coalition 
with the Social Democratic Party. 
  Encouraged by the success in Hamburg, voters' associations 
in 
all laender are now forming Instead Parties; and an expansion 
throughout Germany is already agreed. Whether the Instead Party 
runs in the Bundestag elections next autumn will be decided 
during the summer. 
  The prospects for the party are good: Every other voter 
thinks that the Instead Party is a necessary addition to 
existing parties. There might be some skeptical attitudes on the 
issue of consistency: 57 percent of those polled think that the 
Instead Party "will have disappeared before long." According to 
the study, the Instead Party's greatest potential lies with 
younger voters. A total of 72 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds 
consider such groups necessary, while only 38 percent of those 
over 50 think so, and 49 percent of them consider these groups 
superfluous. Among the middle-aged, 46 percent think such 
groups are necessary, while 33 percent do not think much of them. 
  On the whole, men are more inclined towards the Instead 
Party 
than women. The party's potential lies with workers, 
self-employed people, and freelancers.

  [Text] Ernst Uhrlau from the Social Democratic Party of

Republikaner as "extreme right." Uhrlau told FOCUS: "Of 
course, we class the Republikaner among the right-wing

FRG." The Cologne Office for the Protection of the Constitution 
takes a different view. In internal statistics for 1993, the 
Cologne officials do not class Schoenhuber's adherents among the 
43,000 right-wing extremists in Germany. According to Office 
Spokesman Hans-Gerd Lange, there are "only starting points for 
extreme-right aspirations." Uhrlau, however, talks of 66,000 
right-wing extremists, including 23,000 Republikaner. Uhrlau 
said: "I do not understand why the Republikaner are ignored in 
the statistics."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on 13 January Bundestag meeting: "In </F>
Favor of Equal Conditions for Competition and Export Within the 
European Union"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted]. Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel addresses the three great goals of arms export policy and 
discusses the specific problems of arms exports that make 
efforts at harmonizing by the countries concerned so complicated: 
  "German arms export policy has to fit in with German foreign 
and security policy, which aims at securing peace. This 
corresponds to values that have been firmly anchored in our 
country, throughout all political parties, ever since our 
constitution was proclaimed. 
  "We do not want to, and we will not give up this all-party 
consensus on our restrictive export policy principles of 1982. 
  "The Federal Government pursues three great objectives in 
its 
arms export policy: 

  -  "safeguarding national and European 
security interests; 
  -  "taking into account the justified interests 
of industry; 
  -  "preventing an unrestrained spread of mass 
destruction weapons, but also of conventional arms. 
  "On the other hand, I am well aware of the economic problems 
this involves for a highly specialized industry in our country. 
The answer to these problems -- which are not restricted to 
Germany -- cannot be an export offensive for weapons. But we 
also need industrial capacities that guarantee our ability to 
defend ourselves, to form alliances and to cooperate within the 
alliance -- also as a basis for codetermination and influence. 
This means that German industry must remain able to cooperate 
in these areas. We want to contribute to this -- by simplifying 
procedures." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Wolfgang Piller, president of the Federal </F>
Association of German Aerospace and Defense Industries, by 
unattributed FOCUS reporter; place and date not given: "Bonn 
Should Not Vacillate"] 
  [Text] [FOCUS] The defense industry has empty order books 
and an uncertain future. How do you feel as a German defense 
industry manager? 
  [Piller] I feel better than a year ago, when I was elected 
president of the Federal Association of German Aerospace and 
Defense Industries. I feel better, because public opinion has 
increasingly come to believe that the serious problems that 
people face, such as security, information, communications, 
mobility, and, last, but not least, environmental protection 
cannot be solved without the skills of the aerospace and defense 
industries. I would feel even better if Bonn believed that an 
economy that has maintained one of the highest standards of 
living in the world does not want want to disregard an area of 
such valuable net output. 
  [FOCUS] So, what are the greatest problems that the defense 
industry faces? 
  [Piller] We see ourselves increasingly confronted with 
reductions in the Bundeswehr procurement budget for which 
provision cannot be made. The quota for investment has fallen 
from 30 percent to 20 percent. Now we have got 15 percent, if I 
leave aside socks, underwear, and boots, which have nothing to 
do with high-tech products. There is no industry in the world 
that can survive that without being damaged. 
  [FOCUS] You have called for a relaxation of the rules 
governing German weapons exports. Do you consider that to be a 
general panacea that will save the German aerospace and defense 
industries? 
  [Piller] No, not at all. We do not advocate the 
unrestricted export of defense goods to all corners of the 
world. We are not concerned about a relaxation, but more about 
cross-border opportunities for cooperation on the part of the 
aerospace industry through the introduction of uniform 
regulations for all the countries in Europe. The aerospace 
industry is dependent on international cooperation for its 
survival. That is why there must now be some uniformity in the 
rules governing exports of weapons. 
  [FOCUS] Would you place the entire blame for the collapse of 
the German defense industry on Bonn? 
  [Piller] No. At the moment, our markets have declined for 
various reasons. The end of the East-West confrontation has had 
a significant impact on defense technology. However, a 
significant part of the negative consequences of this 
development in the industry are attributable to the fact that 
the necessary political decisions -- for example, those 
regarding the way in which the Bundeswehr has been equipped -- 
were made too slowly or not at all. 
  [FOCUS] Do you lack certainty with regard to planning? 
  [Piller] Absolutely. Aerospace projects must involve 
long-term planning. For that, one needs guidelines for the 
future stemming from a security policy that has been clearly 
defined. Germany has still not sufficiently defined its role in 
Europe and the rest of the world clearly enough.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Customers Stay Away"] </F>
  [Text] Asylum experts in the Interior Ministry feel that 
they have been made fools of. The 7 May 1993 asylum treaty with 
Poland had already been settled, when the Federal Export Office 
(BAFA) performed its duty: It raised objections. 
  The supply of night vision devices to Poland's Border Guard 
was a violation of the export ban on industrial goods that can 
be used for either civilian or military purposes ("dual use"). 
  A German manufacturer of optical and electronic sensors 
started producing civilian rather than military goods 
("conversion"). Instead of guidance systems, the optical sensors 
now guide probes used in medical endoscopy. His exports are a 
success. Israel is also a customer. However, German officials 
are placing massive obstacles in the way of delivering spare 
parts to Israel: The sensor technology could be converted to 
military use in the recipient country. 
  Nothing but theory? German foreign economic policy knows 
better since German firms industrial equipment for the Libyan 
chemical weapons plant at Al-Rabitah. "Auschwitz in the 
desert," were the comments that William Safire, the NEW YORK 
TIMES columnist, made. Al-Rabitah and "civilian" German goods 
supplied to Iraq have led to controls on all "dual-use" exports 
to suspicious countries. The United States has deemed the effort 
"exemplary." 
  Nevertheless, Bonn is not happy. Industry is using the 
economic crisis as a means of attacking excessive controls. 
They have resulted in "massive international competitive 
handicaps." That has drawn a positive reaction from the CDU/CSU 
[Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] Bundestag 
group. The main advocate of a relaxation of controls is the 
spokesman on foreign policy, Karl Lamers. 
  What has now given a new lease of life to the debate is the 
tug of war in the European Union (EU) regarding uniform export 
regulations for "dual use" goods. Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel, FDP [Free Democratic Party], has doggedly been demanding 
that the strict German law should be recognized as being a 
national exception under EU law. The CDU/CSU is opposed, and 
the Federal Chancellery is vacillating. Lamer's parliamentary 
colleague, Andreas Schockenhoff says: "What is at stake is the 
ability of German industry to cooperate on joint projects with 
EU and NATO partners." 
  In plain English: This does, of course, apply to what are 
solely defense projects. There are more and more reports from 
the aerospace and marine industries that German partners are no 
longer being approached by West European partners. 
  To provide one example: England sells Tornadoes with German 
electronic technology to Saudi Arabia. The manufacturer is to 
repair a guidance system for the customer: It can be repaired 
within 27 days. However, BAFA must give its approval and that 
takes between two and five months. 
  That becomes known. Recently, however, customers all over 
the world now want "package approvals" from the German 
authorities. That has not been permitted until now. Others say 
that offers from Germany do not make any sense "as long as 
German export policy remains unpredictable." 
  The competition from England, France, and the United States 
is not asleep. Their representatives go knocking on doors with 
the German law under their arm, and they have some good advice 
to offer: "Don't buy German." [preceding words in English].

the 1994 annual economic report submitted by Economic Affairs 
Minister Guenter Rexrodt. A spokesman for Rexrodt said the 
cabinet also approved a draft for the abolition of the Rebates 
Law. 
  According to the annual economic report, the German 
Government is expecting a further increase in the number of 
unemployed by around 450,000 to nearly four million. Economic 
growth should amount to 1-1.5 percent with the rate of inflation 
running at around 3 percent. Rexrodt is to give a news 
conference (at 1300 GMT) to discuss details of the report.

<F P=106> [Report signed "df": "IG Metall: Dramatic Situation in the </F>
German Automobile Industry"] 
  [Text] In the middle of negotiations on wages in the steel 
industry, Klaus Zwickel, first chairman of IG Metall 
[steelworkers' trade union], has described the situation in the 
German automobile industry as "dramatic." In 1992, the EC 
posted a record 14 million registrations of new automobiles and 
light goods vehicles; the corresponding figures for the United 
States and Japan were 10 million and 5 million. West Europe is 
still the largest automobile market in the world. In 1993, 
however, demand decreased by 16 percent and by as much as 20 
percent in Germany. German automakers sales and output have 
declined accordingly. "In the best event, a stabilization of 
the situation is conceivable in 1994, but it seems more likely 
that there will be a slight decline in sales." 
  All the mistakes that were made in company policy in the 
1980's have now appeared and all the omissions of the boom 
period must now be dealt with at "top speed." The necessary 
reorganization of the automobile industry is, however, 
encountering obstacles due to excessive production capacity. 
Excessive hopes regarding a growing market and greater market 
shares led to the construction of more and more plants. It is 
estimated that at the present time, at least 15 million 
automobiles can be built in Europe, but only 11.5 million were 
manufactured in 1993. Thus, plants are only operating at 75 
percent of capacity. Operating at that level of capacity, most 
enterprises can no longer function profitably. 
  Zwickel: "If this problem of overcapacity is not solved, the 
European autmobile industry will enter a merciless and hopeless 
price war," the kind of situation that could recently be 
observed in the Japanese automobile market. European 
manufacturers are already trying to outdo each other with price 
reductions, both directly and through maintaining prices at 
their present level, but offering better extras. If production 
capacity continues to grow, from FIAT in southern Italy to 
Toyota in northern England, programs aimed at reducing costs and 
the temporary closure of plants will not help at all. 
  In this kind of situation, economic policy in combination 
with industry will have to end this hopeless situation. Zwickel 
has called for a round of negotiations involving the government, 
the automobile industry, and IG Metall to at least find a clear 
definition of the problems. In addition, a gradual 
organizational reform of company structures will be necessary, 
one that will entail "employment policy safeguards," an 
accelerated approach to product innovation, stronger links 
between manufacturers and their suppliers in the form of 
partnership, support for research and cooperation in research, 
as well as safeguards at the regional policy level for crisis 
situations.

  [Excerpt] Paris, Jan 26 (AFP) -- French President Francois 
Mitterrand held a special cabinet meeting on Bosnia Wednesday 
[26 January] attended by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, 
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Defence Minister Francois 
Leotard. 
  Balladur disclosed the meeting took place but gave no 
details. It was held after the regular weekly cabinet meeting of 
the full government. 
  Government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said there was "no 
change in French policy on Bosnia" and "there is no need to 
change anything at all." France was "doing its duty" even if the 
results were "far from satisfactory." 
  After the failure of a visit here on Monday by U.S. 
Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher when France sought strong United 
States support for a new diplomatic initiative, Mitterrand said 
France would make detailed new proposals on Bosnia, after the 
failure of the Geneva peace conference. 
  Mitterrand's spokesman said that the president had insisted 
to Christopher that the situation could not be left without hope. 
  The president also repeated France's opposition to lifting 
the international arms embargo against the belligerents, which 
would mean the withdrawal of UN peacekeepers and the end of the 
humanitarian relief effort. 
  Meanwhile the Defence Ministry said Wednesday the UN 
Security 
Council was expected to approve the appointment of French 
General Bertrand de Lapresle to head the UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) in ex-Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by </F>
program presenter Patrick Poivre d'Arvor -- live] 
  [Text] [Leotard] Good evening. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] In Brussels this evening General Morillon 
said that he is now in favor of defensive strikes being launched 
should there be cases of aggression. Does this rule out any 
offensive, or preventative strikes? 
  [Leotard] In this matter of air strikes, you have to know 
what you are saying. Most of the time the people are caught up 
in the military incidents that occur between the sides. An air 
strike is meaningless. 
  In another scenario, around Sarajevo, for example, there 
would be immediate fallout on our troops -- that is what the 
Army itself says -- and not on potential enemies, but on our 
troops. So we have to be very careful. 
  We are in a sort of situation which is more or less the 
opposite of the Iraqi scenario: Valleys, gorges, fog, no front, 
so there is no air power in the proper sense of the word, so you 
have to be very careful when raising the possibility. We raised 
it, and hoped for it, ourselves, but in very special cases, very 
close to the actual incident, and as a response to an attack on 
our forces, or to protect the people. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] Are the Western nations credible when they 
keep repeating that one day they will strike? This happened 
with Bill Clinton last July. Isn't this the story of Peter and 
the Wolf: They'll end up not believing us. Not on the ground 
either. 
  [Leotard] It is not so much us, you know. The real loss of 
credibility in this tragedy is for the United Nations. You will 
have seen that the generals who speak out -- sometimes much too 
much -- who speak out, but never speak out against their 
governments. They speak out against the United Nations, for whom 
the word thing [machin], as used by General de Gaulle, is 
probably less than reality. [sentence as heard] So there is a 
real crisis with the United Nations, and everyone should pay 
attention to it. It isn't a crisis for France, or for Italy, or 
for Turkey -- I am only quoting generals who have recently 
spoken out, who have had problems with the United Nations. It 
is a UN crisis. 
  We have told Mr. Butrus-Ghali that it is struck with a type 
of incapacity today, military incapacity. And yet it is in 
situations, for example in Bosnia, where military types of 
action are likely to prevail. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] You have said that the United Nations is 
consuming too many generals, that it is consuming them in 
excessive numbers in the theater of operations. 
  [Leotard] I told Mr. Butrus-Ghali, himself, so. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] Who will be the next one to succeed General 
Cot? 
  [Leotard] We have proposed to the United Nations, who will 
pass it on to the Security Council, the name of General (de la 
Presle), who is the current head of the Rapid Action Force, in 
other words one of the most important soldiers in the Army, and 
who will succeed General Cot at the proper time, in other words 
at the end of the current mandate of UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces], at around the end of March. 
  This is in no way a disavowal of General Cot, who has done 
his work very well. It is a replacement that has to be made 
given the differences that have appeared between the local 
commander, General Cot, and the UN structures, which are quite 
insufficient to follow a crisis of this kind. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] And you insist that it should be a French 
general to replace General Cot? 
  [Leotard] We insist on it being a French general, simply 
because we have the biggest contingent on the ground, out of the 
30 nations currently present in the Yugoslav theater of 
operations. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] Just now you spoke to the RPR [Rally for 
the Republic] deputies, and some of them said that they favor a 
withdrawal of French forces, and of the UN forces as a whole, 
from Bosnia. What is your reply to them? Will we one day 
abandon these people, whom we are seeing being battered? 
  [Leotard] Of course they have the right to say that; we 
listen to them, and I can tell you that when I visit this or 
that parliamentary group I listen to what the members of 
parliament are saying, and it is always extremely interesting. 
  I think that if we withdrew today it would mean looking the 
other way. Staying doesn't mean a guarantee of success, but 
withdrawing means looking the other way. The pictures you just 
showed of those children who were so tragically murdered in 
Sarajevo -- are we going to forget them? Are we going to turn 
our backs on them? Are we going to leave, so as to let people 
kill each other? I think that there are policies that contain 
risks, but there are also policies that lack honor. And I don't 
think it is for France to put forward a policy without honor. 
  It is a very difficult task at the moment. We are in very 
complicated situations on the ground. Are we then to say: 
Well, it's not our business any more? I know that when I say 
this a lot of people will not listen to me, or will not believe 
me. I think that there is something in French courage, in the 
heritage of the French people, that makes them sensitive to the 
distress of others. And I think of those children, I think of 
those women, I think of the people who are under seige today. 
  In the Europe we are trying to build, we can not accept 
this. 
So French soldiers are doing their job, their mission, their 
duty today, with extraordinary morale. 
  Let us be careful, when we speak, not to discourage these 
young people, who think they are being of some use. Just now I 
heard the adjective: Useless. It is not true. It is not true. 
Thousands of people are currently being protected -- even if it 
is not enough -- by soldiers, and in particular by French 
soldiers. So I think we must not say it is useless. 
  There is a form of UN impotence, and we are in this 
situation. We now have to find political initiatives. You have 
the humanitarian path: We have to continue with it; you have 
the diplomatic path: We have to continue with it; and you have 
the path of war: And that one is a dead end. That is what we 
are telling the parties involved. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] Do you think the Geneva conference can 
start 
again in spite of the very many... 
  [Leotard, interrupting] We must at all costs, tirelessly, 
with a great deal of tenacity, get the people to sit down at a 
table again, to get the two great powers, Russia and the United 
States, to sit down at the table too -- and we said this to Mr. 
Christopher -- so that after this meeting we Europeans, Russians 
and Americans can say to the three sides: Look, that's enough. 
You don't have the right to continue in that direction, which 
is the direction of war. Not just war in this small part of 
Europe, but a war which bit by bit will spread -- we have to be 
aware of this -- towards the south, in other words, Kosovo and 
Macedonia; towards the north, in other words, Croatia. In both 
cases this is a terrible kind of failure for Europe. Everyone 
must be aware of this. 
  We are only doing our duty. Let all the Europeans, and the 
others, try to do theirs too. We have faced up to our 
responsibilities. We will not abandon these responsibilities, 
or at least not in the near future.

  [Text] Paris, Jan. 25, IRNA -- The Iranian Embassy here on 
Tuesday [25 January] categorically denied Iran's involvement in 
the 1971 assassination in Paris of Shapur Bakhtiar, the last 
prime minister in the former regime of Iran. 
  In a statement released here the Iranian Embassy also 
condemned any act of terrorism. The statement was a response to 
allegations recently raised by French papers that Iran had been 
involved in Bakhtiar's assassination. It underlined the need 
for the French judicial system to maintain its independence and 
keep aloof from any hue and cry while investigating the case. 
  The AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE in a news dispatch on Monday 
accused 
Iran of providing logistical assistance in the assassination of 
Bakhtiar. The Iranian Embassy advised that no prejudgement 
should be made on the issue.

<F P=106> [Article by Patrice de Beer: "Chinese Foreign Minister in </F>
Paris: Franco-Chinese Reconciliation"] 
  [Excerpts] In Paris since 22 January, where he had meetings 
with President Mitterrand; his French counterpart, Alain Juppe; 
and Edouard Balladur, China's foreign minister has sealed the 
reconciliation between the two countries. While in the French 
capital, Qian Qichen also had talks with the U.S. secretary of 
state. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Arms Sales to Taiwan </H5>
  The Chinese minister seemed pleased with his visit, stating 
that "the future of Franco-Chinese relations is promising." 
However, he did not commit himself to much, saying that he had 
"told the president that French firms had to take a place in 
China." Which place, one wonders, since France's market share 
in China (1.8 percent) is much smaller than Germany's (4.9 
percent), or even Italy's (2.1 percent). 
  A cautious Mr. Qian steered clear of the issue of French 
weapon sales to Taiwan. He did not say whether he viewed the 12 
January communique as ending permanently this particular trade 
-- which is what Beijing has always wanted -- or, in Mr. Juppe's 
words, as a simple "limitation." Indeed, it is clear that 
France -- and especially weapon manufacturers and the Defense 
Ministry -- would be pleased to sign new contracts bringing in 
fresh money, even though sales must now be limited to 
non-offensive weapons. 
  The question is now to determine how and by whom the 
definition of such defensive weapons will be drawn. What of 
armored vehicles, for example? And will it be necessary, as 
stated in Singapore by Industry and Foreign Trade Minister 
Gerard Longuet, to ask for Beijing's permission before each 
transaction? This position seems hardly congruous with that of 
the Quai d'Orsay [French Ministry of Foreign Affairs]. 
Furthermore, Mr. Longuet announced that French assistance to 
Beijing, which had been suspended in 1993, would be resumed. In 
1992, China had been the first beneficiary of French State 
assistance with Fr1,250 billion -- France being the second 
biggest contributor of state aid to Beijing, after Japan. 
  So this is indeed a new start -- commercial interests having 
now displaced the memory of the Tiananmen massacre, which the 
French Government of the time had denounced with a determination 
unmatched throughout the world. Of the resolutions made at the 
time by the Twelve, only the ban on arms sales -- can it last 
much longer? -- and the suspension of state visits remain in 
force. And Chancellor Kohl has shown how little concern he has 
for the latter resolution, when he invited China's President 
Jiang Zemin to come to Bonn. 
  Will the latest compromises made by France on the altar of 
reconciliation with China be the last ones, or will commercial 
or political reasons incite some people to be even more pliant 
in the future? For there is no doubt that Beijing will try, as 
usual, to take advantage of any disagreements it may notice in 
Paris as well as the vague terms of the joint communique. Even 
though barriers to renewed cooperation have been removed, it 
does not follow that China's nature is going to change. 
  The appointment of Chen Kuiyuan, the secretary of the Tibet 
Autonomous Regional Party Committee, as head of the Chinese 
delegation to the PCF [French Communist Party] congress shows in 
just how little regard China's rulers hold the concerns of 
Western democracies with respect to the human rights issue in 
Tibet. Be it insensitivity or provocation, the utmost caution 
will be required if Paris is to avoid looking like it has let 
itself be lured by PRC's siren song.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Christophe Cambadelis, national </F>
secretary of the Socialist Party, PS, by Joseph Mace-Scaron: 
"Cambadelis Hopes for `the Renaissance of a Great Movement'"; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] Social transformation sessions. The national 
secretary of the Socialist Party believes that we are witnessing 
"the end of Balladurmania." 
  Will the left wing begin to recover from its bitter defeat 
last March? It is expected that 742 prominent individuals, 
ranging from Martine Aubry to Dominique Voynet, will publish an 
appeal for the organization of social transformation sessions in 
today's issue of LE MONDE. 
  The phrase used is a little obscure, but it is not likely to 
conceal the ambitious nature of such an operation. 
  Although Jean-Christophe Cambadelis, one of the principal 
artisans of these sessions, may deny it, this is indeed an 
undertaking that will probably, in the long run, result in a new 
unity on the left. 
  Already, the Socialists, of course, but also the 
Communists--both orthodox and reform, the Ecologists, Radicals, 
and representatives of the associative movements, as well as 
trade-union leaders, have responded positively to this appeal. 
In an initial phase, these sessions will involve the 
organization of six demonstrations scheduled to take place in 
the course of a circuit through France. The first, planned for 5 
February in Paris, will have a question as its theme: "Why 
change society?" 
  But this dynamic move toward unity has just been given a 
major forward thrust by the repeal of the Falloux Law. 
  After all, the first event of these sessions will basically 
take place....in the street. This will occur this coming 16 
January when the leftist organizations hold their demonstration 
"in defense of public education." 
  [Mace-Scaron] Can the left wing regain its unity in the 
field? This coming 16 January, for example, with the 
demonstration against the repeal of the Falloux Law? 
  [Cambadelis] The left wing certainly can do that, but this 
is 
not the issue. All of these forces and everyone who is committed 
to public education, to schooling for all and to equal 
opportunity, will mobilize. All republicans should be present. 
By means of its attacks on public education, the government is 
sacrificing the values of the Republic on the altar of 
short-term electoral calculations. These values are secularism 
and free education. 
  [Mace-Scaron] When you use the old formulas in this way, are 
you not afraid of being criticized as "archaic?" 
  [Cambadelis] The spontaneous inclination of our society to 
designate "socially disqualified individuals" can only be 
counteracted by a deliberate policy of support for the right to 
a second chance, to continued equality of opportunity. Because 
these are the Republic's schools, schools that welcome children 
without regard to their social origins, religion, or philosophy. 
Whatever may be said about it, public education remains the 
leading venue for social advancement, integration, and training 
for citizenship. 
<H5>  `The Rending of Our Society' </H5>
  [Cambadelis continues] With the redirection of the effort 
made toward private education, to the detriment of public 
education, it is to the right of center that the archaic 
attitudes are returning in force, accompanied by a more acute 
risk of tearing our society apart. 
  We are witnessing the institutionalization of two 
educational 
networks financed by public funds, that is to say everyone's 
money. One can easily see how the wealthier people and those 
less fortunate are being separated. 
  [Mace-Scaron] Aren't you impressed by Mr. Balladur's 
"know-how?" 
  [Cambadelis] Not at all. And I am obviously not the only 
one. 
Jacques Chirac even believes that the government is not going 
far enough where the employment problem is concerned. He is not 
wrong in his criticism, even though the policies he proposes for 
correcting the situation are not those we advocate. But can one 
support a government that is not moving in the right direction 
on the unemployment issue? Paradoxically, following the vote of 
confidence in Parliament, the prime minister has spoken much 
more frequently in personal terms and has used more 
superlatives. The machinery is seizing up, confidence is 
dwindling, and appetites are growing keener. This is a sign of 
the end of Balladurmania. The government is showing a lack of 
imagination in dealing with unemployment, a lack of 
determination with regard to the nationalist movements in 
Europe, and a lack of tolerance where the problems of society 
are concerned. 
  [Mace-Scaron] Aren't these social transformation sessions a 
"remake" of the union of the left, with Dominique Voynet playing 
Robert Fabre's role? 
  [Cambadelis] I doubt that Michel Rocard thinks he is 
Francois 
Mitterrand. It is not a question of drafting a joint program, 
but of encouraging a debate on ideas in order to respond to the 
expectations of the French people. Why, after having experienced 
the disaster of unemployment, the collapse of Communism, the 
rising tide of inequalities, the consolidation of nationalist 
sentiments, the urgency of ecological needs, the biological 
revolution, the triumph of humanitarianism, the party crisis, 
etc., would anyone want us to return in 1994 to the strategy 
defined in Epinay in 1971? We are living in a new era that 
demands a situational review. Reading patterns have blurred and 
political references and identification have been overturned or 
thrown out of phase. 
  Following the General Assembly of the PS, we reaffirmed our 
principles. New ideas have emerged, and internal life has 
calmed. Now it is necessary to face up to all of this without 
the desire to dominate. There can be no great movement in 
society without the major debate on contradictory concepts that 
must precede it. That is the price of the rebirth of a great 
movement in search of change for our society. 
  [Mace-Scaron] Isn't it a little bit hypocritical to make it 
appear that this operation is not being directed by the PS? 
  [Cambadelis] The PS has proposed, and the protagonists in 
social transformation have disposed. Simply because Michel 
Rocard contemplated the future, or because Lionel Jospin 
sponsored this initiative--neither of these things makes the 
sessions the property of the PS. The initial proposal has been 
substantially enriched. Leaders in the ecological field have 
altered its center of gravity by setting a deadline for social 
change. Organizational leaders have refocused the sessions on 
the daily concerns of the men and women of France. The friends 
of Messrs. Herzog, Fiterman, and Rigout have tried to promote 
debate on the remodeling issue. 
  The sponsors of these sessions, of whom a list is being 
published today, are simply leaders who believe that the 
transformation of society is necessary, and from this point of 
view, they oppose the conservatism that is currently in power. 
What is being sought is a discussion of the basics. The problems 
of alliance and the electoral issues will not be taken up. 
  [Mace-Scaron] In two weeks, the PCF [French Communist Party] 
will elect a new secretary general. Do you hope that he will be 
more of an advocate of unity than Georges Marchais? 
  [Cambadelis] I would remind you that it was Georges 
Marchais, 
after all, who signed the joint program. I think that something 
is happening in the Communist Party. In three weeks, our 
arrangements will be made. As for the future of the Communists, 
it belongs to them, and it is for them to decide. The 
announcement that a leader at the top level will attend each of 
the sessions made by Georges Marchais at the most recent meeting 
of the PCF Central Committee shows that a transition from the 
bunker strategy to that of debate may perhaps be under way. 
  [Mace-Scaron] Shouldn't the PS pursue an evaluation of the 
achievements and failures of the left wing, analyzing the 
reasons for the distortion of its economic policy or the 
monarchic aspect the presidential institution has taken on? 
  [Cambadelis] As former minister Anicet Le Pors noted 
recently, it is necessary to undertake a critical analysis of 
what one has done and what one has been in order to make a new 
start. The PS is therefore continuing its work of review, while 
at the same time opening up new prospects. The younger 
generation insists on this. I would refer, as evidence of this, 
to the imminent publication of the book by Martine Aubry as well 
as that by Pierre Moscovici.

<F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F>
Guido Passalacqua in Milan on 24 January: "`I May Not Sign the 
Pact'"] 
  [Text] Milan -- Seated behind the walnut desk in his new 
office, which has been painted dazzlingly white, with the League 
flag behind him, Umberto Bossi fidgeted with the fax reporting 
the agreement with Segni. It was 1900 hours and it was clear, 
as he admitted himself, that he still lacked all the information 
("I am waiting to hear from [League's lower house floor leader] 
Maroni," he said.) But already he was banging his fist on the 
desk: "I will not sign this document, and if I do not sign it 
the League will not sign it, unless it adds that the next 
legislature will be a constituent one." Then late in the 
evening Maroni telephoned to clarify matters and to inform him 
that the demand had been accepted and that a sentence had been 
included in the document to state that the next will be a 
"constituent legislature." 
  But apart from this clarification, it was apparent that 
Bossi 
is thinking about the repercussions within the movement, the 
many people who disagree with the negotiations and are unwilling 
to accept too much mediation, the hard-line League members who 
refuse to yield constituencies to unknown fellow travelers. 
First and foremost among these is Senator Miglio, who 
immediately dismissed the document: "The framework is national 
unity, which nobody is challenging; it seemed to me merely an 
electoral accord. It will be difficult to keep together 
everything and its opposite." Bossi was less skeptical.... 
  [Passalacqua] What is your assessment of the document? 
  [Bossi] Mine is a positive assessment, but.... 
  [Passalacqua] But what? 
  [Bossi] It confirms that there could be a shift toward 
something pseudo-federalist, that all the League's years of 
struggle in this field are having some impact. The document 
represents an understanding, a declaration that [Pact for Italy 
leader] Segni accepts a minor, superficial form of federalism. 
  [Passalacqua] Is that not enough for you? 
  [Bossi] It is not to be assumed that this document will 
guarantee the transition to the Second Republic. Only an 
overwhelming victory by the League in the North will guarantee 
the Second Republic. Only then will the situation inevitably 
change in a federalist direction. The League is not 
relinquishing political federalism. 
  [Passalacqua] But what about its policy of alliances? 
  [Bossi] We have the problem of whether to make a gesture of 
goodwill. For one thing, by joining a coalition the League is 
becoming a national political force. If we were to go it alone 
we would win everything in four or five regions North of the Po. 
But then we might be marginalized. If we become a national 
force, then the reform of the state will become a task for the 
entire country, including southern Italy. But this is a risky 
option, because according to my information, the major centers 
of power do not want a Second Republic. 
  [Passalacqua] What do you like about the document? 
  [Bossi] A number of things have been more or less copied 
from 
our programs. They have appropriated that which was ours, but 
they must remember that it was the League that made history. 
Looking at this document, you get the impression of an attempt 
to keep alive the principle of the citizens' economic equality 
-- a principle that constitutes a trap, because it leads to a 
rigid interventionist state. By focusing on federalism, 
however, the League is thinking about freedom. So the document 
represents a half-way stance. It can be interpreted in two 
ways. It depends on how it is interpreted at the right time. 
[Bossi ends] 
  Bossi became more animated and cited his real precondition, 
the assertion that the next legislature will be a constituent 
one: "Otherwise I will not sign this document, and if do not 
sign it, neither will the League." 
  [Passalacqua] But do you agree with putting forward Segni 
for 
the premiership? 
  [Bossi] For the moment I do not agree with anything; first 
it 
must be signed, then.... The important thing is not the prime 
minister, but which political forces support him. 
  [Passalacqua] Some people are saying that this document 
grants the initiative to Segni and [Italian People's Party (PPI) 
Secretary] Martinazzoli. 
  [Bossi] The League has a large membership, who want a 
battle, 
who want a struggle, and who are ready for a fight. We must see 
whether this is a maneuver on Martinazzoli's part. There is a 
great difference between a warrior such as myself and a chicken 
thief such as Martinazzoli. We are prepared to continue the 
fight indefinitely. 
  [Passalacqua] And what is Maroni doing negotiating in Rome, 
while you are here in Milan talking about battles? 
  [Bossi] Mediators are there to mediate. But an adult 
decision must be made about what is to be done. There are 
several tendencies within the League, and I, being its founder, 
have worked to keep them together. In the North, the League is 
extremely strong. Never mind your opinion polls: We have an 
average of 45 percent on our own. Nobody can defeat us here. 
Even if [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto 
and [Fininvest President] Berlusconi get together, we can beat 
them with one hand tied. The accord must be reached with a 
realization that there can be no victory without us. And that 
change can only come about if the League scores an overwhelming 
victory in the North. 
  [Passalacqua] Is this an appeal to the League supporters? 
  [Bossi] It is not appeal; it is an analysis. I have never 
suffered any doubts or fears.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rooting for Italy leader Silvio Berlusconi </F>
by Vittorio Testa on 24 January in Milan: "A Knight Almost on 
Horseback...."] 
  [Excerpts] Milan -- [passage omitted] [Testa] So, Mr. 
Berlusconi, almost everyone is only waiting for you, for your 
decision. The meeting between [Pact for Italy leader] Segni and 
[League's lower house floor leader] Maroni has taken place, and 
they have come to an understanding. The miracle that you hoped 
for has happened. What next? 
  [Berlusconi] I heard about it, and I have just issued a 
statement explaining where I stand. That is, I appreciate the 
step forward taken by Segni and Maroni toward an accord among 
the liberals and moderates opposed to the left-wing forces' 
cartel, on a program that we identify with and that expresses 
our aspirations and beliefs concerning what the country needs. 
We are starting to perceive the formation of a potentially 
victorious alliance. I am also very pleased that others too 
have come to the realization that the agreement cannot be merely 
technical and electoral. 
  [Testa] According to your wishes, it is only [Italian 
People's Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli that is missing 
now.... 
  [Berlusconi] Yes, now I hope that Martinazzoli too will 
promptly add his unreserved support. We shall see. Meanwhile, 
however, we will pursue our own path, proceeding with the 
operational phase, because hitherto what has happened exists 
only on paper. However, one thing must be quite clear: The 
agreement between the liberals and democrats must be based on 
the rejection of any unjust discrimination. 
  [Testa] Yes, but what are the confines of the moderate 
alignment? 
  [Berlusconi] Those of the liberal-democratic area, excluding 
extreme positions. 
  [Testa] So is it all over with [Italian Social Movement 
(MSI) 
Secretary] Fini? 
  [Berlusconi] We are watching carefully all that is happening 
in the right-wing area and within the National Alliance. We 
followed the congress proceedings and are waiting to see the 
documents that were approved; I will read them carefully. 
  [Testa] Let us return to Segni and Martinazzoli. 
  [Berlusconi] A step forward was taken today, but it is not 
complete. 
  [Testa] Yes, but what if Martinazzoli joins the accord? 
  [Berlusconi] Let us wait for the PPI's decisions, then we 
shall see. But, frankly, I cannot conceal the fact that, 
especially in recent hours, I have been subject to pressure from 
almost all sides -- private individuals, heads of organizations, 
businessmen, people from the financial world, members of Rooting 
for Italy, candidates, clubs, ordinary people. I am really 
being bombarded with demands. And I have always said that I am 
not accustomed to shirking my responsibilities. Everyone is 
telling me that in order for there to be a genuine 
liberal-democratic pole, it must be truly new. People very much 
need new faces, new experiences, and a real change from the old 
politics. And everyone is telling me that what there is now was 
basically there before. 
  [Testa] So even if Martinazzoli were to say "yes," would you 
stand as a candidate nevertheless? 
  [Berlusconi] I would be very glad not to. But, I repeat: I 
cannot dismiss this pressure, this demand being made of me by 
people, a great many people. Moreover, by now Rooting for Italy 
is a fully-formed force, a significant force. This was 
confirmed by the latest opinion poll. 
  [Testa] What does the latest opinion poll say? The previous 
one granted Rooting for Italy 16.7 percent. What about this one? 
  [Berlusconi] The figures have rocketed now. Perhaps there 
was an announcement effect, insofar as today's newspapers 
suggested that I have already decided to enter the arena. There 
has been a rise in the figure, a considerable rise. 
  [Testa] What percentage have you reached now? 
  [Berlusconi] The figures are not definitely proven yet, but 
I 
can say that one in four interviewees said that they would vote 
for us; in other words, we have 25 percent. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Left Accuses `Transformist Segni'"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- Just one word: transformist. This is how 
the left is describing [Pact for Italy leader] Segni. They 
stress that, just a few months ago, he was affirming his 
agreement with the Democratic Alliance [AD], first and foremost 
by saying "no" to the League. According to [Democratic Party of 
the Left (PDS) lower house floor leader] Massimo D'Alema, 
however, the agreement signed between the Pact and the League 
does not pose a problem for the progressive pole but for 
[Italian People's Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli: "The 
People's Party is the most to blame in its desire to guarantee 
the political autonomy of a Catholic-backed force." 
  According to the PDS floor leader, the agreement causes 
confusion since it groups together "forces that came into the 
battle as opponents. Just a few months ago, Segni said he was 
an alternative to the League." Has [League Secretary] Bossi 
abandoned the idea of splitting Italy? "From Bossi's mouth we 
have heard every possible and imaginable statement, and the 
contrary." Nevertheless, continued D'Alema, out of the 
confusion people could, paradoxically, find clarity "when a 
power group is formed with the sole aim of repelling the 
progressive pole." Moreover, the agreement is "contradictory" 
with respect to the pope's letter on Catholic unity: "In the 
message there is a reference to the values of solidarity and 
national unity to which the political agreement of the Catholics 
can be attached which contradicts the agreement with the 
League." On this point, the PDS floor leader concluded that it 
was not important to know whether [Fininvest President] 
Berlusconi will directly enter the race because "Berlusconi has 
already entered the race, with his people and his TV channels." 
  Claudio Petruccioli, of the PDS secretariat, was even more 
explicit in his comments: "To reach this agreement, both the 
League and Segni have had to `Berlusconize' themselves. 
Inevitably, the same would happen to anyone who was tempted to 
join the agreement." 
  The Rete secretariat had fiery words for Segni who had 
finally revealed his hand "after deceiving the Italian people." 
This "self-styled" program agreed between the Pact and the 
League "is seeking to hide an electoral pact for the 
geographical separation of candidates -- the north for Bossi and 
the rest for Segni. We do not know whom to award the prize for 
the best transformist." According to The Rete: "Instead of CAF 
[previously pact uniting Craxi, Andreotti, and Forlani], for the 
time being we have the SeBo, and we are waiting agonizingly for 
the SeBoBo (Segni, Berlusconi, Bossi)." 
  What about Mario Segni's former allies? Professor Pietro 
Scopola who sat beside Segni on the "referendum committee" and 
who has now chosen the AD, does not appear surprised: "Yes, I 
was expecting it. Besides, Segni had no choice: Either make an 
alliance with the League or go to the electorate on his own, 
which would be equivalent to committing political suicide. Of 
course, it is a move that runs completely counter to what he 
said on 10 October 1992, when he stated in no uncertain terms 
that he was an alternative to Bossi. The change, however, makes 
things clear -- this is the birth of a less divided right." 
  For [Italian Socialist Party (PSI) Secretary] Del Turco, 
too, 
"it was predictable: The right is in earnest, the moderates are 
in earnest, the conservatives are in earnest. The side that 
risks taking this situation too lightly is the left, where there 
is the risk that sectarianism, divisions, and differences will 
prevail." The Socialist secretary concluded: "A formation 
headed by the Segni-Bossi pairing is worrying. A formation 
headed by [Rete leader] Orlando's fundamentalism is not of 
interest."

<F P=106> [Article by Cristina Mariotti: "It Is Cinisello, But It </F>
Seems Like Alcamo"] 
  [Text] Mafia: Report on the mobs up north. They are 
into drugs and arms, but also into hotels, spas, tourism, 
finance, etc. The Anti-Mafia Commission mapped out Cosa Nostra's 
activities outside of Sicily and has discovered that.... 
  Maybe it does not yet hold true for London, where according 
to a fictional investigation published in the SUNDAY TIMES the 
remnants of the Mafia's top leadership now reside, but it 
certainly does hold true in Cinisello Balsamo. For Cosa Nostra 
this town in the hinterland of Milan could just as well be 
located in the outskirts of Palermo, a piece of Mafia territory 
that thus far has only been identified with Sicily. Very soon, 
the old rule that a boss loses his control outside of Sicily 
could no longer apply. 
  This was one of the more interesting discoveries made by the 
Anti-Mafia Commission, which all last year traveled the length 
and breadth of Italy trying to understand to what extent Mafia 
corruption had infected the country. Their conclusion, which is 
contained in the report just completed by PDS [Democratic Party 
of the Left] Senator Carlo Smuraglia, is the following: There is 
no region that is exempt from the contagion. New targets for 
Mafia investments include: the very tranquil Val d'Aosta, where 
the Nirta clan from Calabria is in control of the region's 
criminal activities; the impenetrable Sardinia, where the 
Mafia--according to a credible informer like Gaspare 
Mutolo--engages in real estate speculation along the eastern 
coast and is trying to get its hands on the tourist industry 
almost everywhere; and even the less important Basilicata 
region, which became attractive to the criminal groups after the 
construction of the FIAT plant in Melfi and the agricultural 
development of Metaponto because of the economic setup that made 
it possible to manipulate public works subcontracts and those in 
charge. Not even the Molise region is immune. It is used as a 
transit zone for the drug traffic between Puglia and Calabria. 
  The Mafia's traditional economic activities are still drugs, 
arms, and public works contracts. These are followed by 
extorsion, usury, and investments in businesses (the Mafia buys 
hotels in Versilia; casinos in Liguria; and spas in Tuscany). It 
is flexible in adapting to local ircumstances, and disguises 
itself so well that it manages to get its own representatives 
elected to local administrations. Will we soon be seeing 
municipal councils dissolved in Lombardy because they were 
infiltrated by the Mafia, like the councils were in Calabria, 
Campania, and Sicily? Infiltration is so widespread that 
territorial conflicts arise between the various organizations 
and are referred to the Mafia courts in the areas of 
origin--Palermo, Reggio Calabria, or Naples. But arbitrators are 
also sent out in the field to make peace. 
  Senator Smuraglia's report offers the Milan Car Park as a 
dramatic example of the new Mafia strategy. It was investigated 
by the Florence District Attorney's Office without anyone 
questioning its jurisdiction in the matter. Individuals such as 
Giacomo Riina, uncle of the boss of bosses in Cosa Nostra, and 
Nitto Santapaola, who is connected with the Corleone family, 
were involved with the car park, which in fact was not only an 
important part of the Mafia activities of Cosa Nostra in 
Lombardy, Tuscany, and Emilia Romagna but of the 'ndrangheta as 
well. 
  The members of the Anti-Mafia Commission say that one of the 
most obvious ways that corruption is spread is through the 
institution of legal exile, which removes dangerous Mafia 
members from their region of origin. Although there was a recent 
decision to abolish these measures, there are still 1,079 of 
these individuals scattered throughout Lombardy, Tuscany, 
Piedmont, Basilicata, and Abruzzo. And the so-called Brenta 
Mafia in Venetia suffices to illustrate the potential for 
contagion. Here in Venetia, between Padua and Venice, total 
control of the territory has been organized on the basis of an 
ironclad alliance between the first relocated Mafiosi--who built 
a local hierarchy divided into gangs--and the local criminals. 
  According to the Commission, the signs of corruption are 
unmistakable and common to all nine regions studied: Abruzzo, 
Basilicata, Emilia Romagna, Liguria, Lombardy, Piedmont, Val 
d'Aosta, Sardinia, and Tuscany (Latium was excluded only because 
it is the object of a separate investigation by DC [Christian 
Democratic Party] Senator Paolo Cabras). Arms and drug 
trafficking are on the rise all over, as are the number of 
financial companies and, above all, the sale of 
businesses--hotels, shops, and companies are changing owners at 
an astonishing rate--which often involves secret ownership. Then 
there are other regions where the Commission's work was based on 
written information and documents, like in Friuli 
Venezia-Giulia, Umbria, the Marches, and Molise. Here as well, 
we find shocking surprises, like discovering that Friuli has 
become the center for the illegal traffic of arms, drugs, and 
even nuclear material. It has been mostly the Camorra that has 
corrupted Molise and the Marches, especially between Pesaro and 
Urbino, where the Mafiosi buy up companies as fast as they can. 
In Perugia, which is in Umbria, it buys real estate instead. 
  Is there a regional pattern to the Mafia's activities? Only 
partially, because there are larger geographical combinations. 
For example, in the north there is heavier arms traffic, as 
shown by a list of the latest kidnapings in Lombardy. In Val 
d'Ossola in Piedmont, laboratories have been equipped to adapt 
arms coming from Switzerland to the requirements of the Mafiosi, 
who prefer automatic weapons. Venetia, on the other hand, 
directs the traffic from the East. The Colombians have a special 
preference for Liguria for landing their shipments of cocaine 
(265 kilograms were confiscated last April). Milan remains the 
capital of money laundering. Sardinia, the coast of Abruzzi, and 
especially Tuscany are chosen for their tourist trade. Mafiosi 
have bought hotels like the Kursaal in Montecatini, luxury shops 
in Florence, and beach establishments in Versilia where a string 
of fires was set by arsonists. To the commissioners, the 
president of a business association denied the criminal nature 
of the fires out of fear that the area's good name would be 
damaged. 
  They are afraid of the same thing in Abruzzo, which holds 
the 
record for limited financial companies whose directors minimized 
any causes for concern to the commissioners. Senator Smuraglia 
notes in his report that the same thing has happened in the past 
in Puglia, and we know how that turned out--Puglia ended up 
ranking fourth in Mafia corruption. Public opinion in Tuscany is 
perceptive, but that does not make Prosecutor Pier Luigi Vigna's 
testimony any less agonizing: 800 investigated for Mafia 
connections and the Mafia's tentacles are everywhere. In Lucca, 
there is the Musumeci mob from Calabria; in Pistoia, a group 
connected to the Catania mob from Pulvirenti; and the Camorra 
rules in Valdarno or Figline. Also disturbing are the ties 
between the Mafia and the Masonic Lodge, which is very strong in 
the region. 
  Symptomatic of the general tendency to underestimate the 
danger of the Mafia was the failure of the law that made it 
mandatory for banks to report suspicious transactions. As of 
August 1993, there had only been 230 such reports, and only nine 
of them came from the financial quarter of Milan.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] A spate of articles in the Portuguese 
press recently focused on the difficult cohabitation between 
Socialist President Mario Soares and Social Democratic Prime 
Minister Cavaco Silva. 
  According to Fernando Madrinha's article in the 31 December 
Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO, 1993 failed to offer President Soares 
the conditions he needed for a "settlement of accounts" with the 
prime minister. The economic crisis did not cause the political 
and social upheaval Soares was hoping for, and the Socialist 
Party's (PS) gains in the municipal elections were not 
sufficient to jeopardize the government's majority, Madrinha 
notes. Similarly, internal Social Democratic Party (PSD) 
differences were not of a scale to threaten party disunity. 
"`Cavaco-ism' gave a little, but it did not collapse," he 
comments. In his opinion, while Soares begins 1994 with a 
diminished ability to influence events, he is "perhaps more 
determined than ever" to harass the government. Additionally, in 
the course of 1993 the prime minister and the PSD learned to 
"answer in kind" and no longer hesitate to criticize a 
presidential decision when it affects their interests, Madrinha 
contends. The first quarter of 1994 will be the most critical 
for the government, he continues. Most labor agreements are 
negotiated at that time. Moreover, the commemoration of the 25 
April revolution will be an opportunity for Soares to draw a 
balance sheet of the situation, with negative factors to be 
ascribed to "Cavaco-ism." Another area of disagreement is 
foreign policy. Soares feels that Cavaco Silva governments have 
lacked "daring" and failed to take a broad view of events. As 
examples, Madrinha cites the differences between the president 
and the prime minister on Angola, Macao, and China. In 
concluding, Madrinha asserts that even if Soares does not 
"dislodge" Cavaco Silva until 1995, he will certainly use his 
considerable influence to make the prime minster's life 
difficult before the end of his presidential term. 
  In Mario Mesquita's opinion, expressed in the 7 January 
Lisbon daily DIARIO DE NOTICIAS, Soares still hopes to bring 
down the "imposing edifice of Cavaco-ism" before the end of his 
presidential term. Betting on time as his principal ally, the 
president devoted his first term to widening his base of 
support. He succeeded so well that, lacking a credible 
alternative, the PSD chose to support him rather than field its 
own candidate. However, at the beginning of his second term, 
Cavaco Silva increased his absolute majority thanks to the 
stability he brought to the country and the flow of EC funds, 
Mesquita continues. With Soares "isolated in the midst of 
Cavaco-ism," the "institutional guerrilla" between the two men 
began in earnest in 1993, against a background of national and 
international economic crises, increased unemployment, 
bankruptcies and student unrest. All signs indicate the struggle 
will continue in 1994, Mesquita contends. Even if the countdown 
for Soares' term has started, the president has not given up on 
his goal, however difficult it might be, he concludes. 
  The institutional conflict in Portuguese political life is 
underlined by the results of a poll conducted by 
EXPRESSO/Euroexpansao between 21 and 27 December among a 
nationally representative sample of 481 individuals. Poll 
results appeared in the 31 December EXPRESSO. Respondents were 
queried on the status of the Soares-Cavaco Silva conflict in 
1994. Some 55 percent said it will increase, 31 percent thought 
it will remain at its present level and 7 percent that it will 
diminish.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Called by Carlos Magno the "national 
figure of the year" in the 24 December Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO, 
newly reelected Porto Mayor Fernando Gomes, a Socialist Party 
(PS) luminary, is now generally seen as the North's "new star." 
According to Magno, Porto, which needed a leader in 1989 when 
Gomes was first elected, identified with the "technocratic 
discourse" of this economist and Eurodeputy possessing a "very 
short political resume." Following his election, Gomes was 
increasingly recognized as a "serious player." It was remembered 
that the late legendary PSD leader Sa Carneiro had asked him to 
join his Social Democratic Party (PSD) on the strength of his 
conviction that "this man will go far." In fact, Lisbon 
politicians no longer laugh when Gomes is mentioned as a 
possible Socialist Party (PS)leader or even presidential 
candidate, Magno comments. The Porto mayor is his own man, he 
continues, quoting him as saying that "I did not leave the 
European Parliament when the Portuguese Government wished to 
push me out, and I do not go where others want to take me." 
According to Magno, Gomes is "calmly" preparing his way south to 
the capital, but remains fully aware that his "vital space" is 
still Porto, at a distance from the seat of government that 
enhances his authority. PS leader Antonio Guterres, who called 
him a "statesman" during the municipal election campaign, had 
nicknamed him "Mr. North" when Gomes helped him wrest the PS 
leadership from former secretary general Jorge Sampaio. In fact, 
despite rumors that Gomes and Guterres will fight for the party 
leadership, nothing points to a duel between the two men, Magno 
asserts, noting that while they may fear each other, their 
relationship also involves sincere mutual appreciation. Gomes' 
real test is still to come, Magno concludes: the sights of a 
winner of a string of regional victories in Porto are now 
naturally set on more important political battles at the end of 
the decade.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Socialist Party (PS) leader Antonio 
Guterres and Communist Party (PCP) official Luis Sa provided 
their views on an alliance between their respective parties. 
  In an interview with Guterres by Jeronimo Pimentel and Raul 
Vaz published in the 3 January Lisbon daily PUBLICO, the 
interviewers pointed out that since the PS failed to "crush" the 
communist electorate during the recent municipal elections, a 
leftist majority cannot be achieved without the support of the 
PCP. Denying that the PS intended to "crush" the communists, 
Guterres replied that his party's goal was to defeat the 
governing Social Democratic Party (PSD). In addition, he argued 
that since the PS won 39 percent of the vote, close to a 
majority, it is "perfectly normal" that the "useful" vote 
penalize the PCP in favor of the PS. Asked how the PS will 
attract the traditional PCP electorate's "useful" vote, Guterres 
answered this can be done by providing a credible alternative to 
the PSD government, not through an alliance with the PCP. The 
PS, he said, will run alone in the next legislative elections. 
Guterres also refused to speculate whether he would ask the left 
for an "understanding" if the PS failed to achieve an absolute 
majority. When the interviewers stressed that rejecting an 
alliance with a PCP that openly desires an alliance is telling 
the communists their vote is not "useful," Guterres replied he 
would explain to the communist electorate that "the best way to 
defeat the PSD is to vote for the PS." 
  The interviewers also noted that Guterres seems to be 
addressing one of the PS's "great anxieties," the direction in 
which the party will grow. Asked whether it will be toward the 
center, Guterres replied that the PS's main objective is "to 
grow with the voters who chose the PSD two years ago because 
they believed this party would solve the country's problems, but 
now are disillusioned." Turning to the next presidential 
elections, the interviewers noted that the municipal elections 
produced two winners, Lisbon Mayor Jorge Sampaio and Porto Mayor 
Fernando Gomes, both "almost natural" candidates for the 
presidency. Asked which of the two men Guterres would choose, 
the PS leader said that both are "possible and strong" PS 
candidates who can defeat any rightist candidate, including 
Cavaco Silva. According to Guterres, the prime minister will 
gradually understand he has no strategy to solve Portugal's 
problems and choose the presidency as an "increasingly appealing 
solution." 
  PCP official Luis Sa was interviewed by Leonidio Paulo 
Ferreira and Paula Sa in the 7 January Lisbon daily DIARIO DE 
NOTICIAS. Sa was asked whether he thought the statement Guterres 
made in his recent interview -- that "the PCP is not a credible 
partner for a government alliance"-- was "offensive." Sa replied 
that only the Portuguese people can determine if the PCP is a 
credible partner. The interviewers also asked Sa whether the 
PS's "obstinacy" in rejecting an alliance with the PCP stems 
from its fear of losing centrist voters. Sa pointed out that 
this was the PS's "pretext" for rebuffing the PCP for a long 
time; however, when an alliance was concluded for the Lisbon 
mayoralty race, the cooperation resulted in gains for the 
centrist vote. When Sa advocated a postlegislative election 
PCP/PS alliance to add credibility to a project and gain votes, 
the interviewers asked whether the PCP is being "masochistic" in 
always calling for unity on the left and projecting a "weak 
image." Sa replied that an alternative to a rightist policy is 
more important than the issue of alliances. 
  As reported by Leonidio Paulo Ferreira in the 5 January 
DIARIO DE NOTICIAS, PCP luminary Carlos Brito expressed his 
belief that the Socialists' "blustering" on the possibility of 
their winning an absolute majority by eschewing alliances is 
both indicative of the PS's "arrogant hegemonic ambition" and an 
"incitement to civil war within the Left."

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] In an article in the 31 December Lisbon 
independent noted political commentator Antonio Pinto Leite 
focuses on the five personalities who, in his opinion, are 
likely to exert a significant influence on Portuguese politics 
in 1994. 
  -- While still beset by his conflict with President Mario 
Soares, Prime Minister Cavaco Silva succeeded in limiting the 
victory of the Socialist Party (PS) in the municipal elections; 
however, he is concerned about a possible future alliance 
between the PS and the Communist Party (PCP), Pinto Leite 
believes. The prime minister is also tight-lipped about a 
possible presidential run. Although a Social Democratic Party 
(PSD) congress is planned for 1994, it may be postponed for the 
first quarter of 1995, adding to the uncertainty. If it takes 
place on schedule, the PSD will know whether its leadership will 
change, and the country will find out whether the era of 
"absolute majority" may have ended. 
  -- President Mario Soares will continue to be influential in 
1994, Pinto Leite contends, "preoccupied with how best to 
complicate the government's life and how to convince PS leader 
Antonio Guterres to conclude an alliance with the communists." 
In addition, he will "subtly feed the social conflict" to deny 
Cavaco Silva the success of a "social contract" that would be 
beneficial to the prime minister in the 1995 elections. An 
unknown at this time is whether an "enervated" and impatient 
Soares will provoke "unexpected situations," Pinto Leite 
concludes. 
  -- Despite his gains in the municipal elections, PS leader 
Antonio Guterres did not achieve his dream of becoming the "key 
to the system." It would have allowed him to "sensibly" ask the 
president not to dissolve the Parliament and let the PSD become 
increasingly attrited. Guterres seems determined to eschew an 
alliance with the PCP for the 1995 legislative elections and 
expects that the Center Social Democratic Party (CDS) will steal 
enough votes from the PSD on the right to put an end to the 
latter's absolute majority. 
  -- In Pinto Leite's opinion, new Minister of Finance Eduardo 
Catroga will play a key role in 1994, as his realism and 
cautiousness, coupled with his use of "simple and direct" 
concepts, may lead to the hoped-for economic recovery. 
  -- CDS leader Manuel Monteiro, who will probably run in the 
Euroelections to test his power, has so radicalized his 
discourse that he is now accused of extreme rightist views, 
Pinto Leite affirms. While this is untrue, it indicates that 
Monteiro has abandoned the moderation of his first months in 
office. He may perhaps be the recipient of more hopes from the 
left than from the right, Pinto Leite continues, because the PS 
will be unable to end the PSD's absolute preponderance without 
his help. If 1994 is favorable to Monteiro, Cavaco Silva ought 
to worry, he concludes.

<F P=106> [Article by Adelino Cunha: "Less Demogoguery Without </F>
Federalism"] 
  [Text] In the campaign for the European elections, social 
democratic candidates wish to teach the Portuguese people what 
the European Union really is, demystify the role of the European 
Parliament and strengthen the idea that Europe is not just a 
faucet that drips money. As our newspaper has ascertained from 
Social Democratic Party (PSD) "European" strategists, federalism 
is an issue that will be clarified within the context of 
European construction to explain to the electorate that "what 
exists is a mixture of federalism, confederalism and 
intergovernmentability." Thus PSD deputies will tell the 
Portuguese people that if elected, they will fight for "this 
dosage never to be exceeded so that small countries will not be 
jeopardized. We cannot let Europe slide into a model with 
excessively federal characteristics." 
<H5>  Thinking of Money </H5>
  "Even while defending socioeconomic cohesion and the grant 
of 
structural funds to poor countries, the PSD must tell the 
electorate very clearly that Europe is not only money," party 
sources told our newspaper. "European" social democratic 
deputies believe that it is bad strategy to "`beckon' the voters 
over with money." In other words, "as the funds are already 
guaranteed, the party must (re)introduce issues such as 
subsidiarity and the role of the European Parliament." 
  On this last issue, the governing party wishes to prevent 
the 
opposition from making unfulfillable promises, "since 
Eurodeputies can only emit opinions, which are just that," 
according to a PSD official. 
  Meanwhile, there is little probability that even with the 
talk about subsidiarity, the fields of competence of the 
European Parliament, the flow of money into Portugal and the 
federalism that the PSD rejects, social democratic candidates 
will succeed in significantly propagating the party's message. 
That is why, "within the context of our enlightenment task, we 
must say clearly that we are the best, providing concrete 
examples of what we have done," a party member located in 
Strasbourg told our newspaper. This is how the PSD hopes to 
"see" stars in the sky.

  [Editorial Report] Recent poll results indicate a drop in 
public confidence in the economy. The 31 December independent 
Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO published the results of an 
EXPRESS-Euroexpansao poll conducted between 21 and 27 December 
1993 among a nationally representative sample of 481 
individuals. Results showed that respondents are pessimistic 
about the country's economic future. When asked whether their 
standard of living will improve, remain the same, or worsen in 
1994, 33 percent of the respondents thought it would 
deteriorate, 38 percent that it would remain the same and only 
21 percent felt it would improve. Similarly, 79 percent thought 
unemployment would worsen in 1994, compared to 14 percent who 
believed it would not increase. Concerning the government's 
assertion that inflation will hover around 5 percent, 70 percent 
said it would be higher, 15 percent agreed with the government, 
and 6 percent said it would be below 5 percent. Some 82 percent 
thought that there would be a crisis in both the industrial and 
agricultural sectors, 3 percent thought it would occur only in 
the agricultural sector, with 1 percent picking only the 
industrial field; 5 percent said that neither sector would be 
affected. Finally, when asked whether the economy will increase 
at a higher or lower rate than in other European Union 
countries, 36 percent thought it would increase at a lower rate, 
29 percent at the same rate, and 24 percent said it would 
increase at a higher rate. 
  The 1 January Lisbon daily DIARIO DE NOTICIAS published the 
results of a NORMA-Gallup poll conducted nationwide among 7,609 
individuals over 15 (no further details), which showed that 43 
percent of the respondents thought 1994 will be worse than 1993, 
compared to 18 percent who believed in an improvement. While 
younger respondents between 15 and 24 were almost equally 
divided between pessimists and optimists (33 percent versus 31 
percent), only 12 percent of respondents over 55 believed in 
better days to come, with 46 percent affirming the opposite.

  [Editorial Report] A recent poll gauged the popularity of 
various politicians, as well as their political prospects. 
  The 31 December independent Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO published 
the results of an EXPRESSO/Euroexpansao poll conducted between 
21 and 27 December among a nationally representative sample of 
481 individuals, with a commentary by Jose Antonio Lima. 
According to poll results, the thus far consistently popular 
President Mario Soares lost 12 percent of his positive rating (a 
drop from last month's 58 percent to his present 46 percent), 
while his negative rating increased 13 percent (from 5 percent 
to 18 percent). This loss, certainly worrisome for a president 
who usually enjoys almost unanimous popular support, stems from 
the electorate's resentment of his share of responsibility in 
the "institutional guerrilla" he has waged against the 
government and the majority, Lima comments. 
  Despite its gains in the recent municipal elections, the 
Socialist Party (PS) holds essentially the same share of voting 
intentions as the governing Social Democratic Party (PSD), 37.0 
percent and 36.8 percent respectively. Similarly, PS leader 
Antonio Guterres' popularity is only slightly higher than Prime 
Minister Cavaco Silva's (35 percent and 32 percent respectively). 
  Respondents were also queried about the opposition's 
prospects for 1994. Some 31 percent thought that Guterres will 
be a "good" leader in 1994, 41 percent expect him to be 
"reasonably good," and 17 percent to be "bad." Center Social 
Democratic Party (CDS) leader Manuel Monteiro is expected to be 
a "good" leader by 32 percent of the respondents, "reasonably 
good" by 36 percent, and "bad" by 19 percent. Communist Party 
(PCP) leader Carlos Carvalhas will be a "good" leader according 
to 28 percent of the respondents, "reasonably good" according to 
38 percent, and "bad" in the opinion of 21 percent.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn, </F>
Swedish People's Party presidential candidate, by Maria 
Romantschuk in Helsinki; no date given: "Finnish `Queen' Wants 
To Be President"] 
  [Text] Helsinki -- "My leadership will be synonymous with 
more openness. Hopefully we will be spared behind-the-scenes 
politics. I pay no attention at all to whisperings in the 
lobbies." 
  So said Finnish Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn, who is well 
on the way to making history. She is the first woman in Finland 
to have a real chance of becoming president -- the highest 
office in political life in Finland. 
  A month ago few would have guessed that she would do well in 
the presidential election. Few believed this only two weeks 
ago, but then came the boom. Her star moved into the ascendant 
in opinion poll after opinion poll; she became a phenomenon. 
Her pet name of "Lillan" gave this boom the name of the "Lillan 
phenomenon." 
  Suddenly many people realized -- and women in particular -- 
that there was a possibility of getting a woman placed at the 
absolute political summit. And this in a country where the 
president is not a ceremonial figure, but a person with real 
power, as in the United States and France. 
  The Finnish president controls foreign policy and can do so 
without any interference. In the past the president alone could 
appoint the government and demand its resignation; now this 
happens to an ever increasing extent in consultation with the 
political parties and the Eduskunta. However, even today the 
president can express a wish for particular ministers. The 
choice of prime, foreign, and defense ministers normally happens 
in consultation with the president. 
  Today the president no longer has the power to dismiss the 
government and dissolve the Eduskunta. The initiative must come 
from the prime minister. 
  "Very different views are taken of the powers the president 
has, depending on who is the president. Some, in harmony with 
the constitution, have exercised great power. Others have not 
made use of the opportunities in the same way and have been 
relatively modest in their exercise of power," Elisabeth Rehn 
said in a special interview with BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. 
  Rehn has followed the debate on whether Finland should have 
a 
woman president with some amusement and puzzlement, particularly 
that section of the debate which has speculated that a woman 
would would make less use of power than a man. 
  "Power has nothing to do with a person's gender. The way in 
which you use you power might be different, more feminine and 
softer," she pointed out, adding that she will involve more 
people in the different decisionmaking processes. 
  "In today's world it is no longer possible to sit there as 
chief and make your decisions alone. The more people there are 
involved in the decisionmaking process, the better. 
  "But the person making the decision must do so very 
concisely 
and clearly on the basis of experience," Rehn said, promising 
that she will do more to make use of the Eduskunta's Foreign 
Affairs Committee than outgoing President Mauno Koivisto and his 
predecessor, Urho Kekkonen, did. 
  Rehn is not interested in any major limitations on the 
powers 
of the president. 
  The election of the president will take place in two weeks' 
time, on 6 February. The choice is between nonsocialist 
candidate Rehn and the Social Democrats' candidate, Martti 
Ahtisaari. It was last Sunday that these two candidates went 
through to the second round in a first round which included 11 
candidates. Rehn made history as a woman, as a Finland Swede, 
and as a representative of a small party. In the last few years 
her party, the Swedish People's Party, has enjoyed support of 
around 5 percent -- her personal support in the presidential 
election's first round was all of 22 percent. 
  In the first analyses that have been published since the 
first round it has been claimed that her success is not due to 
the fact that she is a woman, but to the fact that she is 
defense minister -- a ministerial post she has held for almost 
four years. 
  Today when many people feel unease about Finland's huge 
neighbor to the east most people would like to have a president 
who can help to create security. 
  Rehn assumes that she is seen as a "safe [tryg] figure" who 
has several times referred to the uncertainty factors inherent 
in developments in Russia. Then there is her pro-EU [European 
Union] attitude, and the fact that she has always stressed the 
security which EU membership gives: 
  "Not military security, but the security that comes from 
being part of a broader community." 
  EU membership will be decided in the final analysis by the 
people. The referendum that will be arranged around a year 
after the results of the membership negotiations are clear is 
not formally binding, but Rehn considers that it is absolutely 
binding morally. That is why it is the people who will decide 
Finland's destiny vis-a-vis the European Union. 
  Rehn's attitude to Partnership for Peace is also 
unreservedly 
positive, even though here too she does not see it as military 
security: 
  "There will in no way be any changes to our defense policy, 
if we decide to participate in this partnership." 
  Earlier this week the Finnish Government decided that in 
collaboration with the defense minister the foreign minister 
will investigate what Partnership for Peace will mean. The 
point of departure is that Finland would like to take part in 
the creation of peacekeeping troops, but not in possible future 
military actions. 
  "This is definitely not the first step toward membership of 
NATO," Rehn said. 
  Of the Baltic countries Elisabeth Rehn views Estonia in 
particular as important from the Finnish viewpoint. 
  Our most important neighbors are Sweden, Russia, and 
Estonia, 
in that order," she said, without downgrading Latvia and 
Lithuania as neighbors in the process. 
  "Estonia is a natural cooperation partner for us. 
  "What Finland can do for Estonia is to reinforce its 
capacity 
to maintain surveillance over and guard its own territory and to 
help in the creation of commercial ties." 
  Elisabeth Rehn does not try to hide the fact that she is 
where she is today because as a woman defense minister she has 
achieved a very prominent position in the mass media, both at 
home and abroad. She also admits that it would not have been so 
easy to get as far if she had been development aid or social 
affairs minister, for example. 
  "As soon as I have done something as defense minister it is 
on the front pages of all the country's newspapers," she said, 
regretting the fact that her ability to make an impression as 
equality minister -- which she also is -- is not as great. 
  Elisabeth Rehn said that as president she will be able to 
promote Finland in the world. In this she will be different 
from a male president. 
  "A woman can exploit her gender in a different way. Sell and 
promote Finland in a positive way. And attract the attention 
Finland deserves." 
  She also noted the commentaries in the foreign press to the 
effect that Finland now has a real chance. Even though she is 
not wild about being called "Lillan," something that only family 
and friends call her, or "the queen," it is something that she 
has had to get used to in the last few years. When she visited 
the United States a good two years ago, REUTER reported on 
"Queen Elisabeth of Finland's visit." She has also been called 
president and prime minister. 
  Now she really does want to be president and sees this as an 
chance for Finland. 
  "Which will probably be lost," she said pessimistically two 
weeks before the decisive round of voting, even though today she 
is leading in the opinion polls. 
  The new president will take office on 1 March.

  [Text] Russia's debt to Finland, which runs into the 
billions, will be partly reduced by Finland buying weapons from 
Russia. This involves weapons and ammunition worth 450 million 
Finnish Marks granted in a supplementary budget last year. 
Finland is to receive portable anti-aircraft missiles, among 
other things. The deliveries will be specified in a couple of 
weeks, the Defense Ministry says. The total Russian debt to 
Finland is just over 6 billion Finnish Marks.

  [Text] Expenditures on health care dropped in 1992 for the 
first time in 30 years. Total spending on health care amounted 
to 44.6 billion markkas, which was 200 million less than what 
was spent in 1991. 
  Based on GNP, health care spending was 9.4 percent more than 
the OECD average. The share for health care had grown because 
GNP dropped in 1992 by 4 percent, and since GNP continued 
dropping last year, the share for health care expenditures 
apparently grew again in 1993. In 1991, the average for OECD 
countries was 8 percent; the figure has not yet been calculated 
for 1992. 
  Hospital care was cut most. The reason for this was 
increased 
outpatient care and reductions in capacity. There was also a 
drop in the number of health care workers. Seventy percent of 
inpatient costs go for personnel items. 
  Forty-four percent of health care costs, or 19.5 billion 
markkas, went for inpatient care, and 15.6 billion on outpatient 
care. A total of 4.8 billion was spent on medicines, and 2.14 
billion was paid out through the health insurance scheme as 
medicine reimbursements. 
  Investments in health care dropped by 20 percent. 
  The state paid 35 percent of health care costs, 
municipalities 33 percent, and 11 percent by the National 
Pension System. Households, or services users, paid only 17 
percent.

"Jagland Gets Unique Testimonial From LO Leader Hagensen"] 
  [Text] LO [National Labor Organization] leader Yngve 
Hagensen says cooperation between the LO and the Labor Party 
improved after Thorbjorn Jagland became party leader. 
  Hagensen gave Jagland a unique testimonial and described the 
personal chemistry between them as "excellent." He said the 
present division of labor between the party leader and the prime 
minister is a major reason for the Labor Party's gains in the 
election and in the opinion polls. 
  Hagensen confirmed that cooperation between the LO and the 
party is more flexible now than it was when Gro Harlem 
Brundtland was party leader. He said the strained relations that 
prevailed between himself and Brundtland at times was due to the 
fact that they both have a very direct style. 
  It is no secret that Hagensen fought behind the scenes to 
get 
"his" man in as the head of the Labor Party after Prime Minister 
Brundtland made the surprise announcement at the national 
congress in November 1992 that she was resigning as party 
leader. As head of the nominating committee, Hagensen had a 
finger in the pie. He has now confirmed that he got the result 
he wanted. 
  "The personal chemistry is excellent. I think Thorbjorn is 
doing a good job as party leader. He also has the Storting group 
under control. I was sure that when he got a leading role, he 
would acquire the kind of self-confidence that would allow him 
to flourish. He has done so, and at the same time, Gro is doing 
a good job as prime minister. There is a good division of labor 
between the party leader, the prime minister, and the 
government," Hagensen said. 
  We asked what had caused the strained relations between 
Hagensen and the prime minister. 
  "My style is direct and so is hers. We do not restrain 
ourselves when we disagree. Even though everyone expects us to 
lay all disagreements aside and put on a good act when we hold a 
joint news conference. But that is not the way we are, Gro and 
I." 
  Hagensen stressed that it was mainly their personal styles 
that led to collisions. 
  "My personal relations with Brundtland have never been 
negative, let me emphasize that. But when we disagree, we are 
unable to conceal it. She says what she thinks, and I say what I 
think."

<F P=106> [Geir Salvesen report: "French `Yes' to Norwegian EU </F>
Demands"] 
  [Text] Paris -- Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland 
yesterday paid a flying visit to Paris to meet the country's top 
political leaders. She came directly from Strasbourg. Both 
Prime Minister Balladur and President Francois Mitterrand 
received the Norwegian guest -- the latter at the Elysee Palace. 
But there was no suggestion of dinner or any social 
pleasantries at the present time, in the days leading up to the 
funeral of Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst. 
  According to the Norwegian prime minister, one of the most 
concrete things to emerge from the visit was that the French 
voiced "positive reactions" to Norwegian demands to the effect 
that the country needs time and a gradual transition to the EU's 
[European Union] agricultural policy. 
  EU prices on agricultural produce from day one of membership 
-- the arrangement that has been proposed hitherto in the 
negotiations -- are unacceptable to Norway. And Prime Minister 
Brundtland said that inside the EU great importance will be 
attached to the view France takes on such issues. 
  "This is after all a classic field for France," she said. 
  Fish and agriculture are still the most problematic issues 
in 
the present phase of the negotiations. As far as regional 
policy and what support arrangements Norway and the other 
applicant nations will be covered by are concerned, things have 
been moving back and forth over the last few days. But 
Brundtland said yesterday that she could not imagine that it 
will be impossible to achieve some movement on issues to do with 
regional support arrangements. 
  "The question of money has come further to the fore 
recently. 
It is linked to the EU's internal allocation policy," she said 
at a press conference. 
  Brundtland's visit to Paris is part of the Norwegian 
strategy 
to work on the EU countries' capitals. While the EU Commission 
in Brussels has been accommodating on Norway's position on many 
issues, it is expected that the biggest problems are likely to 
arise in individual member countries in the final phase of the 
negotiations. 
  "When you approach the end of the negotiations the EU 
capitals begin to see things in context. And then the tactical 
game starts everywhere," she said. 
  The whaling issue was also raised in Paris yesterday by 
Prime 
Minister Balladur, but the pressure on the Norwegians from the 
French on this issue is less than that from several other 
countries. The Norwegian Embassy has received around 800 "whale 
letters." 
  Norway is still intent that the timetable for completion of 
the negotiations by 1 March should hold. But asked whether she 
herself takes the view that Norway is in an ideal position, she 
said that "we have a few more undecided areas than Sweden." 
  Brundtland also took the opportunity to invite Prime 
Minister 
Balladur to Norway. It is 10 years since a French prime 
minister visited.

  [Text] The National Council met in a three-hour session 
last night and dealt with the current developments following 
their determining that the process of promoting the 
confidence-building measures has for the time being stalled due 
to [Turkish Cypriot Leader] Rauf Denktas' insistence on 
unacceptable positions. During the meeting, President Glavkos 
Kliridhis briefed the National Council members on a draft letter 
he had prepared for UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
giving the position of the Greek Cypriot side. This letter is 
to sent to the secretary general following a similar letter sent 
to Butrus-Ghali by Denktas. 
  Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that President 
Kliridhis does not consider Denktas' answer on the 
confidence-building measures to be positive, stressing that it 
contains the old demands in disguise. 
  Speaking after the National Council meeting, DISI 
[Democratic 
Rally] Chairman Ioannis Matsis noted that Kliridhis' letter to 
Butrus-Ghali deals with all the positions Denktas presented in 
his own letter to the secretary general, which are just as 
negative as they were in New York. Responding to a question on 
whether we are considering disengaging from the 
confidence-building measures and discussion of the substance of 
the Cyprus issue, Matsis said that all issues are now at the 
forefront. 
  AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] Secretary 
General Dhimitrios Khristofias said he estimates that Denktas 
will not change his positions, but added that he does not 
consider that Denktas' letter proposes unacceptable terms. 
Unfortunately for our side, Denktas' letter is framed in a 
diplomatic way. Khristofias expressed the view that our side 
will be in a difficult position. 
  DIKO [Democratic Party] Chairman Spiros Kiprianou repeated 
that he considers the confidence-building measures to be 
dangerous, and that the best possible development would be to 
disengage from these measures. Denktas' letter, he said, 
reveals that the Turkish side wants to use the 
confidence-building measures to gain even greater benefits in 
its effort to promote its goals. 
  Socialist EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] Chairman 
Vasos Lissaridhis said that Kliridhis' letter to the secretary 
general offers a golden opportunity to deal with the substance 
of the Cyprus issue. If this golden opportunity is not used, he 
said, there is a danger of getting involved in indirect talks on 
the implementation of the confidence-building measures, which, 
he added, constitute a de facto solution of the Cyprus issue.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas met again today with Joe 
Clark, UN secretary general's special envoy for Cyprus. The 
meeting, which began at 1200 at the president's residence and 
continued through lunch, lasted approximately two hours. 
  In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said that he held 
constructive and beneficial talks with Clark and the contacts 
were positive for the Turkish Cypriot side. Denktas reported 
that he explained the situation to Clark within the framework of 
the letter sent to the UN secretary general. Denktas added: I 
believe they were satisfied. 
  Pointing out that the UN envoy will also meet with Greek 
Cypriot Administration leader Glavkos Kliridhis and is trying to 
obtain results from the talks, Denktas remarked that he is 
trying to be of assistance. The president stressed that the 
Turkish Cypriots' position and principles are known, adding that 
he reaffirmed that the Turkish Cypriot side is ready to conduct 
any kind of negotiations as long as these principles are upheld. 
  Asked if he is subjected to any pressure, Denktas said: No, 
there is no such thing. In reply to a question if he was given 
a message on a possible change in Kliridhis' attitude, Denktas 
remarked that it is the result that is important in such 
contacts and there is no result yet. 
  Denktas was also asked if any distance was covered, to which 
he retorted: We did whatever was necessary. Now, we think that 
the Greek Cypriot side must inform the secretary general in a 
letter on what they plan to do and what they accept. 
  Recalling that Clark arrived on the island in a bid to 
accelerate the negotiating process, the president expressed the 
belief that he achieved this. Answering another question, 
Denktas said that the preliminary preparations must be conducted 
in Cyprus before going to New York. 
  Denktas underlined that the changes for progress in the 
talks 
will increase if the Greek Cypriot side conveys to its new 
generation and accepts the fact that the Cyprus problem stems 
from the Greek Cypriots' wish to annex the island to Greece. 
  Replying to reporters' questions after the meeting, Clark 
expressed the conviction that all the meetings he held in Cyprus 
were useful. Noting that he does not wish to make any comments 
at this stage, Clark said that he may issue a statement before 
departing the island tomorrow. Asked if he will meet again with 
Denktas after his meeting with Kliridhis, Clark said that he may 
establish contact on the telephone.

  [Text] Lefkosa [Nicosia], Jan 25 (AA) -- President Rauf 
Denktas of the Republic of Northern Cyprus called Greek-Cypriot 
leader Glavkos Kliridhis for a meeting saying "improving a 
mutual understanding could only be reached by meeting 
face-to-face." 
  Denktas met United Nations envoy Joe Clark for a second time 
in two days who came to Cyprus to hold talks on confidence 
building measures. 
  Denktas, speaking to reporters before starting a working 
lunch with Clark, urged Kliridhis to agree to meet him 
face-to-face to improve mutual understanding. 
  "We have to come to a solution one way or another. Both 
sides have to be satisfied, we are eager for that," he said. 
  Clark said he was not asking the two sides to declare 
acceptance of U.N.-proposed confidence-building measures before 
negotiations adding that "neither I nor the U.N. want to force 
anything because there has to be agreement between the parties. 
We have come a long way." 
  Clark said he will leave for Ankara and Athens on Wednesday 
to hold contacts after meeting with Kliridhis. 
  The Mediterranean island has been divided into Turkish and 
Greek Cypriot sectors since Turkey conducted a peace operation 
to the north in 1974 following a short-lived coup by Greeks 
wanting to annex Cyprus to Greece. 
  A U.N. peacekeeping force has been in Cyprus since 
inter-communal fighting first broke out in 1964. 
  The U.N. has proposed a package of measures which include 
reopening the deserted, Turkish-held resort of Maras [Varosha] 
and Lefkosa International Airport under U.N. control to try to 
rebuild bridges between the two sides. 
  Denktas said last week his government agreed to resume talks 
on the confidence-building measures.

<F P=106> [Interview with Greek Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos </F>
by Mehmet Ali Birand in Athens for the "32d Day" program; date 
not given -- recorded, in French fading into Turkish translation] 
  [Text] [Birand] What is your opinion concerning the 
future of Turkish-Greek relations? 
  [Pangalos] I have to say at first that Greece is not 
administering a hostile policy against Turkey and especially not 
against the Turkish people. We are only issuing criticisms 
concerning the human rights issue. I have to note that our 
critical statements do not outdo similar statements made by 
several of my European colleagues, the international press, or 
the Turkish media. 
  [Birand] You insist on having human rights respected in 
Turkey while the human rights of Turks in Western Thrace are 
being violated. This creates a very important concern for 
Ankara. 
  [Pangalos] The rights of Muslims in Western Thrace are even 
greater than what is granted to them by international agreements. 
  [Birand] What strikes us as most disturbing and worth noting 
is that, after a few quiet years, a drastic change occurred in 
Greek policy after you joined the government. A hostile policy 
toward Turkey began, nonexistent during the government headed by 
Konstandinos Mitsotakis. 
  [Pangalos] The government of Mr. Mitsotakis was a 
right-winged government and did not give too much importance to 
the human rights issue. We are a left-winged government and we 
use the same criteria for both Turkey and Greece when judging 
human rights issues. I would like to note that also in Greece 
all is not well. 
  [Birand] The Cyprus issue is the major concern of the 
Papandreou government and they definitely want to reach a 
solution during their term. For this reason the first thing 
they did when coming to power was to include south Cyprus into 
the Greek defense system. According to the agreement signed by 
Greece and south Cyprus, Greece took the responsibility of 
south Cyprus' air and naval defense. This agreement was 
negatively received by the Turkish government in Ankara. Apart 
from this, Greece started drilling oil around the Thasos island 
which created suspicions regarding the intentions of the 
Papandreou regime since the area drilled was close to the 
international water agreement region -- still under discussion 
-- although inside the borders of Greece. 
  [Pangalos] You have 40,000 soldiers in Cyprus as well as 
heavy tanks and your planes are continually flying over the 
Turkish side. In spite of all this, the small measures we take 
disturb you. The fact that you are alluding to a Greek threat, 
although our planes are unable to reach Cyprus, only shows that 
Turkey has adverse intentions. 
  [Birand] Turkey and the Turkish people believe that the 
Greeks and the Greek Cypriots are not interested in solving the 
Cyprus issue. 
  [Pangalos] Why should we not want to reach a solution 
regarding the Cyprus issue? 
  [Birand] We think that it is easier for Greece to put down 
Turkey in the international arena. 
  [Pangalos] We have lost the war in 1974. We have a very big 
military force and we are proud of it. Yet Turkey has to make a 
choice, either it will be a country that values conquests -- as 
in the past -- or it will be a country that values its 
development and relations with other European countries. These 
two values cannot coexist. Turkey has to decide which way to 
choose, either it will be a military power or it will give 
importance to development. Nobody can sweep the issue of Cyprus 
under the carpet. The problem exists and a solution has to be 
reached. 
  [Birand] Your notion of a solution is to give the Turkish 
Cypriots the rights granted to a minority population and 
consequently close the issue. Your approach does not include 
recognizing the equal rights of the Turkish Cypriots. 
  [Pangalos] What is the meaning of political equality? Is 
political equality giving 50 percent of the political power to 
10 percent of the Cyprus population and the remaining 50 percent 
of the political power to 80 percent of the Cyprus' population? 
Is this distribution democratic? This is not called democracy 
but it is called Turkish oligarchy. How will you react if 18 
percent of the Turkish population has half of the assembly 
seats? This is impossible. 
  [Birand] The problem is obvious. If we go back to the 
Aegean, we see that we are faced with a situation that was 
nonexistent during the Mitsotakis period. You started oil 
exploring around Thasos island. 
  [Pangalos] Listen, I do not want to go into details with you 
about something that is being done within our territorial 
waters. Even the fact that you ask me this question, the fact 
that your press and politicians are discussing this issue, shows 
that you have not yet become part of the international world. 
  [Birand] That is how the crisis of 1987 erupted. 
  [Pangalos] We did not start it. Look, even this discussion 
is ridiculous. All this should be settled in line with 
international rules. If there is a settlement, fine. If there 
is not, then the question must be taken to the International 
Court of Justice in the Hague and settled there. 
  [Birand] Another development which disturbs Turkey is 
Greece's positive attitude toward the PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan]. While the PKK is being banned in several European 
countries, Athens is signaling that it will grant extensive 
freedoms to that organization. PKK militants can demonstrate in 
Athens and be active as political refugees. Greek 
parliamentarians frequently show their solidarity with the PKK. 
This situation greatly disturbs Turkey. Turkey describes 
Athens' attitude toward this most sensitive issue as a show of 
hostility. 
  [Pangalos] The PKK does not base itself in Greece. We do 
not allow any political activity against Turkey. There are 
certain Kurds here. They have the status of political refugees 
as recognized by the United Nations. These people stage 
demonstrations. They have the right. Everybody has the right 
to demonstrate in the city. If they create incidents, they are 
arrested. It happened recently. Some of them hurled stones. 
They were caught, prosecuted and punished. 
  [Birand] Is the PKK a terrorist organization or not? 
  [Pangalos] Listen, there is a people living in southeastern 
Turkey. They want their identities to be recognized. If you 
can resolve this, the problem of terrorism will automatically be 
resolved. If, after that, persons emerge trying to use 
terrorist methods, they will be isolated in the community. 
  [Birand] It is not that simple. They resort to extreme 
violence. Everybody knows that. While this happens, we turn to 
Athens and we see that the PKK is there. 
  [Pangalos] No, the PKK has no official bureau here. You 
cannot find the PKK here. They cannot carry out any activities. 
There are Kurds here. Their representatives talk to the press 
on behalf of the Kurds, not on behalf of the PKK. Do not forget 
that we are not a police state. We cannot drag Kurds from the 
street, torture them, and interrogate them to find out if they 
are PKK members or not. 
  [Birand] Another point that disturbs Turkey is the fact that 
Greece places obstacles in the relations between Turkey and the 
European Union [EU]. Under the pretext of the Cyprus problem, 
Greece tries very hard to prevent the EU from extending even a 
cent to Turkey. In fact, Greece has turned into a clear cut 
policy its determination not to have the 12 EU countries open 
the door for Turkey. The key to that door is claimed to be 
Cyprus. 
  [Pangalos] Yes, we have a political condition. Maybe it was 
we who proposed it, but the 12 accepted it, and it became a EU 
resolution. Now, it is impossible for the other countries to 
say that Turkey has been in Cyprus for a long time, that it does 
not want to withdraw, and that it should be allowed to stay. 
These other countries cannot come and tell us to lift our veto. 
That cannot happen now.

  [Text] Urban guerrilla group November 17 has claimed 
responsibility for the assassination against former National 
Bank of Greece governor Mikhail Vranopoulos, saying it had 
planned several attempts against his life over the last six 
months. 
  In a proclamation sent late yesterday to the private Sky 
television station, November 17 said it had decided to "execute" 
Vranopoulos as the second most culpable person - after former 
prime minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis and before former 
National Economy Minister Stefanos Manos -- in the "criminal" 
sale of the Iraklis General Cement Company to an Italian-led 
consortium. 
  It said the attack on Vranopoulos should also serve as a 
warning to individuals in either the private or public sector 
involved in specific privatisations. 
  Former National Economy and Finance minister Stefanos Manos 
is also named along with Mr Mitsotakis and Vranopoulos as 
responsible for 'defrauding' the Greek people and the 
dissolution of the Greek cement industry. 
  The six-and-a-half page typed proclamation, stamped with the 
group's trademark red five-pointed star, was dated June 1993. 
This was preceded by three paragraphs explaining that the 
attack had been planned for June but that the group had been 
forced to call off that attempt as well as others in July and 
September. 
  Developments in the Iraklis case since June are analysed in 
an addendum dated December 1993. 
  Mr Vranopoulos was replaced as National bank of Greece 
governor by the new socialist government election in October. 
His police protection was removed on September 6 after a review 
of his request for removal deemed he was no longer a potential 
target. 
  In a postscript, November 17 also claims responsibility for 
several terrorist attacks since last winter, including 
explosions at the Moskhato, Maroussi, Petroupoli and Peristeri 
tax offices, a bazooka assault on the Nea Filadhelfia and 
Kaminia tax officials' cars in Ilisia, Pangrati, Patissia, Ayia 
Paraskevi and Yalatsi. 
  The group warns senior tax officials it will strike against 
them without warning. 
  17N [as published] claims that the PASOK government is not 
interested in a thorough investigation into the Iraklis case, 
because, the proclamation alleges, Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou was given, before 1989, a villa on the island of 
Patmos as a "gift" from the owner of the Khalkis Cements 
company, Mr Kioseoglou, in order to avoid the kind of 
investigation the former owners of Iraklis had had. 17N 
concludes this has made Mr Papandreou a sort of "hostage" of Mr 
Mitsotakis.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Suleyman Demirel by Ibrahim </F>
Nebiogly; place and date not given -- live or recorded in 
Turkish] 
  [Text] [Nebiogly] Esteemed President, in your meeting with 
correspondents yesterday you announced that Azerbaijani 
President Geydar Aliyev will pay an official visit to Turkey in 
February. 
  [Demirel] Yes, on 3 February. 
  [Nebiogly] Could you comment on the importance of our 
esteemed president's official visit to Turkey? 
  [Demirel] Azerbaijan is our soul mate. There is no one in 
Turkey who does not get excited when he hears the name of 
Azerbaijan. The occupation of Azerbaijani land by the Armenians 
deeply saddened us here. We have supported Azerbaijan in every 
manner, as the international situation permits. But if we try 
to do anything else we would be harming Azerbaijan's interests. 
We have defended Azerbaijan on every international platform and 
will continue to defend it every day. 
  Esteemed Geydar Aliyev is the elected president of 
Azerbaijan. He will visit Turkey and be hosted as the president 
of an independent state. We will discuss bilateral ties and 
other regional problems with him. We will seek ways to overcome 
hitches if they exist. We will discuss how to protect 
Azerbaijan's rights on international platforms, at the United 
Nations, and in the CSCE. It will be a very beneficial visit. 
Esteemed Aliyev is my invited guest. 
  [Nebiogly] Esteemed President, as you know, the Turkic 
summit, which was to take place in Baku from 21 to 22 January, 
was postponed. But the Turkish press has been publishing rumors 
for the past two days. I want to stress, as you yourself know, 
that this meeting was simply postponed. What is your view on 
this subject? 
  [Demirel] We stated very openly that the decision to hold 
such a meeting at a more suitable time does not mean such a 
meeting is renounced. I will meet the presidents of the other 
republics in Davos. I will also meet Geydar Aliyev. We will 
find a date that suits everyone. I think we are engaged in 
politics, not in a fight. The important thing is to obtain 
results. It will benefit all the concerned countries if this 
meeting is held at a time when it can produce the best results. 
That is what we are going to do. 
  [Nebiogly] Thank you. Esteemed President, what about reports 
that the Azerbaijani Army has now been transformed into a 
regular army and has been achieving success lately? What is 
your view on this subject? 
  [Demirel] Naturally, this makes Turkey happy. Azerbaijan has 
been subjected to injustice and its land was occupied through 
the use of force. Land outside and inside Nagorno-Karabakh was 
occupied. What right do the Armenians have to be in Kelbadzhar, 
Agdam, or Fizuli? What right do they have to be in Lachin or 
Shusha? 
  Turkey is pleased that Azerbaijan has ousted these occupiers 
from the land by using its own army.

<F P=106> [Interview with Israeli President Ezer Weizman by Turhan </F>
Ipek in Ankara on 25 January -- recorded, in English with 
superimposed Turkish translation] 
  [Text] [Ipek] Mr. President, could you first summarize 
the problems in the Middle East peace process? 
  [Weizman] A negotiating process never continues in the same 
way as it began. It is natural for certain problems to arise in 
time. The problems that emerged in the aftermath of the 
agreement signed with the Palestinians can be summarized under 
the following three headings: The boundaries of Jericho which 
will be granted autonomous status, control over entries and 
exits from the area, and the disagreements within the PLO. 
  [Ipek] In your opinion, can Turkey play a role in the Middle 
East peace process? 
  [Weizman] Yes, definitely. I would like to tell you that I 
have been in office for eight months. During this period, I 
received invitations from many countries, but I postponed almost 
all of them. I am conducting my first official visit to Turkey, 
because Turkey is an important and large country in the region. 
It also has a large population; and moreover, it is Muslim. It 
is a democratic and secular country. It has common borders with 
Iran, Iraq, and Syria, in addition to the former Soviet 
republics. There is no need to explain in length the importance 
of Turkey, which is a part of the Balkans and has two important 
straits. Turkey and Palestine [as heard] share a common 
foundation because of these characteristics. Turkey, which is 
an important power in the Middle East, can be influential in the 
peace process. It can influence the PLO and Syrian President 
Hafiz al-Asad. Turkey can play an extremely important role for 
peace, and it is doing so. 
  [Ipek] Various international issues were also discussed 
during the talks. Within this framework, can you comment on the 
tragic situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Armenian attacks 
against Azerbaijan? 
  [Weizman] Various international issues were raised with Mr. 
Demirel. We discussed the newly independent republics and the 
developments in Russia. It is not clear what developments will 
take place in Russia. These must be closely followed. I hope 
the developments will pursue a democratic path. We did not 
discuss Armenian attacks with the Turkish president. The 
situation in former Yugoslavia, however, and the tragic 
developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular, were 
discussed. The international community, the United Nations, and 
NATO must do something to halt this course, which caused the 
death of some 200,000 people. Mr. Demirel is concerned about 
the developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I would not like to 
speak on his behalf, but I think he believes that this stems 
largely from the fact that the world remains a spectator to the 
tragedy in Bosnia and the weakness of the United Nations. 
  [Ipek] Lastly, what in your opinion is the future of 
Turkish-Israeli relations? 
  [Weizman] I am very pleased with the warmth we encountered 
in Ankara. The talks were extremely constructive and were held 
in full understanding. There is an important future for 
bilateral economic cooperation. I believe that during the 24 
hours I spent with Mr. Demirel, we created a brand new beginning 
for the relations between the two countries. There is a 
beautiful and bright sun in Ankara. I believe that the future 
of bilateral relations is as bright as this sun.

  [Text] Israeli President Ezer Weizman, currently on an 
official visit in Turkey, received Husamettin Cindoruk, speaker 
of the Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA], at parliament 
today. 
  At the beginning of the meeting, Weizman said that he chose 
to pay his first official visit abroad to Turkey and he is very 
pleased about it. Weizman pointed out that there are many 
common points between the two countries -- both governed by a 
parliamentary democracy -- and noted that secularism is one 
them. He said that there have been occasional ups and downs in 
the Middle East peace process, adding that we have now reached a 
hopeful phase. Turkey is a great country which could 
significantly contribute to this process, Weizman stressed. 
  In his statement, Cindoruk declared that Weizman's positive 
thoughts reconfirm his peaceful character. Cindoruk welcomed 
the steps taken for a lasting peace in the region, in response 
to the desire for peace. Cindoruk expressed the hope that the 
area, which turned into an illegal entity, will in the future 
become a region of tranquillity, in which democracy -- the 
concept of a state -- and border discipline prevail. He said 
that ending terrorism -- which is an extension of the Cold War 
-- in this region will constitute a very important step in 
securing world and regional peace. Like all democratic 
parliaments in the world, the TGNA is waiting for and supports 
the implementation of the recent declaration of principles, 
Cindoruk remarked. He also expressed his conviction that 
archaic methods, which are difficult to explain or comprehend, 
will never be utilized in this region again. 
  Later, the talks between the two delegations continued in 
camera.

  [Text] The Iraq-Turkey oil pipeline sustained heavy damage 
after PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] militants bombed it last 
night. The damage to the pipeline, which was sabotaged at a 
point near the town of Cizre in Sirnak district, is estimated to 
be 500 billion Turkish lira. BOTAS [Turkish Pipeline Company] 
has started work on repairing the pipeline. 
  [Begin correspondent recording] PKK militants who attacked 
two villages in Mardin Province on Saturday night massacred 20 
citizens, eight of them children, using chemical gas. 
  The PKK members attacked Cizre in Sirnak district the next 
day but were repulsed. One police officer was martyred during 
the clash. After being defeated in Cizre, the PKK militants 
bombed the crude oil pipeline at around 0100 this morning. A 
highly explosive bomb was used in the attack in the Duzova area 
between Idil and Cizre. Cizre, which lies 6 km away, was shaken 
by the force of the explosion. Smoke rising from the burning 
crude oil covered the Cudi Mountain and most of Cizre district. 
The fire was put under control when the valves were shut. The 
equivalent of 50,000 barrels of oil spread throughout the 
surrounding area and caught fire. Damage caused by the pipeline 
fire is estimated at almost 500 billion lira. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Ismet G. Imset: "...and Turkey Is Mobilized </F>
Against Terrorism"] 
  [Text] Determined to end the Kurdish separatist campaign in 
southeastern Turkey with military measures by next summer at the 
latest, Ankara last week revealed a major decision taken under 
pressure from the Office of the Chief of Staff. Following 
hundreds of protest calls to newspapers from relatives of 
soldiers who had already heard the news, officials were forced 
to announce that Turkey had frozen all Army discharges for 
periods ranging from three to five months. 
  But, if expectations are correct, the decision is to be 
followed now with a brand new measure that will increase 
compulsory military service for all future conscript s-- 
resulting in a step backward on a political promise that had 
been made to the Turkish nation by now President Suleyman 
Demirel, with the aim of being elected to power. 
  The move was clearly implemented in accordance with demands 
voiced by the Turkish military and was intended to give the 
country's military commanders a free hand in fulfilling their 
pledge to break the backbone of terrorism by spring at the 
latest. 
  Even Prime Minister Tansu Ciller had to go on record saying 
that the development was not designed by her coalition 
government but was the result of a demand that had originated 
from the Office of the Chief of Staff. 
  The words she used to describe what had happened somewhat 
shed light on the behind-the-scenes events. According to her, 
the Cabinet decision had been adopted as a result of "an 
absolute demand" presented to the government by both the 
National Security Council (MGK) and security forces. Her 
remarks also revealed who has the final say on major national 
issues in Turkey. 
  According to sources close to the government, following last 
month's MGK meeting, the "decision" was drafted and delivered to 
each Cabinet minister, one by one, to be signed. By Dec. 20, 
all of the signatures had been obtained and the decision was 
passed. With absolutely no legal right to protest, criticize or 
even express any views at all on this extension, tens of 
thousands of Turkish soldiers were told by their superior 
officers that their eagerly anticipated discharges were not to 
come. Instead, they would have to wait for at least three more 
months and "defend" their country. 
  From the moment the measure was drafted at the chief of 
staff's office and relayed to regional and unit commanders and 
then to soldiers, not a single word of the extension had been 
leaked to the press, despite Turkey's record of leakages on all 
issues. 
  The head of the government, Ciller, knew how much such a 
freeze would hurt her politically as it would every other 
Cabinet minister. Yet, Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan was 
comfortably touring Tunisia at the time and Turkey's senior 
commanders were clearly preferring to place the responsibility 
for the decision on the politicians. 
  It was so sensitive an issue that, according to Parliament's 
National Defense Commission Chairman Baki Tug, even he had to 
wait to hear the news from the newspapers after the horn was 
finally blown. 
  When the decision had been relayed to Turkey's 500,000 plus 
soldiers, they phoned their families to notify them of the 
extension. Once the families were informed, as if in chorus, 
they phoned the press which finally brought the news out. 
Military officials, who often search for opportunities to 
comment on national issues and, in private, criticize "the 
politicians" for interfering in their affairs, were no more 
willing than the politicians to announce this decision. Cabinet 
members contacted by the TURKISH PROBE were telling the press to 
get their confirmation of the new measure from the Office of the 
Chief of Staff. Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry claimed that 
they had not been informed of such a development and only the 
prime minister's office could comment. As for military 
officials, pressed too much by the press, all they did was to 
tell journalists that the report was true, but added that 
Defense Minister Golhan "wanted to make the announcement 
himself" and that they should not be quoted on their 
confirmation of the decision. 
  Clearly, no one wanted to take immediate responsibility for 
-- and thus face the immediate consequences of -- this decision. 
It was too controversial a subject to go public with, at least 
as the one responsible for the measure. 
<H5>  The Verdict </H5>
  Although the official jargon on the recent freeze on 
discharges is jumbled and somewhat difficult to understand for 
the foreigner, what it basically means is that all conscripts, 
including regular compulsory soldiers and noncommissioned 
officers, will be serving in the military longer than they had 
originally planned. 
  But because Turkish law prevents criticism of this decision, 
no one can openly protest it. 
  Thus, all Turks -- those who at very young ages had planned 
their futures based on the former discharge period; those with 
businesses to return to; those who have families to support; 
those who have scheduled their whole lives: employment, 
marriages, business trips and debt repayments -- must wait. 
Even soldiers with only 20 days to go -- those who have 
exhausted their handmade calendars marking off each day of the 
past 14 months -- will have to add at least 100 days more to new 
calenders. And, in the meantime, the press is banned from 
reporting the resulting frustration or even writing what could 
be construed as protests, for this too is a crime. 
  In other words, despite the careful way the news was broken 
to the Turkish public, there is nothing much to fear. For 
protest, if there are any, can only be worded by those who have 
little to loose and even in the media, by those who have now 
gotten accustomed to being closed down or seized on court 
orders. Thus, even though there has been a serious shock among 
soldiers and their families, the recent decision -- or verdict 
-- was passed without a problem. 
  It appears that had the prime minister been kind enough to 
consult with her aides before giving in to the "absolute 
demand," she could have at least prevented a reaction from 
within her own party. But she did not, and was consequently met 
with a strong response. 
  Addressing her party's General Executive Board meeting a day 
after the extension decision was publicized, Ciller faced her 
first problem; not from the legally silenced Turkish public, but 
from her own executives who clearly enjoyed the immunity of 
being part of a ruling party. 
  And, they were tough on her. Not because of their concern 
for what such a decision could hold for the future on Turkey as 
a nation, but for what it could hold for them, politically. 
  The reaction demonstrated, to an extent, how ignorant of 
national issues the True Path Party (DYP) had become and how 
little it cared for such domestic topics. 
  Indeed, the strongest reaction Ciller did get was from her 
own party. The reasons for this reaction were perhaps best 
expressed both in a question posed by Tug and in a remark made 
by DYP Deputy Tevfik Diker: Tug, chairman of Parliament's 
Defense Commission, asked Ciller, "Why was such an important 
decision hidden from us?" while Diker, a member of the same 
commission, said openly that the Cabinet decision would lose 
votes for the party. 
  "We have already lost the families of soldiers who will be 
discharged three months late. The elections are ahead of us and 
most of the families with children serving in the Southeast are 
concerned. This will reflect negatively on the elections," was 
how Diker put it. 
  At about the same time, private ATV television anchor man 
and 
SABAH chief columnist Guneri Civaoglu asked the government why 
such a decision had been adopted in haste and what legitimized 
such an extension, as there was neither a war nor a mobilization. 
  Perhaps unknown to him, there was a mobilization being 
conducted in Turkey even before the decision was released. In 
fact, the main aim of the extensions was to ensure that this 
mobilization would be of use. 
  For, months ago, Turkey's Chief of Staff Gen. Dogan Gures 
had 
sworn that the military would wipe out the terrorists by next 
spring but there seemed to be no way of doing this without 
changing some of the principles of the new Turkish system. 
  As Gures does not have too much time to make such changes -- 
for he himself will be retiring next August -- whatever happens 
must happen before then. 
<H5>  The Reasons </H5>
  This also explains many other developments in recent days, 
especially the reasons behind Gures' most recent furor over 
criticism toward the Army and his now-traditional argument that 
the risks Turkey faces in the region are far greater than they 
were during the Cold War era. 
  At last, after the collapse of the concept of New World 
Order, the "New World Disorder" had surfaced which required that 
Turkey's military be constantly prepared. 
  According to Turkish military officials, the main reason 
behind the freeze of military discharges was the increased draft 
evasion throughout Turkey which had seriously hindered 
recruitment efforts. 
  This was best expressed by Gen. Hursit Tolon, secretary 
general of the Office of the Chief of Staff, who said in a 
written statement that the Turkish Army was 110,000 soldiers 
short. 
  When seen in light of Ciller's announcement that Turkey had 
554,000 soldiers, this put the current shortage at about 
one-fifth of the Armed Forces' total strength. 
  According to Golhan, who made an announcement on draft 
evasion last month, there were approximately 250,000 draft 
dodgers in Turkey and most of them were from the terror-ridden 
southeast region. 
  Thus, Tolon argued, the decision to freeze military 
discharges was made because the peacetime staff apparently did 
not meet the requirements of the Armed Forces. 
  Both he and Ciller explained to Turkey that Demirel's 
decision -- made when he was elected to office as prime minister 
-- to decrease the military service period from 18 to 15 months, 
had created some serious problems. Meanwhile, expectations for 
new recruits had not been met following the Cold War and 
"uncertainties, instability and threats" had increased. This 
called for a revision of the previous decrease. According to 
one senior officer, reducing the term of military service was a 
mistake in the first place since it was nothing more than 
fulfilling an electoral promise. "Fifteen months of compulsory 
service" was a slogan frequently used by the DYP and Gen. Gures 
agreed to make the necessary arrangements, but only in order not 
create problems for the new administration. However the burden 
of the decision had become too great. 
<H5>  The Southeast </H5>
  What was evident, though, was that the impetus for adopting 
the Dec. 20 decision did not come in the form of a perception of 
a global threat, but was a result of escalating events in the 
southeast region. Statistics from 1993 indicated that, despite 
official statements, there was a 100 percent increase in the 
number of armed activities in that region and Kurdish separatism 
had claimed a twofold increase in lives that year compared to 
1992. 
  As Tolon put it, Turkey was seeking now to keep trained 
personnel at hand in the combat zone, especially before the 
military launches its massive crackdown. 
  In the words of Interior Minister Nahit Mentese, winter 
operations against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) 
are to continue with full steam in the coming days. And in the 
spring and summer, the "final blow" is to be delivered. As 
Golhan has put it, "We need trained soldiers for several months. 
We have ordered a freeze on the discharge of trained soldiers 
in view of the continuing domestic threat and the upcoming 
operations to be carried out in southeast Anatolia during the 
winter and spring." 
  Thus, there is no doubt that the main reason behind the 
freeze is neither "the increased threat from Greece," as some 
papers have reported, nor the developments in the former Soviet 
republics. Perhaps these have had some influence on the 
decision, but the extension appears primarily as a result of 
domestic issues. 
  Several issues ago, TURKISH PROBE had informed its readers 
that a countdown had begun for the southeast region and that by 
March 1994, there would be an immense operation in this trouble 
spot of Turkey. It now appears as though the operation is 
currently underway and may gain momentum in the coming weeks. 
March, though, is still the most crucial month. 
  Not only because it is the month of "uprisings" for the PKK, 
but also because all developments during that month are to 
affect the whole of Turkish democracy, most probably to be 
reflected in military appointments, promotions and retirements 
in August. During the debate over military service, one "leak" 
to the press was of interest to the outside observer, although 
the military later denied its authenticity. According to 
several reports in large circulation newspapers, along with the 
extension of military service, "all resignations and retirements 
from the Armed Forces" had also been frozen. 
  This is indeed not true -- for the time being. But cynics 
say there may be a reason behind such a "leak." Perhaps it was 
aimed at putting the possibility into the heads of millions of 
Turks only to prepare everyone for such a development. 
  To be more open, if in March the final clash begins and 
things get out of hand, if the PKK cannot be crushed by the 
spring and if speculation on the real intentions of the current 
Turkish command structure do take place, Gen. Dogan Gures and 
others waiting their turn to retire, may not have to this in 
August. Gures' term in office had already been extended by a 
special decree for an additional year, although his retirement 
had come up in 1993. After the extension though, the 
Constitutional Court ruled against the government's authority to 
make such decisions. But, because no application had been made 
against Gures' extension in the legally required time, he 
remained in his position. 
  But there has been no legal -- or constitutional -- 
extension 
for him this year. The only way his stay, and those of his 
close aides, could be extended would be if heavy increase in 
violence to the point of civil war occurred. In that case, all 
retirement and resignations from the Armed Forces could be 
legally halted. As for what is happening in the Southeast, a 
brief summary of how the recent decision will affect the country 
is as follows: At least 40,000 soldiers who would have been 
discharged in the southeast region next March will remain on 
duty. 
  In other words, the decision is designed to increase the 
manpower of the Turkish Armed Forces at an accelerated rate, 
with new conscripts to be added to those not being discharged. 
Turkey, which under normal peacetime conditions should have 
some 90,000 to 95,000 troops (or nine divisions) in the region, 
currently has about 160,000 there. If these were discharged, 
some 40,000 trained soldiers would have left the service. To 
replace them, 40,000 new recruits would have to go through main 
training for four months and then be sent to the region where 
they would be starting from zero. For many commanders, at a time 
as crucial as this, such a move could be disastrous. According 
to one officer who asked not to be identified, the most 
difficult thing for Turkey was to train commando soldiers which 
were a vital part of Turkey's campaign against the guerrillas. 
"Now there is time and the conditions are present to place more 
trained personnel in the region," he explained. 
  Another military officer disclosed that a decision had 
already been made, in secrecy, to send a majority of Turkey's 
fresh conscripts to the Southeast. The transfers have already 
begun. On Wednesday, there were reports that two Turkish naval 
soldiers were killed in Sirnak. The reports said that they were 
first transferred to Iskenderun from Izmir and then sent to 
Sirnak. This fits in with reports reaching the Turkish capital 
that there has been intensified military preparation throughout 
the region and that new armored personnel carriers, tanks, 
attack helicopters, armored vehicles and warplanes had been 
deployed. Reports also disclosed that gendarmerie depots are so 
full that newly deployed equipment, including Russian-made 
BTR-80 armored vehicles, are now being stocked at depots of the 
Land Forces Command. 
  According to a senior general interviewed by the TDN 
[Turkish 
Daily News] last week, "trained units from everywhere around 
Turkey, even from Istanbul, are being sent there." 
  And, despite Ciller's own announcement that the extension of 
military service is a one-time-only decision, senior sources at 
the Chief of Staff's Office say that they are working on a 
completely new system whereby compulsory service periods will be 
extended up to 18 months. Currently, military service is 15 
months for private and 12 months for noncommissioned officers. 
  What all of this means is that Turkey is on its way to a 
full 
mobilization to counter separatist activities and that many new 
developments should be expected in the near future. These may 
include the declaration of a state of emergency throughout the 
country, the declaration of martial law and even the 
constitutional declaration of the existence of "civil war" 
conditions. 
  Whatever happens, it is evident that in one way or another, 
as long as terrorism remains on Turkey's agenda, it will be the 
military that runs the country and makes the final decisions on 
national affairs....

  [Excerpts] Brussels, Jan 26 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation has sent the United Nations its plans for 
possible air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina and air support for 
UN troops there, a NATO spokesman said here Wednesday [26 
January]. He added that the 16-nation alliance was ready to 
meet any UN request to help break the siege of the Bosnian towns 
of Tuzla and Srebrenica. 
  Serb forces around Tuzla have prevented the re-opening of an 
airport there which is needed for UN aid operations. They have 
also hindered the relief of Canadian troops trapped at 
Srebrenica. 
  The spokesman said: "We have provided our plans for close 
air 
support (of UN troops under attack) and air strikes to the UN 
and we have offered to send a team to UNPROFOR (UN Protection 
Force) headquarters in Zagreb." 
  Speaking after a regular meeting of NATO ambassadors, he 
added: "We are ready to help the United Nations with its 
planning for the re-opening of Tuzla airport and the relief of 
the UNPROFOR contingent in Srebrenica." [passage omitted] 
  NATO sources said the UN's special representative in 
ex-Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, would submit proposed plans for 
military intervention, including bombing, to the world body in 
New York on Friday. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 26 (AFP) -- The integration of West 
and East Europe into a stable unit is the greatest challenge 
facing the European Community, EC Trade Commissioner Leon 
Brittan said Wednesday [26 January]. 
  In a speech delivered to businessmen in The Hague, he urged 
that countries bound to the EC with association agreements 
should be welcomed into the Community as full members. A text 
of the speech was distributed here. 
  Brittan said that the association agreements signed by the 
EC 
in 1992 with Hungary, Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, 
Romania and Bulgaria would create a free trade area stretching 
from the Atlantic Ocean to the Black Sea. 
  But he said it was crucial that the Community open its 
markets wider to East Europe and the countries of the former 
Soviet Union to promote economic progress, democracy and 
stability there. 
  "The future of the European Community itself depends on 
integrating (East European) countries into a prosperous and 
stable common future. It is as much in our interest as theirs," 
Brittan said. 
  Brittan also called on EC countries to retain faith in their 
target of a single currency, to work harder on aligning their 
economies, and to lower interest rates to promote economic 
recovery.

  [Excerpts] The situation in the former Yugoslavia was 
discussed today at the Nordic foreign ministers' meeting in 
Stockholm, and it became clear that Croatia risks losing some of 
its cooperation with the European Union [EU]. 
  [Correspondent] Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg 
Petersen 
said today at the news conference of the Nordic foreign 
ministers' meeting in snow-covered Haga Castle that the EU is 
now seriously discussing its relations with Croatia. The reason 
is the alliance Croatia has formed with Serbia. There are UN 
sanctions against Serbia, while Croatia has so far been treated 
more or less uncritically in the international community. 
[passage omitted] 
  Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas repeated the 
threat which exists against the Croatian Government. 
  [Begin af Ugglas recording] There is permanently a latent 
threat against Croatia, much depends on Croatia's conduct, to 
tell the truth, to what extent the Croatian regular units are 
active in Bosnia, to what extent new massacres can be 
discovered; and I am of the opinion that it was useful that the 
Danish foreign minister pointed out that the European Union 
itself has possibilities because Croatia is very dependent on 
trade opportunities and so on. And that shows that what we in 
Sweden hope for, a stronger European cooperation, also gives 
direct forcible means against aggressive warlords. [end 
recording] 
  [Correspondent] With closer links with the EU, Sweden would 
have better possibilities to act against Croatia, that seemed to 
be Margaretha af Ugglas' conclusion. The good relations Germany 
has with the Croatian government work against any talk about a 
harder attitude toward Croatia.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Piet Dankert, Netherlands state </F>
secretary for European affairs, by R. Timmer and R. Winkel; 
place and date not given: "For the European Parliament It Is 
Now or Never -- `Link EC Expansion With Democratization,' Says 
Dankert"] 
  [Text] The negotiations on the entry of Austria, Sweden, 
Finland and Norway to the European Community are in a decisive 
stage. After all the commotion around the Maastricht Treaty, 
the entry process was supposed to be flexible and smooth. In 
1995, the newcomers were to have been allowed in the Community 
on strict but fair terms. The EC was to be unrelenting if 
excessive demands were made of the Community's existing 
achievements, namely the varied range of treaties and behavioral 
rules which determine how cooperation takes place in the EC and 
European Union [EU]. But it was to be flexible enough to not 
make the referenda in the new member states a hopeless cause in 
advance. 
  But once again the European reality seems to be tougher than 
the illusions of bureaucrats and politicians. Norway and 
Austria are making more problems than expected. Suddenly Spain 
has had the idea that the new member states should not be 
allowed to participate in examining membership in the third 
phase of Economic and Monetary Union. 
  The Spanish and British are also demanding -- despite all 
their fine agreements -- that the relative importance of the 
large member states should not be affected. By way of reply, 
the smaller countries are already wishing aloud again about 
democratization and reviewing the Maastricht Treaty. In brief: 
The attractive timescale seems to have been strewn with thorns. 
With a little over a month remaining before the first deadline 
passes, caused by June's European elections, we are running a 
short series about the current state of affairs. We start with 
an interview with Piet Dankert, state secretary for European 
affairs, who in this capacity is at the front line of the 
negotiations. 
  Not for the first time in his colorful career, Dankert is 
currently in an ambiguous position. At present, he is still 
negotiating in the name of the Netherlands Government on the 
entry of new EC countries. In five months, once again he will 
take up his old position and judge the results of his own work 
in the name of the European electorate. Thanks to a high place 
on the PvdA's [Labor Party] list of candidates, Dankert is 
virtually certain of a seat in the European Parliament. 
  And it is this very Parliament which could take on a key 
role 
in the pandemonium, which is now slowly starting to occur, 
around the expansion question. A parliamentary majority has to 
approve the expansion, before ratification procedures can start 
in the national parliaments. If the negotiations are 
successfully concluded in early March, as is still officially 
intended, then the present Parliament could still give its 
verdict in May. 
  Dankert, who knows the circus in Strasbourg very well, 
thinks 
it will be touch and go. After all, the Parliament is close to 
its end. "Those 260 votes are not certain," Dankert said. 
"There are rather a lot of members who are leaving anyway and 
therefore will feel free to follow their own judgement." The 
MPs see this simply as a "nice issue" for the election campaign. 
  For the Parliament, which feels that it came off badly in 
the 
Maastricht Treaty, there is a very real opportunity for 
extracting more power via the expansion of the EC. "It is now 
or never," Dankert said. "Because nothing should be expected 
from the British and Danes in 1996." In 1996, the EC countries 
are supposed to discuss the review of the Maastricht Treaty. 
Pandora's box should remain closed until then. 
  However, already The Hague has opted to ask a committee of 
experts whether it would not be possible to cautiously open the 
lid now. Recently this suggestion was taken up by [Theodhoros] 
Pangalos, the Greek state secretary for European affairs and 
president of the Council. Negotiations on a binding mandate for 
this committee could be held with the European Parliament, which 
in exchange would vote in favor of the expansion agreement. 
  Dankert said that The Hague, despite the debacle with its 
plans for a European Union in 1991, was still eager to make the 
EC more democratic. "At the time the problem was the 
orientation and shaping of foreign policies, and to a lesser 
degree democratization," he said. He stuck to his position that 
Germany also wanted to go much further at the time. "I feel we 
must now try to achieve that goal through expansion," he said. 
"The UK can be blackmailed with that." 
  In any case, the Netherlands is also a resolute supporter of 
rapidly expanding the Community, "with some ministries being 
somewhat less conditional than others," he said. The Ministries 
of Agriculture, Finances and Economic Affairs see big 
advantages. The Foreign Ministry, which is working hard on a 
European policy document, "in contrast also sees an interest in 
an EC which works properly and democratically. But that is 
harder to put in statistical terms," he said. Nevertheless 
Dankert would not want to sacrifice expansion to 
democratization, a tendency he claims to detect in CDA 
[Christian Democratic Appeal] circles. The PvdA is somewhat 
more inclined toward expansion because of its political affinity 
with the Scandinavian countries. 
  "Technically," it is still possible to reach agreement by 10 
March, the state secretary says, although he does not completely 
exclude the possibility that the most difficult customers, 
Norway and Austria, will have to drop out before then. "But 
then you have to understand that a whole period will pass before 
a new opportunity occurs," Dankert said. "And, in addition, it 
undermines the campaign in the other countries." 
  Norway is demanding its own fishing zone above the 62nd 
parallel, and this demand contradicts the common fisheries 
policy. Not only does Austria want to benefit for another full 
12 years from a transit agreement on goods which it signed with 
the EC, but it also is seeking to use its membership to impose 
similar restrictions on large increases in East-West traffic. 
The Netherlands can agree with a German-Italian proposal to give 
the Austrians another three years' respite. It is still unclear 
whether that is equally true of the other EC countries and 
Vienna itself. 
  The demand, which has now been adopted by all the candidate 
countries, that second homes should remain reserved for their 
own nationals, is also troubling the negotiations. Dankert said 
there was a fear in Bonn that the Austrians were waiting for the 
German EC presidency in the second half of this year, in the 
belief that the Germans will not be able to refuse their 
southern neighbors any favors. 
  The problems with Sweden are almost solved. And, in The 
Hague's eyes at least, a solution is also feasible for the 
Finns, who are refusing to give up their high levels of support 
to farmers. Whereas elsewhere in Europe, exceptions and special 
support regulations are made for farmers in mountainous areas, 
in the high north a criterion based on the degree of latitude 
could be applied. The fact that this way, virtually all of 
Finland's farmers would end up indirectly on Brussels's pay list 
is seen as part of the deal by The Hague. The alternative, in 
the form of levies at the border, is worse. That could also 
cause delays and extra costs for products which are not 
supported, like flowers. 
  Dankert could not say whether the issue could be resolved 
politically by early March. "Even if you make it by 1 March, 
there are still a considerable number of obstacles on the way," 
Dankert said. Given the British attitude, Dankert doubts 
whether agreement could be reached with the European Parliament 
before July. In any case, he feels it is undesirable to meet the 
British/Spanish demand of increasing the relative power of the 
large countries in the Council of Ministers (by keeping the 
present number of votes at 23, despite expansion, which means a 
blocking minority can be reached by two large member states and 
one small one). "You must not make any concession which makes 
the EC less decisive," he said.

<F P=106> [Jacques Amalric report: "Bosnia: Following the </F>
Franco-American Muddle"] 
  [Text] Mrs. Sadako Ogata, UN high commissioner for 
refugees, appealed to the international community in Paris on 
Tuesday [25 January] to help the Bosnians "get through the 
winter" and to "exert pressure" for a peaceful settlement of the 
conflict. She was not willing to comment on the question of air 
strikes. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher knows how not to 
be a diplomat when he so wishes. His French interlocutors -- 
Francois Mitterrand, Edouard Balladur, and Alain Juppe -- 
experienced that on Monday when they discussed the Bosnian 
crisis with him: All their demands, aimed at securing a clear 
commitment from Washington in favor of the European peace plan 
which makes provision for an unequal partition of Bosnia, were 
rejected. 
  This plan, the head of U.S. diplomacy told them in 
substance, 
is "immoral" and "unjust" because it penalizes the "victims" of 
an aggression which is essentially Serbian. Those victims 
should have the right to defend themselves. Therefore the 
United States will never exert pressure on the (Muslim) Bosnian 
authorities to accept a solution which does not suit them, even 
if they have reached a military effectiveness which is causing 
problems for Bosnia's Serbian and Croatian armed forces. As in 
May 1993, the United States is still in favor of lifting the 
arms embargo which is affecting Bosnia -- a measure to which the 
European countries which have sent contingents to the former 
Yugoslavia are still hostile. If the UN bodies agree, Washington 
will not oppose the use of air strikes to break the stranglehold 
on Sarajevo, reopen Tuzla airport, and free the city of 
Srebrenica, but is, however, completely opposed to sending 
American troops to Bosnian soil to impose a settlement. 
  The French officials clearly did not expect such an outright 
rejection. There was "misunderstanding" or "misinterpretation" 
of our position, the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Affairs Ministry] 
said on Tuesday. We did not ask for U.S. military intervention 
and we did not put forward a new plan for a conference; we 
simply asked them to support a political plan and to accept 
increased cooperation with the Europeans and the Russians who, 
within the Security Council framework, are increasingly clearly 
opposing the use of force against the Serbs. And the question 
was asked: "How can the Americans refuse this dialogue?" The 
Twelve's plan, it was added, is not "intangible." Although the 
Bosnians must be deterred from reviving the war, pressure must 
be envisaged on the Serbs to make them concede certain regions 
to the Muslims without which their territory would not be 
"viable," and on the Croatians to accept that the Bosnians 
should have access to the sea. But these geographical changes 
in a plan which is changing constantly, because each side is 
trying to maximize its profits and minimize its risks, cannot be 
entrusted to the result of armed conflict. A resurgence of the 
fighting would place the UN Protection Force troops in an 
impossible situation which would result in their withdrawal. 
  But it is clear that for Washington, which only has a few 
hundred men in Macedonia, the Bosnian crisis does not require an 
urgent decision, because it does not threaten any vital American 
interest: Bosnia, from this viewpoint, is much more similar to 
Lebanon than to Kuwait. A top U.S. official passing through 
Paris, who does not wish to be named, said on Tuesday morning 
that pressure must naturally be brought to bear on the Serbs and 
Croatians, but the best means of pressure is still the force of 
Bosnian arms. And, after once again mentioning the notion of 
"justice" to justify the American lack of action, this same 
interlocutor gave a cruder description of the state of mind of 
the American public ("only the big East coast newspapers are 
worrying much about Bosnia") and of Congress, which is hostile 
to any U.S. involvement in Bosnia following the problems 
encountered by the United States in Somalia and Haiti. "To 
impose a peace settlement in Bosnia," he added, "would take at 
least 200,000 men, which cannot be envisaged in the present 
situation," he added. 
  After such a rebuff, which says a great deal about the U.S. 
desire to take the Europeans at their word when they demanded an 
identity in the security and defense sphere at the last NATO 
summit, the Twelve can only submit their work on the subject and 
hope that a conflagration does not precipitate a chaotic 
withdrawal. The task is particularly uninspiring because the 
Bosnians will emerge strengthened in their conviction that this 
Franco-American clash has ended to their advantage. The 
Russians, who have never concealed their sympathy for the 
Serbian camp, understood this immediately and, in an attempt to 
freeze the situation to Belgrade's advantage, have just demanded 
an emergency meeting of the Security Council in Geneva at 
foreign ministers' level. The aim of the meeting, to which all 
the parties to the conflict would be invited, is to adopt, 
following the conclusion of a cease-fire, "an agreement in 
principle on peace before examining the details." There is no 
doubt that the Twelve could have done without such an initiative.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 27 (AFP) -- The European Investment 
Bank, the financing arm of the European Community, increased its 
investment loans in 1993 by 15 percent despite the economic 
recession, the bank announced here on Thursday [27 January]. 
  It increased lending to ECU19.6 billion (21.56 billion 
dollars), up from ECU17 billion (18.9 billion dollars) in 1992. 
  The bank finances on average 30 percent of project costs. 
Having a top-ranking borrowing status, it is able to raise 
money more cheaply and pass on the advantages to borrowers. 
  In 1993 the EC bank lent ECU17.7 billion (19.6 billion 
dollars) for projects within the EC, and ECU1.9 billion (2.11 
billion dollars) outside -- mainly in East Europe and the 
Mediterranean basin. 
  EIB president Brian Unwin said the bank was playing a key 
role in the EC's economic recovery programme. "The bank is well 
equipped to contribute further to the European integration 
process in 1994," he said. 
  Prominent in the EIB's activities in 1993 were the 
allocation 
of ECU7.8 billion (8.66 billion dollars) for the development of 
trans-European transport, telecommunications and energy networks. 
  The networks are a key element in an EC initiative to speed 
up the integration of West Europe and to boost employment by 
providing a more efficient infrastructure for businesses. 
  The bank said it had already signed network loan contracts 
for ECU2.4 billion (2.66 billion dollars). 
  Nearly three quarters of the funds allocated within the 
community in 1993 went to the EC's poorer regions. The biggest 
amounts went to Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Britain and 
Portugal (in descending order). 
  In 1993 the EIB more than doubled its investment loans to 
East Europe -- to ECU882 million (979 million dollars), up from 
ECU320 million in 1992. The largest recipient was Poland (just 
over ECU300 million). 
  Similarly, loans to Mediterranean countries doubled from 
ECU321 million to ECU680 million (755 million dollars), with 
more than a third of the funds going to Algeria. 
  In 1993, for the first time, the EIB extended its investment 
support operations to Asia and Latin America. 
  India got ECU55 million (61 million dollars) for an 
electricity grid system in the south, and Costa Rica received 
ECU44 million (49 billion dollars) for power projects.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 26 (AFP) -- The European Commission is 
to haul six European Community countries to court for not 
dismantling their gas and electricity monopolies, EC officials 
said here Wednesday [26 January]. 
  They said the EC's executive complained to the European 
Court 
of Justice that France, Denmark, Spain, Ireland, Italy and the 
Netherlands were retaining the monopolies in contravention of 
the EC's principles of free competition. 
  The move is an attempt to pressure the six countries into 
accepting a directive from the Commission that they should make 
their state-owned utility networks available to power companies 
from other countries. 
  The directive has been blocked for nearly two years. The 
Commission is targeting France for its electricity and gas 
monopolies, Denmark for gas, and Spain, Italy, Ireland and the 
Netherlands for their electricity monopolies. 
  Commission officials said the liberalisation of the power 
and 
gas markets was essential if the EC's single market was to work 
properly. 
  It would mean that a French company, for example, could get 
its power from Germany if this was cheaper.

<F P=106> [Article signed M.N.: "Paris and Brussels at Loggerheads on </F>
Bull"] 
  [Text] Brussels is expected to block tomorrow the payment 
of a 2.5-billion-franc [Fr] grant earmarked for Bull [computer 
firm] in 1994. The European Commission will also order an 
inquiry into the amounts already paid to the French manufacturer 
in December. 
  A warning shot from Brussels? Tomorrow, on the initiative of 
[European Competition Commissioner] Karel Van Miert, the 
European Commission is expected to block the payment of a 
Fr2.5-billion grant earmarked by the French Government for 1994. 
This is a serious hindrance to the recapitalization of the 
state-owned group -- an overall Fr8.6 billion bill agreed to 
last November. In addition to the state, capital subscribers 
include France Telecom (Fr1.6 billion) and NEC [Nippon 
Electronics Company] (Fr0.4 billion). In the meantime, an 
inquiry into the Fr6.1 billion already received by Bull last 
December will be opened by Brussels. The procedure will also 
entail looking at the Fr2.5-billion advance made in February 
1993 by Pierre Beregovoy's government. 
  The French state has now been warned. It must comply with 
Brussels' demands within a month. Although the government is 
eager to rescue the computer manufacturer, it may have to 
contend with opposition from the European Commission. The 
latter considers it has already shown flexibility. "We could 
have blocked the grants allocated in December, but we did not 
wish to put pressure on the French Government," it says. Today, 
the Commission is no longer in an accommodating mood. It says 
it has been waiting over a year for the business plan required 
for its investigation. During this period, Karel Van Miert met 
six times with French Industry minister Gerard Longuet. 
However, the documents submitted by Bull and the French state 
"are mere outlines and do not show details," it is said in 
Brussels. 
  "We provided the Commission with the elements needed to 
demonstrate our determination to reorganize the company. 
Furthermore, the aid we received in December only amounted to 
Fr5.5 billion," Bull says. "How can we let everyone know about 
Bull's five-year strategy?" adds a senior public servant. As 
for the Industry Ministry, it considers it has given Brussels 
clear enough indications as to the changes implemented in the 
computer manufacturer. "A new man from the private sector at 
the helm of the group, recapitalization as the only financial 
intervention, and projected privatization: This should be 
enough." 
  In any case, the figures released by trade unions yesterday 
as to Bull's standing are not likely to reassure Brussels. 
According to the unions, there was a sharp drop in the group's 
operating result in 1993 (a Fr3.2-billion loss as compared to a 
Fr642-million loss the previous year). Sales have allegedly 
fallen down 7 percent to Fr28 billion. These estimates are 
"totally erroneous" according to Bull management. Still, Bull 
and Brussels are now locked in a thoroughly inauspicious 
wrestling match.

<F P=106> [Report signed "spu": "Fasslabend: Contacts With NATO Will </F>
Be Intensified"] 
  [Text] Austria is to intensify its existing contacts with 
NATO and the Western European Union [WEU]. This was announced 
by Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend in an interview with 
SALZBURGER NACHRICHTEN on Tuesday [25 October]. 
  Already at this point, a military attache is working at the 
Austrian mission in Brussels. In the future, a liaison officer 
will also be sent there, Fasslabend stated. However, it is not 
yet clear whether this liaison officer will only be responsible 
for NATO contacts or also for contacts with the WEU. 
  For Austria, the Partnership for Peace offer is less 
significant than for those states of the former Warsaw Pact that 
are interested in NATO membership. However, with a view to 
peacekeeping missions and disaster relief operations, the 
contacts with NATO will assume increasing importance. Thus, as 
early as the end of 1993, an international exercise took place 
near Wiener Neustadt. 
  There is a growing possibility that the United Nations or 
European bodies might ask NATO to carry out such missions. If 
Austria wants to participate, close contact with NATO at a 
technical level is unavoidable, the defense minister pointed 
out. Yet this also requires more personnel.

  [Text] Today, at the Wullowitz border checkpoint near 
Freistadt, Upper Austria, 70 Czech UN soldiers on their way back 
from the former Yugoslavia were stopped. 
  The suspicion that they had arms with them was substantiated 
when their two buses were searched. A total of six hand 
grenades and one pistol were found. By evening, 67 UN soldiers 
could continue their journey home; three others are still being 
interrogated. 
  Inquiries so far have led to the conclusion that the three 
soldiers probably took the weapons with them only as "souvenirs" 
of their mission in the former Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Gottfried Kuessel, the "leader </F>
of Austrian right-wing extremists," by Otto Tuma in the Stein 
Prison in Krems; date not given: "The Voice of the Leader"] 
  [Text] The politicians will be dragged out of Parliament by 
a frenzied mass of people and be hanged on lampposts along 
Vienna's Ringstrasse street. This retribution will be terrible, 
the inflammatory speaker in his olive-green "leisure suit" said 
to his circle of crypto-Teutons in front of a blazing bonfire, 
calling for "different" times. 
  The "terrible visionary," neo-Nazi leader Gottfried Kuessel, 
35, who has been imprisoned since 7 January 1992, was sentenced 
to the minimum term of 10 years imprisonment for neo-Nazi 
activities. Now the state prosecutor has appealed the verdict 
and is calling for a more severe sentence. In view of the 
letter-bomb attacks -- friends of Kuessel were arrested after 
the series of attacks -- officers of the state police searched 
cell West E 27 in the high-security wing of the Krems/Stein 
prison, the current address of the neo-Nazi leader. More than 
500 letters were confiscated in the secret nighttime action on 
the instructions of the state prosecutor. 
  This is the first interview Kuessel gave after the terrible 
series of bomb attacks. His lawyer, Dr. Otto Tuma, asked the 
would-be Teuton the questions on behalf of WIENER, making a 
verbatim record of Kuessel's answers. 
  WIENER emphasizes that we do not identify ourselves with the 
statements of Gottfried Kuessel in the following interview. 
  [Tuma] Mr. Kuessel, you are in the hospital wing of Stein 
prison. What is your health situation? 
  [Kuessel] The gallstones that developed while I was in 
prison were not only not treated in the Vienna Landesgericht 
Prison, but completely wrongly diagnosed, which resulted in 
permanent bilious attacks since early 1993. As far as I can 
see, the problem has been solved now through an operation. 
  [Tuma] You have been imprisoned for two years. Describe one 
day in Stein prison. 
  [Kuessel] At the moment, I am in the high-security wing and 
do odd chores in the house. This means that between 0700 and 
1500 I work in the house. The time after work and before I go 
to bed is generally dedicated to study, to work on my files, and 
to read and write letters. 
  [Tuma] What are you reading at the moment? 
  [Kuessel] Wisnewski/Landgreber/Sieker's The RAF 
Phantom, Eibl-Eibesfeldt's Man, the Risky 
Being, The Baghavadgita, and computer books. 
  [Tuma] Are you still in contact with your friends, maybe 
through letters? Also with those in prison? 
  [Kuessel] At the moment, that is to say for about one month, 
my correspondence has been interrupted for dubious reasons. I 
hardly receive any mail. I assume that the letters are 
deliberately withheld from me by some authorities. Moreover, in 
a search of my cell, all my letters, which had to pass through 
the censors anyway, were confiscated for dubious reasons; all 
that happened despite the fact that my contact with friends and 
acquaintances is limited largely to private and philosophical 
questions. 
  [Tuma] You get regular letters from your friends in Germany. 
What are the contents of these letters? 
  [Kuessel] As I said, these letters are exclusively of a 
private or philosophical nature. 
  [Tuma] Which of your friends in Germany have not 
disappointed you, and which have? 
  [Kuessel] I did not expect anything special from any of my 
acquaintances and friends, which is why nobody could disappoint 
me. Since a central organization has been a dream that was 
dreamt up mainly by the media, but also by the authorities, and 
is to be maintained at any cost and regardless of the truth, and 
is, thus, to be made a reality in public, I did not expect much 
from anyone. 
  [Tuma] What was your first thought when you learned of the 
letter-bomb attacks? 
  [Kuessel] That somebody is presently trying to work against 
the natural developments in the 1994 election year! 
  [Tuma] Do you personally see any connection between your 
arrest and the letter bombs? 
  [Kuessel] No, because I do not think that the people I know 
were able to carry out such attacks, and any protests would 
certainly have been held as early as September or October 1993. 
Apart from the immediate victims of the attacks, those who are 
affected are only national and politically "correct" groups. 
This should have been obvious to anybody who ever studied the 
theory of the issue of individual terror. The Austrian 
population understands such attacks only to a very limited 
degree and certainly does not support them. Therefore, I think 
the forces behind these letter bombs are interested in the 
defamation of the political opposition in Austria and want to 
act against political opponents even with the methods of a 
police state. The violent actions of the authorities against 
persons from rightist and national circles, and the request for 
even farther reaching legal possibilities, show clear parallels 
with the actions of the FRG authorities against the left in the 
1970's. People with courage should try and consistently think 
through the question of who benefits from that. 
  [Tuma] What would you personally tell Vienna Mayor Helmut 
Zilk, who was severely injured by a letter bomb? 
  [Kuessel] Personal talks should remain personal, although 
the basic tenor is certainly that physical violence against 
political opponents, irrespective of where they come from and 
how they represent themselves, is unacceptable. 
  [Tuma] How would you describe your current role and position 
in your so-called community of people? With the same 
convictions? 
  [Kuessel] I am a political prisoner -- nothing else! 
  [Tuma] What aspects, what political positions do you see in 
a different light now that you have been in prison for two years? 
  [Kuessel] The suppression of those who think different 
politically has been stepped up, and we are further away than 
ever from implementing the principle, which at the beginning 
stood for development toward political freedom, and was defined 
by Rousseau: "I shall fight against your opinion as severely as 
I can, but I shall also fight for your right to articulate it." 
  [Tuma] Did you make any mistakes? 
  [Kuessel] In retrospect one is always wiser. With what I 
know today, I would certainly have reacted differently to 
certain things. However, considering the situation in which I 
was at the time, I hardly ever had any choice to act differently 
from the way I did. 
  [Tuma] What do you think of people such as Franz Radl, both 
junior and senior, Peter Binder, Alexander Wolfert, and Gerhard 
Endres? (those persons were arrested after the series of 
letter-bomb attacks last year -- the editors) 
  [Kuessel] I consider those whom I know to be politically 
minded people who would not carry out acts of terrorism! Most 
of those people you mentioned have been under public observation 
for some time and are aware of it. 
  On the other hand, they are all intelligent enough to know 
it. Thus, I think I can rule out that even one of my friends has 
had anything to do with the letter bombs. 
  [Tuma] Who are the "most promising" brains in your movement? 
Are they Bela Althans, Christian Worch, or Arnulf Priem? 
(Althans, Worch, and Priem are among the leaders of the German 
neo-Nazi scene -- WIENER editor's note) 
  [Kuessel] Since there was and, as far as I know, there is no 
"movement," I think it is a waste of time to think about this 
question. Apart from those who you mentioned, there are enough 
other intelligent, interesting personalities in Europe, the 
names of whom are well-known and who can speak for themselves. 
  [Tuma] The Russian nationalists were the clear winners of 
the parliamentary election. Does this circumstance have any 
influence on your or similar movements? 
  [Kuessel] The developments in Russia are interesting from a 
geopolitical point of view, and I think it is advisable not to 
isolate the Liberal Democratic Party in terms of foreign policy, 
but to take the desire of so many Russian voters into 
consideration and conduct talks with the representatives of this 
party for the prosperous development of all peoples on the basis 
of political and economic independence. 
  [Tuma] An indiscrete question: After such a long time in 
prison, what is the relationship with your girlfriend like? 
  [Kuessel] You are right, this is an indiscrete question that 
I do not want to answer indiscreetly. What unites me and my 
fiancee is not a "relationship," or "affair," or "partnership," 
but love. This love has been strained by the unfortunate 
circumstances. Nevertheless, I trust in this love! 
  [Tuma] What are your plans for your life after prison? 
  [Kuessel] Considering the length of time, I cannot really 
speak of plans. Nevertheless, I am "using" the time behind bars 
to study, study, and study to prepare for any eventualities 
after my release. Many prisoners leave prison and are fully 
dependent on the state. 
  I am planning to take life into my own hands -- whenever, 
wherever, and under whatever circumstances!

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jean-Pierre Stroobants: "True and False </F>
Lessons Drawn From the `Affair'"] 
  [Text] Guy Coeme who, two weeks ago, produced a defense 
statement stressing the difficulties of applying the measures 
for the referral of a minister to the Court of Appeal, at noon 
on Tuesday 25 January asked for the referral to be made to this 
same court. This will be the final episode in a strange defense 
action which, when all is said and done, will have had the 
effect of confirming suspicions. The former deputy prime 
minister repeated yesterday, in every possible way, his 
innocence and his desire to defend himself. We have already 
heard this from him many times, at least where the method of 
allocating the Agusta contract is concerned. Now, however, 
attention has been focused on a specific point -- the 
commissions that are supposed to have been paid to the Socialist 
Party [PS] (or should we say the Socialist Parties, the national 
and Liege groups?) that the ex-minister claims he never saw, 
thus contradicting the members of his own "family." 
  Now all we can hope for is that the rules applied will 
enable 
Guy Coeme to explain his case once and for all, on every point, 
and then leave Justice to finish what it started. 
  Nothing would be worse than if this dossier were to be 
"buried," stifled in the procedural maze or the tangle of party 
politics. 
  The dangers of this affair have been underlined, with its 
possible link with the murder of a minister of state. It could 
still undermine the government or strengthen the rejection of 
politics by the public as it stands today. The triggering of a 
governmental crisis moreover would make it possible to check "in 
vivo" the depth of this feeling, fed by the outpourings from the 
PS. 
  These are real dangers. However, there is something even 
more important which will prove only too well the crucial nature 
of current events. The real risk for the political sphere will 
be if it fails to learn the lessons, the many lessons, to be 
drawn from the current situation. 
  A number of officials, including Coeme, are aiming their 
criticisms today toward the media which, if we are to believe 
them, is collectively responsible for deviations, false 
disclosures, and errors. We do not deny that certain elements 
have been responsible for damaging exaggerations. However, 
without playing the role of judge and jury, we would ask those 
assigned the mission of government not to draw from the Agusta 
affair the sole conclusion that the press should be regulated. 
Now there are many other things that need to be considered by 
all those who, in the PS and elsewhere, are truly convinced of 
the need to reconcile morality with public life.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Christian Democrats Put Bukman and </F>
Hirsch Ballin Lower on Parliamentary Electoral List"] 
  [Text] CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] members have 
placed Justice Minister E. Hirsch Ballin and Agriculture 
Minister P. Bukman lower down the list of parliamentary 
candidates than was proposed by the party committee. Economic 
Affairs State Secretary Y. van Rooy now has the second place 
after Brinkman, who is top of the list. 
  CDA circles blame Bukman's drop from sixth to eleventh place 
on the problems encountered in convincing the rank and file of 
the need to modify agriculture policies. "The change shows the 
problems in farming and agriculture," a spokesman said. 
  In the run-up to the decision on the candidates, it was long 
unclear whether the CDA Women's Council would succeed in placing 
its "candidate," State Secretary Y. Van Rooy, in second place. 
What could not be achieved at the party committee meeting in 
November -- Van Rooy got third place there -- has now been 
realized successfully. 
  Other female candidates in the first 20 positions, like M. 
Soutendijk and A. Doelman-Pel, have climbed a few places as 
well. F. Walters, tipped as a possible leader of the 
parliamentary party, has dropped two places from five to seven. 
  State Secretary Heerma, who has criticized the style of 
Brinkman, the leading candidate, has climbed three places and 
now has the fifth position. The party spokesman pointed out 
that the members had indicated their preferences before Heerma 
expressed his criticism in the VRIJ NEDERLAND weekly magazine. 
The leaking of the notorious letter from Bukman to Minister 
Andriessen on agricultural tariffs also dates from after that 
deadline.

  [Text] Brussels ROMPRES, 27/1/1994 -- After an interview 
with NATO Deputy General-Secretary Amedeo de Franchis on 26 
January, Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu stated to a 
ROMPRES correspondent that a general exchange of opinions was 
made on the occasion regarding "security in southeast Europe, 
the prospects opened by the Partnership for Peace (PFP), as well 
as its contribution brought to stability in the mentioned area 
and to Romania's stability." 
  "We also approached the issue regarding the concurrent 
support that we wish to gain from the alliance for the 
elaboration of the necessary documents regarding our offer of 
participation in the Partnership for Peace and I may say that 
the answer was extremely positive and determined," Melescanu 
said. 
  The Romanian top diplomat also added that consultations were 
already held regarding "technicalities and administrative 
issues" related to the future appointment (under the 
Partnership's provisions) of liaison active officers with the 
alliance headquarters and with "the gray cell" of the 
Partnership for Peace headquartered at Mons.

<F P=106> [Victoria Brittain report: "UN Peacekeepers Criticised for </F>
`Neglecting Human Rights'"] 
  [Text] The credibility of United Nations peacekeeping 
operations is being undermined by the forces' neglect of human 
rights violations, according to a report by Amnesty 
International. 
  "It is essential that human rights are made an intrinsic 
part 
of all peacekeeping activities," the report says. It was 
released today in Mozambique, one of the countries where UN 
peacekeepers have a weak mandate, according to Amnesty. 
  The report contrasts two countries where human rights 
monitoring was made part of the UN mandate -- El Salvador and 
Cambodia -- with six African countries where it is minimal, 
inconsistent or non-existent. In Somalia, Angola, Western 
Sahara, Liberia, Rwanda and Mozambique the neglect of human 
rights has led to disaster or at best stalemate, the report says. 
  "In some operations human rights have been ignored and UN 
personnel have stood by, silent, while serious violations were 
taking place.... That must not be allowed to continue." 
  The report condemns the UN's failure to denounce such abuses 
as Unita's refusal to release prisoners held in Jamba, or the 
Moroccan government's blocking of investigations into 
"disappeared" Saharawis. In Angola, Amnesty believes the UN's 
lack of response to peace pact violations in the run-up to the 
election contributed to UNITA's contempt for the peace process 
and the return to war. 
  Amnesty calls for the principle established in the former 
Yugoslavia -- of all UN bodies having a duty to provide human 
rights information -- to be applied universally. 
  The report cites Sudan as an "urgent humanitarian challenge" 
and says UN agencies should monitor and demand compliance with 
international human rights and humanitarian law standards by all 
sides, rather than keeping quiet to ensure access to populations 
in need. "This cannot be avoided in the name of 
humanitarianism," the report says in a paragraph which will be 
controversial with aid agencies. 
  Among the report's proposals is the appointment in Angola of 
a UN human rights commissioner, and for on-site monitors in 
Iraq, an idea endorsed both by the special rapporteur on Iraq, 
Max van der Stoel, and the UN General Assembly.

  [Text] Florence, 19 Jan (ANSA) -- Italy continues to work 
for the release of Kuwaitis still held prisoner in Iraq three 
years after the end of the Gulf War. 
  The commitment was reiterated today by Luigi Amaduzzi, 
diplomatic advisor to Italian Head of State Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro, in a reply to a letter received on the occasion of the 
45th anniversary of the Human Rights Charter, from the president 
of the Italy-Kuwait Association, Pierandrea Vanni. The 
association's letter sought to bring to the attention of the 
head of state the problem of around 800 Kuwaiti prisoners still 
held illegally in Iraqi territory despite the fact the war in 
the area is over. 
  The Italian government has closely followed the evolution of 
this "tragic inheritance" of the Gulf War and has worked, in all 
opportune forums, to find a solution to the problem, according 
to Amaduzzi in his reply. He went on to say that Iraqi 
officials must understand the compelling need to respect basic 
human rights. 
  The Italy-Kuwait Association was formed in Florence two 
years 
ago.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Negotiations on Cooperation </F>
Agreement With Russia Expected To Be Relaunched"; as released by 
Brussels TEXTLINE database] 
  [Text] Since the signing of the EC/Russia political 
statement on 9 December (for which Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin came to Brussels in person), negotiations between the EC 
and Russia on the conclusion of a partnership and cooperation 
agreement have known a period of reduced activity. A meeting of 
experts planned for the end of December in Moscow has been 
postponed (Russian sources indicate that it should take place 
end January) and the initialing of the final agreement could, 
say well-informed sources, take place toward the end of March. 
This development does not correspond to the optimistic scenario 
described by politicians on both sides at the signing of the 
political statement when not only the president in office of the 
European Council, Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, but 
also the president of the Commission, Jacques Delors, had 
announced that an agreement would be signed in the next few 
days. Relaunching negotiations was the central topic of talks 
that the Russian Ambassador to the EC, Mr. Silaew, had on Monday 
[17 January] and Tuesday with the vice-president of the European 
Commission, Mr. Christophersen, with Sir Leon Brittan and also 
with Mr. Benavides of the DG-I [Directorate General I -- 
external relations]. EUROPE believes that the reasons for the 
present break are both technical and political, given that: 
  (a) Fundamental divergence persists, notably in the nuclear 
field (in particular concerning the rules and provisions to 
govern the trade of uranium between the EC and Russia), maritime 
transport and access to the banking market (where Russia calls 
for a transition period). As regards the nuclear question (by 
far the most tricky question), France insists for trade 
questions to be governed by a separate accord between the EC and 
Russia, in this case the EURATOM agreement (negotiated 18 months 
ago with Russia but never completed) which would give the EC 
more possibilities for acting in connection with over-large 
import flows or dumping practices in the trade of enriched 
uranium. The 11 other member states, the Commission and Russian 
authorities hope to include this chapter in the cooperation 
agreement. It seems that the Commission recently submitted a 
compromise solution to Russian authorities. It is now awaiting 
Moscow's reply; 
  (b) After the parliamentary elections in Russia in December 
and given the political and staffing changes that have taken 
place within the Russian Government, the EC expects the 
situation will become more stable and that its interlocutors in 
negotiations will be clearly identified; 
  (c) Further to the real "forcing" by negotiators before and 
during Mr. Yeltsin's stay in Brussels (mainly in order to make 
it possible to sign the statement), the Twelve needed time for 
reflection in order to examine results obtained in detail.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/42: "EU Supports Payment and </F>
Clearing Systems in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus"] 
  [Text] Assistance to countries of the former USSR under the 
TACIS [Technical Assistance to CIS] program took a major step 
forward last week with the signing of a contract for nearly ECU2 
million to provide expert advice for the modernization of their 
payment and clearing systems. The main beneficiary is the 
Central Bank of Russia, but substantive assistance is also being 
provided for a new institution, the Inter State Bank, and for 
the central banks of Ukraine and Belarus. The contractor is a 
Spanish-British consortium led by the Sema group of Spain. 
  Despite initiatives to combat fraud, organize clearing 
houses, reduce delays and improve payment security, considerable 
problems remain in the payment systems of the NIS [newly 
independent states] countries. It can still take several weeks 
until a payment is made between, for example, Vladivostok and 
St. Petersburg. This inhibits the development of trade both 
within the countries as well as between the NIS. In particular, 
the lack of a multilateral clearing institution between the NIS 
central banks has been seen as a major deficiency and has led to 
the setting up of an Inter State Bank to serve this purpose. 
These problems are moreover associated with a worrying lack of 
transparency on the net position of credits and liabilities 
between banks, and between banks and their customers, implying 
possible hidden insolvency problems. Meanwhile, private 
individuals continue to distrust the banking system. 
  Not surprisingly therefore, modernization and upgrading of 
the NIS payment and clearing systems has been seen as a priority 
in designing technical assistance to strengthen the NIS central 
banks. The Commission earmarked funds for this purpose as part 
of wider efforts to assist the NIS central banks. The 
assistance is being delivered in close cooperation with other 
donors and NIS central banks. The assistance to the Russian 
Central Bank is being coordinated under the aegis of an 
international steering committee comprising the Commission, the 
IMF, other multilateral financing institutions and cooperating 
Western central banks, (Banque de France, Deutsche Bundesbank, 
Bank of England, U.S. Federal Reserve) and the OECD. 
  In more detail, the TACIS assistance aims: 
  i) To strengthen the capacity of the Central Bank of Russia 
to formulate and implement reform policy initiatives by 
providing a pool of highly qualified European payment system 
experts to the beneficiary institutions; 
  ii) to provide training and expert assistance during the 
start-up phase of the Inter State Bank whose task is to put in 
place and manage an efficient interstate payment system among 
the NIS; and 
  iii) to help the central banks of Ukraine and Belarus to 
cooperate successfully in making an improved interstate payment 
system work. In this regard, assistance to the Central Bank of 
Belarus will naturally take account of the recent agreement with 
Russia on monetary unification.

foreign minister and president of the Council of the [European]

Commission to negotiate an association agreement with Lithuania 
as soon as possible. "The support of the presidency of the 
European Union" to this effect "would be of great importance for 
the future prosperity of Lithuania, as well as for the stability 
and security of the whole Baltic region," the letter states. It 
will be recalled that the Twelve found the negotiating 
directives proposed by the European Commission for the Baltic 
states to be too limited and have expressed the intention of 
going further in creating closer ties with these countries.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Nuclear Safety -- Development of EU </F>
Assistance to East Europe and Ex-USSR"; as released by Brussels 
TEXTLINE database] 
  [Text] In conjunction with President Clinton's talks in 
Brussels and Moscow, the European Commission has made a point of 
recalling the essential role the EC plays within international 
efforts to boost nuclear safety in East Europe and the former 
USSR. Information provided by the Commission reveals the 
following: 
  (a) Following the G-7 meeting in Munich in July 1992 (which 
should be considered the starting point of international 
assistance to improve nuclear safety because it gave rise to a 
multilateral action program and the decision in principle to 
create a multilateral fund of 700 million dollars), the EC 
accepted responsibility for coordinating implementation of the 
program agreed in Munich within the G-24. In early 1993, work 
to create the multilateral fund was concluded and its 
administration has been entrusted to the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development [EBRD]. Since the implementation 
of the Munich action program, a total of 506 assistance programs 
have been listed in the G-24 data bank, involving 16 donors 
(including the European Union), five international organizations 
and 15 beneficiary countries. These 506 programs involve a 
total of ECU461.25 million, of which more than 60 percent is 
provided directly by the EC (through its PHARE [Economic 
Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] and TACIS [CIS 
Technical Assistance] programs) and by the member states; 
  (b) Regarding the organization of implementation of the 
Munich action program, the EC has contributed to a large measure 
in the achievement of several positive results, in particular: 
  - three working groups (Kozloduy, Training and Civil 
Liability) are fully operational, while three other issues 
(Slovakia, RMBK and Regulatory Authorities) are being handled in 
ad hoc working groups; 
  - institutional arrangements are fully operational (the 
Plenary Group meets twice a year and the Steering Committee four 
times a year). A secretariat has been established with the 
status of an independent unit within Directorate-General XI of 
the European Commission (it comprises European civil servants 
and national experts from Germany, Belgium, France, Japan, 
United Kingdom and Russia); 
  - the data bank has reached an advanced state of development 
and is now being used by the secretariat and members of the G-24 
as a tool for the administration of bilateral and multilateral 
cooperation. The system will be perfected soon so as to make 
distance access possible. Moreover, the secretariat's missions 
in Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgaria have made it possible to 
incorporate the data bank into national programs for the 
improvement of safety being developed in these countries without 
Western assistance; 
  - information on projects underway is provided by means of a 
quarterly publication (NUSAC News). 
  (c) In addition to participation in decisionmaking and 
multilateral fund management bodies, the EC has established 
close technical cooperation between the G-24 secretariat and the 
EBRD secretariat (meetings are held regularly in Brussels). The 
Commission notes that this cooperation has already proved 
productive regarding the case of the nuclear power station in 
Kozloduy (Bulgaria), with approval of an initial project 
totalling ECU25 million on which the G-24 Kozloduy working group 
has issued a favorable technical opinion. An identical 
procedure is underway for the Ignalina station in Lithuania and 
will be used subsequently for a number of projects in Russia. 
  (d) Regarding the outlook for 1994, a stepped-up effort will 
be made to improve coordination of aid to beneficiary countries 
in the area of legal matters so as to establish international 
confidence facilitating the exchange of know-how. Two specific 
aspects will be the focus of this initiative: 
  - the development of an appropriate framework in terms of 
civil liability to enable Western suppliers to more easily 
deliver equipment and material. The G-24 ad hoc group on civil 
liability will continue providing follow-up to national 
developments in nuclear law and will continue its contacts with 
the nuclear industry and the insurance sector; 
  - the development of legislation on intellectual property.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/43: "Nuclear Security and </F>
Efficiency in East Europe"; as released by Brussels RAPID 
database] 
  [Text] Commission Vice President Henning Christophersen 
welcomed the adoption by the European Parliament yesterday of a 
project which will contribute to financing the improvement of 
the safety and efficiency of nuclear sites in the countries of 
Central and East Europe as well as in the Republics of the 
former USSR. 
  The Commission proposal will allow a total of ECU1.1 billion 
in EURATOM loans to be earmarked for this project. 
  The vice president stressed that the text adopted by the 
(European) Parliament confirms that the Parliament as well as 
the Commission deem improving nuclear safety a priority. 
According to Mr. Christophersen, a political consensus has 
already been reached within the Council. Quick approval of the 
decision, which will make the program operational, is expected, 
and the efforts already made within the framework of the PHARE 
[Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] and TACIS 
[CIS Technical Assistance] programs thus will be enhanced. 
  The proposal is in line with the conclusions of the European 
Council of Lisbon in June 1992. 
  The decision will be implemented in cooperation with the 
European Bank for Investment, which will assess the projects in 
economic and financial terms. 
  According to the vice president, this decision will make it 
possible for the Commission to initiate an important program in 
line with its priorities in the field of security, environmental 
protection, and foreign relations.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikki Tait: "Australia-UK Relations Not Just </F>
History"] 
  [Text] Australia's sunny shores have suddenly been swamped 
again by the British. Prince Charles touched down in Sydney on 
Monday [24 January] with a royal entourage and 40 journalists. 
Later this week, a trade delegation, led by Mr Michael 
Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, flies into 
Melbourne, accompanied by two other UK trade missions. 
  The British parties are being given a high-level reception. 
Mr Keating, with his beaming but non-curtseying wife, turned 
out to greet Prince Charles, and the Australian prime minister 
will deliver a keynote speech to a conference on UK-Australian 
trade. This raises the question of whether such attention is 
just residual politeness, or whether -- from a commercial 
viewpoint, at least --the countries still have something to 
offer each other. 
  On the trade front, the relationship has undergone some 
fundamental changes in the past 30 years. Britain has thrown 
its lot in with Europe while Australia has cultivated its Asian 
neighbours. Between 1960 and 1990, the latter's merchandise 
exports to West Europe shrank from 46 per cent of the total to 
just 16 per cent. Today, about 60 per cent of Australia's trade 
is conducted in the Asian region. 
  That said, the two countries' trade ties are not just 
history. Australia sold 2.39 billion Australian dollars worth of 
goods to the UK in 1992/93, a figure which has been increasing 
at a double-digit rate over the past five years, thanks partly 
to the growing popularity of Australian wine. Britain also 
remains the third most important source of imports into 
Australia and the trade balance tilts well in the UK's favour. 
However, the five-year trend in UK merchandise imports is flat. 
  The investment relationship is more interesting. According 
to a report by the Allen Consulting Group, the UK is the 
second-largest investor in Australia after the U.S. and accounts 
for just less than a quarter of total foreign direct investment 
there. 
  As Australian trade officials point out, the nature of that 
investment makes it particularly valuable. About 44 per cent of 
it is in manufacturing. This means that UK companies actually 
outstrip their US counterparts as players in the core industrial 
sector. 
  It is tempting to think of this as an historical relic; 
after 
all, companies such as Pilkington have had Australian 
subsidiaries for a century or more. In reality, a smattering of 
recent deals -- such as Tate &amp; Lyle's 325 million Australian 
dollar purchase of Bundaberg Sugar, or United Biscuits' 
acquisition of Smiths Snackfood -- have sustained the UK's 
relative position, while the U.S. share of foreign investment in 
Australia has slipped and Japan's has grown. 
  The steady deregulation and privatisation of Australian 
industry has also thrown up new opportunities which UK companies 
-- in some cases recently privatised themselves -- have been 
prone to seize. BT's telecommunications contract with the New 
South Wales government or British Airways' minority stake in 
Qantas are cases in point. 
  From an Australian point-of-view, then, the British interest 
holds out the possibility of new capital and, to some extent new 
jobs. At a time when the unemployment rate is in double-digits, 
Japanese investment is at low ebb and the smaller Southeast 
Asian countries have yet to show much interest in placing their 
funds in Australia, this is welcome. 
  Arguments put forward by British trade officials for the 
continuing interest in Australia are more subtle. They like to 
stress the possibility of using the country as a route into the 
Asian markets, a thought which the Australian trade lobby 
eagerly encourages. 
  "There's a comfort level," says David Richard, senior trade 
commissioner at Austrade. He cites the nations' similar legal 
systems, the availability of professional services in Australia, 
the pleasant climate, and so on. 
  For British companies with existing operations in Australia, 
there is some merit in this argument. The Allen report, for 
example, cites the experience of P&amp;O (Australia), whose 
container handling, distribution, catering, maritime and port 
management arms all have expanding interests in Southeast Asia. 
  But for companies seeking to set out a stall in Asia for the 
first time, the merits of the Australian route are more 
debatable, and even British trade officials admit it is a matter 
of "horses for courses." The downside is that, while Sydney or 
Melbourne are within the "Asian time zone," they still face a 
three-hour time difference with most Southeast Asian countries. 
A flight between Sydney and Bangkok, say, takes eight hours. 
  Moreover, while Australia has been moving to reduce its 
tariff barriers, restructure labour market practices, and shed 
its bureaucratic image, this process is not complete. 
  Then there is investment by Australian companies in Britain. 
This has increased sharply over the past decade, after the 
removal of exchange controls, and amounted to about 15.9 billion 
Australian dollars by the end of 1992. A large tranche arrived 
in the late 1980s, when Australian "entrepreneurs" were riding 
high. Nevertheless, Australia's direct investment in Britain has 
risen by a further 6.5 billion Australian dollars over the past 
five years. 
  Few Australian companies have ventured into Europe without 
first securing a British base -- with the result that more than 
70 per cent of Australian investment in Europe is concentrated 
in the UK. 
  There are some signs that this is changing: for example, 
Amcor, the paper group, began its European strategy by building 
a plant in Cambridgeshire, and has subsequently expanded into 
France and Germany. But familiarity, it seems, tends to work 
both ways.

<F P=106> [Chris Blackhurst report: "Britain Gets Secret SAS Base in </F>
Malaysia"] 
  [Text] Britain is to help build a secret special forces 
base in Malaysia under the package which included pumping 234 
million pounds of overseas aid into the Pergau dam project. 
  News of the base will fuel criticism of Pergau, described 
last week as an "abuse" of the aid system by Sir Tim Lankester, 
a former permanent secretary at the Overseas Development 
Administration. The National Audit Office, the public spending 
watchdog, has condemned Pergau as uneconomic and a waste of 
money. 
  John Laing International, the construction company, has 
submitted plans for the site, at Mersing on the east coast, for 
approval by the Malaysian government. The original 
specification for the project comprised submarine docking 
facilities, landing strip, reinforced hangars for Hercules 
transport aircraft and accommodation for up to three battalions 
of special forces. Laing's contract is thought to be worth about 
200 million pounds. 
  As a signatory of the long-standing Five Power Defence 
Arrangement -- with Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand and 
Singapore -- Britain will be able to station troops and 
equipment there during joint exercises. Mersing is also likely 
to play a key strategic role in the region when Britain hands 
Hong Kong back to China in 1997. 
  Details of the project, including the cost and who is paying 
for it, remain confidential. Apart from confirming that a 
report had recently gone to the Malaysian government, a John 
Laing spokesman would say only that "the company has been 
involved in it for several years." A Ministry of Defence 
spokesman said: "We don't discuss special forces operations." 
  However, a former senior executive from Midland Bank, which 
was involved in the financing of the accompanying 1.3 billion 
pound sale of arms to Malaysia, said Mersing was raised at the 
very outset of talks in 1988. "It was on a menu of transactions 
drawn up by the Malaysians. They'd selected a site and they 
wanted our help. It would be operated by the Malaysians but 
would contain our troops when Hong Kong goes." 
  He said that Stephan Kock, a consultant to Midland who also 
advised the Government's Joint Intelligence Committee, was 
"architect of the different strands" of the deal. Mr Kock is 
understood to have visited Malaysia with officials from the MoD 
[Ministry of Defense] and members of the Special Air Services. 
  A defence spokesman at the Malaysian High Commission in 
London was also unwilling to discuss Mersing. Asked if British 
Special Air Services and Special Boat Squadron personnel would 
be based there, he replied, "they could well be." 
  He did, however, confirm that Mersing "was raised in 
discussion for the memorandum of understanding on the 
procurement of defence equipment from Britain." 
  The Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee will decide 
today whether to examine Pergau. Unlike the Public Accounts 
Committee, which last week questioned Sir Tim and is confined to 
quizzing officials, it has the power to call ministers. Douglas 
Hurd and John Major, who over-ruled Sir Tim, are likely to be in 
the firing line. 
  Last night the Government moved to defuse embarrassment by 
claiming Lord Younger, the former Secretary of State for 
Defence, was mistaken in linking aid with arms. 
  Replying to a parliamentary question from Jack Cunningham, 
Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, Mr Hurd said the military 
memorandum signed by Lord Younger "included a reference to `aid 
in support of nonmilitary aspects under this programme.'" 
However, Mr Hurd said, "after consultation with ministerial 
colleagues in London, (Lord Younger) wrote to the Malaysian 
Minister of Finance in June 1988 to say that aid could not be 
linked to defence sales." 
  Mr Cunningham said it was plain that "Lord Younger, who is 
no 
longer in the Government, is being made a scapegoat." He 
maintained the answer showed the governments did discuss linking 
arms deals and aid.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Taking Politics Back to the People"] </F>
  [Text] So it is Back to Basics with Bill Clinton too: and 
the echoes are instructive. Yesterday morning's State of the 
Union was back to the basic pledge of health care reform -- back 
to the basic conundrum of welfare provision; back to the basic, 
visceral fear of crime. A driving domestic agenda from a leader 
who against a backcloth of burgeoning economic recovery, has 
staked his future on profound change to the U.S. body politic. 
  The parallels with B to B British-style are there to be 
drawn. On crime, legislation that pours 15 billion pounds a year 
extra into tougher, broader policing (Michael Howard, eat your 
heart out) and catches headlines for its "three strikes for one" 
proposal to lock up violent offenders for life on their third 
conviction. (A frothy wheeze since, because it applies only to 
federal territory, is most likely only to affect reservation 
Indians and serially-violent sergeants on army bases). On 
welfare (eat your heart out Portillo) the blending of training 
and workfare grows ever closer, with the Michigan model of 
safety nets snipped away after a finite term ever more dominant. 
These are not the ways of J.K. Galbraith. Bill Clinton may be 
a Democrat, but he is not a liberal Democrat -- and the 
policies, mixing tough and tender in new ways, may turn to dust. 
Remember, for instance, that California already spends more on 
its prison system than it does on education. 
  But Clinton cannot be conventionally described in the old 
categories of American politics, any more (much though John 
Smith might wish it) than he can be translated to a British 
context. His approaches to health care reform--the one, 
inescapable mountain he must climb to succeed on his own 
test--have scant ideological connection to his crime policies: 
one a complex revolution involving government expertise, the 
other an abdication of such philosophy. Yet, if there is 
incoherence, it stems directly from the America he leads. 
Clinton won the election, but on a minority of a split vote. He 
is having, in practice, to forge a new coalition: and that means 
building the interest blocs, the things that ordinary people say 
and want, together. Leadership by reconciliation, balance and 
distillation. That has all manner of weaknesses, if only 
because the policies ordinary people want sometimes don't work. 
But it is a process that engages enthusiasm rather than repels 
it. Something active rather than think-tank passive. 
Crucially, it looks to a better future rather than invoking a 
golden past. And when Clinton yesterday openly acknowledged the 
limits of government action, when he set "family, school, church 
and community" far ahead as agents of change, perhaps he defined 
why his B to B stands more chances than the Downing Street 
version. He knows American government is distrusted and often 
reviled. He preaches passionately--but not from personal 
example. The message is people-based, not politician- based: 
because those are the hearts and minds he must capture.

<F P=106> [Article by Lurek Martin: "Tough-Talker Clinton Slays the </F>
`Naysayers'"] 
  [Text] If giving speeches were all there was to 
government, and if the U.S. constitution allowed it, Ronald 
Reagan would have been elected president-for-life -- and so, on 
Tuesday [25 January] night's form, might Bill Clinton. In fact 
there was quite a lot of the old Republican gunslinger in the 
first official State of the Union address by the self-proclaimed 
"new kind of Democrat." 
  The call-to-arms for a better America, with or without the 
assistance of Congress, and the brandishing of his pen as he 
threatened to veto any healthcare legislation that did not 
provide universal insurance coverage were borrowed from the 
Reagan handbook. So too were the acknowledgement of ordinary 
(and not so ordinary) people in the public galleries and the 
artful seating at either side of Mrs Hillary Clinton of Jack 
Smith, head of General Motors, and Lane Kirkland, the trade 
union leader. 
  Critics might also complain that the 64-minute speech was 
too 
long, yet short on new proposals, especially on the revived 
promise to "end welfare as we know it." Foreigners might lament 
that its external passage was both perfunctory and predictable 
and Republicans that the president keeps stealing their clothes. 
  But reservations must be placed in context. The State of the 
Union address offers all presidents a stage and -- for a 
Democrat, old or new, welcomed by a Democratic Congress -- an 
audience guaranteed to applaud often and loudly. And it found 
Mr Clinton in vintage missionary form on his favourite subject, 
domestic reform. The country, he concluded in ringing tones, "is 
growing stronger but it must be stronger still." 
  It was tough for the opposition to muster an effective 
immediate response. Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, 
speaking woodenly from his office without the benefit of 
partisan cheering, could only proclaim that there was no 
healthcare crisis, and complain about higher taxes. 
  Potentially far more revealing, though still to be 
approached 
with a degree of cynicism, was the reaction of Congressman Newt 
Gingrich of Georgia, the firebrand conservative. "There is a 
potential, if this speech was sincere, for a remarkable 
coalition that could pass a lot of stuff," especially on crime 
and welfare. He added approvingly that Mr Clinton was now 
talking his kind of language. 
  This, indeed, was the political message of the address. Mr 
Clinton drew his line in the sand, insisted that an improving 
economy was no excuse for delaying more reform and gave the 
distinct impression that he did not care from which side of the 
political aisle he derived support for his crusade. But he 
warned, too, that the body politic was ultimately accountable to 
the public -- "those who hold our feet to the fire." 
  Americans, he said, would not heed the siren songs of the 
special vested interests and the "naysayers who fear we will not 
be equal to the challenges of our time and who misread our 
history, our heritage and even today's headlines." 
  There were micro-political messages, too. The president's 
promise to bring in soon substantive proposals to change the 
welfare system and explicitly to link this with healthcare 
reform was a clear nod in the direction of Senator Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who chairs the Senate 
finance committee. 
  The senator, an intellectual, if temperamental, original in 
this Congress, has become miffed with the administration. He 
has declared, like Senator Dole, that there is no healthcare 
crisis and threatened to make trouble for the health proposals 
if his welfare hobby horse was relegated in priority -- which is 
precisely what the White House intended at the start of this 
year. 
  At least he was satisfied with Mr Clinton's commitment on 
Tuesday night, though as the president went on to expound with 
much greater passion on the imperative of healthcare reform he 
can have been left in little doubt where the Clinton heart lies. 
  But this, too, had a political need. The momentum for 
changes in healthcare, accelerated by the rapturously received 
presidential address to Congress last September, has slowed over 
the last two months. Other issues such as Nafta, gun control 
and Mr Clinton's European trip have intruded while the insurance 
and medical professions have begun to launch effective 
propaganda campaigns. It had become incumbent on Mr Clinton to 
regain the initiative. 
  His ecumenical side was also in evidence in the coda to his 
address on crime and on the responsibility of individuals to 
make communities safer. 
  Much of what he said appeals to conservatives -- mandatory 
sentencing for violent offenders, more police on the streets, 
the restoration of family values -- but some, specifically the 
calls for ever tighter gun control, does not. 
  Violent crime is now a perennial political issue. Every 
president since Lyndon Johnson has attacked it and Congress 
loves to debate it, though the effect of the efforts of both may 
be questioned, not least because conservatives and liberals have 
rarely agreed on the right prescriptions. 
  But at least the Senate last year passed, by 95 votes to 
four, an omnibus crime bill that now awaits action by the House, 
while both chambers approved waiting limits for purchasers of 
handguns. This measure was now the Brady Law, Mr Clinton said 
with pride as he clapped Mr James Brady, the former presidential 
press secretary, who from his wheelchair in the galleries 
proudly waved his walking stick back in return. 
  There is always a risk of overloading Congress, especially 
in 
the run-up to midterm elections. It is possible now that 
fixation with crime will make harder action on health and 
welfare reform both immensely complicated and controversial, as 
well as other items on the president's heavy agenda such as 
worker retraining, campaign finance reform, more controls on 
lobbyists and the creation of an information superhighway. 
  But, from his Tuesday night pulpit, Mr Clinton was brooking 
no delay. "Our deepest and most profound problems" could not be 
left to "petty political fighting." If words were all--and he 
used them very well--he would be home and dry. But not 
yesterday, as his doctors ordered him to rest a voice that 
barely lasted the 64 minutes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Clinton Cracks Down on Crime"] </F>
  [Text] Bill Clinton could hang a new sign on his wall to 
keep his mind on the main issue, as he did during his election 
campaign. This one would read "It's crime, stupid." For while 
the news on the economy gets better every day, crime gets worse. 
It now easily tops the list of issues that most concern the 
public. 
  In his State of the Union message on Tuesday [25 January] 
night, he spoke strongly of how "violent crime and the fear it 
provokes are crippling our society, limiting personal freedom, 
and fraying the ties that bind us." He has recognised that it 
preoccupies not only the middle and upper classes but most of 
the population, including especially the black communities that 
are in the thick of it. 
  He also sees that his response must cut across the political 
spectrum, dealing with both causes and symptoms, prevention and 
punishment. In this he speaks for the modernising element in 
the Democratic Party that is anxious to shed both its welfare 
liberalism and the trendy, individualistic radicalism of the 
Sixties, both of which are now widely felt to have undermined 
the traditional fabric of American society. 
  There is a tactical element in this, too. Mr Clinton needs 
to win back the working- and middle-class Democrats who voted 
for Ronald Reagan and are still hesitant about supporting his 
own presidency. Indeed, parts of his speech could have been 
lifted straight from Mr Reagan. He promised more policemen and 
tougher punishments, induding life sentences for those who 
commit three violent offences. This may raise doubts among 
experts who will ask why rehabilitation should be abandoned 
after three offences, but it will go down well among voters, 
especially those wanting reassurance that Mr Clinton is not at 
heart a traditional liberal. 
  He should also win wide support for his rather less specific 
"community empowerment agenda," designed to counter the 
breakdown of community, family and the work ethic, and his call 
for something suspiciously like back to basics: parental 
responsibility, education and teaching children to "obey the 
law, respect our neighbours and cherish our values." 
  But he also acknowledged the left by calling for partial gun 
control, job creation and more money for drug treatment and 
universal health care. He will need every ounce of political 
support he can raise for his health-care programme because it 
will be the central test of his presidency. 
  The speech thus confirms his determination to be a strong 
reforming president, building on a legislative record that is 
already impressive. Given his rising popularity as the economy 
grows and the deficit shrinks, he now looks in a strong position 
to push through a programme of more radical domestic change than 
the United States has seen in many decades, provided he is not 
tripped up by the various scandals that still hover around him. 
If he succeeds, he will also be in a better position to provide 
leadership abroad.

  [Text] Speyer (DPA) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
intends to assist the East European states with integration into 
the Western military alliance NATO. The federal government was 
also committed to creating concrete prospects for membership of 
the European Union, Kinkel said this evening in a speech before 
students at Speyer College of Administration. 
  The West had to support the democratic reforms in Russia to 
secure peace in Europe in the long-term, he said. However, the 
financial support given Russia had long ago reached the limits 
of the budget's capacity. The minister called upon the other 
Western industrial nations to provide greater financial support 
for Russia. 
  In Speyer, Kinkel once again spoke in favor of a permanent 
seat on the UN Security Council for Germany. The German 
Government wanted to play a part in deciding international 
problems that affected Germany. To that end, Germany would have 
to take part in UN military peace missions. It was important 
for the constitutional basis for Bundeswehr missions abroad to 
be established at last.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- The German Bundesbank 
recorded record profits in 1993. Its gross income increased to 
almost 21.4 billion German marks [DM]. The figure is shown in a 
weekly report dated 31 December 1993, which lists the amount of 
DM21.368 billion under the heading "other equity and 
liabilities." Alongside other liabilities, accruals, and 
deferred income, this figure also contains the profit accrued in 
1993. 
  Experts assume that Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel 
will 
receive about DM18 billion "at the final count" from Frankfurt. 
In 1992, a total of around DM13.1 billion of Bundesbank net 
profits, amounting to DM14.7 billion, went into government 
coffers, while in 1991 the federal finance minister received 
exactly DM14.5 billion out of Bundesbank profits of DM15.2 
million. Waigel has included DM7 billion of the 1993 Bundesbank 
profits in the federal budget. Any extra must be used to repay 
debts. The Bundesbank's results for the year are determined by 
the Central Bank Council and officially announced, as is 
customary, in April. 
  The Bundesbank's most important source of income in 1993 
remained interest from loan transactions with domestic banks. 
Although official interest rates did go down sharply during the 
course of 1993, this was largely offset by the expansion in the 
volume of refinancing. As the U.S. dollar, the Bundesbank's 
most important reserve currency, recovered greatly in 1993 from 
its historical low in 1992 of DM 1.3870, there is no need to 
write off funds in this area either.

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DPA) -- German Economic Affairs Minister 
Guenter Rexrodt believes the economic recession in Germany is 
over. He said today when presenting the 1994 annual economic 
report, which had been approved beforehand at a cabinet meeting 
chaired by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, that there would be no boom, 
but modest growth. The government is expecting the German 
economy to grow this year by 1-1.5 percent. It shrank by 1.3 
percent in 1993. 
  The major economic associations are skeptical as to whether 
the economic growth expected by the government can be achieved. 
The Federal Association of German Industry said there was no 
discernible sign yet of the rapid climb out of the economic 
trough which this would require. The German Association of 
Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHT) said the report 
featured a degree of confidence that was not yet reflected in 
corporate investment. 
  The German Salaried Employee Union (DAG) said the 
government's savings policy was snuffing out the beginnings of 
economic recovery. The German Trade Union Federation (DGB) 
accused the government of inactivity in the face of high 
unemployment. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn, 21 January (MTI) -- The Christian Democratic 
Union and Christian Social Union [CDU-CSU] has an interest in 
the continuation of a centrist government in Hungary, Bela 
Csepe, head of the parliamentary group of the Christian 
Democratic People's Party, told reporters in Bonn today. 
  Returning from Taiwan to Europe as head of a party 
delegation, Csepe is paying a three-day visit to Germany at the 
invitation of the CDU-CSU parliamentary group. 
  "The goal of my visit is to hold political and economic 
talks 
rather than canvass electoral support," Csepe said. 
  The German side offered assistance in intensifying Hungary's 
relationship with NATO within the framework of the Partnership 
for Peace scheme, he said. 
  "We disagree with the view that we were left alone after the 
Brussels decision of NATO. Although full membership in NATO is 
still a goal, it lacks reality today. We accept the opportunity 
offered by the Partnership for Peace scheme," Csepe said. 
  The German side stated it would promote Hungary's 
integration 
into the European Union, he said. 
  Regarding his visit to Taiwan, Csepe said that Hungary 
should 
open a trade representation there. "The Czech Republic has 
already taken that step," he added.

  [Text] Berlin/Bonn (DPA) -- In large-scale raids against 
right-wing extremists mainly in Berlin, Brandenburg, and 
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, police today seized evidence. 
Flats in Lower Saxony and North-Rhine Westphalia belonging to 
members of the "Direct Action/Middle Germany" group were also 
searched and the contents of post office boxes were seized. 
According to the security services, the organization pursues 
right-wing extremist and anticonstitutional goals. 
  The group emerged from the "Middle German Youth Association" 
(FMJ), which originally saw itself as a "mass organization" to 
complement the "cadre and elite party" "Nationalist Front" (NF). 
The NF was banned on 26 November 1992. According to the 
Interior Ministry in Bonn, the activities of "Direct Action" are 
particularly concentrated in Brandenburg, where it has about 100 
members. 
  German Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said in Bonn the 
investigation demonstrated once again that the German Government 
was determined to fight extremism in close cooperation with the 
federal states. People who engaged in extremist violence and 
caused incitement to racial hatred would be countered with the 
full force of the law. 
  The interior senate administration [Interior Ministry] said 
written documents and diskettes were found in Berlin during the 
search instigated by the state of Brandenburg and the city of 
Berlin. The documents are said to contain information regarding 
the group's organization and membership. A spokesman for the 
State Criminal Investigations Office said 43 items of written 
propaganda material were also seized in Brandenburg. The 
searches in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania focused on the town of 
Neubrandenburg.

  [Text] Kiel (DPA) -- Fresh cracks have been discovered in 
the Kruemmel nuclear plant near Hamburg. Sixty-seven small, 
shallow, operationally induced cracks have been discovered in 
the ferruginous pipes of the feed-water system filled with 
mildly radioactive water, a spokesman for the Schleswig-Holstein 
Energy Ministry confirmed in Kiel today. The cracks, which were 
caused by extensibility corrosion, are to be repaired through 
restoration work. 
  Three cracks had already been discovered in the welding 
seams 
of the austenitic steel of the nuclear reactor during a series 
of special surprise tests carried out within the framework of 
fuel exchange of fuel rods last September. The plant, which is 
situated east of Hamburg, has been shut down since August 1993. 
The test of 876 seams in the ferruginous system was ordered 
when a leak was discovered in the feed-water system. 
  The nuclear plant of Brunsbuettel, which is just as 
important 
for the production of electricity for Hamburg, was also shut 
down in the summer of 1992 because of numerous cracks. The 
restarting of both reactors cannot yet be foreseen, according to 
the ministry.

afternoon. The Weser-Ems District Council in Oldenburg confirmed 
that two packets had been clearly identified. The contents of 
three other packets still had to be tested. 
  Authorities estimate that around 130,000 packets of Apron 
Plus had been collected on the Dutch coast by yesterday evening. 
About 70,000 more packets are drifting eastward off the Dutch 
North Sea islands. They come from the French freighter the 
Sherbro. It lost 88 containers last December.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Sisde/Sismi Chiefs on Scalfaro's </F>
Heightened Security"] 
  [Text] Rome, 13 Jan (ANSA) -- The heads of Italy's domestic 
and military secret services, Sisde and Sismi respectively, 
today reassured the relevant parliamentary committee that no 
specific threats were behind the heightened security recently 
placed around Head of State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, but they 
pointed out that increased vigilance was the watchword given the 
current evolution underway in the country, an evolution which 
some may not be willing to accept. Reporting to the secret 
services committee today were Sisde chief, Domenico Salazar, and 
the head of Sismi, General Cesare Pucci. 
  Coming out of the meeting, committee members said that both 
men have made mention of an episode which occurred on December 
31 when fishermen found a container containing a vest and two 
handguns 50 meters from the shore at Santa Severa, the town 
north of Rome where Scalfaro has a home. However, both secret 
service chiefs tended to downplay the find, saying it was more a 
matter for the local police force. Salazar said that whenever 
there is an institutional void there is always a greater risk of 
destabilization as subversive elements look for their chance to 
move. The important thing is not to let down one's guard, the 
Sisde chief said. 
  Pressed by journalists to elaborate on his reference to 
subversive or "deviant" elements, Salazar said every now and 
then there was a telephone call from the "Armed Phalange," for 
example, and that there might well be deviant strains running 
through other, unspecified "forces," persons "who cannot accept 
the present state of things; this inevitable process of 
evolution." Forces different from the security services? he was 
asked. "That's the way it looks to me," he replied. 
  Security is tight around the head of state, who has also 
been 
advised during this period to spend more of his time living at 
the Quirinale (presidential) palace.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Segni Launches New Party Into </F>
Electoral Fray"] 
  [Text] Rome, 5 Jan (ANSA) -- Former Christian Democrat 
Mario Segni, who created and quit two political movements in as 
many years, on Wednesday [5 January] unveiled the birth of yet 
another party under his leadership, called Pact for Italy, and 
touted as a moderate alternative to the left. 
  "Today is a historic day because a grand project is taking 
shape," Segni claimed at a press conference. All potential 
candidates from various parties are welcome to run under a Pact 
ticket in coming elections, he said, as long as they accept the 
party's programs, which will be "along alternative lines to 
those of the left-wing caucus, and will indicate Mario Segni as 
candidate for prime minister." 
  The Pact, Segni went on, is a "great alliance between 
secularists and Catholics, a liberal-democratic and reformist 
alliance that is a credible alternative to the caucus of the 
left," referring to potential alliances between the Left 
Democrat, Green, Network, Republican, Socialist and Communist 
Refoundation parties. 
  He said candidates will be chosen by local committees among 
those who obtain at least 300 signatures in their favor. 
  Segni claimed that the Christian Democrat Party, which will 
not use its name or symbol in first-past-the-post majority 
elections, will also join the Pact for Italy at the next 
elections. Some Christian Democrat members of parliament, along 
with some Liberal and Republican Party officials, flanked Segni 
at his press conference. 
  Segni said the party's program will be announced on January 
15, and the first national assembly will take place February 5. 
  Among his various political comments, Segni reiterated his 
request that Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi make it clear 
once and for all that "he is not a candidate of the left." 
  Segni again urged media mogul Silvio Berlusconi, who has 
announced plans to create his own conservative party, not to 
enter politics, because "his candidates would split up the 
liberal-democratic front." 
  Christian Democrat Party Secretary Mino Martinazzoli reacted 
to Segni's claim that many Christian Democrats would join the 
Pact by saying that the so-called neo-centrists, who make up one 
of the minority wings, "seem to have taken their leave" of the 
party. 
  Martinazzoli said: "When they behave like a party, with a 
program, an executive and their own strategy, holding talks with 
other political bodies, I acknowledge all this."

<F P=106> [Article by Francesco Verderami: "Elections: PDS Is Already </F>
Coming Up With Its First Candidates"] 
  [Text] In PDS headquarters at Botteghe Oscure, they 
anticipate sacrifices, exclusions, and shifts. 
  Rodota: Everyone is looking for a safe electoral 
colleges and sometimes shamelessly. Iotti in Rome, Napolitano in 
Naples, Occhetto in Emilia, D'Alema in Taranto. And AD 
[Democratic Alliance] approaches Maurizio Costanzo. 
  Rome--Behind the very minor point of not knowing when the 
next elections will be held hides the last big organizational 
structure to survive the collapse of the First Republic. It is 
the PDS, which has not awaited the decision of the Quirinale 
[presidency of the Republic] to start selecting its candidates. 
At PDS headquarters, a committee has been established that 
includes secretariat coordinator Davide Visani; group leaders 
D'Alema and Chiaranti; party president, Giglia Tedesco, and the 
reform senator, Ranieri. The job of preparing the slate of 
candidates is a difficult one, made even worse by the new 
electoral system. It is new territory, as challenging as a 
wager, both technically and politically because the commission 
has already started running while the progressive alliance has 
not yet left the starting gate. At party headquarters--where 
several deputies who are reluctant to be nominated have been 
summoned--they have discussed the criteria for selecting the 
candidates. D'Alema explained that "to win, we have to have 
credibility, not just in our platform but in the choice of the 
new political class as well. The existing people will remain in 
the race where they have a chance to win, otherwise they will 
find themselves on the proportional lists. These words signal an 
out and out revolution. Up until the last elections the big wigs 
were able to ride to victory on the coattails of the party under 
the protection of the proportional vote. This time they will 
have to work to win all on their own, and anyone who cannot make 
it...." 
  It is certain that some members of the old guard will no 
longer be around this time. Chiarante sent a letter to Occhetto 
saying that he had decided that "the time had come for him to 
step aside. A while ago even Tortorella had said that that was 
his intention as well, but now I am not sure," revealed former 
party President Stefano Rodota, who himself is no longer willing 
to run: "Also because no one has asked me to." The reformist 
Pellicani, PDS deputy group leader in the Chamber of Deputies, 
is also in doubt about what to do. But in comparison with this 
small group of parliamentarians who want to sit this one out, we 
have a huge throng of PDS leaders on the national level and a 
host of obscure local dignitaries who want to sit in the next 
Parliament. 
  The problem becomes a really difficult puzzle to solve when 
you consider that the new electoral system holds few hopes of 
success for the party's "bosses" in Lega areas and that the 
future alliance will call for many sacrifices. In Ravenna, the 
PDS will have to support the Republican La Malfa; in Umbria, it 
will have to find some way to say no to the Socialist Manca. And 
then there are the alliances with the Refoundation, the AD, the 
Greens, and the Rete. "We are all looking for a safe electoral 
college," says Rodota, "and in some cases shamelessly." Faraguti 
of the DC was heard saying day before yesterday in the 
Transatlantico [deputies' lounge]: "Why don't you try asking the 
deputies currently in office how upset they are? We may have 
Imposimato's declaration that he is in favor of a government 
shakeup, but there are lots of people in the PDS who do not want 
to give up their seat to Adornato." 
  While they are waiting to finalize the progressive lineup, 
the PDS is beginning to fill in its own slots. At PDS 
headquarters, they anticipate sacrifices, some exclusions, and 
shifts. 
  For example, Nilde Iotti, who has always run in her own 
region of Reggio Emilia, would be "transferred" to the 
majoritarian and the proportional slates in Rome. The same fate 
will befall Reichlin who would have to leave his own electorate 
in Apulia to run on the proportional slate. Instead, prominent 
positions have been reserved for the party bigwigs: Occhetto 
will be the candidate on the majoritarian list in the heart of 
communist Emilia and will also be "used"--as the new electoral 
law allows--on three proportional slates. D'Alema will go to 
Taranto, and Napolitano will run in Naples on the majoritarian 
and proportional slates. The problem will be keeping the 
candidacies secret. At PDS headquarters they explain: "With this 
system, you have to avoid giving your opponents the `advantage' 
of knowing your moves because they could plan their 
countermoves." On the left, they are moving toward an alliance. 
The Greens and the Rete intend to run together in the 
proportional. Del Turco is proposing the same thing to the PRI 
[Italian Republican Party], to the remains of the PSDI [Italian 
Socialist Democratic Party] and to the social Christians. And 
Bordon invites everyone to join together under the banner of the 
Democratic Alliance, which is looking for prominent candidates 
for the upcoming elections. It has a semi-commitment with 
television commentator Maurizio Costanzo who has asked for some 
time to think about it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Rete Secretary Leoluca Orlando by </F>
Felice Cavallaro in Palermo; date not given: "Orlando Says No 
to Sad Martinazzoli, Believes La Malfa -- Under Investigation -- 
Should Stay at Home"] 
  [Text] Palermo -- The great left-wing agreement, with a 
view to setting up a progressive pole, will perhaps be reached 
next week at a negotiating "table" secretly convened over the 
past few days by Leoluca Orlando and [Green Party Coordinator] 
Carlo Ripa di Meana. The idea is to bring together left-wing 
movements and parties, ranging from AD [Democratic Alliance] to 
Communist Renaissance. The invitations have already been sent to 
attend a meeting at the Valdesi Institute, in Rome, on 13 
January -- a date worthy of a soccer match -- following the 
debate on the Ciampi government. There are many who are 
prepared to sit down at this table, though perhaps they will 
soon stand up again. Others have been excluded from the game 
even before it started, and the task of waiving little red cards 
[expulsion card in soccer] at so many different parties fell to 
Orlando. La Malfa [former Italian Republican Party secretary] 
is warming up on the sidelines, getting ready for a comeback 
into politics, but Orlando advised him to stay at home. A 
"stop" warning was also addressed to Martinazzoli [Christian 
Democratic Party, DC, secretary] and Del Turco [Italian 
Socialist Party secretary]. 
  [Cavallaro] Deputy Orlando, who is qualified to join the 
Left? 
  [Orlando] Anyone who did not represent, and does not now 
represent, the various existing parties. 
  [Cavallaro] What about Martinazzoli? 
  [Orlando] Sadly he is preparing to remain in a useless 
Center, having failed to understand that there is no Center any 
more. So much the worse for him. His voters have understood 
it, though. Some will support [DC neocentrist leader] Casini and 
[Fininvest President] Berlusconi, while others will back the 
progressive pole. 
  [Cavallaro] With whom would you like to see an agreement? 
  [Orlando] Certainly not with Del Turco. Rather, with 
Gorrieri's Christian-Socialists. Also, with Socialists such as 
Enzo Mattina -- all those who made a clean break at a time when 
such a move was not suspect -- the Greens, Rete, AD, PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left], Communist Renaissance. 
  [Cavallaro] When did you first think of this "table"? 
  [Orlando] On 18 December, at the Greens' National Council 
meeting. At that time I told Ripa di Meana: Bring along two 
legs, I have another two, so that together we can make a table 
at which we can sit and talk. 
  [Cavallaro] Is this a political agreement or an electoral 
pact? 
  [Orlando] The objective is a government platform for the 
next 
parliament. Otherwise, we are not interested. 
  [Cavallaro] Are you thinking in terms of the Palermo model? 
  [Orlando] I am hoping that we can break with the past as 
much 
as possible everywhere, as regards the moral issue -- and 
everywhere achieve the maximum possible unity of the Left. I am 
thinking of the 56 percent achieved by the Left -- a majority 
the first time around. 
  [Cavallaro] People talk of a fictitious Left, because your 
platform is rather conservative in economic terms. What are the 
progressives' distinctive characteristics? 
  [Orlando] The respect for diversity. For the progressives, 
diversity is a form of wealth, not an obstacle. This applies to 
the differences between north and south, as well as sexual, 
cultural, religious, social, and racial differences. The second 
point is respect for market rules, rather than the pirate raids 
that are presented as being the market. 
  [Cavallaro] Of course corrupt politicians and mafiosi are 
vetoed, but what about those under investigation? 
  [Orlando] We must respect the moral issue when drawing up 
the 
lists. 
  [Cavallaro] What about La Malfa proclaiming himself the 
saviour of the Left? 
  [Orlando] He certainly cannot stand as a candidate as long 
as 
he is still under investigation. 
  [Cavallaro] Will the presence of Communist Renaissance put 
off many people? 
  [Orlando] If Cossutta believes that the progressive pole 
must 
be conditioned by "real socialism" he will be forced to get up 
and leave. The same will apply, however, to those who choose to 
ignore the value of solidarity. 
  [Cavallaro] Who is in the right-wing camp? 
  [Orlando] Bossi [League secretary], Fini [Italian Social 
Movement secretary] and Casini, with Berlusconi acting as a 
binder. Of course, Casini could also be joined by someone like 
Segni [National Rebirth Pact leader], who nevertheless is 
clinging to the Center, probably because he is hoping to become 
prime minister and head a center-right government. I think his 
problem is: Who will make him prime minister? He tried already 
with [PDS Secretary Achille] Occhetto, and he will be trying 
with Berlusconi. 
  [Cavallaro] When did he try with Occhetto? 
  [Orlando] He tried, believe you me.... 
  [Cavallaro] And Occhetto never makes mistakes? 
  [Orlando] Some people see the progressive pole in terms of a 
train with many wagons, with the PDS acting as the locomotive. 
If Occhetto believes he is the engine pulling the wagons he 
runs the risk of becoming a dashing engine with no wagons. It 
would be a serious mistake if the progressive pole appeared to 
be dominated by an individual. 
  [Cavallaro] Does Occhetto risk being ousted by Orlando as 
the 
leader of the Left? 
  [Orlando] Let us be realistic. For the next four years, 
Orlando will be working as Palermo's mayor. Look, he is not 
even interested in standing as a candidate. He will not be 
requesting a constituency for himself, be it unilateral or 
proportional. 
  [Cavallaro] Why are you concerned about Berlusconi? 
  [Orlando] He is making what appears to me to be a decision 
dictated by desperation. He is too overexposed as a businessman 
and as a politician. One of the priority issues for us is 
holding a referendum on the Mammi-Berlusconi law. We must get 
rid of this absurd record. And besides, in any normal country, 
a businessman pays his debts to the banks. 
  [Cavallaro] Is it true you returned a greeting card sent to 
you by Father Sorge? 
  [Orlando] I had never done that with anybody before, but I 
found it absurd that he should offer to cooperate on precisely 
the day they sent [Father] Pintacuda an eviction order from 
Palermo. 
  [Cavallaro] Is it true you believe [Palermo Archbishop] 
Pappalardo to be too cautious? 
  [Orlando] In Palermo, the DC has collapsed, but not the 
church. Hitherto the cardinal has guaranteed pluralism. As a 
citizen and a Catholic, I hope he will continue to do so in the 
future.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Christian Demcorat `Centrists'"] </F>
  [Text] Rome, 18 Jan (ANSA) -- The platform of the new 
Christian Democrat Center is for liberal Catholicism, national 
unity and democracy, while the defense of life and the family 
are "assets that cannot be renounced," as are the concepts of 
liberalism and solidarity in economic and social life. 
  In the "Center" founding declaration, as read at today's 
meeting by Ombretta Fumagalli, the now former Christian 
Democrats also voiced their "deep disappointment" also at the 
fact of being unable to find a "democratic seat to express our 
views." 
  "We want to be the yeast" explained Pier Ferdinando Casini, 
"for a moderate alliance, popular and reformist which is a 
candidate to govern. This is what is happening on the Left, 
where (Communist Armando) Cossuta and (Republican Giorgio) La 
Malfa are sitting together, I can't see why there should be 
obstacles in the center where, among other things, the 
differences in program are minimal." 
  "It is our hope" Casini added, "that even [Pact for Italy 
leader] (Mariotto) Segni wants to be part of a moderate cartel." 
A cartel, he pointed out, which cannot include those of the 
National Alliance, formed by the neofascist Italian Social 
Movement (MSI) and other right-wing elements, such as Christian 
Democrat Publio Fiori. 
  In related developments, Christian Democrat House Whip 
Gerardo Bianco wrote a letter to Francesco D'Onofrio calling on 
him to "think twice" before splitting the party underscoring how 
division before an election did not "respond to Aristotelian 
logic nor political wisdom." 
  "Does it not seem contradictory to you" Bianco added, "to 
separate from those who are closest to you, for culture and 
political criteria."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Eight Days To Save Referendums"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- [Radical leader] Marco Pannella has scored 
his first victory since starting his complete hunger strike, 
having taken no food or drink for the past four days. The 
Council of Ministers decided at the last moment last night to 
issue a decree extending by eight days the deadline for 
gathering signatures in support of the 13 abrogation referendums 
proposed by the Pannella Club and the Northern League. A 
subsequent period of seven days is expected for delivering the 
signatures to the Court of Cassation. This is the first time 
such a measure has been adopted. The decision followed a report 
from Interior Minister Nicola Mancino, who spoke about the need 
to "find a just solution to the referendums problem" since, he 
said, it is not enough to place an entry in the Official Gazette 
in order to terminate an initiative which, however much people 
may agree or disagree with it, is nevertheless legitimate. 
  An extension of the deadline has been granted for gathering 
signatures and submitting the referendum proposals for which 
signatures are being gathered. 
  So the volunteers assigned to gathering signatures -- which, 
according to the latest estimates, now total 440,000, Marco 
Pannella said -- can resume their work. But the Radical leader 
was cautious: "Let us not celebrate yet; we still have to read 
the decrees carefully." Be that as it may, he said, the rate at 
which signatures have been gathered in recent days is 
encouraging -- "an average of 25,000-30,000 per day," which, if 
maintained, would enable the promoters to achieve the quorum of 
500,000 signatures. This, partly because, Pannella went on, "the 
margin of error when gathering signatures is about 3 percent of 
those gathered by us, 15 percent of those gathered by others who 
are less expert, and some 8-10 percent of those gathered by the 
municipalities." 
  So does the Radical leader expect to end his fast? "We shall 
see.... Certainly, if the situation really is as we hope it is, 
I might at least end my water fast."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Defense Minister on Leased Tornados </F>
and Air Defense"] 
  [Text] Gioia del Colle, Italy, 20 Jan (ANSA) -- Twenty-four 
Tornado ADV interceptors leased from Britain for the Italian Air 
Force were spoken of by Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri as an 
ideal "bridge solution" for stiffening the nation's air defense 
ahead of the deployment of the Eurofighter 2000 at the beginning 
of the next century. 
  On a tour of the Gioia del Colle Air Base in the southern 
Puglia region, where the Tornado Air Defense Variants will be 
based, Fabri said the decision to lease the warplanes from 
Britain was "the most logical and economical, the most correct 
and advantageous" move to round out Italy's air defense system. 
  With reference to the Eurofighter 2000, to be built by a 
European consortium, Fabri stated, "we absolutely have not 
renounced" participation in this program. 
  Air Force Chief of Staff General Adelchi Pillinini, who 
accompanied the defense chief here, along with the commanding 
officer of the Third Air Region, General Vincenzo Manca, 
discussed the "compatibility" between the Air Force 
modernization program and keeping F104 ASA interceptors in 
service. "I have no doubt about the possibility of using" the 
F104s now flying out of the Gioia del Colle Base "for another 15 
years," said the general and affirmed that these warplanes still 
have 260,000 flying hours of life left in them. "Around 2010 we 
can replace them with the Eurofighter," he added. 
  Pillinini reported that also under study are the G222 
transport planes, still considered fully efficient by the Air 
Force, and the Hercules C130s, scheduled for overhauls after 20 
years in service in line with a European modernization program. 
  The defense minister said the reason for the tour here was 
to 
"check out the conditions of efficiency of this air base with 
the view to training for the use of the new interceptors," the 
Tornado ADVs. 
  Now sharing the Gioia del Colle base are the F104s of the 
12th squadron and the 156th squadron of Tornado fighter-bombers.

Shi Welcomed at CERN by Chinese Nobel Prize Winner"; as released

  [Excerpt] Geneva, 25 Jan (ATSA) -- Qiao Shi, president of 
the Chinese National People's Congress [NPC], was received on 
Tuesday [25 January] by the authorities of the Geneva Canton and 
municipality. He previously had visited the Castle at Chillon 
and the European Organization of Nuclear Research [CERN], the 
only stops in the French-speaking part during his four-day visit 
to Switzerland, which he will conclude on Wednesday in Zurich. 
  The third highest-ranking Chinese was received early Tuesday 
afternoon by Professor Christopher Llewellyn Smith, new director 
general of the organization, and by Professor Samuel C.C. Ting, 
Chinese scientist and Nobel Peace Prize winner for physics. The 
spokesperson of the CERN press service indicated that Mr. Qiao, 
accompanied by 60 persons, visited the LEP [Large Electron 
Positron Collider] where Mr. Ting works. 
  CERN is an intergovernmental organization grouping 19 
countries. It employs 3,000 persons and works with some 6,000 
scientists, of whom about 100 are Chinese. For 1993, its global 
budget nears 1 billion Swiss francs. The principal financial 
backers are, in decreasing order, Germany, Italy, France, and 
the United Kingdom. 
  After his visit to CERN, which is situated on the 
Swiss-French border, the NPC president was received at Geneva's 
city hall. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Britain will not act hastily or alone to withdraw 
troops from Bosnia, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd pledged 
tonight. "We remain committed to sustaining our contribution 
through this winter, and working to improve further its 
effectiveness," he said. 
  But Mr Hurd betrayed his anger at the "constant obstruction" 
which humanitarian aid troops face on the ground. "I was there 
last week. The outlook is bleak. The latest round of talks in 
Geneva made no progress. The prospect is for continued 
fighting, which may intensify in the spring," he told the 
Diplomatic and Commonwealth Writers Association at Marlborough 
House, London. 
  Mr Hurd said the achievements of British troops were 
threatened by the deliberate obstructiveness of the parties. 
"Aid is stuck in warehouses in Croatia. The road the British 
troops hold open could carry many more convoys. Our engineers 
are working to keep open power stations in central Bosnia, but 
essential spare parts are being blocked. No wonder then that 
people ask how long we can sustain this involvement, in the face 
of constant obstruction on the ground. We have to consider 
carefully, and with the others who contribute troops, how long 
we can reasonably be expected to sustain this involvement and 
how meanwhile we can improve its effectiveness." 
  Mr Hurd said that no decisions had yet been taken. "We shall 
not act hastily or alone to withdraw our troops. We remain 
committed to sustaining our contribution through this winter, 
and working to improve further its effectiveness. Because the 
Serbs carry the main responsibility for starting the conflict, 
sanctions against Serbia must remain in force."

<F P=106> [Article by Charles Clover: "Major Warns of Pain in `Green' </F>
Plan for Britain"] 
  [Text] The Prime Minister gave warning of "painful 
political action" to protect the environment at the launch 
yesterday of a "green" action plan that promises higher fuel 
taxes and a city curb on cars. 
  The Government's followup to the Rio Earth Summit, an 
environmental action plan for the next 20 years, runs to four 
documents -- nearly 600 pages, announced by nine ministers in 
the surroundings of Inigo Jones's Banqueting House in Whitehall. 
  The most controversial chapter of Britain's Sustainable 
Development Strategy, on transport, says that "costs of travel, 
particularly costs of road travel, may well have to rise to 
reflect environmental costs and to affect levels of future 
demand for transport." 
  Mr Major, launching the strategy, said: "Sometimes quite 
painful political action may be necessary to meet environmental 
objectives." He admitted he "did not expect to see people 
dancing in the street" at the thought of road pricing. 
  He said that Britain's imposition of VAT [value-added tax] 
on 
heating and lighting, higher fuel prices and commitment to road 
pricing had already gone further than most other countries, but 
denied these would impose an intolerable burden on the economy. 
  An expansion of nuclear power might be necessary to meet 
future environmental commitments, he hinted. Alongside the 
overall environmental strategy, Major introduced the following 
documents: 
  The UK Climate Change Programme -- sets out in detail how 
Britain intends to meet its commitments to freeze carbon dioxide 
emissions by the year 2000. 
  The document shows for the first time that Britain will 
achieve a reduction in all gases that cause global warming -- 
including methane and CFCs [chlorofluorocarbons] -- of five 
percent. It commits Britain to setting targets after 2000 but 
not what they will be. 
  The Biodiversity Action Plan -- sets out 59 specific 
commitments to protecting wildlife and local distinctiveness. 
  The Forestry Action Plan -- shows how Britain will increase 
forest cover. 
  Mr Major announced a new panel of five "wise men" who will 
advise him and monitor progress on "green issues," chaired by 
Sir Crispin Tickell, warden of Green College, Oxford, an 
unofficial adviser at Downing Street. 
  The others are Lord Alexander of Weedon, chairman of 
National 
Westminster Bank, Lord Selborne, chairman of the Government's 
statutory conservation watchdog, the Joint Nature Conservation 
Committee, Sir John Houghton, chairman of the Royal Commission 
on Environmental Pollution and Dr Anne Mclaren, vice president 
of the Royal Society 
  Mr Gummer, Environment Secretary, announced that the 
Government would be setting up a Roundtable on Sustainable 
Development which would bring together industry, local 
authorities and environmentalists to discuss environmental 
policies. 
  The Government also intended to stimulate a new "citizen's 
environmental initiative" in consultation with local 
authorities, churches and community groups. 
  Mr Major's initiative received a chorus of criticism from 
Opposition MPs and environmental groups. Mr Chris Smith, Labour 
spokesman for environmental protection, said the four reports 
contained "no vision and few firm commitments to action." 
  The Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Simon Hughes said 
the key Strategy document was "full of `coulds', `ifs' and 
`maybes' when what the country needs is `whys', `whats' and 
`whens.'" 
  The Green Party complained the Government "lacked the 
courage 
of its convictions" and the WorldWide Fund for Nature described 
the announcement as "a lost opportunity."

  [Text] When he touches down in Washington this weekend, 
Chancellor Kohl might be struck by nostalgia. For, in America 
things are really better at the moment, as Goethe once wrote. 
The recession that will make itself really at home in Germany 
this year, has already bidden farewell to the United States. 
The country is at an enviable (and very rare) point in the 
economic cycle, where everything is right. The economy is 
growing, inflation is going down, interest rates are at a 
20-year low, the dollar is on its way up, the deficit is 
declining, and jobs are mushrooming. 
  In Germany, once called "model Germany," almost all the 
indicators are pointing in the opposite direction. Here, 
unemployment is growing, together with debts and the budget 
deficit; inflation is only beginning to fall below the 4-percent 
mark; interest rates seem to be too high to boost the economy -- 
and too low to maintain the external value of the German mark: 
Since April 1993, the mark has gone down 20 pfenning against 
the dollar. 
  And this is why Helmut Kohl might remember Walter Rathenau's 
words when he meets Bill Clinton: "Not the world, but the 
economy is our fate." With these words, the foreign minister, 
who was murdered by the Nazis, anticipated several cubic meters 
of political literature: A purse that is doing all right is a 
nice pillow to rest on for those in power. But if the man in 
the street gets the feeling that his material existence is 
suffering in line with the economy, the ballot paper turns into 
a letter of dismissal. Whether chancellor or president, with 
the economy going down, they may have to go. 
  George Bush had to experience this. In March 1991 he was 
still the glorious winner of the Gulf War (with an approval rate 
of 91 percent), and in November 1992 he was the loser in a 
domestic war called "presidential elections." "Not the world, 
but the economy," was, therefore, the unwritten motto of this 
year's State of the Union Address, which the president gives on 
Congress' return from winter recess. Of the total 11 pages, 
only one and one-half were on foreign and security policy; the 
rest concerned domestic and economic policy. 
  The speaking notes were full of success figures: 1.6 million 
new jobs in the private sector alone during Clinton's first year 
in office; the tackling of the seemingly eternal budget deficit, 
that -- according to Clinton -- will be only 180, instead of 300 
billion next year; the cutback on bureaucracy; the removal of 
trade barriers in North America; the plans for a general health 
insurance. Today, the "state of the nation" looks as if Clinton 
might come out with flying colors in the 1996 election year -- 
at the height of an economic upswing, the most secure basis for 
reelection that the Democrats know. 
  But there is another reason why things are better in 
America, 
and this has something to do with the electoral system. In 
practice, this system creates more frequently clear-cut 
majorities than the German one. In a majority voting system you 
tend to have two parties, one in power, the other in opposition. 
Proportional representation, on the other hand, creates many 
parties, and thus the need to form coalitions. This obviously 
does not bring about any clear mandates for change, but 
compromise cabinets maintaining the status quo. In good times, 
the Germans, the Europeans, were quite well advised with this 
system. But when there are fires burning everywhere, coalition 
governments are not an effective fire brigade. 
  Clinton is fortunate enough to have his Democratic Party 
controlling both houses of Congress. He managed to get many 
things underway during his first year: "Weariness of politics," 
is a term unknown to the Americans -- even if it did seem at one 
point that they might fall into the trap of a demagogic outsider 
like Ross Perot. Beside, Clinton has managed to embody the 
state of his union as perfectly as Kohl did in the eighties. 
  Leaning toward the "left," he offers voters a national 
health 
insurance and laws to control firearms -- both long overdue. 
Speaking to the "right," in his State of the Union Address he 
promised an additional 100,000 police officers, stricter laws 
against relapse offenders, more liberal choice of schools, and a 
welfare reform that would speed up people's return to the labor 
market. More state here, less there; more welfare here, more 
freedom there -- Clinton seems to have come up with a mixture 
that smells strongly of achieving a majority. 
  And that is why the chancellor might very well have an 
attack 
of nostalgia during his visit to Washington -- all the more so, 
as almost two-thirds of Americans think that Clinton will be a 
"better president" during his second year in office. But one 
enemy stays with him, Clinton himself -- with his affairs and 
lapses. More than half of the voters say: "Every time I am 
beginning to feel good about the President, something happens 
that speaks against him."

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel has come out in favor of greatly strengthening Germany's 
relations with the countries in the Asia-Pacific area, 
particularly in the economic sector. Speaking in Bonn on 
Wednesday [26 January] at the conclusion of a three-day 
conference involving 21 German ambassadors from countries from 
the region, Kinkel referred to a 10-point catalogue on 
German-Asia policy. This stresses that, in view of low budget 
funds, there had to be more efficient use of the available 
personnel and organizational resources in German missions abroad 
when it came to relations with Asia. 
  The conference was devoted to the implementation of the Asia 
plan adopted by the Federal cabinet in December.

<F P=106> [Robin Geyde report: "Britain's EC Rebate Under Fire as Bonn </F>
Seeks Cuts"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Germany is to call for its contributions to 
European Community funds to be reviewed following demands by the 
opposition Social Democrats (SPD) to scrap the rebate negotiated 
for Britain by Lady Thatcher in 1985. 
  Frau Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier, the SPD's financial 
spokeswoman, 
said that if the German parliament was unable to insist on 
eliminating Britain's entire rebate, "then at least the German 
contribution must cease." 
  The SPD, hoping to turn the issue into a major bone of 
contention in an election year, argues that the costs of German 
reunification have reduced the nation's relative wealth in 
Europe. 
  "We have moved from second to sixth place, on a level with 
Britain. At the same time, we pay the lion's share of Western 
aid to East Europe and the former Soviet Union," Frau 
Matthaeus-Maier said. 
  "It was a serious omission by Chancellor Kohl that he did 
not 
negotiate away Britain's rebate at the 1992 Edinburgh summit." 
  Herr Theo Waigel, finance minister, under intense pressure 
to 
act, agreed to demand a review of Germany's EC contributions, 
which came to 9.14 billion [U.S. trillion] pounds last year, 
including 460 million pounds to help fund the EC rebate to 
Britain. 
  A Finance Ministry official said yesterday there were 
constant discussions in the EC over reducing German 
contributions, "but Frau Matthaeus-Maier must remember that her 
popular demand must be politically feasible . 
  "We must not forget that any such changes are subject to a 
unanimous vote -- and that includes Britain's agreement." 
  With opinion polls showing a steadily decreasing enthusiasm 
for European monetary union, Bonn could be forced into taking a 
tough stand on the issue. 
  Even Bavaria's Christian Social Union, sister party to Herr 
Kohl's Christian Democrats, has expressed reservations about 
European political and economic union, and lent its backing to 
the SPD's call for an end to the British rebate, in a rare 
example of cross-party unanimity.

  [Excerpt] Karlsruhe/Munich -- The president of the Federal 
Constitutional Court, Roman Herzog, officially declared his 
willingness to run for the office of federal president. 
According to the court, he sent identical letters to Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU] Chairman Helmut Kohl and Christian Social 
Union [CSU] Chairman Theo Waigel, informing them that he wants 
to run for president. Herzog had said for weeks he would not 
make his final decision until the CDU/CSU leadership had 
nominated him officially. On Monday evening [24 January], the 
CDU and CSU leaderships agreed to ask the 59-year-old Bavarian 
to run for president, to be elected by the Federal Assembly in 
Berlin on 23 May. Until then, Herzog wants to remain a 
constitutional judge and president of the court. [passage

former IBM security officer from Wilhelmshaven to 12 years 
imprisonment for treason. 
  Between 1975 and 1980, the defendant passed on some 35,000 
sheets of confidential military documents from an archive of the 
IBM Special Systems company [IBM Sondersysteme] to the main 
Department II of the MfS [former GDR Ministry for State 
Security], which handled counterintelligence. In the event of a 
military conflict, the betrayal could have led to the complete 
destruction of NATO's navy.

  [Excerpt] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- Germany's Economic Affairs 
Minister Guenter Rexrodt today called for a multilateral GATT 
agreement on air traffic in Hamburg. Only regulated and fair 
competition can "prevent a new subsidy race," Rexrodt said 
during the handover to Lufthansa of a new Airbus model. 
Regarding recent complications involving the German-U.S. air 
traffic agreement, Rexrodt stated forcefully that "the United 
States also has to accept that its indirect support of air 
traffic is now open to question. Equality of opportunity in the 
skies has to apply worldwide." 
  Rexrodt backed the further expansion of air traffic in 
Germany. It is "extremely damaging" for Germany "that it is not 
possible to build a runway today without encountering 
resistance." Germany has to develop its airports if it wants to 
avoid being cut off from international traffic routes in the 
future. At the international level, Rexrodt called for fair 
"market entry opportunities" and a stop to "protectionism 
disguised as environmental protection." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- The news agency DDP/ADN is to be 
transformed into a workers' cooperative. The main shareholder 
in DDP/ADN, Bolko Hoffmann, told the press in Berlin on 
Wednesday [27 January] that the shares in the business are to be 
transferred to all DDP/ADN workers on the model of the workers' 
shares in the Hamburg news magazine DER SPIEGEL. This should 
ensure the long-term existence of the company with its 250 or so 
full and part-time jobs. 
  Hoffmann made it clear he had planned originally to time 
this 
step differently. However, the latest offer of a three-year 
contract from the Federal Press Office (BPA) seriously 
disadvantaged DDP/ADN in comparison with other competitors on 
the news market. He did not want to sign this contract "because 
it would have long-term effects of over a decade or longer." 
Whereas no other agencies had to accept any cuts in their 
subsidies, payments to DDP/ADN were to be reduced by almost 20 
percent both in 1995 and 1996. This meant DDP/ADN was standing 
"at a crossroads." Hoffmann said, "the editor in chief and the 
editors will have to fight the necessary battle with the Federal 
Press Office without me." However, at the same time he stressed 
that he will "quite clearly continue to be available to the 
agency." 
  The main shareholder sharply criticized the fact that the 
Federal Press Office did not open news services to public 
tender, even though the law expressly demanded this. The entire 
foreign budget of DM [German marks] 11.25 million was awarded to 
the Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA), in spite of the Federal Audit 
Office's strictures that this involved payment for services not 
provided. The Federal Press Office had paid DPA fees of DM17 
million, which enabled it to offer discounts of up to 75 percent 
in eastern Germany. The effects of this persisted, particularly 
since drastic discounts were still being offered. This dumping 
was a clear violation of competition, Hoffmann said. This meant 
DPA was able to conduct a "devastating price war" against its 
competitors. 
  Hoffmann also pointed out that the news agency AFP, which 
already received an unlawful 48 percent subsidy from the French 
state, had received an additional Federal Press Office grant for 
1993 at the expense of DDP/ADN. 
  He had to "say with a degree of bitterness" this "is 
evidently a fresh example of how the Kohl government envisages 
the `Upswing East' in the long term," Hoffmann said. He said 
the company had been "modestly in the black" during 1992 and 
1993 and was "absolutely healthy." The company's nominal 
capital amounted to DM1 million and had at its disposal over 
DM1.2 million in liquid funds. The decisions to be taken now, 
therefore, concern not the year 1994 but the future of the 
agency and its staff. 
  Hoffmann, majority shareholder in Effecten-Spiegel AG, 
Duesseldorf, acquired the former GDR state agency ADN from the 
Treuhand privatization agency in May 1992. In December 1993 he 
merged it with Deutscher Depeschen Dienst (DDP), which he took 
over in 1983.

<F P=106> [Report signed "S. Pol.": "In Paris the Hypothesis of a </F>
Withdrawal of UN Troops Is Shaking the Majority"] 
  [Text] The debate on Bosnia took a lively turn yesterday 
within the majority and between the government and the deputies 
supporting it. The UDF [Union for French Democracy] group in 
the National Assembly asked that the UN Protection Forces 
mandate be extended "without waiting for the spring" in order to 
"remove the doubt of a withdrawal which is encouraging the Serbs 
to step up their offensive," at the very time when several RPR 
[Rally for the Republic] deputies are calling for the withdrawal 
of the Blue Helmets from Bosnia. 
  For the time being, the UDF is demanding that the UN forces 
be strengthened, reinforcements sent, and the military command 
provided with the "legal and practical means to take action," 
including air cover. "Impotence in face of the unbearable 
killing in Bosnia can no longer be tolerated. This conflict is 
now a test of the truth of democratic values, of the European 
Union's political existence, and of the crediblity of the new 
NATO doctrine," the UDF added. 
  During the defense commission meeting attended by [Defense 
Minister] Francois Leotard, several RPR deputies demanded either 
the withdrawal of the Blue Helmets in the fairly near future, or 
the use of military means. Those speaking in favor of 
withdrawal were Robert Andre Vivien (Val-de-Marne); Charles Cova 
(Seine-et-Marne); Pierre Lellouche (Val d'Oise), who is 
diplomatic adviser to Jacques Chirac; Jean-Bernard Raimond 
(Bouches-du-Rhone); and Robert Pandraud (Seine-Saint-Denis), a 
former minister, who said: "I wonder who now stands to gain from 
dying for Sarajevo; this is not 1914. When people want to kill 
each other, they kill each other, and they have been killing 
each other in the Balkans for centuries." 
  Rene Galy-Dejean (Paris) and Alain Marsaud (Haute-Vienne) 
advocated a tough intervention. In reply to Jacques Chirac, who 
wondered about the possibility of combining intervention and 
withdrawal, Defense Minister Francois Leotard said that France 
is envisaging the possibility of a withdrawal, but that it must 
be multilateral. "We must assess the consequences," he added, 
"because there could be a veritable bloodbath." An operation on 
Serbian territory, "a step in the escalation of the war," 
strikes him as inconceivable. As for an intervention against 
the 200 Serbian batteries around Sarajevo, he thinks it would 
require one and a half days for the targets to be destroyed and 
would prompt harsh reprisals against an unprotected city.

<F P=106> [Henri Paillard report: "Bosnia: Differences of Opinion </F>
Within the Majority"] 
  [Excerpt] By describing the United Nations as a 
"contraption" and criticizing its "military incapability" in 
Bosnia, Defense Minister Francois Leotard has prompted many 
reactions. According to persistent rumors, the most serious 
incident took place after the cabinet meeting during a meeting 
of the inner cabinet on Bosnia attended by Francois Mitterrand, 
Edouard Balladur, Alain Juppe, and Francois Leotard. 
  "A serious clash" apparently took place between the defense 
minister and the foreign minister. The Elysee [president's 
office] refused to make any comment, given that it concerned 
members of the government and the president of the Republic was 
not involved. During the cabinet meeting, the head of state 
"called to order," as the Elysee points out, those who are 
indulging in excessively strong statements. According to some 
members of the Elysee staff, however, no incident took place. 
These people merely refer to the foreign ministry's explanation. 
  The Defense Ministry stresses that, in addition to the 
general political agreement on Bosnia, there may be "differences 
of feeling and therefore differences in statements" between the 
armed forces chief and the head of diplomacy. 
  It is true that the diplomatic style is clear enough for 
those who know how to interpret it. Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Richard Duque was anxious to say that it is important not to 
"accuse the United Nations," thus reacting to the defense 
minister's rather fierce criticisms. The Quai d'Orsay [Foreign 
Ministry] spokesman also explained that "the United Nations is 
what the actions of the component states make it. There is no 
other source of legitimacy for the international community's 
operations than the United Nations." 
  He also said that the foreign minister and the UN secretary 
general had telephoned each other during the weekend. "Mr. 
Juppe reaffirmed that France wanted to work in harmony with the 
secretary general's office. France, as a permanent member of 
the Security Council, has a special responsibility," Richard 
Duque reaffirmed. 
  In view of the fact that several RPR [Rally for the 
Republic] 
deputies have called for the withdrawal of UN troops, Mr. Duque 
said that "the withdrawal of the Blue Helmets is not on the 
agenda and would raise serious problems," particularly the 
halting of humanitarian aid and a risk of the conflict 
spreading. The Quai d'Orsay said that "the deterioration in the 
situation ultimately presents the problem of how to maintain the 
UN Protection Force." 
<H5>  An "Inadequate" Position </H5>
  It is true that views differ, to say the least, among the 
many people following the affairs of the former Yugoslavia. 
Pierre Lellouche, RPR deputy for Seine-Saint-Denis and adviser 
to Jacques Chirac for political affairs, said that the UN 
soldiers should leave Bosnia "in March" if the warring sides had 
not reached agreement. 
  There is a degree of caution in the remarks regularly made 
on 
this Bosnian crisis. The deputies who are members of the 
Foreign Affairs Commission are asking questions about France's 
presence in that country rather than categorically demanding the 
withdrawal of the contingent. During recent meetings, only Jean 
de Lipowski, former secretary of state for foreign affairs, has 
asked for the withdrawal of French soldiers, holding the view 
that the UN attitude was "inadequate." The RPR deputy for 
Charente-Maritime had recently attacked the "sham" of the UN 
position. 
  At several meetings of this commission, deputies like 
Georges 
Gorse, Jacques Myard, and Didier Julia said they were "rather" 
in favor of a withdrawal. But the matter has never been 
expressed so categorically. Moreover, Robert Pandraud has had 
the opportunity to intervene on several occasions on the risks 
of the formation of a Muslim state in the corner of Europe. He 
was also very circumspect about the UN secretary general's 
attitude. Indeed, it seems that there is no clear split between 
the UDF [Union for French Democracy] and the RPR on what 
position to adopt, although in general the UDF may seem more 
favorable to the French forces remaining. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article signed A. Pu.: "Paris Seeks To Curb Trade Deficit"] </F>
  [Text] In committing itself not to sell any more offensive 
weapons to Taiwan, France aimed to do away with the barrier 
which prevented French companies from gaining a share of the 
Chinese market comparable to that of their foreign competitors 
in 1993. French companies are now "welcome to compete on an 
equal footing (in this market," said China's Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen during his official visit to France. 
  By bringing its relations with Beijing back to normal, 
France 
hopes to be able to take advantage of China's economic boom 
(annual growth rate of 14 percent) and thus to curb its trade 
deficit with this country, which has been steadily increasing 
since the mid-eighties. While it boasted a 2.5-billion-franc 
[Fr] surplus in 1985, France's trade balance with China suffered 
a Fr11.2-billion deficit in 1992. As for the exports-imports 
ratio, it went down to 39.7 percent in 1992 from 157 percent in 
1985. 
  However, statistics available for last year's first nine 
months indicate an improvement. The 1993 deficit should be 
comparable to that of 1992, a year during which France was 
China's 12th biggest supplier and customer. Major French 
corporations with a foothold in the Chinese market include car 
makers Peugeot, Citroen and Renault, as well as CGE [General 
Water Company], Alcatel-Alsthom, Elf-Sanofi, Rhone-Poulenc, and 
Lyonnaise des eaux [Lyon Water Company]. 
  Franco-Chinese trade is characterized by a typical 
industrialized nation/developing country relationship. Owing to 
its fast economic growth, China mainly purchases capital goods 
from France. In 1992, machinery and mechanical apparatus made 
up 23 percent of French exports to China; then came cars, car 
equipment and commercial vehicles (19 percent), electrical 
equipment (8 percent) and professional electronics (8 percent). 
France purchases consumer products from China, such as textile 
articles and clothes (21 percent of French imports in 1992), 
toys, sporting goods and jewelry (19 percent), shoes and leather 
goods (14 percent), and consumer electronics products (7 
percent). 
  While French exports to China increased by 30.2 percent over 
last year's first five months as compared to the same period of 
1992, Germany's exports went up by 89.8 percent, Italy's by 83.3 
percent, and Britain's by 52.3 percent. France's policy U-turn 
with respect to Beijing should therefore enable French companies 
to take full advantage of China's booming economy.

  [Text] Silvio Berlusconi has announced his candidacy on 
air. He has just announced his entry into politics. He will 
stand for Forza Italia at the forthcoming elections because, he 
said, he no longer wants to live in a country governed by 
immature forces, and desires to fight on the side of freedom as 
an alternative to the left. Berlusconi sent a video recording 
to public and private sector news bulletins. Here is the 
passage concerning his candidacy: 
  [Begin Berlusconi recording] I have decided to enter the 
fray 
and to concern myself with public affairs because I do not want 
to live in a country which is not liberal and is governed by 
immature forces and by men tied twice over to past political and 
economic failure. In order to live the new life I have chosen, 
today I tendered my resignation from all company positions in 
the group that I founded. I am therefore giving up my role as 
editor and businessman to put my experience and all my efforts 
at the disposal of a battle in which I believe with the utmost 
conviction and with the utmost strength. [end recording]

  [Text] Let us have a look at the first reactions to Silvio 
Berlusconi's statement [about entering politics]. Here is a 
report from Rocco Tolfa: 
  [Tolfa] Mario Segni tried to persuade Berlusconi not to 
enter the fray. Now that he has, Segni has said that his 
decision will not help the moderate grouping but make it more 
divided. 
  The Democratic Party of the Left spokesman in the Chamber of 
Deputies, Massimo d'Alema was curt: Berlusconi incites the 
hatred of one part of the country against another, and he is 
only raising his voice because he wants to conceal privileges 
and personal interests. 
  Spokesman for the Italian Popular Party Gerardo Bianco is 
also worried. He said: Berlusconi is the owner of a large news 
network. He ended by saying: There are risks for the proper 
functioning of democracy. He would have done better to continue 
in his role as a businessman. 
  Italian Republican Party secretary Giorgio La Malfa, in 
contrast, is neither pleased nor worried about Berlusconi's 
decision. 
  The Italian Social Democratic Party politician Ferri is 
pleased. He said: It is a positive thing and can help to build a 
liberal democratic grouping.

<F P=106> [Gianluca Luzi report on Italian People's Party Secretary </F>
Mino Martinazzoli remarks to journalists in Rome on 25 January 
in Rome: "Martinazzoli's `No'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- "[Pact for Italy leader] Segni is not our 
political agent. If Bossi, who is the League's leader, says 
that he does not want to talk with us, obviously I acknowledge 
the fact." Everyone was waiting for him outside PPI [Italian 
People's Party] headquarters and, before meeting with the 
nonconfessional socialists of the UDS [Union of Democrats and 
Socialists] and the PRI's [Italian Republican Party] Giorgio La 
Malfa, he confronted the wall of journalists. Martinazzoli was 
sharp and unyielding and gave no glimmer of a hope of an 
agreement with the League. He issued a warning to Segni [PPI 
Chairwoman] Jervolino went still further, describing an 
agreement with the Pact leader as "very, very unlikely," 
attacked Bossi, and leveled charges at Berlusconi. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Martinazzoli, do you not 
think that there is some common ground between the PPI and the 
League? After all, Bossi too wants the next legislature to be a 
constituent one. 
  [Martinazzoli] I regard it as an afterthought, a last-minute 
contrivance. To say that a legislature is constituent means 
absolutely nothing unless you specify in what way it will be 
constituent. 
  [Correspondent] Do you still regard your dialogue with Segni 
as open? 
  [Martinazzoli] That depends on Segni. 
  [Correspondent] But is he still your candidate for the 
premiership? 
  [Martinazzoli] Segni remains our interlocutor. We have 
granted him this possibility, but obviously Segni is no demiurge 
that can square the circle. Many have tried to do so, but 
nobody has succeeded. 
  [Correspondent] Are you not afraid that your party will 
remain isolated? 
  [Martinazzoli] The only danger would be if the new-born 
party 
were to decide to die. 
  [Correspondent] But do you not think that a bipolar 
arrangement is now an obligatory option, with this electoral 
system? 
  [Martinazzoli] What must be realized is that electoral rules 
are not a substitute for politics: They must be interpreted. 
It is Mr. Occhetto who invented this neurosis about a two-pole 
system, unfortunately; he is to blame. This restores old 
alignments, ancient controversies, obsolete arguments -- in 
other words, a complete mess. 
  [Correspondent] You said that the program signed yesterday 
is 
not neutral with regard to political accords. 
  [Martinazzoli] Political programs are not just any pieces of 
paper; indeed, they relate to the political forces that support 
them. 
  [Correspondent] Do you mean that [League lower house floor 
leader] Maroni's signature is not enough and that Bossi's is 
needed, too? 
  [Martinazzoli] I am not well acquainted with the League's 
rules. However, I see that Bossi called me a chicken thief. 
Perhaps that is the language of the new modern liberal democracy. 
  [Correspondent] Will you now seek a political and electoral 
agreement only with Segni's Pact? 
  [Martinazzoli] We said Saturday [22 January], and repeated 
yesterday, that we believe that alternation -- or, rather, the 
conditions for real alternation -- must be built around a 
polarity that is not a division between extremes. So we will 
continue our dialogue in the days ahead much more intensely than 
last week -- but not with vestiges, relics. 
  [Correspondent] Did you expect the agreement between Segni 
and the League? 
  [Martinazzoli] Frankly, I did not consider the possibility. 
  [Correspondent] Did you expect the League to subscribe to 
Segni's program? 
  [Martinazzoli] I do not see what the spectacular novelty 
is.... Throughout these past months I have observed that the 
League has an extraordinary capacity for change. Be that as it 
may, the League will be holding a congress shortly. We shall 
see what they have to say. 
  [Correspondent] Is your rejection of the agreement not a 
repudiation for [PPI ideologue] Buttiglione, who is pleased 
about the Segni-Maroni meeting? 
  [Martinazzoli] From his viewpoint, Buttiglione was right to 
be pleased. I too -- who am less of a philosopher than 
Buttiglione and therefore use a more direct language -- noted 
that the League had lost federalism along the way. So this is 
the reason for his satisfaction.... 
  [Correspondent] The fact remains that Buttiglione was in 
favor of it, and Mattarella and Bindi against it. 
  [Martinazzoli] Please do not ask me any more what Bindi 
thinks and what Formigoni thinks, and whether I will succeed in 
reconciling them. This, partly because if you were at the 
conference hall Saturday you will have seen who is in charge in 
this party -- and I say this without arrogance, though it has to 
be said from time to time. 
  [Correspondent] Will there be another meeting with Segni, 
who 
has stated his willingness? 
  [Martinazzoli]I should hope he is willing to meet with me. 
  [Correspondent] Does it not worry you to see the moderate 
front so divided, compared to the compact progressive front? 
  [Martinazzoli] What worries me is your distorted perception, 
because the left-wing front is by no means compact. What 
worries me is the fact that you all portray it as compact, and 
it rather irritates me. 
  [Correspondent] Do you not think that this is all just a 
game 
to involve [Fininvest President] Berlusconi? 
  [Martinazzoli] I do not know. My opinion is that Berlusconi 
entered the arena a while ago. He has encouraged the departure 
of some of my supporters, has issued ultimatums such as you 
would not give even to a waiter..., he has rewriten Italian 
history by arguing that Sturzo is to blame for having helped 
fascism. So I think he is fully involved. Perhaps he is 
something of a demiurge.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has said that the Greek 
Cypriots are trying to have the Turkish Cypriots accept 
everything before sitting at the negotiating table, and then 
play a game of bargaining for gaining even more advantages. 
  Denktas was speaking at Ercan [Tymbou] Airport before he 
went 
on a private visit to Istanbul this morning. He said that in 
today's papers he read that the Greek Cypriots will not attend 
the meetings on the confidence-building measures. However, he 
added, I do not have any official information confirming this. 
I hope this is not true. 
  Denktas said that the Turkish Cypriot side expects the Greek 
Cypriots to place their views on the table, approach, the points 
they accept and those they do not accept, and also, if they have 
any reservations, to inform the UN secretary general of them 
with a letter, like the Turkish Cypriot side did. He added: In 
this way, the duty of Mr. Clark and Mr. Feissel would be to work 
together to eliminate any conflicts there might exist in the 
documents posited by the two sides. 
  Denktas revealed that the United Nations found the Turkish 
Cypriot letter and document favorable. It is obvious, the 
president stressed, that the Turkish Cypriot side is showing its 
intent to reconcile. 
  Denktas pointed out that if he receives official information 
about the attitude of the Greek Cypriot side, and if he learns 
of the reasons of this attitude, then he can reply to them. 
  The president said that he did not have another telephone 
conversation with Joe Clark. 
  In a statement on arrival to Istanbul, Denktas reiterated 
that the Turkish Cypriot side has adopted a conciliatory 
attitude regarding the Cyprus problem. He pointed out that he 
held positive talks with Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's 
special envoy in Cyprus. Denktas added that the Turkish 
Cypriots will continue to show their goodwill. 
  The president recalled that the Turkish Cypriot side 
informed 
the UN secretary general with a letter that it will participate 
in the work on the confidence-building measures with a 
constructive and positive attitude. He said: The right thing 
to do, the natural thing to do, is for Kliridhis to write in a 
letter what he accepts, and if there is a difference of opinion 
between us, then we must sit at the negotiating table and 
resolve it between ourselves. 
  Denktas said he learned that Kliridhis did not find the 
Turkish Cypriot letter satisfactory and will therefore not 
attend the meetings. Denktas added: If Kliridhis is saying 
that he will not sit at the negotiating table unless the Turkish 
Cypriots concede to a certain line, and if he is trying to make 
us concede to that line without him making any concessions, then 
this is a distorted approach. 
  Replying to a question, Denktas said that the use of the 
Lefkosa [Nicosia] International Airport -- under UN observation 
-- by Turkish Cypriots is included in the agreement. Ercan 
Airport will continue to function too, he added.

  [Text] UN envoys Joe Clark and Gustave Feissel today 
briefed the ambassadors of the five UN Security Council [UNSC] 
permanent members in Nicosia on their deliberations with 
President Glavkos Kliridhis and [Turkish Cypriot Leader] Rauf 
Denktas on the confidence-building measures. The meeting took 
place at the Russian Embassy. 
  A statement read after the meeting by Boris Zenkov, Russian 
ambassador in Cyprus, noted that the five ambassadors called on 
all interested parties to reply promptly to the UN secretary 
general in a way that will allow the beginning of discussions on 
ways of implementing the package on confidence-building 
measures. The five ambassadors also reminded that the position 
of the five Security Council permanent members is that the 
package on Varosha and Nicosia's international airport will not 
only prove beneficial for the two communities but will have a 
significant effect in overcoming the current lack of confidence 
between the two sides. It will also facilitate an overall 
solution to the Cyprus issue. 
  The five ambassadors also referred to the Security Council's 
position that both sides are committed to full cooperation with 
the secretary general without delay in working promptly toward a 
general framework of agreement, the first stage of which is to 
reach agreement on the confidence-building measures package. 
  The statement also notes that Clark advised the five 
ambassadors that the leader of the Greek Cypriot side repeated 
its acceptance in principle of the package of 
confidence-building measures for Varosha and Nicosia 
international airport. He also reiterated his readiness to 
discuss ways to implement this package when the leader of the 
Turkish Cypriot side accepts as well. Clark noted that 
Kliridhis informed him of his intent to repeat his acceptance of 
the package in a letter to the secretary general. 
  Furthermore, the statement adds that Clark briefed the five 
ambassadors on Denktas' latest letter and his deliberations with 
the Turkish Cypriot leader on Monday [24 January] and Tuesday 
regarding the contents of the letter. Clark underlined the 
importance of insuring that the acceptance of the package by the 
Turkish Cypriot side will lead to the implementation of the 
package. 
  Speaking after the meeting, Clark said that he must be 
certain that both sides mean the same thing when they say they 
agree in principle with the confidence-building measures. He 
said: I have to say we have not reached that point. Clark 
expressed the hope that in the coming days and following his 
deliberations in Athens, Ankara, and Istanbul he will be able to 
tell the UN secretary general that there is agreement between 
the two sides on the same issue. 
  Asked whether he is optimistic, he said that a lot of 
distance has been covered. He also expressed the hope that both 
sides will show real willingness to take steps that will allow 
the implementation of the confidence-building measures. Clark 
refrained from commenting on Denktas' letter to the UN secretary 
general but added that after his discussions and deliberations 
with the Turkish Cypriot leader, he wants to make sure that the 
acceptance in principle will lead to discussing the 
implementation of the confidence-building measures.

  [Text] In a statement this afternoon before leaving for 
Athens, Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special 
representative in Cyprus, said Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktas did not give the United Nations a satisfactory answer on 
whether he accepts the confidence-building measures in 
principle. However, he appeared optimistic, saying that in his 
opinion, the negotiations are very close to reaching an 
agreement. Clark said: There is only one very significant step 
left.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis will send a letter to UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali outlining the positions of 
the Greek Cypriot side. Government spokesman Ioannis 
Kasoulidhis today said the letter is being prepared and must be 
sent by tomorrow. President Kliridhis informed the National 
Council of its content yesterday. 
  In light of developments, the political party leaders 
outlined their positions in statements to the Cyprus 
Broadcasting Corporation. 
  DISI [Democratic Rally] Chairman Ioannis Matsis said our 
side 
should turn toward discussing the substance of the Cyprus issue. 
He also said that the security issue should come at the 
beginning, which Rauf Denktas raised in his letter to the 
secretary general. Using the issue of security, Matsis said, we 
should turn toward international organizations and Europe and 
undertake initiatives and promote them at international 
decisionmaking centers. 
  AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] General 
Secretary Dhimitrios Khristofias said his party would be happy 
if in the end, our side's handling of policy results in 
disengagement from the discussion on the confidence-building 
measures with no political cost. Khristofias criticized our 
side, saying its handling of policy has led to many impasses and 
wasted time. Answering a question, he said he does not believe 
the secretary general will propose to return to a discussion of 
the substance of the Cyprus issue following the receipt of 
Kliridhis' letter. This, he said, should have been done a few 
months ago to achieve a specific result. 
  DIKO [Democratic Party] Chairman Spiros Kiprianou said that 
as things stand today, the only way out is to begin a dialogue 
on the substance of the Cyprus issue, putting forward issues 
relating to security and demilitarization. He also said he is 
optimistic for the long term on condition that we follow the 
correct policy and struggle in the right way. He added that 
this is subject to full cooperation with Athens. Kiprianou said 
that now is the time to hold a conference in Athens and added 
that he will raise the issue of a trip to Athens, even if it is 
only for the members of the National Council. 
  Socialist EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] Chairman 
Vasos Lissaridhis noted that with is stance since Kliridhis 
accepted the confidence-building measures and his recent letter 
suggesting that every measure be included in an overall 
discussion of the Cyprus issue, Denktas had offered a golden 
opportunity. Let us grasp what Denktas says and let us ask, 
finally, for a discussion of the substance of the Cyprus issue, 
Lissaridhis said. He added that he does not believe the 
secretary general or any country will say that our demand to 
discuss the substance of the Cyprus issue is illogical. 
  Konstandinos Themistokleous, vice president of the 
Democratic 
Socialist Renewal Movement [ADISOK], said our side should 
reaffirm its position that it accepts no regulation that would 
imply recognition of the pseudostate and will discuss all the 
other issues connected with the three documents [on the 
confidence-building measures]. Themistokleous said we cannot 
appear to be negative in our effort to discuss the 
confidence-building measures, because the United Nations 
considers that both sides now accept the measures in principle. 
He also said that the confidence-building measures are valid as 
a single package and cannot be implemented in stages. 
  Free Democrats Movement Chairman Yeoryios Vasiliou said the 
procedure being formulated now is dangerous. He said Turkey 
aims to maintain the status quo and if we enter a continuing 
dialogue on what Denktas does and does not mean, Turkey will be 
very happy. He said we cannot overcome the impasse by 
retreating or give the impression that we are retreating, 
because it will lead us into conflict with the United Nations 
and create a negative picture of our side for the world.

confidence-building measures submitted by UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali as balanced and scrupulous and called on the 
two sides to accept it. We doubt whether the U.S. President has 
found time to deal with Butrus-Ghali's confidence-building 
measures. Some employees at the White House or State Department 
have again written the President's report, which appears to be 
three months late. Consequently, Clinton's report is outdated 
and out of touch with reality. Cypriot Hellenism demands that 
the U.S. President view the Cyprus issue seriously and honestly 
and stop acting as others have. He promised in Brussels that 
when he returned to Washington he would personally deal with the 
Cyprus issue. Instead of dealing with the substance and trying 
to promote an honest solution, he is signing documents presented 
to him by officials and submitting worthless reports written by 
bureaucrats. Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special 
coordinator on the Cyprus issue, will come to Cyprus at the 
weekend but it appears that he will come to resuscitate the 
confidence-building measures. Unfortunately, the Americans do 
not appear willing to get seriously and effectively involved in 
the Cyprus issue and this disappoints Cypriot Hellenism.

  [Excerpt] Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky this morning 
began an official visit to Athens. Soon after arriving, the 
Austrian chancellor had a 30-minute meeting with Prime Minister 
Andreas Papandreou. Papandreou said afterward that their talks 
covered issues relating to Austria's accession to the European 
Union. We are committed, the Greek prime minister and president 
of the European Union said, to achieving the interstate 
agreements for the accession of European Free Trade Association 
countries by March. 
  The Austrian chancellor referred to his friendship with 
Papandreou and announced that a group of specialists has 
undertaken to give a new push to the negotiating package on 
issues of regional, agriculture, and land transit and transport 
policy. Asked what stance his country will take on the issue of 
Cyprus' accession to the European Union, the Austrian chancellor 
said it will be positive. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by P. Alisanoglou: "Drilling in Oil Deposit Larger </F>
Than Prinos"] 
  [Text] The NAPC [expansion unknown] Consortium decided 
suddenly to start two new drilling operations beginning 
yesterday in an oil deposit it regarded until now as 
"uneconomic." 
  The deposit is located west of Thasos Island and according 
to 
data the NAPC has (exclusively) the new deposit is larger than 
that of Prinos. 
  The decision of the foreign Consortium was reached in 
Toronto, Canada, in the presence of all the big stockholders and 
confirms TA NEA information, which claimed in 1979-1980 that 
"NAPC has found oil west of Prinos but closed the well for 
unexplainable reasons." The justification offered at the time by 
NAPC that presumably the deposit west of Thasos was small and 
that the return on drilling was to be marginal, was not valid. 
This is borne out now, because the NAPC managers would have 
never spent $15,000 to $20,000 -- if not more -- to conduct 
exploratory-productive drilling operations in a "small" deposit. 
They knew in advance the potential and the daily yield of the 
new oil deposit and they were waiting for the proper time to 
revise their contract while the New Democracy was in office to 
open the "well" of western Thasos with its assured oil deposits 
which for them constituted a safe "reservoir." 
<H5>  The Ministry </H5>
  The Ministry of Industry said this in an official statement: 
  "After a long period of inactivity during the previous 
government, the drilling in `northern Prinos' is now under way 
in the second section of the Prinos oil exploration region. The 
Public Petroleum Corporation and Hydro-Carbonate Exploitation 
[DEP-EKY] is a participant in this region with a 15-percent 
share in the consortium which will undertake the drilling 
according to the revised contract of 9 December 1987 which was 
ratified by Law 1769/1988. 
  "The significance of this drilling is that the potential 
discovery of an oil deposit will extend the life of the existing 
deposit in Prinos while it will require a minimum investment 
since the exploitation will utilize the existing installations 
of Prinos." 
<H5>  The Contract </H5>
  DEP-EKY data indicate that the objective of the drilling is 
"to find out any serious indication for an oil deposit." 
  Nevertheless, trade union circles note among other things 
that, with the drilling taking place without previously setting 
in motion the process for the vision of the law that was enacted 
by the New Democracy shortly before the election, the charges 
and revelations of those being then in the opposition are 
totally wasted. 
  It is noted in this regard that the DEP-EKY management 
should 
have informed the political leadership of the Ministry of 
Industry. With this drilling, an investment of some $15 million 
is being made in effect which according to the law (recommended 
by the then-president of DEP-EKY Goulas) will be paid off 
through the cost of the oil. In other words, in addition to all 
the other concessions we have made, we allow the consortium to 
do this, thereby reducing even further the Greek share. The 
contractor evidently will inflate these costs (as it did in 
Prinos) to keep a greater amount. Moreover, this cost will be 
borrowed and therefore subject to interest payments. 
  Regarding this contract which will result in tens of 
millions 
of dollars in losses for the Greek State, the Association of 
DEP-EKY Personnel (its chairman is a member of the company's 
board of directors) had presented the following charges on June 
22, 1993. 
  a. The consortium tax rate is reduced from 50 percent to 40 
percent. 
  b. The depreciation rate of the consortium is increased 
while 
the percentage share of the Greek State is decreased. 
  Based on the annual extraction of oil, the depreciation rate 
for the consortium ranges from 58 to 90 percent (it was 40 
percent) and the participation share of the Greek State from 20 
percent to 5 percent (it was 30 percent). 
  c. The Greek state will receive its share from the sale of 
oil once a year and not on a monthly basis as was the case until 
now, thereby losing several millions [of dollars] from lost 
interest.

  [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina President Alija Izetbegovic has 
declared that peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina can be achieved 
through a NATO air operation. 
  In a statement at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, where he 
stopped over en route from Malaysia to his country, Izetbegovic 
said that the efforts of the UN Security Council and 
international organizations have so far failed to stop the 
Serbs. A NATO operation would bring peace, Izetbegovic 
reiterated, adding that the delay in such an operation has 
caused the deaths of 200,000 people and the occupation of 70 
percent of his country's territory. 
  In response to a question on the Turkish and Pakistani prime 
ministers' plans to go to Sarajevo, Izetbegovic said: Let them 
garner their courage and come. We are waiting for them. 
  Commenting on his visit to Malaysia, Izetbegovic explained 
that he was very pleased with his brief visit and received 
significant support from the Malaysian Government. 
  In his statement after seeing Izetbegovic off, Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin said that the recent developments 
concerning Bosnia-Herzegovina were assessed. Cetin remarked 
that during the meeting with Izetbegovic, views were also 
exchanged on the conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina to be held in 
Geneva on 10 February.

  [Text] Israeli President Ezer Weizman, in Turkey on an 
official visit upon the invitation of President Suleyman 
Demirel, has concluded the Ankara leg of his visit. 
  Demirel stated that Turkey and Israel confirmed their 
determination in working toward regional solidarity and 
cooperation. The guest president was ceremoniously seen off at 
the Cankaya Mansion. After the Israeli and Turkish national 
anthems, Weizman and Demirel inspected the honor guard. Weizman 
parted from Husamettin Cindoruk, Turkish Grand National Assembly 
speaker; Prime Minister Tansu Ciller; General Dogan Gures, chief 
of the General Staff; Constitutional Court President Yekta 
Gungor Ozdem; and other officials. 
  In a speech, he delivered at the ceremony, Demirel stated 
that his meetings with Weizman proved that both Israel and 
Turkey had the political will needed to develop bilateral 
relations. Pointing out that there must be expansion in all the 
areas discussed, Demirel added that the economic relations will 
be developed within a very extensive framework. Demirel said 
that arrangements were under way to complete, in a couple of 
months, the legal infrastructure needed to develop the economic 
and commercial relations between the two countries. Demirel 
further announced more cooperation in the defense industry, 
agriculture, tourism, industry, energy, and contractor work. 
  Demirel said: The Middle East is being restructured at the 
present time. Elevating the standard of living and eliminating 
terrorism from the region are two key elements needed for 
stability there. These conditions are directly linked to the 
development of the Middle East peace process and Turkey and 
Israel confirmed their determination to undertake every effort 
necessary toward achieving them -- through regional cooperation 
and solidarity. 
  In the speech, he delivered at the ceremony, Weizman said 
that his visit was extremely beneficial for future relations 
between Turkey and Israel. Pointing out that world and regional 
peace will benefit enormously from the development of the 
solidarity and cooperation between the two countries, Weizman 
added that he is persuaded that Turkey will continue to 
contribute positively to the Middle East peace process. 
Indicating that he had extended an invitation to Demirel, 
Weizman added that it would give him great pleasure if Demirel 
would visit Israel as soon as possible. 
  Meanwhile, Demirel presented Weizman with a photo album of 
pictures of the visit. Weizman later departed from Ankara's 
Esenboga Airport to Sanliurfa. The guest president will be 
conducting a study tour of the Ataturk Dam and other various 
installations. Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and State Minister 
Nurhan Tekinel will be accompanying Weizman on his tour of the 
GAP [Southeast Anatolia Project]. Weizman will be leaving 
Sanliurfa for Istanbul during the evening hours. He will be 
leaving Turkey after visiting the historical and touristic 
sights of Istanbul.

<F P=106> [Report by K. Deniz Ogut] </F>
  [Excerpts] Azerbaijan's postponement of the "Turkic 
Republics" summit, which was due to have been held in Baku, 
shocked Ankara. [passage omitted] 
  The summit was postponed in line with a request from Russia, 
which is following a "backyard" policy on Central Asia and the 
Caucasus. This process, which started with the dispatch of 
Russian troops to Tajikistan, continued with the solution of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict on a Russian initiative and Moscow's 
intervention in the continuing Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. 
Realizing they can achieve lasting peace only by siding with 
Russia, Georgia and Azerbaijan joined the CIS. From then on, 
Russia has said: "If unity is needed, we already have the CIS; 
we do not want a summit of the Turkic republics." 
<H5>  A Dream Collapsed Within Four Days </H5>
  Recent military victories by the Azerbaijanis against the 
Armenians are due to Moscow helping Baku, which is acting in 
tandem with the Russians. In return, Baku postponed the "Turkic 
summit." [passage omitted] 
  Turkey's broken dream is not the only result of the 
postponement of the Baku summit. What really faded was the 
illusion of a share in the Caucasian and Central Asian cake by 
acting as a front for the West. Trying to establish ties with 
the former Soviet republics, Turkey acted as the representative 
of the IMF, World Bank, similar other imperialist institutions, 
and NATO. In line with these institutions' desires, Turkey 
advised them to follow an unbridled privatization program. This 
was Turkey's thinking to create "a Turkic world extending from 
the Adriatic to the Wall of China." It did not happen. 
<H5>  Shaman Dance by Turkes, Demirel, and Inonu </H5>
  In agreement with the United States, Yeltsin has now 
declared 
the region part of his responsibility. Turkey, which failed to 
develop its own independent ties with these republics, has 
remained helpless in the face of this new development. 
  Privately, the Russians are saying: "We had relations with 
these republics for many years and will continue to have 
relations. Why did Turkey start to utter the slogan `From the 
Adriatic to the Wall of China?' This frightened us." The 
Russians tease: "Now, Turkish officials are reacting to 
Zhirinovskiy's statements. Well, weren't we supposed to be 
concerned when Turkes, Demirel, and Inonu were organizing Turkic 
world meetings in Antalya and, like Shamans in our Siberia, 
dancing around fire and hammering the iron on the anvil?"

  [Excerpt] A group of Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] 
terrorists killed 20 people, including four village guards, in 
two villages in Mardin's Savur district. For the first time, 
the terrorists used toxic explosives to attack the villages. 
  Two PKK groups attacked Ormancik and Akyurek at about 2000 
last night. The village guards resisted and clashes continued 
until the early hours of the morning. Several women and 
children gathered in a house during the clashes. The PKK 
terrorists fired on the house and threw hand grenades and toxic 
explosives into the building before leaving the area. Several 
explosions occurred in the house. Officials have said that 15 
people were killed and eight others, affected by the explosives, 
were taken to hospital to receive medical treatment. A 
12-year-old child died en route to the university hospital in 
Dicle. The officials said that two terrorists were killed in 
the clashes. 
  They also said that for the first time, the PKK militants 
used toxic explosives in their attacks on the villages. But 
they declined to reveal the type of explosives or their 
effectiveness. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Stefan Petersen: "Danish Air Force Takes Draken </F>
Out of Service--The F-16 and Nothing Else"] 
  [Text] The Danish Air Force must accomplish its 
combat missions with the Fighting Falcon alone until at least 
the year 2010. In addition to national defense, it will in the 
future participate in the NATO reaction forces and in UN 
missions. 
  "Not very big, but topnotch." This motto, which has been 
taking quite a battering in the course of the cutbacks taking 
place all over, could also serve as a campaign slogan of the 
Royal Danish Air Force. Unlike other countries, however, it 
appears that Denmark may also be able to turn this idea into 
reality. Here, too, of course, there is a need to economize and 
to reduce in size, but the objective of keeping the combat 
effectiveness of the Kongelige Danske Flyvevabnet at a high 
level is not being overlooked in the process. Organizational 
belt-tightening and cutbacks in personnel, together with alert 
unit reductions in surface-to-air missile units, are to help 
keep the impact on the quality of the flying component as small 
as possible. 
  Nevertheless, this component, too, must accept a 
quantitative 
decrease. Following the deactivation already in 1992 of the Saab 
F-35 Draken-equipped 725th Squadron, the second of the two 
Draken squadrons formerly stationed in Karup ceased its flying 
operations at the end of 1993, thus making the Flyvevabnet a 
purely F-16 Air Force. Until 31 December, the 729th Squadron 
still had the dual role of reconnaissance and fighter-bomber 
unit, which it carried out with a mix of F-35 fighter-bombers, 
RF-35 reconnaissance aircraft, and TF-35 trainers. As of 1 
January 1994, the reconnaissance role will go to the 726th 
Squadron in Aalborg; a reconnaissance pod developed by Danish 
industry will provide the F-16 with the necessary capabilities. 
  Aalborg is home to two F-16 squadrons. In addition to the 
726th Squadron, the 723d Squadron is also stationed here in the 
northern part of Jutland. The other two Fighting Falcon units of 
the Flyvevabnet, the 727th Squadron and the 730th Squadron, fly 
their missions out of Skrydstrup. All four squadrons utilize 
their F-16A both as fighters and as fighter-bombers, and 
additionally assigned to each squadron are a number of F-16B as 
combat trainers. Officially, an F-16 training unit as such does 
not exist: In Skrydstrup, however, there is a training component 
for the retraining of new F-16 pilots, in which flight 
instructors from all the Fighting Falcon squadrons have been 
drawn together. 
  Of the originally assigned 54 F-16A and 16 F-16B, 63 still 
exist. Five single-seaters and two twin-seaters were lost during 
accidents. Three used Fighting Falcons are to be newly procured 
as replacements for the aircraft that were lost; the purchase of 
seven more is being considered. To this end, Denmark is 
currently negotiating with the Netherlands, Belgium, and the 
United States. From 1994 on, all Danish F-16 aircraft will 
undergo the multinational midlife-update program which is being 
carried out by the original F-16-operating countries Norway, 
Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United States, since 
the Fighting Falcon are, after all, to remain in service with 
the Flyvevabnet for another 20 years or so. 
  Only of limited size is the transport and SAR 
[search-and-rescue] component of the Flyvevabnet, which is based 
in Vaerloese near Copenhagen. The 721st Squadron has three 
Lockheed C-130H Hercules and three Grumman Gulfstream III 
assigned for transport missions, as well as a number of Saab 
T-17 Supporters as liaison aircraft; eight Sikorsky S-61A Sea 
King helicopters fly search-and-rescue missions for the 722d 
Squadron. Search-and-rescue field detachments are located at 
Aalborg and Skrydstrup, each with one Sea King permanently 
assigned. In addition, one S-61 is stationed at Roenne on the 
island of Bornholm in the winter. The air transport fleet is 
tailored to the special geographic situation of the territories 
belonging to Denmark; aside from tactical air transport 
operations, it also monitors fishing operations in the area of 
Greenland. 
  The flying school of the Royal Danish Air Force, in which 
classification training of future pilots is carried out with 
T-17 aircraft, was reassigned on 1 February 1993 from Avnoe to 
Karup. Following their screening at the flying school, students 
qualified for jet aircraft go to Sheppard in Texas to undergo 
the Euro-NATO joint jet pilot training program. For Denmark as 
well as most of the other NATO countries of Europe, 
participation in this program continues to be the most 
economical and most effective means to train their jet pilots. 
There are no female jet pilots in the Flyvevabnet as yet; there 
are, however, female helicopter pilots for the Westland Sea King. 
  Organizationally, the Danish Air Force consists of two main 
components. Responsible for flight operations is the 
Flyvertaktisk Command, known in NATO parlance as the Tactical 
Air Command Denmark (TACDEN); responsible for support is the 
Flyvemateriel Command. Since 1 September 1993, the tactical 
component has undergone a belt-tightening process and has been 
patterned after this structure: TACDEN now likewise consists of 
an operational and a logistic component. Aside from the 
operational bases at Aalborg, Karup, Skrydstrup, and Vaerloese, 
the two airfields at Tirstrup and Vandel that are earmarked for 
use by allied reinforcement units--the latter occupied in 
peacetime by Army aviation units--and the flying squadrons, 
eight surface-to-air missile batteries equipped with the 
improved Hawk, all units responsible for airspace surveillance, 
as well as the schools of the Flyvevabnet, are also subordinate 
to the TACDEN. 
  In the operational area, the reduction of the Danish Air 
Force from the original 9,500 to the current 8,000 was achieved 
primarily through the deactivation of the two Draken squadrons 
and reductions in the number of active surface-to-air missile 
personnel. As a result, the Air Force depends more than ever 
today on mobilization. The 8,000 personnel on active duty are 
joined by 11,000 reservists plus 10,000 members of the Danish 
home defense force and the airspace observer corps, thus giving 
the Flyvevabnet a total of 29,000 members in a national 
emergency. The reorganization of the NATO structure also brought 
about a change in the organizational assignment of Denmark and 
its armed forces: Since 1 October 1993, the Flyvevabnet has been 
subordinate to the allied Central Europe command sector. 
  The mission of the Air Force was not changed in the process, 
it was simply expanded through its participation in the crisis 
reaction forces of the alliance. In peacetime, the surveillance 
of Danish airspace is assured by two F-16 aircraft which, 
alternating between Aalborg and Skrydstrup, are kept for a week 
at a time on five-minute alert status around the clock for 
air-policing missions. In addition, two reconnaissance aircraft 
are kept on four-hour alert to photograph foreign vessels 
spotted off the coasts of Denmark. These alerts were not changed 
in any way following the end of the East-West conflict.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Fogh, Commander of the </F>
Tactical Air Command, by Stefan Petersen: "All Six Bases Will 
Be Retained"] 
  [Petersen] During the Cold War, Denmark, thanks to its 
geostrategic location, served as NATO's goaltender for the exits 
from the Baltic Sea. What are the missions of the Danish Air 
Force today? 
  [Fogh] The primary mission continues to be national defense 
within NATO, albeit with reduced forces. Even though no direct 
threat is visible any longer, no one knows what the future will 
bring. To be on the safe side, adequate defense resources must 
be kept in readiness in the event of a renewed threat; 
especially in the case of modern air forces, we cannot wait 
until they are needed and then try to create them overnight. The 
absorption of British and American reinforcement units in case 
of war likewise continues to be planned. 
  Newly added is the mission of making resources available for 
out-of-area operations by NATO crisis reaction forces and for UN 
operations. Based on current plans, the Flyvevabnet will 
probably participate in the rapid reaction forces with one F-16 
squadron. 
  [Petersen] What practical effects have reductions had in the 
Danish Air Force? Are there any serious problems? 
  [Fogh] No problems, but a lot of work to adapt the 
organization of the Air Force to the new realities. With the two 
Draken squadrons [formerly] in Karup, we lose two flying units, 
but all six operational bases of the Flyvevabnet will be 
retained. At least for the time being no base closures are 
planned. As compensation [for the loss of the two Draken 
squadrons], the Air Force flight school was moved to Karup in 
February 1993. To safeguard as many jobs in that region as 
possible, a civilian firm named Danish Aerotech is also being 
established there, which will take over facilities and personnel 
of the two deactivated squadrons. This firm will be charged with 
carrying out maintenance work for the Danish Air Force in the 
future. Additional savings are realized through the reduction in 
the peacetime manning of the eight Hawk squadrons by one-third, 
as well as by a reduction of the administration. 
  [Petersen] Following the deactivation of the Draken, the 
Fighting Falcon is the only jet combat aircraft in the Danish 
Air Force. What steps are planned to upgrade the combat 
effectiveness of the Danish F-16? 
  [Fogh] The production phase of the multinational 
midlife-update program begins in 1994 and includes a 
higher-performance radar system, a Beyond-Visual-Range 
capability, an improved self-defense capability, the 
installation of a GPS [Global Positioning System] and a new 
head-up display, as well as an improved cockpit layout. The 
Fighting Falcon will be operational until the year 2010/2015; 
its combat effectiveness is to be maintained in any case. In the 
Flyvevabnet, we must place the main emphasis on the quality of 
personnel and materiel, otherwise we will sink into a state of 
insignificance. An air force as small as ours cannot impress 
anybody by its number of aircraft alone.

  [Text] The Nordic foreign ministers hope that the new 
Russian Federal Assembly will continue reforms. The Nordic 
foreign ministers have had talks in Stockholm about developments 
in Russia and the Baltic countries. The Nordic countries will 
assist the Baltic countries in setting up their own peacekeeping 
force. 
  [Correspondent Mikko Maeaettaelae] The Nordic foreign 
ministers gathered in Stockholm, who were joined by the newcomer 
Tore Godal of Norway, devoted a large part of their talks to 
issues in areas in their close vicinity. Finnish Foreign 
Minister Heikki Haavisto commented on the latest news from 
Russia on the resignation of Finance Minister Fedorov by voicing 
the hope that he would be replaced by an equally good man. On 
the other hand, Haavisto suspects that the reform policy in 
Russia will slow down. 
  The Nordic foreign ministers point to the aggressive 
nationalist trends appearing in Russia, voicing the hope that 
Russia will adhere to the foreign policy it has chosen and that 
it will become closer to the rest of Europe. The hope is 
expressed that Russia will respect the inviolability of other 
states. The foreign ministers urge Russia and, on the other 
hand, Estonia and Latvia to reach an agreement on the withdrawal 
of Russian troops from the Baltics. This is what Foreign 
Minister Heikki Haavisto had to say: 
  [Begin recording] [Haavisto] It is based on the 
international 
treaties concluded and it would increase stability here in 
northern Europe, in our close vicinity. 
  [Maeaettaelae] How rapid a withdrawal would the Nordic 
countries wish for? 
  [Haavisto] As I have seen it, the issue between these Baltic 
countries and Russia has been that withdrawal should take place 
by the autumn. 
  [Maeaettaelae] The Danish defense minister has said that a 
new cold war can be expected in Europe unless Russia withdraws 
its troops from the Baltics. What do you say to this? 
  [Haavisto] I don't think it is a question of that. These 
countries are now having businesslike talks with each other and 
I believe that they will be acting in accordance with the 
principles as they have promised at various international 
conferences. [end recording] 
  [Maeaettaelae] The Nordic foreign ministers take a positive 
view of the fact that the Baltic countries are joining 
peacekeeping work. The Nordic countries are prepared to assist 
the Baltic countries in establishing a peacekeeping unit 
operating under the auspices of either the United Nations or the 
CSCE. This is what Foreign Minister Haavisto has to say about 
Finland's ways of helping: 
  [Begin recording] [Haavisto] Well, mainly in training. We 
have considered that we have the capacity in Niinisalo to take 
on pupils for training from the Baltic countries -- that is the 
primary way in which we are taking part. 
  [Maeaettaelae] Is this in fact military assistance? 
  [Haavisto] No, this is purely training specifically for 
peacekeeping duties. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "All Right: `Yes' or `No'"] </F>
  [Text] The working group charged with organizing the EU 
[European Union] plebiscite has finally decided against the 
pitfall of having three choices on the ballot and has announced 
its support for a clear "yes" or "no" for membership. These will 
be Finland's only alternatives after negotiations are concluded. 
It would therefore be wrong to offer voters a "don't know" 
choice. Obviously none of the three choices would get a 
majority, so that the government and parliament would have been 
able to interpret the results of an advisory vote any way they 
saw fit. 
  The working group had floundered about in the law regarding 
conducting plebiscites, which provides for the possibility of 
vote choices that are neither for or against. Fortunately, clear 
heads won out in this dispute over legalities, and the working 
group decided the issue unconditionally: that the procedural 
legislation was not applicable here. And in reality, there are 
no other choices than yes or no regarding EU membership. Nor 
should there be more than two choices provided in other 
plebiscites. 
  According to the most recent HELSINGIN SANOMAT-Gallup poll, 
the percentage of those favoring EU membership has remained 
steady at 41 percent. The figure for those against, however, has 
gone down precipitously: for January 27 percent, while as late 
as November it was 41 percent, and in December 43 percent. 
Correspondingly, the figure for the "don't know" group has grown 
steeply to 32 percent. 
  A third of voters are thusly confused about membership or 
have not made up their mind. The outcome of negotiations and the 
subsequent assessment of it will affect their final position. If 
the negotiations are completed more rapidly than scheduled, at 
the latest by the end of March, the plebiscite could be held in 
September or October.

<F P=106> [Morten Fyhn report: "Warm Defense of Whaling"] </F>
  [Text] Strasbourg -- Yesterday Gro Harlem Brundtland 
defended Norwegian whaling in a heated showdown with opponents 
in the European Parliament. 
  "There is a logic in our arguments, and that is something 
that they must understand," a pugnacious Norwegian prime 
minister said after a short and intense debate with the many 
friends of the minke whale at an open meeting with the European 
Parliament. But the Members of the European Parliament [MEPs] 
did not allow themselves to be convinced in any way by Norway's 
well known scientific arguments regarding whaling. For them 
this is and remains a question of emotions and morals. 
  Whaling became a central topic when the MEPs were able to 
put 
questions. But none of them threatened to vote against 
Norwegian EU [European Union] membership if hunting of the minke 
whale continues. On the contrary, a large number of the critics 
of whaling said that they would very much like to have Norway as 
a member of the EU. 
  The parliament's criticism of whaling was chiefly voiced by 
British animal lovers -- both Conservative and socialist. 
  Norwegian seal hunting is also a popular hate issue in 
Strasbourg, and several MEPs mentioned the use of clubs on 
innocent seal cubs. Nor could they understand why Norway wants 
to sell sealskins. 
  Prime Minister Harlem Brundtland was both well prepared and 
ready for action yesterday. She lectured the gathering on what 
will happen if we start to make emotions instead of scientific 
arguments the basis for international decisions on the 
defensible management of animal species. She admitted that it 
would be much more pleasant for Norway to give in, but made it 
clear that there can be no question of this. 
  "And why do we want to sell sealskin? Because we believe 
that we have a logical and a good ecological policy," she said. 
However, the prime minister seemed to be hinting that this is a 
demand that Norway could give way on in the negotiations with 
the EU: "We will have to wait and see what we can achieve," she 
said. 
  The prime minister zealously defended Norway's attempts to 
be 
allowed to retain not only its monopoly on alcohol sales, but 
also its wholesale and production monopolies. British socialist 
MEP Gary Titley was unable to understand why the solution agreed 
with Sweden and Finland is not good enough for Norway. Harlem 
Brundtland admitted that in the context of the EEA [European 
Economic Area] the Norwegian Government had been dependent on 
the support of the Christian People's party, but said that 
another consideration is the ability to limit the freedom to 
open the doors to alcohol everywhere. "This is not 
protectionism," she said. 
  In her introductory remarks to the MEPs the prime minister 
gave a detailed account of why Norway has applied for EU 
membership. She assured them that Norway is working hard to be 
able to complete the negotiations before the March deadline that 
has been set so that the European Parliament will be able to 
debate and vote on the outcome of the negotiations in May, and 
said that after that Norway will need five to six months to 
prepared a referendum.

  [Excerpt] In the conflict over President Klestil's private 
life, the fronts were clear on Tuesday [25 January]. According 
to a statement issued by the President's Office, Klestil will 
remain separated from his wife Edith and will carry out his 
official duties without her. 
  Envoy Margot Loeffler, who holds a leading position in the 
Office of the President -- she is involved in the president's 
private problems because of her close relationship with the 
president -- has submitted a request to Foreign Minister Alois 
Mock for a transfer abroad at the earliest opportunity. 
  According to the President's Office, the president's 
decision 
to remain separated from his wife was preceded by efforts to 
clarify the situation with his wife in the presence of his 
children living in Austria. Much to his regret, Klestil had 
reached the conclusion that the couple will remain separated, he 
announced. 
  Klestil regretted Loeffler's plan to leave the President's 
Office, referring to her achievements in reorganizing it.

<F P=106> [Unaattributed article: "Disarmament Conference in Geneva: </F>
The Way to Nuclear Test Ban"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA 
database] 
  [Text] Geneva, 25 Jan (ATSA) -- The opening of talks on a 
nuclear test ban marked the resumption of the Conference on 
Disarmament in Geneva on Tuesday [25 January]. The United 
States, which refused Iraqi participation in the conference, 
joined France in criticizing the "nuclear ambitions" of North 
Korea. 
  In a message to the Conference on Disarmament, U.S. 
President 
Clinton underlined on Tuesday that "the first priority" is to 
quickly conclude a treaty on a complete ban of all nuclear 
tests. This objective was made possible in light of the 
consensus reached among the five recognized nuclear powers 
(China, United States, France, Great Britain, and Russia) in 
1993. 
  However, French Ambassador Gerard Errera, who was elected 
conference president, noted that "it is hardly conceivable that 
the five powers will agree to impose new constraints on 
themselves if other countries remain free to develop clandestine 
nuclear armament programs." 
<H5>  North Korea Condemned </H5>
  Ambassador Errera denounced the refusal by North Korea to 
"meet its international commitments in the field of 
nonproliferation." That country is opposed to the inspection of 
facilities which are suspected of engaging in the development of 
atomic bombs. 
  John Holum, director of the U.S. Disarmament Agency, 
mentioned the possibility of a nuclear arms race in the Middle 
East and between India and Pakistan, but he also pointed out the 
progress made in Latin America and Africa in this regard. 
<H5>  Enlargement </H5>
  An issue to be solved is the enlargement of the membership 
of 
the Conference on Disarmament (currently 37 states), so as to 
allow a better regional breakdown and to include "threshold 
countries" which have the capability of acquiring the nuclear 
bomb. 
  The United States recalled on Tuesday that it did not oppose 
an application by North Korea. It turned down Iraq's request, 
however, as that country is under UN Security Council sanctions 
and "disregards" UN resolutions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Klaus Kinkel, FDP Chairman and foreign </F>
minister, by Martin S. Lambeck in Bonn; date not given: 
"Liberals Keep CDU/CSU Waiting"] 
  [Text] [Lambeck] Mr. Kinkel, after the strategic summit 
of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union 
[CDU/CSU] in Munich, Helmut Kohl clearly stated that the CDU and 
the CSU want to continue the coalition with the Free Democratic 
Party of Germany [FDP]. Do you also want to continue the 
alliance with the CDU/CSU? 
  [Kinkel] I am, of course, pleased that the chancellor and 
Mr. Waigel said that they want to continue the alliance with the 
FDP. Despite all the forebodings, we have achieved remarkable 
things in a difficult time. I have always said that I do not 
want to make a statement on a coalition without coordinating it 
with the FDP's executive bodies. We will decide before each of 
the 18 elections this year whether and when we will make a 
statement on a coalition and, if possible, what it will be like; 
this will also be done before the Bundestag elections. I am 
proceeding on the assumption that it is more likely that a 
statement on a coalition will be made. 
  [Lambeck] The chancellor said in Munich that he expected the 
FDP to revise its position on the "great bugging campaign" at 
its party congress in Rostock. Have you indicated a change on 
this issue to Helmut Kohl? 
  [Kinkel] I have not. My personal attitude toward this 
question is known. I have always said, and said as early as the 
time of the party congress in Muenster, that the vote of the 
party congress is binding on me. We voted against the bugging 
campaign with a two-thirds majority in Muenster. Nevertheless, 
there can be different opinions on such a difficult legal and 
political question. 
  [Lambeck] Theo Waigel has demanded that the FDP vote for the 
CDU/CSU presidential candidate, Roman Herzog, in the decisive 
ballots in the Federal Assembly.... 
  [Kinkel] After every ballot, we, the FDP, will get together 
in the Federal Assembly and consider what we will do in the next 
ballot. I am against continuous speculations before the 
presidential election. 
  [Lambeck] Do you still see any chance for Mrs. 
Hamm-Bruecher? 
  [Kinkel] Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher was chosen as candidate for 
the presidential elections with overwhelming support in the FDP. 
I can say only again and again: She is not a mere pawn that 
can be exchanged at will. 
  [Lambeck] The coalition is again trying to find a compromise 
on nursing-care insurance with the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD]. Do you also see a chance for the desired 
solution if, for the time being, only one holiday is abolished? 
  [Kinkel] We indeed want to make a new attempt at mediation 
on the basis of a solution for the nursing-care insurance that 
includes outpatients and inpatients. From the point of view of 
the CDU/CSU and the FDP, a solution for outpatients and 
inpatients is only possible by compensation that involves the 
abolition of two holidays. 
  [Lambeck] The CDU/CSU is now demanding that the SPD clarify 
events concerning the pasts of the Social Democratic 
politicians, Wehner and Wienand, which have now become known. 
Might the case of Herbert Wehner be the undoing of some people 
in the present SPD leadership? 
  [Kinkel] I am of the opinion that, in the first place, the 
SPD has to be committed to clarifying this and taking an 
interest in it. On the other hand, I think there should be no 
mudslinging in the election campaign. I cannot assess whether 
this might result in any problems for SPD politicians who are 
still alive. I am interested in the historical question of 
whether German politics was influenced in an unacceptable way by 
the former GDR or the Soviet Union in the postwar period. 
  [Lambeck] In view of the imponderabilities in the East, may 
Germany continue to cut its defense budget constantly? Should 
the Bundeswehr not actually get more money as an insurance 
policy for politics? 
  [Kinkel] The Bundeswehr is a very important factor in our 
society. It has to be excluded from the quarrels between the 
parties. It has to be excluded from the permanent criticism and 
fumbling. It cannot be right that we say we have a certain 
amount of money and we can afford a certain amount of Bundeswehr 
for it. It has to be the other way around: In the changed world 
situation we need a Bundeswehr that can cope with new tasks. 
This concept has to be developed and then the money needed for 
the concept must be made available. 
  [Lambeck] In your opinion, does the coalition have a 
convincing concept for the Bundeswehr or does this not exist yet? 
  [Kinkel] The world and thus the tasks of the Bundeswehr have 
changed. Only think of the future tasks that hopefully also 
will be possible for us after the Basic Law amendment, that is, 
to keep and to make peace. In addition, there are preventive 
and humanitarian measures. Indeed we need a new concept. 
Volker Ruehe must present one. As for the rest, I am convinced 
that the Bundeswehr's personnel strength of 370,000 men should 
be maintained. 
  [Lambeck] What do you think of the proposal by your party 
friend, Juergen Moellemann, to limit the chancellor's term to 
eight years? 
  [Kinkel] Nothing at all.

  [Text] Qiao Shi, chairman of the PRC National People's 
Congress Standing Committee, was received by the president of 
the Austrian Parliament, by Foreign Minister Mock, and by 
Chancellor Vranitzky in Vienna today. Apart from economic 
issues, the talks also included the human rights situation in 
China. There was no change in the differing views held by the 
two sides. 
  Only a few people have demonstrated against the visit, 
calling for an end to Chinese rule over Tibet. 
  Qiao Shi was the head of the Beijing intelligence service 
for 
many years. Even during Qiao Shi's visit to Germany, critics 
said that his hosts would shake bloody hands -- an accusation 
which Chancellor Franz Vranitzky did not support: 
  [Begin Vranitzky recording] I think this formulation is 
inappropriate, and the point is not to shake bloody hands to 
make business, but, through reasonable cooperation, one day -- 
and, I hope, in the not too distant future -- we should achieve 
[a situation where] there will be no more bloody hands. [end

<F P=106> [Andreas Schwarz commentary: "Clinton's Last Resort"] </F>
  [Text] The Americans have not yet noticed everything that 
his administration achieved during the past year. This is how 
U.S. President Bill Clinton explained the situation in his State 
of the Union address. What is now required is simply the 
implementation of the steps that have been initiated. He 
mentioned numerous successes -- NAFTA, the gun law, or the U.S. 
economy -- which have had a positive impact on the entire world 
economy and triggered a recovery. 
  Fortunately, Clinton's overestimation of his abilities did 
not extend to foreign policy. Russia's reforms must be 
supported, said the one who had pledged to focus on domestic 
issues. Thus, Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia -- in fact he had to 
deal with these crises in one or another unfortunate way -- were 
hardly worth mentioning. As far as Korea is concerned, keeping 
silent was the best solution. 
  As a matter of fact, the United States will probably supply 
12 Patriot-type antimissile batteries to South Korea because 
North Korea possesses -- yes, you guessed it -- Scud missiles. 
Are the two Koreas really on the brink of war? Will the North 
Koreans storm south through their tunnels, like the Iraqi 
soldiers when they attacked Kuwait City? 
  There is no danger at all. The reason is the conflict with 
Pyongyang over control of the nuclear facilities. In a constant 
quarrel, the North Koreans refuse to show their cards and allow 
inspectors to check whether they are producing nuclear weapons 
or not. They are not, the CIA announced recently. Probably 
not, stated South Korea's president recently, but control is 
necessary. There is no doubt about that. 
  Clinton even threatened the old man Kim Il-Song with "a 
military solution" unless he gives in. However, if Patriot 
missiles -- which South Korea apparently does not want in the 
middle of negotiations because it fears that the North might 
feel provoked -- are Clinton's last resort, and there will be 
another foreign policy masterpiece that should not be mentioned 
during a State of the Union address.

  [Text] Leo Delcroix became defense minister two years ago. 
In these two years he has made far-reaching reforms in his 
department. He wants to turn the Belgian Army into a 
professional army, and also make it a more open body. 
  One measure in this direction concerns military command 
files. The defense minister wants to involve parliament, and in 
particular the president and vice president of the defense 
committees, to a greater degree. They would have a ex post 
facto right of examination, rather than only taking part in 
consultations. Is this an opportunistic move at a time when 
military orders are making headlines? Leo Delcroix denies this 
is the case. 
  Openness will also mean the Army will be allowed to speak 
out: From April 1994, military personnel will be able to express 
themselves freely on all subjects except those relating to 
discipline and military secrets. Previously, they had to obtain 
authorization before speaking out. 
  On a broader level, the Army will make a greater effort to 
keep the public informed. The Army must strengthen its ties 
with the nation, Mr. Delcroix said. We must make ourselves more 
attractive, as we are going to have to recruit, he said. This 
recruitment drive is a consequence of the decision to abolish 
military service. 
  Finally, 1994 will see an unprecedented number of new 
postings in the Army. There will be 12,000 transfers this year 
-- three times more than usual. This is mainly due to the 
return of troops from Germany. The minister said he is 
concerned about the personal situation of these soldiers, and 
has announced his intention to create new housing, which will be 
financed by rents paid by the Army.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Commentary: "Clinton Skilfully Plays on </F>
Popular Themes"] 
  [Text] With a brilliantly managed first State of the Union 
address, U.S. President Bill Clinton has given his image and 
popularity a large boost. For some time the Americans have 
shown an irresistible inclination to turn inward. They used to 
call it "splendid isolation," when talking about the American 
east and west coasts. Clinton's predecessor, George Bush, was 
the "foreign affairs" president. With his State of the Union 
address, Clinton has left no doubt that domestic policy is his 
priority. 
  In his speech, Clinton was as brief as he was vague when 
talking about foreign issues. Naturally the president 
underlined the absolute leadership of the United States in the 
world. But he kept the foreign chapter strikingly short, to be 
able to go on all the quicker to popular domestic topics. 
  Clinton's plan to reform health care in the United States is 
undoubtedly popular among average Americans, even though they 
find the plans unclear and scarcely comprehensible. But the 
reform plan is facing considerable opposition from the 
traditional right-wing camp -- including the Republicans and 
right-wing Democrats. It is now as good as certain that Clinton 
will have to water down his plans very significantly. So the 
question arises: How much of the original plan will remain when 
the president has reached a compromise with the Republican 
opposition? 
  The president also wants to reform the support system for 
the 
millions of poverty-stricken Americans. Clinton wants to 
provide these people with social security benefits and training, 
but if they have not found work in the private sector after two 
years then the money will once again be shut off irrevocably. 
  Clinton has not yet said how he will finance his plan. And 
for this plan too he will be obliged to compromise with the 
Republicans. 
  The striking feature in the president's speech was the fight 
against crime. This is a very popular subject of conversation 
in the United States and the hobbyhorse of the "law-and-order 
fanatics" under the Republicans. Clinton wants to floor and 
even overtake his rivals on this particular Republican private 
hunting ground. And there is a very real danger of 
demagogically raising the stakes in the fight against crime. 
Clinton wants to take on 100,000 new policemen and build more 
prisons at a cost of US$23 billion. The anticrime law passed 
recently by the Senate expands the death sentence and has the 
president's support. Better than any other, Bill Clinton knows 
what themes make a president popular in the United States.

<F P=106> [By Peter Mackler] </F>
  [Excerpt] Davos, Switzerland, Jan 27 (AFP) -- German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl made a strong appeal Thursday [27 
January] for Western support of Russia's embattled reformers and 
backed permanent membership for Moscow in the Group of Seven 
industrial powers (G-7). 
  Speaking at the opening of the World Economic Forum here, 
Kohl sought to overcome Western misgivings about Moscow's new 
conservative cabinet and a feared drift away from its commitment 
to market reforms. 
  "The alternative is whether we give our support to those who 
support reform, not knowing whether they will succeed or not, or 
sit in our historical corner knowing the failure will be 
disastrous," he said. 
  Kohl said the possible expansion of the G-7 to give Russia 
permanent membership would be "a question of the greatest 
importance" at the group's July summit in Naples, Italy. 
  "They would not be just guests, they would be members of a 
round if this was provided by the democratic reforms in Russia," 
the German leader said in response to a question. "I don't see 
any alternative." 
  The G-7, which has agreed to provide Russia 43 billion 
dollars in assistance, comprises the United States, Japan, 
France, Britain, Canada, Germany and Italy. 
  In a keynote address to some 1,500 top political, business 
and media leaders gathered here, Kohl linked the West's future 
well-being to the success of economic and political reforms in 
the former Soviet bloc. 
  He urged active assistance for reform programmes throughout 
Central and East Europe and well stepped-up efforts to widen 
Western markets to imports from the East. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Davos, Switzerland, Jan 27 (AFP) -- Germany's 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl directly linked the future well-being of 
the Western world with the success of economic and political 
reforms in the former Soviet bloc in a major speech Thursday [27 
January]. 
  Delivering the keynote address at the annual meeting of the 
World Economic Forum, he said the West must continue to support 
the emerging democracies of Central, East and southern Europe on 
their road to free market democracy. 
  "A failure of the reform efforts in these countries, in 
which 
some 380 million people live, would bode ill for West Europe 
directly, but also for the Western world as a whole," Kohl said. 
  "This would raise the danger that, in their disappointment, 
these people would leave their homes and try their chances in 
the West -- not only, as till now, in Germany, but also in other 
West European states," he warned. 
  Success of the reforms, on the other hand, would offer all 
countries the chance of lasting peace and prosperity, the 
chancellor said. 
  Kohl said the West must continue to make every effort to 
build a market economy in these states. Germany had not 
restricted itself to promises, but assumed a "way over normal" 
responsibility in this respect, he observed. 
  Of the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries, 
Germany had provided by far the greatest financial support for 
the reform process in Russia, he said -- nearly 90 billion 
[German] marks [DM] (51.5 billion dollars) for states of the 
former Soviet Union and about DM37 billion (21.2 billion 
dollars) for those of Central, East and southern Europe. 
  However, it was clear the West could only provide "help for 
self-help" and that credits and advice alone could not bring the 
desired results, Kohl said. 
  "With consistent pursuit of the economic reforms already 
begun, these countries hold in their own hands the key to a 
step-by-step resolution of their economic problems. No one can 
take on this responsibility for them." 
  The German chancellor saw support for the reform process in 
the former East Bloc countries as part of a four-point approach 
to counter unemployment, take up new economic challenges, and 
ensure a stable and secure future for Europe. 
  His first proposal was to "press ahead full speed" with 
European political and economic integration. 
  Extension of European Community membership to Austria, 
Finland, Norway, and Sweden beginning on 1 January 1995, would 
"further strengthen Europe." A standstill in the integration 
process, on the other hand, carries the danger of political 
power rivalry and a throwback to earlier times, he said. 
  Kohl further called for a strengthening of economic links 
with the dynamic young market economies of Asia, and for further 
opening up the world trade system. 
  In his speech, the chancellor also warned about the war in 
the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, saying 
military intervention would require "hundreds of thousands of 
ground troops" and lead to a great number of casualties, 
including civilians. 
  He also doubted it could produce a lasting peace. "The truth 
remains -- there is no ready-made solution to this conflict," he 
said.

  [Text] Davos, Switzerland, Jan 28 (AFP) -- Monetary policy 
must not be used as a weapon against unemployment, Bundesbank 
president Hans Tietmeyer said here on Friday [28 January], while 
also condemning budget deficits. 
  Tietmeyer also called for a new relationship between growth 
and employment, and said that social support in Europe 
discouraged the creation of jobs. 
  Tietmeyer told the World Economic Forum here that his 
unequivocal message was that there should be no experiments in 
policies to combat inflation. Expansionist monetary policy 
could not be used to fight unemployment, he said. There was no 
alternative to rectification of structural causes of under 
employment. 
  He also warned against sliding budget deficits in Europe, 
holding that a stable monetary policy which left no room for 
inflation had to be linked to budgetary policies which did not 
lead later to an increase in taxation. 
  Tietmeyer posed the question of how to reduce the budget 
deficit without bearing down unduly on demand. The problem was 
how to do it at the appropriate time while being credible about 
the fact that the deficit would be reduced. 
  Growth was necessary in dealing with unemployment, but 
growth 
alone was not sufficient. A new relationship between growth and 
employment was needed. In European countries there were too 
many encouragements to be unemployed and these should be 
replaced by incitement to work. 
  He blamed rigidity in the labour market, a lack of 
flexibility in pay rates and a system of social welfare which 
discouraged the creation of jobs.

  [Text] Davos, Switzerland, Jan 28 (AFP) -- GATT chief 
Peter Sutherland, arguing that world trade policy should not be 
decided solely by the leading economic powers, proposed on 
Friday [28 January] the creation of a top-level forum including 
developing states. 
  He said the forum could meet regularly at prime minister and 
trade and finance minister level, and draw institutional support 
from the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and new World 
Trade Organisation (WTO). 
  Sutherland told the World Economic Forum here that new 
cooperative structures were necesssary to follow up on last 
month's global trade pact hammered out under the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Bodies such as the Group of Seven industrialised powers or 
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development left 
out some of the world's fastest-growing economies in Asia and 
Latin America, the GATT director general said. 
  "The fact is that the countries which will increasingly 
provide our best hope for economic growth and new markets are 
simply not represented where it most counts," he said. 
  He called for structures that will "recognise the realities 
of the 21st century," adding, "We cannot continue with a 
majority of the world's people excluded from participation in 
global economic management." 
  Sutherland told some 1,500 political and business leaders 
here that his proposed forum would include include developing 
countries, economies in transition as well as states of the 
24-member OECD. 
  "Setting up such a forum is the logical step next in the 
development of global economic cooperation for which the success 
of the Uruguay Round has done so much," Sutherland said. 
  He said the world had to treat money, finance and trade in 
an 
integrated way and find ways of coordinating discussions on the 
problems of Russia, for example, now spread out over several 
groups. 
  Sutherland also warned that the successful conclusion of the 
GATT Uruguay Round after seven years of negotiations did not 
eliminate the threat of protectionism from the world trade scene. 
  The major powers were showing a stubborn readiness to handle 
their trade disputes unilaterally and notions of managed trade 
and barriers to low-cost imports in the name of saving jobs were 
still alive, he said. 
  Sutherland said such talk hampered Western efforts to 
promote 
free-market reforms among the former communist bloc. 
  "To call on others to implement economic reform has a rather 
hollow ring to it if at the same time you maintain regime of 
managed trade or retain restrictions in key sectors," he said. 
  The Irishman called on the United States, European Community 
and Japan to rapidly ratify the GATT accord and take the lead in 
providing the WTO with the means to fulfil its mandate to settle 
trade differences.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>
  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has said that the recent 
crisis observed in Turkey's money market is the result of a 
failure to establish a good balance between the rate of 
exchange, rate of interest, and inflation. 
  Our correspondent Haluk Koc reports from Switzerland that 
Demirel, who is there to attend the World Economic Forum 
meeting, held a news conference last night. Demirel pointed out 
that the Turkish economy is a growing, developing, and 
productive one and that the state's current problems are the 
result of borrowing. He stated that the extraordinary situation 
observed in the money market recently is the result of a failure 
to establish a good balance between the rate of exchange, rate 
of interest, and inflation. The president stressed that these 
developments are temporary, but should not be taken lightly. He 
said: When you are in such a crisis or extraordinary situation, 
it is not only logic that is at work; psychological factors are 
also extremely important. It is important to have an atmosphere 
of trust. Those who take measures will create an atmosphere of 
trust. They will deal with the developments vigorously. If 
there is anything that has not been done, they will do it. This 
is a war. 
  Demirel pointed out that Turkey has difficulties in 
promoting 
itself in the world. Certain countries, he said, still fail to 
see the struggle Turkey is waging against a murderous gang. The 
president said that Western countries recently began to support 
the struggle being waged against terrorism. He added, however, 
that the developed world took a stand against terrorism in order 
to protect its own interests and not to support Turkey. One 
reason is that terrorism disrupts public order in those 
countries. The second reason is the drug traffic that is 
involved in financing terrorism. These countries realize that if 
they do not take a stand against terrorism, their people will 
continue to be poisoned. These are the reasons why these 
countries took the steps they did against the terrorist 
organization, Demirel added. 
  The president pointed out that the chilly relations between 
Ankara and Bern can be improved through dialogue and that there 
should not be any ill-feeling between states. 
  Demirel also received the members of the coordination 
council 
of the Turkish Federations. He was briefed on the problems of 
Turks living in Switzerland. He said that the 12 million Turks 
living in Europe constitute a bridge between Turkey and Europe 
and that the problems they face should not daunt them.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "France In Favor of a General </F>
Embargo"] 
  [Text] On Tuesday evening [25 January] at UN Headquarters, 
France circulated a draft resolution calling for a strengthening 
of sanctions against the Haitian military junta by means of a 
general embargo on the island. The text, which still can be 
amended, recommends extending the oil and military embargo to 
all fields of activity, except humanitarian aid. The embargo 
should also apply to all noncommercial flights from or to Haiti; 
this actually applies to small aircraft involved in all kinds of 
trafficking -- mainly drug -- linked with Haiti. France 
suggests that these measures be enforced on 31 January at 11:59 
[time zone not specified].

  [Text] Strasbourg, Jan 27 (AFP) -- Russia should be barred 
from full membership of the Council of Europe [CE] for as long 
as it maintains troops in neighbouring countries without their 
accord, Luxembourg President Jacques Santer said Thursday [27 
January]. 
  Russia could not move closer to full membership as long as 
its foreign policy conflicted with international law, Santer 
told the winter session of the Council's parliamentary assembly. 
  "The stationing of troops in bordering countries, against 
their wishes, flies in the face of these principles," Santer 
added. 
  Russia did however have a "vocation" for full membership of 
the 32-nation organisation, Santer said. 
  Russia has since May 1992 sought to exchange its special 
"guest" status, which it has had for the past four years, for 
full council membership. 
  The head of the Russian delegation last Tuesday accused the 
Council of erecting "new, artificial obstacles" to full 
membership. 
  Russia fulfilled all the requirements for full membership 
after holding democratic elections and drawing up a new 
constitution in December, he added.

<F P=106> [Report signed "norb/tom/plo": "Accession Poker: Pressure </F>
on the European Parliament"] 
  [Text] Brussels/Vienna -- Commissioner Hans van den Broek, 
who is responsible for the foreign relations of the European 
Union, has suggested the European Parliament apply "expedited 
procedures" concerning the handling of the accession agreements 
with Austria, Sweden, Norway, and Finland. 
  Van den Broek proposed that only the "essential parts" of 
the 
agreements be submitted to the European Parliament by the end of 
March. 
  Thus, the European Parliament, which must ratify the 
expansion of the European Union, might begin preparations in 
March. Van den Broek no longer considers the presentation of 
complete treaties possible by 10 March. The president of the 
European Parliament, Egon Klepsch, believes that membership 
might be postponed by one year if negotiations are not concluded 
according to schedule. 
  Chancellor Vranitzky told DER STANDARD in Athens that 
contradictory statements by commissioners of the European Union 
or the European Parliament on the schedule are not surprising. 
It must be clear, however, that accession is a political 
decision that will be made ultimately at the government level. 
  Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek stated that, according to his 
information, there will be no delay in the talks. If problems 
should occur, it will still be possible to achieve a solution at 
the summit of the European Union in February.

Transparency in Military Purchases"; as released by Brussels 
BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 27 Jan (BELGA) -- Defense Minister Mr. Leo 
Delcroix announced on Thursday [27 January] that he was seeking 
"greater transparency" in future purchases of military 
equipment, notably by involving Parliament in the decisionmaking. 
  "Initially, I am thinking of discussing files with the 
presidents and vice presidents of the Chamber and Senate 
national defense committees, which also include opposition 
members," he essentially affirmed during a press interview. 
  "It is a question of explaining a posteriori the reasons for 
deciding to purchase this or that equipment rather than other 
equipment," a close associate of the minister explained. 
  "If this initiative proves positive, Mr. Delcroix envisages 
further involving Parliament in discussions," he added. 
  "This must be a step in the right direction," added Mr. 
Delcroix, who denied that he was acting out of opportunism, a 
reference to certain military purchases -- including Agusta 
helicopters for the army -- which are the subject of a 
parliamentary committee of enquiry. 
  "But we must not go too far," added the minister, apparently 
excluding the setting up of a subcommittee charged with military 
purchases, similar to that which exists in the United States and 
the Netherlands.

  [Excerpts] Bonn/Karlsruhe (DPA) -- According to German 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, the UN mission in Somalia has 
"gone awry." He admitted this at an FDP [Free Democratic Party] 
function in Karlsruhe yesterday evening. He emphasized, 
however, that 32 countries have attempted "to resolve this 
terrible situation." One thing has been achieved after all: 
"There is no more starvation there." 
  The Defense Ministry announced today that Chief of Staff 
Klaus Naumann will open a dam south of Beledweyne on Sunday [30 
January]. This is the last large project implemented with 
German humanitarian aid provided by the support unit in Somalia. 
[passage omitted] 
  The general will stay in Somalia until Tuesday. He is due to 
meet high-ranking UN officials in Mogadishu. [passage omitted] 
  Kinkel defended UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
against recent criticism. Ghali is an "immensely committed man, 
but far too much is asked of him." After the end of the 
East-West conflict, the United Nations is no longer in a 
position financially, organizationally, and regarding the 
available manpower, to handle all problems of the modern world, 
ranging from environmental to population problems. "We should 
not criticize Butrus-Ghali, but support him," Kinkel said.

  [Excerpt] Karlsruhe (DPA)--German firms have no right to 
claim compensation from the state for losses arising from the 
embargo imposed on Iraq in August 1990. The foreign trade ban, 
decreed in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, was imposed by 
the Council of the European Union (EU); thus, losses can only be 
attributed to the "Community legislator," the Federal Court of 
Justice said in a ruling announced today. A compensation claim 
by a vehicle manufacturer, who has since gone bankrupt, has thus 
been finally rejected. 
  In mid-1989, the company had concluded with an Iraqi 
Government company a contract to supply 100 low-loader trucks 
that were intended for use as transport vehicles in the Iraqi 
oil fields. A total of 25 vehicles were delivered and paid for. 
The delivery of the remaining 75 vehicles, which was due in the 
summer of 1990, did not take place because of the embargo on 
Iraq that banned, among other things, the export of all goods 
from EU countries to Iraq and Kuwait. The vehicle manufacturer 
demanded compensation for his fruitless expenditure and lost 
profits. [passage omitted]

German metallurgical and electrical industry on Monday [31 
January]. The announcement was intended to get the stalled wage 
negotiations moving again, deputy chairman Walter Riester told 
journalists in Bonn today. He accused employers of "sabotaging" 
the pay talks. The assumption is not unjustified that some 
employers want to start a large-scale dispute all over the 
republic. 
  The legal moratorium on industrial action in the west German 
metal and electrical industry ends on Friday.

  [Text] Duesseldorf (DPA) -- Large losses in its 
steelmaking division pushed the entire Thyssen group deep into 
the red last year. Thyssen AG announced today when presenting 
its annual accounts for the financial year, which ended on 30th 
September 1993, that its losses of 994 million German marks [DM] 
represented a new record in the company's history. 
  A year ago, the group, with its three divisions, steel, 
capital goods, and commerce, generated an annual surplus of 
DM348 million. Thyssen cut around 12,000 jobs in its domestic 
companies, and employed a worldwide workforce of 133,800 at the 
end of December. The steel and capital goods divisions were 
particularly affected by job losses. Staff cuts would continue 
in these sectors, Thyssen said. 
  The board of management described the results as "wholly 
unsatisfactory." The company added that its worldwide turnover 
during the 1992/93 financial year fell 6 percent to DM33.5 
billion. However, turnover during the first quarter of the 
1993/94 financial year rose again by 1.2 percent to DM8.1 
billion. Turnover shrank in the steel and capital goods 
divisions by 7 and 10 percent respectively. Economic results 
for the period October to December 1993 remained marked by high 
steel sector losses. The company is expecting largely negative 
results for the whole of this year, albeit with "continuous 
improvement each quarter."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Prodi to Delors on Privatisations"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, 25 Jan (ANSA) -- IRI [Institute for 
Industrial Reconstruction] Chairman Romano Prodi today assured 
European Commission President Jacques Delors of Italy's capacity 
to absorb the big privatisations lined up for this year, saying 
that "the Milan bourse [stock exchange] may be small, but so was 
Paris before they started the privatisation process there," 
adding that "when you put banks like (already privatised) 
Credito Italiano or Banca Commerciale Italiana (Comit) on the 
market, it gets bigger, it becomes a real market...and will get 
even bigger when we float 40 percent of telecom giant STET 
[Turin Telephone Finance Company] later this year." 
  Prodi, who presented Delors with an IRI study on the 
communications infrastructures envisaged in the European 
Commission President's White Paper on boosting European Union 
[EU] growth and employment, said that the upcoming Comit 
privatisation would respect rules of "transparency" and 
safeguard shareholders' rights. 
  In its last IRI balance sheet, approved today in Milan, 
Comit 
reported a 1.7 percent rise in 1993 net profits to 268.2 billion 
lire and a 65 percent leap in its operating result to 1.510 
trillion lire. It announced an unchanged dividend of 200 lire 
per ordinary share and 230 lire per savings share still in 
circulation at the end of the conversion period, February 11. 
  Prodi also had talks with European Competition Commissioner 
Karel Van Miert on the recent European steel accord, reiterating 
the strategic importance of Ilva plants to be privatised and 
saying he had "no worries" on Dalmine's coming tubes joint 
venture with Mannesmann and Vallourec despite EU clouds 
apparently brewing. 
  On the freeing-up of Italy's mobile phone market with the 
second, "European" licensee, Prodi stressed the importance of 
competition, "even if it costs dear." 
  Illustrating the main points of IRI's communications network 
study -- the first in Europe to issue a concrete response to 
Delors's vision -- Prodi proudly pointed to its provision for 
what Premier Ciampi recently called the missing piece -- 
high-speed links between north and south and not just the east 
and west of Europe. The study had also highlighted the need for 
any link between West and East Europe to pass through the Po 
Valley, he said. 
  European Institutional Affairs Commissioner Raniero Vanni 
d'Archirafi and Public Works Minister Francesco Merloni pointed 
to the "coordinated approach" shown for the first time in IRI's 
Trans-European Network (TEN) blueprint, and its crucial 
importance for speeding European integration. Prodi highlighted 
the "watershed" change represented by the almost wholly private 
funding of the scheme, via the proposed EU bonds.

  Italian Head of State will receive Chernomyrdin at the 
presidential Quirinale palace during his stay.

  [Text] Rome, 27 Jan (ANSA) -- Economic reforms in Russia

  The Russian premier, Ciampi said, is firmly convinced that 
reforms will move ahead and asked for Italy's support to be 
allowed to join the group of seven major industrialized nations. 
  Italy in July will host the G-7 summit in Naples and Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin is expected to attend the last day's 
session. 
  Chernomyrdin, Ciampi said, asked Italy to act so that the 
G-7 
may become the "G-8" beginning with the Naples summit. 
  As for reforms, Ciampi said he "heard with great pleasure a 
clear and full statement assuring that reforms not only will not 
move backward but will decisively move ahead." 
  According to Ciampi, it is "inevitable" that stabilization 
and renewal processes have their "ups and downs and alternating 
phases," but "the firm Russian determination is beyond question." 
  The G-7 summit, according to a joint statement released 
after 
the talks, will be "an important occasion" to make a progress 
report on Russian reforms towards a free market economy and for 
"a joint evaluation of international political events." 
  The statement speaks of Russian reforms as "fundamental" and 
also describes Russia as having an increasingly important role 
in "the construction of a new Europe." 
  The U.S.-sponsored Partnership for Peace, allowing Central 
and East European states closer ties with NATO, was also 
mentioned as a possible contribution to the creation of a single 
security system in the European continent, under the umbrella of 
the 52-member Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe. 
  Chernomyrdin also spoke of the conflict in former 
Yugoslavia, 
saying that all efforts to stop the civil war there must be 
"peaceful and civil." 
  Ciampi and the Russian premier signed a political statement 
and a declaration of principles that will form the basis of a 
future investment cooperation accord, as well as a separate 
agreement on the burial of Italian soldiers killed during the 
Russian campaign of World War II. 
  Chernomyrdin on Friday will be received at the Vatican by 
Pope John Paul II and will meet Italian President Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro.

  [Text] Rome, 25 Jan (ANSA) -- Foreign Minister Beniamino 
Andreatta today received the Saudi Foreign Affairs under 
secretary Mahmun al-Qurdi, who is in Rome to take part in a 
meeting of the joint Italo-Saudi Commission. 
  The commission's previous meeting (the fourth in the series) 
took place in Riyadh from January 30 to February 1 of last year. 
The two men today first reviewed economic matters of common 
interest. Andreatta and al-Qurdi agreed on the advisability of 
stepping up initiatives aimed a bolstering trade and industrial 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  Recalling the Italian government privatization plan outlined 
to the Saudis when Treasury Minister Piero Barucci travelled to 
Saudi Arabia in January of 1993, Andreatta plumped for Saudi 
investments in share companies being formed from the former 
public ones. 
  The two men also discussed international matters and 
especially the situation in the Mediterranean and in Bosnia. 
The previous political contact between the two countries took 
place in November of last year when Saudi Foreign Minister Sa'ud 
al-Faysal al Sa'ud came to Rome, the Farnesina [Foreign 
Ministry] noted.

<F P=106> [Ugo Stille commentary: "Clinton and the State of the </F>
Union: The Challenge of Realism"] 
  [Text] New York -- Bill Clinton has begun the second year 
of his presidency in a climate of popular support (according to 
the latest opinion poll by the ABC network, he enjoys 60 percent 
support) such as has not been witnessed since he assumed office 
in January last year. And this was reflected in the State of 
the Union message that he read out Tuesday [25 January] at the 
joint session of both houses. 
  The President seemed optimistic, confident, and resolutely 
determined to achieve by the end of the year objective number 
one for 1994 -- the introduction of a free health care program 
for all Americans, which would mark a historic turning point 
similar to the adoption of Roosevelt's first social measures in 
the 1930's. The bill, submitted by the government and drafted 
by First Lady Hillary Clinton herself, doubtlessly will undergo 
modifications during its debate in Congress, but Clinton has 
already threatened that any version that does not embody the 
principle of health care for all will be vetoed. At the same 
time, the President tried to avoid a tone of ideological 
controversy and to make the White House impartial in its role as 
guarantor of national interests. 
  On some issues, such as the fight against crime and the 
reform of the welfare system, he did not hesitate to espouse the 
Republicans' traditional arguments. Clinton's intention thus 
was to stress the "centrist" position, the plataform on which he 
was elected in November 1992 and which many accused him of 
having relinquished after his first year in government by 
falling back on the theories of the "liberal" left. 
  In this context the point on which the President focused his 
entire speech is all the more significant -- that is, the need 
for a "return to traditional values" (comprising the three 
elements of family, community, and work) that was another of the 
themes used by the Republican Party in the past. Its 
endorsement by Clinton confirms his determination to tackle the 
United States' problems on a new, realistic and not ideological, 
basis. This approach has received the approval of a large 
majority of the country, and the opinion poll held immediately 
after the speech shows that 84 percent of Americans agree with 
the President's approach. 
  The task of every State of the Union message is twofold -- 
to 
indicate to the country what direction the government intends to 
pursue in the year ahead and to define the legislative program 
that it will submit to the houses. Although the plans to step 
up measures against crime will be approved easily with the 
support of both parties, the conflict over health care is almost 
bound to continue throughout the year. The Republicans accept 
some parts of it, but sharply reject others, and it will be 
necessary to find a compromise. 
  The part of the speech devoted to foreign policy confirms 
that this remains the sector in which Clinton moves with the 
least confidence and the greatest difficulty, lacking a clear 
vision of the relationship between theory and reality. Apart 
from the very vigorous reaffirmation of the determination to 
maintain the United States' international leadership role and 
the commitment to continue along this path, the trouble with the 
picture the President presented to America in the present 
international situation is that it was either too generic or 
falsely optimistic. 
  The principle on which Clinton wants to base foreign policy 
-- "the strengthening of the democratic area in the world," that 
is, a kind of new Wilsonism -- seems like an empty slogan devoid 
of both a realistic perception of the problems and a consistent 
strategy. The best example is provided by the sharp 
deterioration of the crisis in Russia. In this connection the 
President repeated the old theory about the desire to facilitate 
the process of reforms in Russia and urged Congress to join this 
effort. But he did not even mention the increasingly serious 
threats now presented to Washington by Yeltsin's return to an 
inflationist economic stance and the resurgence of 
neoimperialist nostalgia. 
  An example of this former threat came with yesterday's 
confirmation of the resignation of Economy Minister Boris 
Fedorov, one of the reformist leaders; while an example of the 
latter is the new Russian parliament's vote against Western 
military measures against Serbia. Neither of these alarming 
developments was mentioned in Clinton's speech, though he spoke 
at length about aspects that have become entirely marginal, such 
as nuclear and space agreements with Russia. With regard to the 
Middle East, the President reaffirmed, resolutely but obviously 
in general terms (as, for that matter, he did with almost all 
aspects for foreign policy), support for the current peace 
process between Israel and the Palestinians, while admitting 
that we face a "long and difficult road, but one which America 
intends to pursue with supportive action." The Bosnian question 
was mentioned almost in passing, and the same went for the 
Somali crisis and the Haitian problem. Despite the possibility 
that this will cause difficulties in the future, for the present 
the outlook looks promising for Clinton. Of course, his 
prospects of success depend to a large extent on the evolution 
of the situation that has favored him hitherto. The President 
did not hesitate to attribute the major economic recovery to his 
last year's policy, entailing a deficit reduction, a fall in 
interest rates, and creation of new jobs. In the belief that 
for the present he has won the "economic battle," Clinton did 
not put forward any new initiatives in this field, counting on 
the fact that the expansive trend now set in motion will 
continue through 1994. For that matter, most experts agree with 
him, although they note the possibility of a clash between the 
White House and the Federal Reserve over the issue of interest 
rates. The Fed, anxious to nip in the bud any return of 
inflation, wants to raise them, but Clinton opposes it. For the 
present the future holds two dangers for the President: The 
first is an exacerbation of the Russian crisis, restoring a 
climate of instability throughout East Europe; and the second 
would be the emergence of further disclosures in the Whitewater 
case. It has not yet affected Clinton's popularity, and the 
information that has emerged hitherto has been received by the 
country with a certain degree of irritation. However, it 
remains to be seen whether during the inquiry that is starting 
now there will emerge further disclosures capable of changing 
people's minds about the situation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri by Marco Nese </F>
in Rome; date not given: "Fabbri: `Soldiers Against the Mafia 
-- No Guards For The Polling Stations'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The government will send soldiers in against 
the 'Ndrangheta [Calabrian Mafia] and the Camorra [Neapolitan 
Mafia]. "Yes," Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri said, "1,000 
soldiers will go to Calabria and 500 will be deployed in Naples. 
We made this decision at a meeting of the national committee 
for public order. I also raised the issue of guarding the 
polling stations, a task that has been entrusted to the Army. 
Italy and Greece are the only two countries in Europe that use 
the military to guard polling stations." 
  [Nese] Do you mean that on 27 March there will be police and 
Carabinieri guarding the polling stations rather than soldiers? 
  [Fabbri] Maybe we will not have time to change anything 
before the 27 March elections. Starting with June's European 
elections, however, the soldiers should have been replaced. 
Guarding the polling stations requires a good 28,000 soldiers. 
When you consider that we sent some divisions to Somalia, 
others to Sicily, and now more to Calabria and Naples, it is 
becoming difficult to maintain our commitment for the elections. 
  [Nese] You say that 1,000 men will be sent to Calabria. 
  [Fabbri] Yes, they are light infantrymen from the Garibaldi 
Brigade who had been scheduled to go to Somalia. They will be 
involved in guarding high-risk targets. In this way, police and 
Carabinieri will be freer to concentrate on truly investigative 
tasks. We have called it Operation Riace, and it will have the 
same features as the Sicilian Vespers operation that produced 
very encouraging results. At the meeting, Police Chief Parisi 
said that, thanks to the presence of the soldiers, Sicily has 
recorded a 35 percent drop in the number of homicides. That is 
not all. The forces of order have been able to channel their 
energy into the fight against major crime, with excellent 
results. Therefore it was decided that 5,200 soldiers will 
remain in Sicily. 
  [Nese] The deployment of the military was controversial. 
Some people have said that our towns are not Mogadishu. 
  [Fabbri] These objections were above all raised with respect 
to Rome. I, however, was against putting soldiers onto the 
streets of Rome. As a matter of fact, we have abandoned that 
plan -- the mayors, judges, and the cardinals asked me to. The 
soldiers will be used to man the garrisons of the government 
buildings and important headquarters. In Calabria, spring and 
summer military camps will be set up. Moreover, starting next 
spring, the 360-strong mounted Carabinieri regiment will go on 
exercises in Aspromonte, and another 600 Carabinieri cadets will 
arrive there next autumn. 
  [Nese] Soldiers will be arriving in Naples, too. 
  [Fabbri] Mayor Bassolino requested it for the garrison of 
the 
new court and a few unauthorized buildings currently patrolled 
by the municipal police. Finally, we will keep 300 troops on 
the frontier with the former Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Article signed "p.pol.": "We Celebrated Too Soon, the </F>
Mafia Has Not Been Defeated"] 
  [Text] Parliament is alarmed: The bosses are 
organizing their counterattack. Fresh shipments of arms come 
from the East. Mancino says: There are missiles and cannons in 
the Mafia families' arsenals. 
  Rome--"Cosa Nostra is not dead." Interior Minister Nicola 
Mancino thus shattered our illusions when he read the DIA's 
[Anti-Mafia Investigative Directorate] biannual report in 
Parliament. So, despite the successful hits it took last year, 
the Mafia alarm is still reading in the red alert zone. In fact, 
the Mafia families are allegedly reorganizing for their 
counterattack. 
  The interior minister's words leave no room for optimism. 
The 
recent massive seizures of arms confirm the fact that the Mafia 
clans still have "significant economic resources and means for 
intimidation and blackmail." And they are still able to 
influence the "life of entire local communities." This somber 
picture is composed of a number of elements. 
<H5>  900 in Handcuffs </H5>
  From 1 July to 17 December 1993, DIA investigations (carried 
out with a head count of 1,337 instead of the expected 1,457) 
led to 890 orders for precautionary arrest (524 members of the 
Mafia, 269 of the Camorra, 62 of the 'Ndrangheta, and 35 of the 
"sacred united crown.") At present, 103 operations are underway 
compared to 81 six months ago. 
  Some of the major causes for the prisoners' irritation with 
the state are the "restrictive measures imposed by Law 354/75 
which does not allow the Mafiosi special leaves, alternative 
forms of punishment, or the assignment to external work." 
  During the final days of 1993, they were able to completely 
reconstruct the 24 murders that had punctuated Toto Riina's rise 
to the Mafia's top leadership in the Cupola. 
<H5>  "Strategy of Terror" </H5>
  With the car bomb in Florence and the strikes on Milan and 
Rome in July, Cosa Nostra appears to have entered into a phase 
of pure terrorism. The purpose of deciding to hit symbolic 
targets, which are not connected with the activities not 
connected with judicial harassment, in unpredictable areas and 
situations, would be to "reaffirm to their followers the 
leadership of the top Cosa Nostra leaders who are now in prison." 
  This theory is supported by information obtained through 
wire 
taps in a "den" of fugitives and then by the suicide of the 
involuntary informer Antonino Gioe. The DIA believes that groups 
from Calabria, Campania, and Apulia worked together with the 
Mafia on these attacks. 
  A disturbing fact is that today the mob gangs "have access 
not only to automatic weapons but to military type explosives 
and self-propelling arms, such as missiles and recoilless 
cannons." For the most part, they come from the black markets of 
Switzerland, Croatia, and Russia. 
<H5>  The Falcone and Borsellino Cases </H5>
  Almost two years have gone by, but the DIA has not forgotten 
about "Mafia terrorism" at its highest symbolic level. According 
to the report, "the two massacres were characterized by the lack 
of any real sense of necessity or urgency. In addition to the 
objective of removing two dangerous enemies, the massacres 
served to reassure and to vindicate the men of honor sentenced 
to prison in the maxi-trial, whose sentences were almost all 
reconfirmed by the courts." 
<H5>  Rackets and Usury </H5>
  In the area of extortions, "the pressure brought to bear by 
the mob has not diminished. Racketeering continues to constitute 
a major source of illicit revenue." There has been an increased 
use of illicit funds in taking over industries and businesses. 
In 1992, in fact, 10 percent of commercial concerns were 
directly controlled by organized crime. In Sicily alone, there 
are allegedly 4,000 shops, restaurants, bars, mini-markets, and 
car dealerships with connections to the Mafia. 
  Just as serious, are the rising phenomena of usury (in the 
four regions where the "Mafia has its roots") and drug 
trafficking. 
<H5>  Politicians Targeted </H5>
  In the south, the Tangentopoli wave appears to be subsiding. 
The DIA reminds us that during 1993 34 municipal councils were 
dissolved because they had been subject to Mafia infiltration 
and influence: 10 in Sicily, two in Calabria, 17 in Campania, 
four in Puglia, and one in Basilicata. 
<H5>  The Mafia Abroad </H5>
  Mafia expansion still knows no boundaries. It has been known 
for some time that there are affiliates of the gangs from 
Sicily, Campania, and Calabria to be found in France, Germany, 
Canada, the United States, Australia, and South America. But now 
the Mafiosi are also investing in former East bloc countries. 
And by now hundreds of Italian criminals are visiting at the 
hotels of Moscow, who are interested in trafficking in drugs, 
counterfeit money, and works of art, and in laundering dirty 
money.

<F P=106> [Article by Francesco La Licata: "Watch Out for the </F>
'Ndrangheta"] 
  [Text] The minister says: "an army of 5,000 men." The 
investigators say: "It has now become a single entity with the 
Sicilian families and has reached international proportions." 
Connections with the Masonic lodges. 
  Rome--According to the repeated testimony of informers over 
a 
number of months, Cosa Nostra has almost completely absorbed the 
Calabrian Mafia, in the sense that they "have become one and the 
same thing." This is not a new phenomenon. Just think back to 
the late 1970's. When boss Gaetano Badalamenti started to fear 
his life was in danger, he went to Aspromonte to find "anonymous 
killers" to fight the mob families from Corleone. So, even 
though this revival of 'Ndrangheta infamy represents nothing 
new, it is still very worrisome to government investigators. The 
Calabrian alarm was sounded in the biannual report the DIA 
[Anti-Mafia Investigative Directorate] presented by Minister 
Mancino to Parliament. It took 39 pages chock-full of numbers, 
analyses, forecasts, and warnings to say that the menace of this 
criminal connection--which has perhaps been slightly 
underestimated because it was subconsciously relegated to the 
background by the more sensational acts of Cosa Nostra--has 
reached "international proportions." 
  'Ndrangheta can count on 155 clans, which means about 5,000 
men spread throughout the territory with powerful branches in 
some Italian regions, primarily Lombardy and Piedmont, and even 
in Europe, the United States, and Australia. For years, the 
"Santa" [something holy] (which is what they call the Mafia in 
Calabria) has been able to extend itself, branch out, and 
fortify itself until it was able to infiltrate politics and the 
economy. How? By making good use of the formidable vehicle of 
Freemasonry. According to the report of Gianni De Gennaro, DIA 
director, the Masonic lodges are allegedly "an important loop in 
connecting the Mafia with politics." It is significant that 
one-third of all Southern Masons come from Calabria. "There are 
twice as many Masons in Calabria as there are in Sicily and six 
times as many as in Campania." 
  How does the 'Ndrangheta support itself? Its main line of 
business is extortions and the trafficking of narcotics. Then 
comes kidnaping which, although it is still practiced, seems to 
have been "delegated" to the mob gangs of the hinterland, the 
bosses in the "Aspromonte mountains, which are used as a huge 
prison for kidnaped victims." 
  Protection money has become such an integral part of the 
"normal conduct of business" that it is no longer reported. And 
the victims are often hit twice--first by the Mafia and then by 
the usurers who always operate under the protection of the 
godfathers. 
  But drugs are the inexhaustible lifeline. Cocaine traffic 
seems to have become the prerogative of the Calabrians who also 
have substantial bases of operations to control its use in the 
large cities in the North. The DIA carried out two missions 
(called "Siderno Group" and "North-South") that provided an 
exact picture of the extent to which the Calabrian Mafia has 
taken root in Piedmont and Lombardy as well as in Romagna, 
Lazio, and Liguria. It is from Liguria that they control the 
activities of important gambling casinos like those in Nice and 
Menton. According to the DIA, some of the major bases of 
operations include those in Susa, Bardonecchia, Volpiano, 
Rivarolo, and Cirie--which are near Turin--while the city itself 
is controlled by the Belfiore gang. Not even the Valle d'Aosta, 
with its Nirta gang, is immune to the epidemic. 
  The synergy between 'Ndrangheta and Cosa Nostra is 
especially 
alarming. It has been shown that the Calabrian bosses have been 
practically absorbed into the Sicilian "cupola," or dome of 
leadership, as true Mafia men of honor. The most obvious proof 
of this is the assassination of Cassation Court Judge Antonino 
Scopelliti. It was an assassination that was ordered by Toto 
Riina and carried out by Calabrian "soldiers" in their own 
territory. The death of the attorney general who had been 
assigned to argue the state's case in the first maxi-trial of 
Palermo was meant to slow everything down and cause the 
deadlines for precautionary custody to elapse for the Sicilian 
bosses who had been sentenced to jail in the first trial and on 
appeal. The informers say the exchange of favors took place.

  [Text] Rome, 26 Jan (ANSA) -- The Northern League on 
Wednesday [26 January] threatened to break a government program 
agreement made just two days ago with the Pact for Italy if Pact 
leader Mario Segni attempts to make an alliance with the former 
Christian Democrats, now called the People's Party [Italian 
Polular Party--PPI]. 
  "I will withdraw my signature because I don't want to make 
agreements with the People's Party," League official Roberto 
Maroni announced, adding that if Segni "ever thought that the 
League and the PPI could be together, he was fooling himself." 
  Maroni and Segni on Wednesday signed an accord that outlined 
a government program but fell short of an official alliance for 
the March 27 elections. 
  Segni today commented that the League was standing in the 
way 
of a broad anti-left alliance and, in apparent response to 
Segni, Maroni said that "we were with the Pact and were not 
three-way." 
  Maroni stressed the differences in political thinking 
between 
the People's Party and the program outlined in the agreement 
between League and Pact, especially the part calling for direct 
election of the prime minister.

Accord'"] 
  [Text] Rome, 27 Jan (ANSA) -- People's Party [Italian 
Popular Party--PPI] Secretary Mino Martinazzoli voiced "full 
accord" with the aims of the Pact for Italy of reformer Mario 
Segni in a meeting here Thursday [27 January] morning, Segni 
aide Giuseppe Bicocchi said. 
Segni's call for direct election of a premier has long been a 
sticking point with the People's Party and its predecessor, the 
Christian Democratic Party. 
  The announcement comes just days after Segni signed a 
programme deal with the federalist Northern League, a deal which 
broke down last night when League chief Umberto Bossi said he 
would have nothing to do with the People's Party. 
  Segni is continuing a round of meetings with representatives 
from the Liberal, Socialist and other lay parties, aides said.

<F P=106> [Luis R. Aizpeolea and Anabel Diez report: "Serra and </F>
Arzalluz Meet at Moncloa Palace"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The government and the PNV [Basque 
Nationalist Party] have taken a first step toward relaxing their 
relations after three months of mutual affronts. Deputy Prime 
Minister Narcis Serra and PNV Chairman Xabier Arzalluz met 
Wednesday [19 January] at the Moncloa Palace, at the government 
"number two's" request, in order to normalize relations which 
have been troubled since the approval of the overall state 
budgets in November. 
  On that occasion, the PNV voted against several sections of 
the budget when the government did not take some of its 
amendments into account. 
  At that time, the Basque Nationalists reproached the 
government and the Socialist parliamentary group for 
discriminatory treatment in comparison with the Catalan 
nationalists of Convergence and Union (CiU). 
  Serra offered Arzalluz a reopening of dialogue between the 
government and the PNV, whose relations have passed in just six 
months from the possibility of taking part in a coalition 
government to the most severe dialectical confrontations, 
ranging from traditional condemnations of the government's 
failures to keep its word on autonomy, through a warning about 
the role of the king, to public criticism of some action by the 
Civil Guard. 
  Part of the meeting was devoted to surmounting 
misunderstandings and stopping the snowballing criticisms. This 
flood of mutual accusations reached its peak with the Basque 
Socialists' proposal for negotiating politically with Herri 
Batasuna [People's Unity Party], without previously consulting 
with the parties comprising the Ajuria Enea Pact. 
  The immediate result of the new atmosphere of dialogue will 
be an impending meeting between Minister of Public 
Administration Jeronimo Saavedra and Councillor for the Basque 
Premier's Office Joseba Zubia in order to unblock the 
negotiation of the package of 54 transfers [of areas of 
responsibility] demanded by the Vitoria government. 
  The central government intends to offer immediately to the 
Basque government a block of 15 to 20 transfers, whose ownership 
is indisputable and whose only point of friction is their 
valuation. 
  However, despite the atmosphere of relaxation created 
following the meeting between Serra and Arzalluz -- whose 
personal relationship is excellent, confirmed by regular 
contacts since Serra took up the deputy premiership in 1991 -- 
skepticism still prevails among the Basque Socialists and 
Nationalists. The proximity of the Basque autonomous community 
elections, scheduled for the fall, is the cause of the suspicion. 
  The political rivalry existing between the PNV and the 
Basque 
Socialist Party on the Basque scene must not be forgotten at a 
time when Ramon Jauregui's supporters have in mind the 
possibility of defeating Jose Antonio Ardanza's Nationalists in 
the elections. This battle will inevitably have repercussions on 
relations between the PNV -- and, as a result, the Basque 
government -- and the central administration. 
  Felipe Gonzalez' government, however, is determined as far 
as 
possible to prevent the political rivalry from going beyond the 
framework of the autonomous community and tainting the 
institutional relations which both Felipe Gonzalez and Narcis 
Serra deem essential.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Fritz Wirth: "Change Through Success"] </F>
  [Text] The time of political miracles, which began to 
change the world so dramatically five years ago, is changing 
into a time of astonishment. Hardly anybody is contributing 
more to this postmiraculous world than the man who made change 
his political trademark -- Bill Clinton. This was emphasized 
and proved by his appearance in Congress yesterday. 
  In the middle of an international landscape of political 
crises, disenchantment on the part of the voters, and 
superannuated governments, one could see one of the last and 
rare political winners. The man who a year ago in the same 
place complained about the economic crisis, which he allegedly 
inherited, has now presented himself as its triumphant master 
and winner. This is all the more astonishing since right at the 
beginning, Congress took away from him that instrument -- a 
$30-billion program for the stimulation of the U.S. economy -- 
with which he wanted to overcome the crisis. Nevertheless, the 
economy recovered, probably by following different laws than 
those that Clinton had in mind. However, yesterday he did not 
hesitate for one minute in presenting himself as the man who 
saved the nation from the crisis. 
  It is irrelevant to ask whether this bold claim of Clinton 
is 
legitimate. The only thing that counts is that the great 
majority of citizens, who like to personify political movements, 
accept Clinton in this role. This has also resulted in a 
remarkable change of the political climate in the United States. 
No longer troubled by the recession, the citizens are more 
receptive and cooperative than before. 
  The shocking and warning words of the early Clinton days -- 
"It's the economy, you idiots" -- are no longer up to date. The 
citizens are turning to other problems. They are no longer so 
interested in wealth, profit, and those priorities that 
characterized the 1980's. Priority is now being given to 
questions of personal security and the renewal of disappearing 
family values. In a nutshell: The citizens no longer expect 
the state so much to provide benefits and jobs as to act as a 
defender against the violence in the streets of the United 
States, which is getting out of hand and is breaking social 
structures. 
  Nobody has realized that faster than the populist Bill 
Clinton, who keeps in closer contact with the citizens than any 
other U.S. president has in the past three decades. Proof of 
that lies in the program that he presented yesterday. It no 
longer focuses on economic acronyms such as NAFTA [North 
American Free Trade Agreement] and GATT, but the concern about 
the health and security of the citizens. The reform of the 
health sector, and his law to contain the crime rate will be the 
crucial issues for the next few months. 
  Popular as they may be -- they will not be a comfortable 
free 
ticket to success, such as Clinton had in the way he dealt with 
the economic crisis last year. The reason is that Americans 
will be going to the polls again this year. Congress, which will 
be reelected in the autumn, will be a significantly more 
reserved and difficult partner. The Republicans, who were still 
important and willing partners for Clinton in his struggle for 
NAFTA, have already assumed an aggressive posture. They have 
criticized Clinton's reform of the health system as "socialized 
medicine" and will not let him get away with taking from them 
their reputation as the "law-and-order" party with his "crime 
bill." 
  Clinton understands his initiatives as a new partnership 
with 
the citizens for social peace. His critics have made out an 
excessive degree of state intervention in this partnership. 
Thus, the old ideological fronts between the Democrats and the 
Republicans, which seemed to have vanished in the past few 
months, will reappear. 
  In view of these internal priorities, yesterday nobody 
expected Clinton to come up with a profound foreign policy 
program. Therefore, it was all the more astonishing that he did 
not degrade the issue to a mere footnote. His statement of the 
"responsibility for leadership" was hardly part of his foreign 
policy concept last year, when he was permanently concentrating 
on looking for the emergency exits in international crises. 
Since his last visit to Europe at the latest, he felt that this 
escape route is now only open to a limited degree. The 
developments in the former Yugoslavia, the former Soviet Union, 
and North Korea will, with great probability, require action in 
the near future. The promise he made yesterday, namely to stop 
the cuts in the U.S armed forces, which he had so far vehemently 
proposed and implemented, is a first sign for a U.S. security 
policy that is no longer exclusively based on lofty words or the 
action transit to the United Nations. 
  Nevertheless, one must warn against too high expectations 
for 
change in this sphere from the so-called president of change. 
His appearance yesterday has emphasized that quite clearly: 
Bill Clinton is a brilliant political "salesman," who can still 
handle words better than power. Yet, apart from that -- as 
could be seen in the recent scandal stories -- he is still a man 
for unpredictable things. Before this president will really go 
down in history, he will first have to settle the stories that 
still accompany his career. Until then there is still much time 
for astonishment.

<F P=106> [Martin Winter report: "Kinkel Looks to Asia"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 26 Jan -- German foreign policy wants to 
concentrate on the Asian-Pacific region in the future. At the 
end of a three-day conference of the German ambassadors to Asia 
in Bonn on Wednesday [26 January], Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
(Free Democratic Party of Germany, FDP) called on politicians 
and economic representatives "not to leave" the economy "to the 
United States alone." He complained that above all the world 
economy has not taken this "most dynamic world region as 
seriously as it would have been necessary." For example, only 8 
percent of Germany's foreign trade is transacted with Asia, 
although half of the human race lives there. 
  Some time ago, Kinkel instructed the embassies in Asia to 
help German enterprises in every conceivable and possible way in 
negotiations on business transactions and the establishment of 
businesses. One must not only intensify exports, but also 
invest in Asia. According to Kinkel's estimate, economic 
commitment in time could have created 400,000 additional jobs in 
Germany. "Then we would have had fewer employment problems 
today," he said. 
  On the one hand, Bonn wants to procure better business deals 
for the German economy. On the other hand, "poverty" in Asia, 
which accompanies the economic upswing in some Asian countries, 
is to be combated by focusing on it in the field of development 
aid. To integrate the Asian economies "fully" into the world 
economy, the Federal Government wants to advocate the admission 
of China and Taiwan to the world trade agreement (GATT) and to 
support the "policy of reform and opening up in India, as well 
as in China and Vietnam." 
  Kinkel commented cautiously on the question of human rights. 
The Europeans must not "impose" their cultural principles on 
the Asian countries. He warned against a policy of "wagging an 
admonishing finger." Although human rights violations have to 
be "clearly" addressed in principle, "dignity," which is so 
important in Asia, has to be respected. It is better "to be 
secretly active" to help in concrete cases of human rights 
violations. 
  The Federal Government wants to use its presidency of the 
European Union (EU) from July to secure and implement its policy 
toward Asia at a Community level. For example, a conference 
between the EU and the organizations of Asian and Pacific states 
in Germany is planned. According to Kinkel, Bonn also wants to 
attach importance to cultural exchanges and cooperation in the 
media sector.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Beate </F>
Mueller-Blattau, from the Villa Bonn program, place not given -- 
live, monitored in progress] 
  [Text] [Kinkel] ...with the aim of doing something for the 
people affected, that must be our policy. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] You say friendly; I have problems with 
understanding that, for example in the case of China. 
  [Kinkel] Why? We have good, friendly relations with this 
country, that is the way I would put it. That changes nothing 
about the fact that at every meeting, such as last week with the 
president of the parliament, I emphatically and clearly say: you 
have committed such-and-such and such-and-such a violation of 
human rights in your country. You must please ensure 
that...[changes thought] I cannot sit there and say: we have an 
absolutely valid understanding of human rights, we are imposing 
our understanding of human rights onto you, a country like China 
with a great history and culture. They won't allow us to 
dictate to them like that. The way Mr. Mueller imagines this, 
that you can make foreign policy in this way, is just not 
possible. One must address the issue clearly, unambiguously, 
with an understanding of this country, its culture, its 
different history. That is the problem, and foreign policy is 
not a matter of getting up on a table, shouting heave-ho and 
thinking we can impose our views on others. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] Quite another country, that is Japan with 
its great economic power, is a tough competitor for German 
industry, for example the car industry. Does something have to 
change there, in economic relations? 
  [Kinkel] What does have to change mean? We must remain 
competitive, and we must assert ourselves vis-a-vis the Japanese 
car market, the engineering market, etc. It's as simple as that 
and at the same time so difficult, for the Japanese have, it is 
true, gained huge advantages over us and there are whole sectors 
where we have fallen behind technologically. Just take 
bio-engineering, where in America there are a thousand 
production facilities in this field and here there are 12. A 
thousand as against 12. 
  Last week I spoke to the German Research Institute and the 
Max Planck Institute -- we must be very careful that, as a big 
industrial country, we don't fall behind in the technology 
sector, and of course one of our great competitors is Japan. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] I deduce from that industry and foreign 
policy are quite obviously very closely connected. 
  [Kinkel] Yes, far more than before. Foreign economic and 
trade policy has become a focal issue above all for German 
foreign policy and plays a very decisive, important part for 
example in European and transatlantic relations now that the 
security issue has gone into the background following the end of 
East-West confrontation, therefore, we must devote great 
attention to these foreign trade issues in our foreign policy.

<F P=106> [Report signed "uhl": "Rexrodt: Germany Is Emerging From </F>
the Adjustment Crisis Stronger Than Before"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- According to Economics Minister Guenther 
Rexrodt, Free Democratic Party [FDP], the German economy has 
"weathered the worst" and is emerging from the greatest 
adjustment since the end of the war stronger than before. As 
the minister said after the cabinet had approved the annual 
economic report for 1994, he will not allow his views to be 
altered by "professional Cassandras." 
  Moderate wage agreements and low interest rates mean above 
all that the "growth" of between 0.5 percent and 1 percent in 
western Germany and between 6 percent and 8 percent in eastern 
Germany predicted by the government is realistic. An increase 
in prices of about 3 percent is not "too rosy a picture." As 
for the level of unemployment, which is supposed to rise by 
"about 450,000" in 1994, "a change of direction will only become 
possible in 1995." That is because this year, adjustments will 
still take place in large companies to make production cheaper. 
  Criticism from the opposition and industrial associations to 
the effect that the government is being too optimistic about 
economic development was described as "carping and much ado 
about nothing" by Rexrodt. Rexrodt also demanded "fair 
treatment" for "the program for more growth and employment." It 
is incomprehensible that "some associations are already 
complaining that we have not done anything yet." However, along 
with the annual economic report, the government has already 
repealed the law on discounts as well as produced bills for a 
new conversion law and the introduction of small-scale 
joint-stock companies. Over the next few weeks, things will 
proceed "one after another." That particularly applies to labor 
measures, which include "sensational things" contained in the 
"action program." 
  At the same time, the FDP politician complained about 
"spiritual ossification" in Germany, which manifests itself 
above all in hostility toward technology and "bureaucratic 
senility." Quoting Bismarck, the minister said: "Heavy 
industry always has a hard time." 
  Rexrodt stressed that investors need "reliable budgetary 
perspectives." Scope must be created for "the necessary 
reduction in taxes and dues." Hermann Rind, FDP spokesman on 
economic affairs, criticized statements made by Joachim 
Gruenewald of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] that in the 
next term of office, there will only be reform of company 
taxation that is neutral in its effects on revenue. As soon as 
the budgetary situation permits, the FDP would be more inclined 
to effect a genuine reduction in the taxation burden on 
companies, which is high in international terms.

  [Excerpts] Paris, Jan 27 (AFP) -- A row between France and 
the United States on Bosnia strategy intensified Thursday [27 
January] with the French Foreign Ministry accusing U.S. 
officials of being ill-informed and standing back on the 
sidelines as war raged. 
  French Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque dropped 
diplomatic niceties on Thursday to accuse the State Department 
of being "ill-informed" about France's stance after Paris urged 
the United States to take an active part in pressurising the 
belligerants to agree to a peace treaty. 
  In an allusion to the United States, he said: "If we take 
this from a moral point of view, the choice is between being 
happy to observe the fighting or to try everything to stop it." 
  He was reacting to equally sharp criticisms by the State 
Department that French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe had engaged 
in "a strange moral calculus" by urging a peace settlement on 
the "aggrieved party" -- the Bosnia Moslems -- although they 
have suffered the most from Serbian aggression. [passage 
omitted] 
  France is the biggest contributor with 6,000 men to the 
United Nations peacekeeping force in former Yugoslavia and there 
have been increasing calls for a pullout in the spring, after 
the failure of Geneva peace talks. 
  Duque said the 11 other states of the European Union shared 
the French view on the Bosnia situation and that consultations 
among Europeans would intensify in the coming days. 
  Juppe told the NEW YORK TIMES Tuesday that if the United 
States did not join in European efforts to force through a peace 
plan dividing Bosnia into three ethnically based mini-states, 
they would be responsible for a "catastrophe." 
  He said: "If the Americans do not convince the Bosnian 
Moslems that they must stop fighting and that there is no chance 
that the United States would come to their rescue, then the 
United States will give them incentives to pursue the fighting 
on the ground." 
  On Wednesday, France called for the implementation "if 
necessary with the use of force" of recent NATO decisions on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to use air strikes if necessary to relieve UN 
forces in the Moslem enclave of Srebrenica and open up Tuzla 
airport for relief supplies." 
  In a joint communique issued by President Francois 
Mitterrand 
and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, France urged the United 
Nations to "secure the necessary means as soon as possible" to 
achieve these objectives. 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation resolved at a summit 
in Brussels earlier this month to authorise the use of strikes 
by NATO warplanes to open up the two beseiged Moslem-controlled 
centres.

<F P=106> [Jacques Isnard report: "The Last-Chance Legionnaire"] </F>
  [Text] Lieutenant General Bertrand Guillaume de Sauville de 
Lapresle, a tall man, with a smooth brow, quiet, and discreet 
without being self-effacing, is the reverse of the legendary 
figure of the legionnaire -- he served in the Foreign Legion for 
a long time -- who is usually thought of as an adventurer -- 
brutal, crude, and undisciplined. 
  And yet, do not be deceived; although Gen. de Lapresle may 
not be talkative, he knows what he wants, does what he says he 
will, and does not officially have moods. Like all officers who 
have accepted the notion of discipline, he knows how to obey, 
but he also knows how to give an order and expects it to be 
carried out. At the age of 56, Bertrand de Lapresle is the 
last-chance general for the United Nations. 
  Born in Marseilles on 5 September 1937, a graduate from 
Saint-Cyr, holder of a master's degree in economic sciences and 
a graduate from the faculty of Political Sciences, Bertrand de 
Lapresle was sent to Algeria in 1960 with the airborne and 
armored troops. After 1963, he alternated posts in the Foreign 
Legion, in the armored division and cavalry units (especially in 
Germany), in the general staff, and higher military, scientific, 
and technical education institutes. 
  In August 1981, with the rank of colonel, he commanded the 
1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment in Orange (Vaucluse). From 17 May 
to 25 September 1983, Bertrand de Lapresle was chief of staff of 
the French section -- 2,000 men -- of the multinational force in 
Beirut, alongside American, Italian, and British contingents, 
called up following the Sabra and Shatilah massacres to help the 
regular Lebanese army to intervene between rival factions and 
protect the civilians. In that post, he was valued for his 
qualities as an organizer and, also, for his coolness and sense 
of diplomacy during the individual actions which the 
international force was obliged to carry out. 
  He again served in the general staff, especially in the 
"financial planning" office, and, with the rank of brigadier 
general, he was deputy chief of "operations" in the army general 
staff in 1986, and then in 1987 he became chief of the "plans, 
programs, and space" division in the army general staff. 
Promoted to major general, he commanded the 3d French Armored 
Division in Germany in 1989. Raised to the rank of lieutenant 
general in 1990, he became major general of the Army (number two 
in the hierarchy, after the chief of staff), then he was placed, 
on 1 December 1993, at the head of the five divisions of the 
Rapid Action Force (FAR). 
  In the Army, Bertrand de Lapresle is an officer who is not 
opposed by his peers or his subordinates (which is a double 
exploit). His appointment was expected and, in its way, it is a 
signal which France is sending to the United Nations. Indeed, 
Gen. de Lapresle is already being called "the last-chance 
general" in the French armed forces, the man who -- if he failed 
to agree with Mr. Butrus-Ghali on remedying the United Nations' 
shortcomings on the spot -- could be repatriated with the 6,600 
or so French blue helmets in the former Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Interview with EC Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert </F>
by Marc Paoloni and Marc Nexon in Brussels; date not given: 
"Karel Van Miert: `Gerard Longuet Has My Confidence, But The 
Treaty Is Essential'"] 
  [Text] [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Does not the act of 
prohibiting the French Government from putting another franc 
into Bull run the risk of putting that company in difficulty? 
  [Van Miert] The Commission could not let such large public 
payments be made to a company in a normal commercial environment 
without reacting. The amounts transferred in December were 
already an illegal act, because paying them contravened the 
rules of the treaty. We did nothing new by making the decision 
to which you referred. We decided to apply the provisions laid 
down in the Community acts. 
  Recently, for example, we demanded the reimbursement of two- 
thirds of the aid received by the company Grundig from the 
Austrian Government. Yet, Austria is not part of the Community. 
One should be aware that in the Grundig case, France wanted us 
to intervene in this way. The same is true for the steelmaking 
industry in Italy: The French Government felt the Commission's 
arbitration to be legitimate. The decisions we take on one side 
must also be taken on the other. That is a matter of 
consistency. 
  [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] In other words, this was not an 
expression of distrust vis-a-vis the French authorities? 
  [Van Miert] Not at all. [Foreign Trade Minister] Gerard 
Longuet made a lot of effort. He tried to come along with 
documents. The steps he took were correct. We can see that the 
minister is still going down the proposed path. We understand 
that there was a change and that that has consequences. 
However, we must also acknowledge that the explanations given 
to us by the French Government were insufficient and that we 
were extremely patient. 
  [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] The French Government explained its 
hesitancy to give precise information about Bull because of its 
confidential nature. What do you think of that? 
  [Van Miert] We are used to dealing with hundreds of matters 
under such conditions. It is a question of confidence. One 
thing is sure: We will not be in a position to make a decision 
based on the aid given to Bull until we have a detailed 
restructuring plan for the company. This plan must convince us 
of Bull's long-term viability. Otherwise, it will not even be 
possible to privatize the company. I can see that the industry 
minister is showing a desire to reorganize the group, but one 
must play by the rules of the Community game. 
  [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Is this recapitalization for full 
settlement, along with a privatization, not enough for you? 
  [Van Miert] Absolutely not. This is not the first time that 
we have examined the Bull case. People have so often told us 
"You will find out what you find out" that we might be allowed 
to harbor a few doubts. We are responsible for getting to the 
bottom of this matter -- if only out of consideration for Bull's 
competitors. I have received many letters from foreign firms, 
including European ones, which do not understand our patience 
and which feel that this situation is intolerable and cannot go 
on. 
  [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Is there the possibility of the 
Commission asking for the aid received to by paid back? 
  [Van Miert] At this stage, it is not possible to speculate 
and I refuse to do so. Let us examine the strategic plan and 
then we will see. However, it must be clear that I am not 
suspicious about France. I have confidence in Gerard Longuet 
and I can see that things are now moving at Bull. 
  [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] What will the next stages entail? 
  [Van Miert] I plan to meet with Gerard Longuet in the coming 
days and then use that meeting to get to the bottom of the Bull 
affair.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The ALCATEL-ALSTHOM Diplomacy"] </F>
  [Text] According to his advisors, Francois Mitterrand had a 
rather tense conversation with Edouard Balladur on Friday, 14 
January, at the Elysee [offices of the president of the 
Republic]. The object of the presidential ire was the communique 
on the reconciliation between France and Communist China. 
  Always according to a member of his entourage, Mitterrand 
heatedly protested to the prime minister against the very terms 
of this communique in which France accepted all the conditions 
imposed by the Chinese to reestablish normal diplomatic 
relations. To wit, the refusal to sell new arms to Taiwan and 
the acknowledgment by Paris that Taiwan belongs to Communist 
China. This leads Elysee officials to say that, "Paris literally 
lay down in front of the Chinese, accepting all the demands that 
the Americans rejected. This does not prevent them from trading 
with Beijing China while still maintaining economic relations 
with Taiwan." 
  A number of high Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials are 
also screaming about the way the decision was made: 
"Negotiations were conducted, not by a professional, but by an 
amateur, Jacques Friedmann" (a close Balladur advisor). 
"Friedmann literally let himself fall into a trap set by the 
Chinese. In reality, all of this only has one objective: to 
permit ALCATEL, FRAMATOME, GENERALE DES EAUX, and 
LYONNAISE-DUMEZ firms to obtain markets in China. As for human 
rights...." 
  A thoroughly unpleasant remark. Because renewing relations 
with China also allowed Balladur to make a small gift to Alain 
Peyrefitte, Rally for the Republic (RPR) deputy: Henceforth, 
Peyrefitte is personally in charge of reporting to the prime 
minister the hour at which China wakes up in the morning at the 
economic level. 
  The prime minister knows what to do to mollify an "internal 
enemy."

<F P=106> [Article by Claude Angeli: "Listening in on the New War in </F>
Algeria"] 
  [Excerpt] Every evening, unit commandants and regional 
military leaders transmit the day's balance sheet to Algiers: 
the dead and the wounded in each camp, then the number of 
prisoners. These conversations, encoded or not, are recorded 
and, if need be, decoded by the French intelligence services. 
  It is a simple question of technique. Above the 
Mediterranean, an Atlantic-2 plane permanently monitors these 
military communications. Lower down, in international waters, is 
the patrol boat Le Berry, belonging to the General Directorate 
for External Security (DGSE). Equipped to intercept all 
telephone and satellite communications, Le Berry records 
messages from the Algerian military but mainly monitors civilian 
governmental communications. 
  This is probably not enough to know everything that moves 
among our neighbors. In Algeria proper, the "big ears" of the 
military intelligence branch of the DGSE are also working. 
Thanks to perfected scanners, our intelligence operatives 
monitor the local communications of the special units and the 
gendarmery, which are the most deeply engaged in the fight. 
  In June 1993, for instance, our newspaper had mentioned the 
interception of a radio conversation between a unit pursuing 
clandestine operatives in an Algiers neighborhood and an 
official from the former Military Security who explicitly gave 
the order to execute the wounded fundamentalists arrested in a 
sweep. 
  This says much about the reason why Mitterrand, Balladur, 
Juppe, and Leotard should worry about Algeria. In their recent 
notes, the French services estimated the weekly balance sheet of 
this new war at 200 dead. Desertions and arms thefts occur. 
Clandestine operatives who do not hesitate to circulate in rural 
areas, show themselves to the people, attack barracks and set 
ambushes. This is no longer terrorism and repression. 
  Finally, always according to the French services, young 
Algerian officers, from lieutenants to commandants, are not all 
faithful partisans of the present leaders. This pre-civil war 
situation troubles many of them.

<F P=106> [Arturo Zampaglione report: "Clinton's Republican </F>
Turnaround -- Three Out of Four Americans Are Behind Him"] 
  [Text] Washington -- He talked of God, spoke out against 
military spending cuts, talked nostalgically of family values, 
praised the electric chair, proposed life imprisonment for 
third-time offenders, announced cutbacks in social expenditure, 
praised religious voluntary work, and attacked welfare benefits 
for the unemployed. How can any President riding on the back of 
these issues be called a democrat? How do we define the Bill 
Clinton who -- on Tuesday evening [25 January], speaking in a 
voice which was, to tell the truth, slightly hoarse -- showed 
himself at the sung mass of American politics that is the State 
of the Union speech? Right wing or left wing? Post-Reagan or 
post-Kennedy? Or, to put it in Italian terms, is he a "liberal 
democrat," a progressive, [Forza Italia leader] 
Berlusconi-follower, or a [L'UNITA editor] Veltroni-follower. 
  The truth is that in a traditional bipolar system, which the 
United States has had for some time and which Italy aspires to, 
it is often hard to pin labels on people. The mythical "center" 
of politics and of society is more of a virtual reality than a 
real place, and is occupied from time to time by both sides, 
counter to ideology and depending on contingent electoral 
convenience. Clinton's speech the other evening simply confirmed 
this. 
  The President's aim was clear: Place the White House and the 
Democratic Party in the best possible position with regard to 
the forthcoming elections. A third of the Senate will be 
reelected in November, together with the entire House of 
Representatives. If the Republicans were to win again, as they 
did two months ago with Rudolph Giuliani in New York, and 
perhaps if they managed to wrest back the majority in Congress, 
then Clinton too would be much more vulnerable at the 
presidential elections of 1996. Hence the attempt to anticipate 
events, taking up typically Republican themes such as crime and 
unemployment and attempting to woo middle class moderates. At 
the same time, the President did not want to cut all his ties 
with the traditional Democrat voters: For this reason the 
speech was a clever game of striking the balance between the 
iron fist and social expectations, and between traditional 
values and post-modern idealism. Clinton has watered down but 
has certainly not forgotten the progressive stance that took him 
to the White House, beginning with the reform of health care and 
the policy for cleaning up the ghettos. What conclusions can be 
drawn? A pragmatic platform has emerged that pleased the voters 
(84 percent of people interviewed in a CNN-USA TODAY poll said 
they thought that the President was going down the right road) 
and that he has forced out the Republicans. 
  In a televised reply, Senate minority leader Bob Dole and 
Clinton's most likely opponent in the 1996 election, could only 
criticize the inadequacy of Clinton's anticrime measures and the 
overdose of bureaucracy in the health care reforms. His party 
colleagues confirmed yesterday that the litmus paper of the 
White House anticrime strategy will be the presence of large 
amounts of money to build more prisons. 
  The fact remains that the Democratic majority is ready to 
follow the President. "The health care reform will be passed by 
Easter," predicted House of Representatives Speaker Tom Foley. 
His party certainly does not want to let the favorable 
political situation slip, with a recovering economy -- and it is 
this which seems to be most important for the voters -- where 
there are no wars on the horizon, where the White House remains 
popular in the polls, and where the program platform, i.e., 
running with the hare and hunting with the hounds, keeps the 
number of malcontents to a minimum.

<F P=106> [Umberto Rosso report: "Agreement on Bossi in the North, </F>
Fini in the South?"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The Black Knight is back. Berlusconi is 
entering the arena -- now that [Pact for Italy leader] Segni has 
eaten humble pie and returned to [Italian Popular Party (PPI) 
Secretary] Martinazzoli -- and acting as a link between 
[National Alliance leader] Fini and [League Secretary] Bossi, to 
bring under the same banner the troops of the National Alliance 
deployed in the South and the army of the League that commands 
the North. The plan -- which also embraces the members of 
D'Onofrio's and Casini's "Christian Democratic Renaissance" is, 
as expected, about to acquire a "post-fascist" black tinge 
imparted by Gianfranco Fini. In fact an electoral agreement is 
apparently ready, though the people concerned are officially 
denying it. "The situation is fluid and in flux," according to 
Maurizio Gaspari, co-editor of IL SECOLO D'ITALIA, "but there is 
a willingness to come to an agreement, even though the League is 
dominated by Bossi...." Roberto Maroni, the League's lower 
house floor leader, was cautious on the subject of portioning 
agreements in a statement issued by the press bureau. However, 
there were rumors in parliament that "technical" negotiations 
have already reached an advanced stage, that there is a pact to 
divide electoral Italy between the forces under Berlusconi's 
umbrella. The Social Movement [MSI] -- or, rather, the National 
Alliance [AN] -- which does not command huge support in the 
North, would stand aside: According to these rumors, the MSI 
candidates would not contest the northern constituencies. So 
all Fini's votes would go to the League, the Berlusconi 
Alliance's tank regiment in the Po Valley and the surrounding 
area, which will not relinquish its own symbol. What would the 
MSI receive in return? A free hand in central and southern 
Italy. Here the League is virtually nonexistent, but the AN 
would receive a shot in the arm from Berlusconi's supporters. 
This, through agreements in individual constituencies whereby 
backing would be granted either to the MSI candidate or to the 
Forza Italia candidate. Fini would be left with the 
traditionally strongest areas -- Naples and other southern 
cities, for instance. Elsewhere, the lists would be headed by 
Berlusconi and in some instances by Mastella's CCD [Democratic 
Christian Center]. In these places the postfascists, Forza 
Italia, and the CCD might share the same symbol -- a new one 
created for the occasion. As for the proportional quota, 
however, there would be no constraints, and each one would 
compete under their own symbol. 
  But this "four-way" contest will be won and lost in the 
first-past-the-post poll. Technical agreements may change and 
the elaborate arrangements for the constituencies could be 
modified, but it is Berlusconi who is the alignment's political 
guarantor. Gianfranco Fini is pleased with Berlusconi's 
self-investiture speech: "I agree with what he says and also 
with his direct involvement in politics." On the eve of his 
party's congress, the MSI secretary expressed the hope that "his 
entry into the front that commands a majority in the country and 
that stands in opposition to the left will not cause further 
splits among the moderates, because if so, it would certainly 
please [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto." 
  So everyone is united. Yesterday Fini drew closer to the 
refugees from the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and the 
"extremists" of the CCD, in talks lasting an hour at the MSI's 
offices at Montecitorio [lower house] with Pierferdinando 
Casini, Clemente Mastella, and Francesco D'Onofrio. The AN was 
also represented by Giuseppe Tatarella, the MSI's floor leader. 
"We are watching the evolution of the AN with great interest," 
Casini said. "We have urged a more rapid process of revision 
and, at the same time, have reaffirmed our desire for a 
constitutionalization of the right." 
  Berlusconi had already reached an agreement with the MSI 
leader in the local elections, having publicly declared that he 
would be voting for him. And this fellow-feeling, despite some 
ups and downs, has continued, through the convention, the MSI's 
change of course, and Fini's tribute at the Fosse Ardeatine. 
What about the League? Bossi's solemn and unyielding rejection 
of the right could prove to be worth as much as his insults to 
Segni, which were followed by a handshake, which has itself now 
given way to further threats against Segni. In other words, 
yesterday's enemies could become today's traveling companions on 
the road to 27 March. Then there is Berlusconi, the heart of 
the entire operation, who is opening up to Fini. As pointed out 
by Valerio Zanone, the former Liberal secretary now a member of 
Segni's alignment, who considers mistaken "the confidence placed 
in the AN, it is necessary to set our sights on the center, not 
on extreme positions." Yes, there is a new political factor, as 
ACLI [Christian Associations of Italian Workers] Chairman 
Giovanni Bianchi said: "Berlusconi is introducing into the 
political scene his ability to bring Bossi and Fini together, to 
act as a bridge between the armies of the League in the North 
and those of the AN in the South...."

<F P=106> [Article by Daniele Martini: "The Tax Nightmare"] </F>
  [Text] The real figures concerning the tax burden: 
Taxpayers paid 20 trillion lire more in 1993. But 1994 also 
threatens to be a terrible year. Here is why. 
  In mid-November, Sister Maria Lucia Soncini gave in to the 
Internal Revenue Service. "We were gathered together for our 
spiritual exercises when I decided to take a bold step," said 
this mother superior of 22 cloistered Dominican sisters of the 
San Giuseppe nunnery in the town of Fontanellato (population 
6,000, with one parish), 20 km from Parma. "There would be no 
more Eucharist wafers for the local parishioners." She said the 
taxes were to blame. "They wanted to make us open a VAT 
[value-added tax] account, and they ordered us to have a cash 
register. We would also be required to produce receipts and 
invoices.... All because of 200,000 lire in sales per month. I 
sought advice, and was told that this was more trouble than it 
was worth. Then a fellow nun from a convent in Macerata told me 
that for their wafers they had been fined 6 million lire, and I 
thought: Where would I get such a sum? I made up my mind on the 
spot. Enough is enough. No more holy wafers." Sister Maria Lucia 
and the other nuns will henceforth prepare the Host only for 
their own convent. "Now I want to see if they will also impose a 
tax on homemade bread," she added. 
  Well, it would not be surprising if they did. An internal 
revenue service--the only one in the world that dares to make 
its citizens pay a tax of 100,000 lire (for opening a VAT 
account) in order to collect other taxes--might well entertain 
such an idea. Especially in these times. The year 1993 was the 
annus horribilis [terrible year] of taxes, in which 
the burden on individual citizens and firms underwent an 
exceptionally sharp rise following a decade of sustained and 
constant growth--the sharpest rise recorded in any of the 
industrialized countries. In the meantime, however, the services 
provided by the state neither increased nor improved, and 
neither did the fight against tax evasion make any progress. 
  According to some economists--for example, Paolo Leon and 
his 
colleagues of the CLES [expansion not given] research 
institute--the tax burden as a percentage of GDP grew by more 
than 1.5 percent in 1993. Inasmuch as GDP has risen to more than 
1.5 quadrillion lire, the computation is easily made. Individual 
citizens and firms in 1993 paid over 20 trillion lire more in 
taxes than they did the previous year. 
  It is an enormous sum. Until a few weeks ago, however, 
Finance Minister Franco Gallo was declaring with pride that the 
tax burden had actually been lighter in 1993 than during the 12 
previous months: specifically, 1 percent lighter. Not even he is 
making that claim any longer, however. On the afternoon of 
Monday, 3 January, Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi reached 
Gallo by telephone in Venice--where the finance minister was 
vacationing--to agree on a statement concerning the progress 
made with respect to taxes, in response to the thousand 
controversies that had broken out the previous day. Gallo 
suggested that it would be better to talk about the expectations 
for 1994, the year when--the government promises--the tax burden 
should decrease by 1.2 percent. This stated objective is at 
variance, however, with rumors concerning an umpteenth fiscal 
maneuver to be carried out next spring, and also with the 
plethora of taxes large and small that were actually enacted 
late last year and that the taxpayers will have to pay in 1994. 
  The government--and some newspapers--have called this 
maneuver "the minimaneuver." Perhaps because it will impact a 
populace that has already been hard hit--and perhaps also 
because spirits are already overheated in anticipation of the 
spring elections--it has caused an uproar. At the very beginning 
of the year, Mario Segni lit the fuse by floating the idea of a 
fiscal pact between the state and its citizens that would be 
based on the imposition of "a strict freeze on the tax burden." 
Segni is convinced that "a limit on the tax burden and on public 
spending as a percentage of GDP must be established as a 
constitutional norm, so that it cannot be circumvented." 
  It is an idea--welcomed by the moderate elements--that has 
suddenly appeared to be the ideal adhesive to bind together a 
center-right program for governing: an idea for which Silvio 
Berlusconi--the publisher of PANORAMA (among other things) who 
has now been projected onto the political stage--offered an 
explanation. "It is not possible to improve public accounts by 
increasing revenues without controlling spending." We should 
abandon the old method and put a ceiling on taxes--a ceiling 
written into law. "What we need," he explained, "is 
constitutional norms to regulate the decisions made concerning 
taxation and spending. We can no longer allow ourselves to sign 
promissory notes." 
  Lega leader Umberto Bossi quickly gave his approval, 
hastening to point out that he himself has been reiterating 
these ideas for a long time. But the opposite front--the left 
front--has been firing point-blank broadsides at the 
Segni-Berlusconi proposal. 
  The harshest criticism has come from PDS [Democratic Party 
of 
the Left] leader Achille Occhetto. "It is a demagogic idea," he 
said, "that resembles those propounded by petty South American 
dictators. It is as if I--to win votes--were to promise that if 
I won, I would hand out champagne and brioches to all Italians." 
Writing in L'UNITA, Vincenzo Visco--who was finance minister for 
a few hours in the Ciampi administration and is currently the 
PDS expert on taxation--branded the concept of a ceiling on 
taxes with similarly harsh words. "It is mere propaganda," he 
said. Giorgio La Malfa, Ottaviano Del Turco, and a number of 
economists are also on the same wavelength. 
  "One of the old evils of the financial left is surfacing," 
says Giulio Tremonti, one of Italy's best known tax experts, 
"namely, the belief that reform of the public debt is possible 
within the old framework represented by the current system of 
taxation, whereas it is necessary to get rid of the entire 
system." Bocconi University Rector Mario Monti and other 
economists, while keeping their distance from the strident tones 
of the controversy, have nonetheless welcomed the fact that the 
political confrontation is finally moving toward concrete issues. 
  And it is hard to find anything more concrete than taxes. To 
find new revenues in 1993, the government was compelled to 
resort to three different economic maneuvers in only seven 
months: in May; in September, on the occasion of the 
introduction of the budget bill; and now, at year's end. Budget 
Minister Luigi Spaventa has himself acknowledged that "taxes in 
1993 reached levels that are truly unbearable." "For example," 
he pointed out, "we paid taxes on our homes two or three times." 
In the year just ended, the measures enacted by the previous 
government--that of Giuliano Amato--began to take effect, 
starting with the drastic revision of the IRPEF [personal income 
tax] rates that suddenly raised the tax burden on individuals to 
the very high levels that prevailed before 1988. 
  The increase in the rates was by no means compensated by the 
tax reduction on ownership of the first home or even the 
reduction in the advance payment of the IRPEF to 95 percent from 
98 percent, among other things because the Amato administration 
had taken steps to thin out the deductions allowed. For example, 
the ILOR (local income tax) is no longer deductible, and medical 
expenses, insurance expenses, and interest paid on loans are 
deductible to a lesser extent than in the past. 
  Even the VAT underwent repeated upward revisions during 
1993, 
the last of which came at year's end. The tax was raised to 13 
percent from 12 percent on 17 classes of products ranging from 
disks to corn flakes [preceding two words in English], from 
ornamental plants to lobsters, and from certain articles of 
clothing to shoes. It was reduced on five-star hotels to 13 
percent from 19 percent, but compared to the other revisions 
these are clearly of little significance, among other things 
because in the financial maneuver of last May the government 
provided that the advance VAT payments would be made even 
earlier and would be raised to 90 percent from 60 percent. The 
experts have calculated that the average rate of VAT increased 
half a percentage point in one year--to 12 percent from 11.5 
percent. In absolute terms, this represents an additional 2 
trillion lire for the state coffers. 
  In the group of the five major taxes--i.e., those that yield 
the most substantial percentages of the total of taxes 
collected--only the IRPEG [corporate income tax] and ILOR were 
not revised upward. There is talk of reducing the tax withheld 
on bank interest, but for the time being it remains at 30 
percent. In the meantime, those taxes that are technically 
defined as "excise taxes" and that constitute the third source 
of revenue--i.e., the taxes on gasoline, methane, and alcoholic 
beverages--were also raised. In 1993, the minimum tax [preceding 
two words in English] began to yield revenue: According to some 
estimates, it produced approximately 4 trillion lire for the 
state coffers, while the ICI--the municipal real estate 
tax--yielded 14 trillion. 
  But it was not just the major taxes. It was also a year to 
forget as far as minor taxes were concerned. For example, the EC 
directive "on the subject of the exemption of dividends from the 
income tax levied on mother-daughter companies" was received in 
March. Whereas in all the European countries minimum thresholds 
of participation were established to determine when a company 
may be regarded as a "daughter" company--with the aim of 
facilitating the exemption to the maximum possible extent--in 
Italy the very high threshold of 25 percent was chosen. "It is a 
self-destructive measure," comments Enrico Nuzzo, professor of 
tax law at the University of Naples. "You not only do not 
attract foreign capital and foreign companies in this manner, 
but you also do not halt the exodus of Italian capital and 
Italian enterprises." 
  If 1993 made the taxpayers cry, 1994 is making them tremble. 
No sooner had the end-of-the-year maneuver been executed than 
rumors began to circulate to the effect that another maneuver 
would be necessary immediately after the elections, obviously 
accompanied by the usual tax increases. Even Undersecretary of 
Finance Stefano De Luca and Raffaello Lupi, tax expert and 
adviser to Finance Minister Gallo, do not deny this. "One cannot 
rule out the possibility of an adjustment in the spring designed 
to plug other holes in the tax structure; to thwart tax evasion 
strategies; and at the same time to grant tax relief, as for 
example with respect to taxes on company profits that are 
reinvested." Hypotheses are already being advanced as to the 
measures that might be taken: for example, more stringent laws 
relating to transactions conducted entirely abroad by Italian 
companies and relating to mergers among companies. 
  This does not mean that the category of unearned income has 
been overlooked. At the very end of the year, the government 
decided to introduce a bill that would delegate to the executive 
branch the power to tax profits from the sale of stock. The 
subject is an extremely delicate one, and there is danger that 
the Internal Revenue Service will for the umpteenth time score a 
goal against its own team. The tax experts are urging caution. 
"Targeting income from financial sources at this time," they 
say, "would amount to opening the doors to a massive flight of 
capital." And that is precisely what is not needed. 
<H5>  [Box, p 148] </H5>
<H5>  Famous Next to the Last Words </H5>
  "I believe that legal mechanisms should be introduced that 
would automatically reduce the deficit to zero and keep it 
there." Who is speaking? Is it Silvio Berlusconi, Mario Segni, 
or Umberto Bossi? Or some new standard bearer of the 
center-right alliance that is now being formed? Not at all; 
these words were spoken in 1988 by Antonio Maccanico, who today 
is under secretary of the office of prime minister in an 
administration that has been firing incendiary shells at the 
proposal that would put a ceiling on the tax burden--by means of 
a constitutional amendment, if necessary--with the aim of 
holding down spending and continuing the efforts to balance the 
national budget. 
  In an interview he granted to L'EUROPEO six years ago, 
Maccanico was explicit on the subject of ceilings. "Governmental 
reform," he said, "must also extend to the sector of the public 
finances by amending not only the laws and regulations now in 
effect but--if necessary--the Constitution as well." And he 
added: "The time has come to regard controlling the national 
budget as an institutional emergency." Are these ideas 
extemporaneous, thought out in solitude? Not at all. During the 
interview, Maccanico declared that his convictions were also 
shared by the Bank of Italy, which was at that time headed by 
the very same Carlo Azeglio Ciampi who is the current prime 
minister. 
  In Maccanico's opinion, the guiding principle for initiating 
the reform process should have been a measure modeled on the 
Gramm-Rudman Act, a law introduced in 1985 by the Reagan 
administration to balance the budget. "The basic principle of 
that mechanism," Maccanico declared, "should be imitated, which 
is to make the Parliament and the government legally obligated 
to pursue the goal of balancing the government's books."

  [Text] The prime minister said today that he expects 
constitutional rights to be respected during the general strike 
scheduled for tomorrow, with the right to work being respected 
as well as the right to strike. Felipe Gonzalez added that the 
day after the general strike, the government's policy will 
remain the same as it is today. The prime minister made these 
remarks at the end of a news conference he held with Finnish 
Prime Minister Esko Aho at the Moncloa. Over to Pedro Fernandez 
Cespedes. 
  [Cespedes] Good afternoon. Hours before the general strike, 
Felipe Gonzalez has repeated his willingness to hold a dialogue 
with the representatives of the social parties, with an open 
mind. He will have the same attitude on the day after the 
strike. This led Felipe Gonzalez to say that the strike does 
not make sense. However, he also underlined that he cannot agree 
to a bilateral negotiation -- that is to say a negotiation 
[between government and trade unions] which would exclude 
employers -- nor will he agree to withdraw the reform. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] We agree to change the result of 
an agreement between the social parties. But we are not willing 
-- and I will say it now and I will state it clearly -- to give 
in to pressure that will harm the interests of our country, the 
interests as we understand them to be, and as they are seen by 
the majority of parliament. [end recording] 
  [Cespedes] According to the prime minister, the government 
believes it has taken the necessary measures to guarantee both 
the right to strike and the right to work, freely and without 
coercion. Felipe Gonzalez hopes that everyone's behavior will 
make this possible.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Nicolas Redondo, secretary general of </F>
the General Workers' Union, UGT, and Antonio Gutierrez, 
secretary general of the Workers' Commissions, by unidentified 
announcer -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Good evening Mr. Nicolas Redondo, 
secretary general of the UGT. 
  [Redondo] Good evening. 
  [Announcer] Good evening Mr. Antonio Gutierrez, top leader 
of 
the Workers' Commissions. 
  [Gutierrez] Good evening. 
  [Announcer] To use in an orderly manner the time and your 
live contribution here on Radio Nacional, for which we thank 
you, I would like to ask you for a brief assessment of what has 
happened today in Spain. Mr. Redondo?. 
  [Redondo] Well, I believe that the figures speak for 
themselves, don't they? And what's more, this strike has been 
visually apparent. We have seen empty roads, we have seen the 
situation in a perceptible form. The foreign media -- CNN and 
other media such as those in Britain, Italy, or France -- 
acknowledge the success of the strike. All the same, it's 
rather odd how this country has to be different, because [words 
indistinct] to realize the truth than the foreigners. But 
having said that, no one doubts the success of the strike -- 
huge support from [words indistinct] and very considerable 
support from society. Therefore we are highly satisfied. 
Millions of people have taken part in this strike and the 
appropriate conclusions must be drawn from that. 
  [Announcer] Mr. Antonio Gutierrez, is the success of the 
strike first and foremost? 
  [Gutierrez] That's right, I believe that it is an 
unquestionable fact. That the immense majority of working men 
and women and of those who may be workers in the future -- young 
people, students, or otherwise -- have supported this strike on 
such a large scale, convinced that it was just, that it was 
necessary, and also quite determined that this strike should be 
very beneficial for the country and for the workers. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Announcer] Mr. Gutierrez, what are the terms of the letter 
you have sent to [Prime Minister] Felipe Gonzalez asking him for 
negotiations? 
  [Gutierrez] Well, the truth is that out of basic 
responsibility and courtesy, we do not wish the exact contents 
of the letter to be known to the media before he receives it. 
But, summing it up briefly, what we convey to him is that 
following the success of this strike, which gives a lesson in 
democracy and civic conduct and shows up those who have spread 
alarm about possible violence and all that, we ask him for a 
meeting so that the government can respond as soon as possible 
to this demand to change -- by means of negotiations -- labor 
reforms. Because the stubborn ones are those who, in spite of 
the proof of this widespread rejection, in spite of the proof of 
the failure of their economic and social policy, stick to the 
same line. As Nicolas says we are in no way stubborn. What we 
do is reflect, reflect positively, on what is happening and 
offer negotiations. We are not saying that the revealed truth 
of the trade unions must be accepted here 100 percent. It seems 
that it is the government that has maintained such a position 
until now, not us. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has reemphasized that he 
accepts the principles of the package of confidence-building 
measures proposed by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
and is ready to begin talks on ways to implement the measures as 
soon as the Turkish Cypriot side states the same clear and 
unconditional acceptance. Since the Turkish side has not 
accepted the package and seven months have been lost, the 
president proposes that the secretary general have the two sides 
return to a discussion of the substance of the Cyprus issue, 
beginning with their concerns about security issues, until the 
Turkish side decides on the confidence-building measures. 
Kliridhis' positions are outlined in his letter to the 
secretary general the text of which was made public today in 
Nicosia. 
  In his seven-page letter, the president reiterates his 
position that he accepts the package of confidence-building 
measures as proposed by Butrus-Ghali, that is, the whole 
fenced-off area of Famagusta coming under UN administration and 
the Nicosia International Airport reopening under United 
Nations' control. The president stresses that Turkish Cypriot 
leader Rauf Denktas has not replied in a straightforward way on 
whether he accepts the agreement proposed by Butrus-Ghali. 
After wasting seven months since June, when the talks were 
suspended because of his stance, the Turkish Cypriot leader's 
own letter to the secretary general raises several issues 
outside the framework of the principles set out by the UN 
secretary general. 
  Kliridhis writes various notes on particular issues raised 
by 
Denktas and submits three questions, stressing that he expects 
clear answers to these questions: First, whether Denktas 
accepts, irrespective of his so-called concerns about security 
issues, that the whole fenced-off area of Famagusta be turned 
over to the United Nations to administer and police and that the 
Greek Cypriot residents will return to their homes and 
properties. Second, whether Denktas abandons any notion of the 
Greek Cypriot side recognizing, either directly or indirectly, 
through any practical measures, legal status for the occupied 
ports and the airport in the north. Third, whether Denktas 
accepts that any confidence-building measures agreed upon must 
be implemented without waiting to see if they are in line with 
an overall and complete Cyprus solution. 
  The president continues: On Denktas' concerns about security 
issues raised in his letter to Your Excellency, both regarding 
the final solution and the confidence-building measures, I wish 
to highlight that the Greek Cypriot side also has serious 
concerns about security issues. Since both sides, the president 
adds in his letter, admit that they have serious concerns about 
security, obviously, we must discuss and resolve this issue 
before any other, instead of finding it in front of us every 
time we reach a step toward progress. If Denktas is ready to 
discuss both sides' concerns about security, I am ready to 
participate, the president concludes.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Kiriakos Kiriakidhis: "Secret Meeting </F>
of Clark and Feissel with Boucher on the Cyprus Issue"] 
  [Excerpt] In a secret meeting at the U.S. Embassy shortly 
before Wednesday's [26 January] meeting of ambassadors of the 
five UN Security Council permanent members, Joe Clark, the UN 
secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, asked for 
the United States' "help" so that the Turkish side withdraws the 
conditions that the United Nations says obstruct the beginning 
of talks on the confidence-building measures. According to 
exclusive information secured by I MAKHI, the United States was 
represented at the meeting, which lasted 20-30 minutes, by U.S. 
Ambassador Richard Boucher and high-ranking diplomatic officer 
Carolyn Huggins and the United Nations by Clark and Gustave 
Feissel. The UN secretary general's special representative 
briefed the Americans on his contacts and the problems and 
difficulties that surfaced and asked the Americans to help and 
contribute so that the Turkish side will withdraw the conditions 
set out in [Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf] Denktas' letter and 
that make discussion of ways to implement the 
confidence-building measures impossible. The same reliable 
sources note that Clark and Feissel expressed certainty that the 
road to begin discussing ways to implement the 
confidence-building measures will open up if the Turkish Cypriot 
side withdraws the three basic points from the conditions it set 
out in Denktas' letter. The same reliable sources said that for 
this reason and following a demand by the U.S. ambassador, the 
communique issued after the meeting of the five ambassadors 
included an explicit reference to the UN secretary general's 
report to the Security Council dated 1 July 1993. This report 
noted, among other things, that the secretary general's three 
documents on the confidence-building measures must be accepted 
in principle and without conditions by the two sides. The three 
points that Clark and Feissel noted prevent dialogue from 
beginning are: 
  1. Denktas' demand to operate the illegal Tymbou airport at 
the same time as Nicosia Airport reopens. This is something 
that will clearly give political advantage to the Turkish 
Cypriot side, since UN permission to operate the occupied 
airport will, as a result, constitute recognition of the 
pseudostate. 
  2. The "security" points the Turkish Cypriot leader raises 
and the conditions set out for handing over the whole of the 
fenced-off area of Famagusta. 
  3. The "possibility" of Denktas demanding that the United 
Nations retake the town if he is not satisfied with the 
measures. [passage omitted]

letter to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, the President of 
the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Rauf Denktas said: `If 
Sufficient Guarantees Are Given on Benefits to the Turks on the 
Island, Then Varosha Will Be Opened Under UN Control as an Area 
for Contacts and Cooperation Between the Two Communities'"] 
  [Text] Nicosia -- Rauf Denktas, the president of the 
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC], announced that they 
agreed to discuss the opening of Nicosia Airport and Varosha 
[Maras], as stipulated in the confidence-building package, after 
having studied the reports of the UN secretary general and 
experts. 
  In his statement to reporters, Denktas said: "The package is 
based on the principle of providing major economic benefits to 
the Turkish side. The UN secretary general and experts 
confirmed this. Our people will witness this. If such a 
situation really does exist, then naturally it will be easy to 
hold talks." 
<H5>  What Does the Mini-Package Include </H5>
  Briefly, Denktas said the following: 
  1. "So far, we were concerned with what the package gave to 
and took from us. In approaching the package, we are still 
defending the principles that we uphold, and we are agreeing to 
talk with goodwill. 
  2. "We are given firm guarantees that we can fly anywhere in 
the world from Nicosia Airport with our own passports, that the 
flight control area of Ercan [Tymbou] Airport and the Ercan 
flight information zone will not be affected, and that Ercan 
will continue to function as it does at present. 
  3. "Our airplanes registered in Turkey will land and take 
off from Nicosia Airport without any intervention. 
  4. "This way, the embargo will be mostly broken. The 
entrance to this airport will be through two separate doors 
enabling us to have full control over entrances to TRNC. 
  5. "The FIR [flight information region] between us and 
Turkey will probably not be affected and will continue to exist 
as it is, as this is related to our security." 
  6. Explaining that they have been told that the package has 
been drawn up not to deceive the sides but to open the way to 
new cooperation and, in the words of the UN secretary general, 
to provide major economic advantages to the Turkish Cypriots 
subjected to embargo for years, Denktas said: "We will look at 
the results at the end of the talks to see if our expectations 
are justified, and then we will ask our people: What do you say? 
  "I do not want to start an argument by replying to 
Kliridhis' 
statements in Thessaloniki. 
  "The UN secretary general is well aware of our position. He 
also knows on which principles we will not retreat. Our desire 
is to hold talks in goodwill." 
<H5>  Shuttle Diplomacy in TRNC Starting Today </H5>
  Indicating that the UN secretary general's special 
representative in Cyprus Joe Clark will meet with him and 
Kliridhis today, Denktas said that shuttle diplomacy might start 
between the sides at the end of February, and in the case of 
positive results the need might arise to go to New York.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias today met German 
Deputy Foreign Minister Helmut Schaefer. During the talks, they 
ascertained that they have similar views and the German deputy 
foreign minister described allegations of tense Greek-German 
relations as rumors. 
  The two officials discussed the former Yugoslavia, 
particularly the Bosnian problem, and the Cyprus issue. Asked 
about Skopje, the German deputy minister said Greece and Skopje 
should talk to solve their problems. He also supported that 
sentimentality, as he described it, should at last be removed 
from this issue.

<F P=106> [Article by K. Y. Tsapoyas: "What Is Hidden Behind </F>
Clinton's Recovery"] 
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton confirmed the 
predictions of those who had said that as governor of Arkansas 
he made significant mistakes at first but later corrected them 
and erased the negative picture he created. 
  A year after he took over the Presidency and saw his 
popularity fall to the lowest point experienced by any U.S. 
President in his first year, Clinton yesterday reached the other 
end of the scale, with the most successful--even his opponents 
described it thus-- State of the Union address. Even former 
Vice President Dan Quayle predicted that Clinton would be U.S. 
President for a second four-year term. 
  It was not Clinton's effort that caused the popular view to 
change. It was the visible improvement of the economy, which 
did not stem from Clinton's own actions. But Clinton managed to 
disengage himself from his destructive involvement in issues 
like Somalia, Yugoslavia, and Haiti. Recently, and for the 
first time, Washington appeared to have acquired an organized 
policy for the post-Cold War period, something that can be seen 
in the results of Clinton's recent European tour. During the 
tour, he avoided emphasizing foreign policy issues, knowing that 
the Americans are only interested (usually negatively) when 
their compatriots are involved. 
  In his address yesterday, Clinton was careful to give 
international policy the position it deserves (according to the 
U.S. popular view). It simply gave an assurance that a good 
quality of life must be secured for Americans. 
  Clinton's choosing to emphasize the restructuring of 
healthcare and combating crime was no accident; it proved to be 
extremely successful. A day before his address, 39 percent of 
Americans said they believed the White House priority should be 
to combat crime, 35 percent asked that healthcare be 
restructured, 14 percent asked that the budget deficit be 
limited, and 11 percent wanted the social security system to be 
restructured.

<TEXT>
Language: <F P=105> French </F>
Article Type:CSO 

  In an article in the 18 January Paris daily LIBERATION, 
Robert de Bruin, communications director for the French Banking 
Association, protests the damaging comments that greeted the 
Greek EC presidency and influenced West European political 
leaders, leading to the official recognition of the Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. True, Greeks are "often 
disconcerting" and have lacked "the gift of communication" on 
the Macedonian issue, de Bruin admits. Also, European 
"ambiguity" vis-a-vis modern Greece must be acknowledged. 
However, the Greek presidency ought to be seen as a "chance" for 
Europe, he argues. An Orthodox and Balkan country will preside 
over Europe at a time when the continent's political future will 
be defined by the relationship between the European Union [EU] 
and Orthodox Russia, as well as by the "boiling Balkan 
cauldron." To disregard Greece's opinion on Macedonia or contest 
its capability to lead the EU would be as ridiculous as deciding 
the future of Europe by "disregarding the Franco-German axis," 
de Bruin contends. Furthermore, a European Greece is an economic 
"chance" as well, he continues. While the press only speaks of a 
"lost economy" propped up by EC subsidies, a drachma zone is 
beginning to take shape in the Balkans; and even if the Greek 
currency is not very strong, Greece possesses a stable currency 
in the eyes of Romanians, Bulgarians, and Albanians. Finally, if 
it is "shameful" to take advantage of Brussels' subsidies, 
perhaps the European presidency ought to be denied to Ireland or 
Portugal, de Bruin comments. "Let us listen to Greece, for we 
have been lucky enough to have had as a European partner an 
Orthodox, Balkan Greece endowed with a per capita economic 
potential equal to Italy's," he concludes.

  [Text] Air Force Command warplanes carried out an 
operation against the Zhalah camp of the terrorist PKK [Workers 
Party of Kurdistan] organization in northern Iraq. Heavy losses 
were inflicted on the PKK terrorists in the camp, who are 
believed to number around 1,600. 
  Fifty F-16 and F-4 warplanes, one reconnaissance plane, and 
five helicopters took part in the operation. The warplanes made 
52 sorties during close to 30 minutes. They dropped a total of 
132 bombs, including cluster bombs and 500- and 2,000-pound 
bombs. The photographs taken at the end of the operation show 
that the camp administrative units, as well as the ammunition 
depots and shelters, were destroyed. The planes returned safely 
to base. 
  At a briefing at the General Staff Headquarters this 
morning, 
Admiral Attila Tuzman, acting deputy chief of the General Staff, 
and Lieutenant General Ali Gullu, Air Force staff commander, 
discussed the details of the operation. [one-minute indistinct 
passage] 
  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller went to the General Staff 
Headquarters this morning and was briefed on the operation. 
  [Begin Lt. Gen. Gullu recording] At 0600 [0400 GMT] this 
morning, two reconnaissance planes took off, and from 0700 to 
0710 reported that the meteorological conditions were suitable 
for the offensive. Our honorable chief of the General Staff 
then declared that we could begin the offensive. Our planes 
began to take off at 0810. The offensive began at 0900 and 
lasted until 0928. At 0936, the last air photograph of the 
region was taken and the mission ended. All our planes 
returned safely to base after successfully fulfilling their 
mission. On the basis of the reconnaissance results, we will 
resume the operation whenever ordered. [end recording]

  [Text] At 0900 this morning, our Air Force hit the Zhalah 
camp. As you know, the Zhalah camp recently replaced the 
al-Biqa' Valley. The terrorists were being trained and 
sheltered in this camp, and they were providing logistics 
support to the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization in 
Turkey. Approximately 1,600 terrorists were nestled there. We 
also received intelligence information to the effect that the 
leaders of the PKK were among these terrorists. We also know 
that of the 1,600 persons, approximately 300 were armed, female 
militants. 
  Our Air Force launched an operation at 0810 this morning. 
Our planes took off and the Zhalah camp was bombed at 0900. 
This operation will continue. To my satisfaction, I was 
informed a while ago that the operation was completely on target. 
  This was a political decision, and it had to be made. As I 
stated earlier, 1994 must be an important turning point in the 
struggle against terrorism. In order to turn 1994 into a year 
in which terrorism is placed under control, we, on one hand, 
waged our struggle abroad on a diplomatic level by explaining 
our just cause and, on the other, displayed our political 
determination today by hitting the Zhalah camp, which had become 
the most important region providing logistics support for the 
PKK.

  [Text] Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, who was expected in 
Beirut today to attend the deputies discussion of the statement 
he presented to them a week ago, has changed the route of his 
return journey from London, stopping over in Istanbul and 
al-Qardahah. In Istanbul, he and his ministerial delegation 
held brief talks with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and 
Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin on a number of issues. Al-Hariri 
also attended part of a meeting between Ciller and Pakistani 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who stopped over in Istanbul on 
her way back home from the economic forum in Dafos, Switzerland. 
  Al-Hariri's talks with Ciller dealt with the construction 
issues that he discussed during his recent official visit to 
Turkey. He said before the meeting that the talks would include 
a plan to purchase electricity from Turkey. He told 
journalists: We want to know Turkey's current position 
concerning electricity supplies and we also want to complete a 
tax agreement between our countries. 
  The Turkish foreign minister said later that Lebanon wants 
to 
go ahead with an electricity purchase deal. Mrs. Ciller said 
following the meeting with al-Hariri that they discussed 
bilateral relations, especially the economic aspects, which she 
said was discussed during al-Hariri's recent visit to Turkey. 
The discussions also dealt with other issues of concern to the 
world, she said. On the customs agreement between the two 
countries, Ciller said that things are being studied. She 
expected a positive result in a short time. On the three-way 
meeting, which included Benazir Bhutto, Ciller said that it was 
useful for all sides. Al-Hariri and Bhutto discussed bilateral 
relations, she said. 
  Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri and the accompanying 
delegation then left for Latakia Airport, where they were 
received by Wahib Fadil, Syrian minister of state for presidency 
affairs. Al-Hariri headed to the town of al-Qardahah to offer 
condolences to President Hafiz Al-Asad on the death of his son, 
Staff Major Basil al-Asad, who died a week ago.

  [Text] Istanbul (NATIONAL PRESS AGENCY)--President Suleyman 
Demirel has said that a difference of opinion exists between the 
leading officials and many of the opposition circles in the 
Western world on the Kurdish problem. He asserted: "The 
question of the establishment of a Kurdish state is in the 
offing. We must be prepared." 
  Demirel attended the dinner held by the Supreme Press 
Council 
in the Divan Hotel in Istanbul last night. He discussed the 
question of the establishment of a Kurdish state, which the 
officials of the Western countries frequently mention. Minister 
of Internal Affairs Nahit Mentese, Minister of National 
Education Nevzat Ayaz, Governor of Istanbul Hayri Kozakcioglu, 
and Director of Police in Istanbul Necdet Menzir also attended 
the dinner. Demirel was accompanied by his advisers Emre 
Gonensay, Cuneyt Arcayurek, and Omer Tarkan. He recalled that 
the British, German, and French foreign ministers opposed the 
establishment of a Kurdish state in the statements they made 
both in and outside Turkey but said that Mrs. Mitterrand in 
France and several members of the House of Lords and the House 
of Commons in Britain had mentioned that possibility. Demirel 
asserted: In light of the developments, Turkey must be prepared 
for the establishment of a Kurdish state. It must consider 
every possibility on that matter. 
  Asked whether or not the Kurdish state that the Western 
officials are considering would include a part of Turkey, 
Demirel said: "Considering the statements that have been made 
and the maps that have been drawn, Turkey is included in their 
plans. In other words, they have not excluded Turkey. Large 
maps have been drawn up and published." 
  Replying to a question on the massacre of 20 people, 
including women and children, by the Workers Party of Kurdistan 
[PKK], Demirel said that the action was an act of violence, the 
Turkish security forces will definitely take the necessary 
measures, and the PKK will definitely be rendered ineffective. 
  Demirel disclosed that the PKK does not have toxic gas and 
other chemical arms at the present time. However, he stressed 
that the security forces do not have clear-cut information on 
that matter. Nevertheless, he said that the information 
available at the present time must be regarded as being valid.

  [Text] Ankara--President Demirel invited leading banking 
officials to a dinner at the Presidential Palace last night and 
asked them "not to panic, but help the government." Before 
dinner, Demirel made a statement to the directors and chairmen 
of the executive committees of the public and private banks. He 
recalled the argument that the invitation was linked with the 
monetary crisis last week and said: "An effort has been made to 
create the impression that I invited you because of the monetary 
crisis. But I invited you before the crisis began." 
<H5>  I Am Hinting </H5>
  Demirel created interest by emphasizing the importance of 
macro analyses, as former President Turgut Ozal did in the past. 
Stressing that his views should create no "anxiety," but should 
be taken as a "hint," Demirel asserted: "Everyone must fulfill 
his obligations without anxiety. No one must panic. Monetary 
issues are very sensitive. You may ask me: `How can we not 
panic?' I reiterate that you should not panic. You should not 
be carried away by anxiety. I wish you success, because you 
will be confronted with many problems. I expect you to show 
understanding toward the country's problem and help the 
government solve them." 
<H5>  On the Country's Agenda </H5>
  Stressing that issues relating to the effort to control 
inflation, establish a balance in public financing, reduce the 
need for borrowing, and resolve the issues of parity, interest, 
and prices are on the country's agenda, Demirel asserted: "I 
have not said that they are on the political administration's 
agenda. They are on the country's agenda. They will remain on 
the country's agenda, regardless of the administration that is 
in power. Turkey must not ignore the measures that can prevent 
instability from being created in the country." 
  Demirel stressed that a liberal democracy and a liberal 
economy cannot be separated. He also said that achieving the 
two together will be difficult. He noted: "Turkey has problems 
in both cases. But what is important is how determined we are to 
surmount the problems. Turkey is determined to solve its 
problems. It will solve all its problems." 
<H5>  I Reiterate My Call </H5>
  Journalists were not allowed into the dining hall. Demirel's 
statement during the dinner created interest: "I am an 
impartial president. I do not wish to interfere in the 
executive organ's work. But I will intervene to express my 
opinion on issues that concern the country, issues that must be 
resolved. I don't want to do so now. But that does not mean I 
will not summon you to discuss issues relating to the economy 
and banking procedure in future. I will invite you in smaller 
groups, that is, if necessary."

  [Text] Some 625 kg of powder hashish has been impounded in 
an operation carried out in Hakkari by the Directorate of Police 
in Bitlis. The Governor's Office in Bitlis has disclosed that 
the teams from the Narcotics Department contacted two persons, 
Aziz Kurt and Ramazan Kurt, in Hakkari's Kavaklidere Village. 
The two men were known to be drug traffickers. 
  Acting as buyers of narcotics, the teams later arrested 
Mutealip Celiker in Van's Baskale district. Celiker arrived in 
the area to collect the cash for the narcotic drugs the teams 
would buy. The police took action and impounded 625 kg of 
powder hashish in Hakkari's Isiklar Village. They are now 
making an effort to arrest Aziz Kurt and Ramazan Kurt for drug 
trafficking. The impounded drugs have an estimated market value 
of 10 billion Turkish lira.
