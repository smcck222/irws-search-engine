  [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 10 (TANJUG) -- The new head of the 
U.N. Protection Force in the former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR), 
Yasushi Akashi, said in Sarajevo on Monday following his meeting 
with the president of the Bosnian Serb republic, Radovan 
Karadzic, he was "very satisfied with the constructiveness the 
Serb side manifested during the talks." 
  Akashi said he had been assured by Karadzic that 
humanitarian 
convoys will travel safely and freely through the territory 
controlled by the Serbs. 
  "We highly value the good cooperation with U.N. 
representatives," Karadzic said after the talks and added that 
the Serb side had informed Akashi about its "willingness to 
place Sarajevo under a U.N. protectorate under certain 
conditions," those being that peace be restored immediately. 
  Karadzic underscored the readiness of the Serb side to 
cooperate with U.N. representatives in order for Sarajevo 
airport and its vicinity to be used for humanitarian purposes. 
  The readiness to place Sarajevo under a U.N. protectorate 
was 
recently expressed by representatives of the Bosnian Serb 
republic during talks with the two co-chairmen of the 
international conference on the former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen and 
Thorvald Stoltenberg, in Belgrade. 
  Humanitarian convoys have for some time now been 
unhinderedly 
crossing the territory controlled by Bosnian Serbs and the Serb 
side has handed over Sarajevo airport to UNPROFOR to make 
possible unhindered humanitarian flights for the former Yugoslav 
republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina ravaged by civil war.

<F P=106> [Article by Milos Solaja] </F>
  [Text] Banja Luka, January 10 (TANJUG) -- The conflicts 
between Croats and Moslems in central Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
threats by Croatian Defence Minister Gojko Susak, and later by 
President Franjo Tudjman, that the Croatian Army will intervene 
there, have cast a different light on the civil war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  It has been generally known that regular Croatian troops 
have 
been fighting in former Bosnia-Herzegovina for two years 
already. However, this fact seems to be receiving the due 
attention of the international public only after the former 
allies, Croats and Moslems, fiercely started fighting over 
territories in central Bosnia, from where they previously 
jointly banished all Serbs. 
  The truth about Croatia's engagement could not have remained 
hidden in the western media any longer not only because of the 
fierce clashes in Mostar, Vitez, Gornji Vakuf, and Bugojno, but 
because the currently weak position of Bosnian Croats compelled 
Tudjman to make threats of a direct military intervention. 
  Both the Moslem and Croat sides base the concept of the 
further realization of their interests in former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on control of central Bosnia where the 
military industry is based. 
  This area is home to a factory of explosives in Vitez, a 
factory of weaponry in Nov Travnik, overhaul works and a factory 
of military supplies in Travnik, and a factory of detonator 
fuses and shells in Bugojno. 
  It is evident why Croatia is concerned, when Moslems already 
have control over works for the production of weaponry and 
ammunition in Zenica, shells in Tesanj, caps in Gorazde, and 
12.7-mm ammunition in Konjic. 
  If the Moslem forces manage to banish Croats from central 
Bosnia, they will have control over the entire special military 
industry as the strongast basis for continuing the war. 
  In the geo-political sense, they would have a more compact 
and integral territory, and in the strategically-operative 
sense, they would reduce the frontline, which would enable 
easier control and communications with [word indistinct] force. 
  In order to achieve this, Moslems must first take Vitez. 
This is the key town in central Bosnia, where the British 
batallion of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) is 
deployed. 
  Gornji Vakuf is also very important to Bosnian Croats, 
because its loss would mean that they are completely cut off 
from central Bosnia communications-wise. 
  Bosnian Moslems have a larger force than the Croats and a 
strong motive. Until recently technically inferior, Moslems 
have lately acquired vast quantities of weaponry from abroad and 
now have heavy artillery, tanks and helicopters. 
  It is estimated that Bosnian Croat units (HVO) in central 
Bosnia have around 8,000 troops and that regular Croatian troops 
number around 70,000, with the corresponding hardware. 
  The Croatian force in Bosnia includes units from Osijek, 
Rijeka, almost the entire guards brigade from Split, and [word 
indistinct]. Moslem radio recently said that new units from the 
Croatian towns of Varazdin, Vinkovci, Sinj and Split arrived 
last week via Prozor. 
  If Croats lose central Bosnia, they also stand to lose 
western Herzegovina, since Moslems aspire to "their" Neum, the 
Adriatic port which was within the administrative borders of 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  It will soon be clear if Croatia's open threats will be 
realized, or if they are just preparations to admitting defeat. 
Attempts by the West to reconcile the former allies and again 
blame only Serbs for the war have not yielded any results yet, 
and the importance of central Bosnia and the heaviness of the 
present conflicts there indicate that things will not be any 
easier in the future either.

<F P=106> [Article by David Fink: "Wiretaps Restricted by New </F>
Law--Parliament to Reform Law Enforcement Rules"] 
  [Text] For the first time in Hungary's history, police will 
need a judge's permission before placing a wiretap on a 
suspect's telephone or engaging in undercover sting operations. 
  The new laws are part of sweeping legislation agreed to this 
week that is designed to establish a legal framework for law 
enforcement activities in postcommunist Hungary. Agreed to after 
months of debate, the proposed law attempts to balance a respect 
for civil liberties with a need to create an effective police 
force able to combat a growing crime problem. 
  "It is a philosophical dispute," said Hungarian Democratic 
Forum MP Fabian Jozsa, under secretary in the Interior Ministry. 
Conservatives had sought to give more police more authority, 
while liberals fought for more individual liberties. 
  The compromise is viewed by many analysts as a step forward, 
bringing Hungary in line with Western law enforcement standards. 
  Law enforcement is an issue that many emerging democracies 
are grappling with. Under communism, Hungary and other Soviet 
bloc countries were virtually police states, where laws 
regulating wiretaps or sting operations were secret. In other 
words, police had extraordinary powers and citizens had little 
recourse. 
  After the political changes, police were confused about 
their 
roles and had difficulty in dealing with crime without specific 
guidelines. The proposed legislation will also set parameters 
for a variety of undercover operations, such as setting up dummy 
companies, opening mail and conducting secret searches. 
  Government and opposition MP's clashed over how best to 
control police activities. The government, taking a tougher 
law-and-order approach, originally argued that prosecutors 
should be able to authorize secret actions. But the liberal 
position, court authorization for wiretaps, prevailed. 
  The bill requires a two-thirds majority to pass since it 
deals with basic rights. The bill could be passed as early as 
February. 
  The legislation also attempts to decentralize police 
control, 
but in a very limited way. During the communist era, the police 
force was tightly controlled by the national government and 
local authorities had virtually no police powers. 
  The bill would maintain the national police force, but would 
give local towns and villages the ability to control police 
services and personnel within the local areas. For example, 
local governments could obtain specific services and additional 
personnel by paying the national police for them. 
  Opposition MPs sought to give self-governments the authority 
to select local police commanders, but the government rejected 
that proposal. 
  "This could bring a political influence into the police," 
Jozsa said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross by </F>
Lorinc Szendrei in Budapest; date not given: "The New Prime 
Minister Promises Constitutional Order and Stability -- 
End-of-Year Interview With Peter Boross"] 
  [Excerpts] Lasting dialogue between the government and the 
citizens that elected it is a natural element of democracies. 
In his first speech, recently elected Prime Minister Peter 
Boross promised that the dialogue would be continuous. He also 
used our end-of-year interview for this. We curiously awaited 
his views on the parties' election struggle, the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF] that has come through an internecine 
struggle, the further tasks of economic transformation, and 
relations between Hungarians living beyond the border and the 
mother country. In addition to the answers that were to the 
point, he often reacted to our questions with questions. He was 
indicating that he does not see himself or his government as 
infallible or in possession of eternal truth. This is how many 
problems of politics, the economy, current affairs, and mainly 
the nation, were discussed in the prime minister's office where 
the portrait of Jozsef Antall is displayed. 
  [Szendrei] After you were sworn in as prime minister and sat 
back in your place, [Parliamentary Chairman] Gyorgy Szabad gave 
you the opportunity to speak. I watched you from the 
journalists' seats. You did not react immediately. Can you 
recall what you were thinking about? 
  [Boross] I had to decide a very simple matter: from where I 
should present my brief speech. I decided on the podium. 
  [Szendrei] In your maiden prime ministerial speech, you 
promised order. This put many people at ease, while others 
became alarmed. What kind of order did you mean? 
  [Boross] I usually add that I am talking about the 
constitutional order. Many of my statements prove that I always 
think about the legal order and the constitutional order. In my 
view, all our recognition can be attributed to this. The 
letters and telegrams of condolence received by the government 
also welcomed this in the first place. I believe that the 
majority of Hungarian people also find the situation that we 
managed to create in the interest of constitutional and legal 
order, attractive. At the same time, I know that some people do 
not recognize the significance of this. I hope that we will 
never have to learn to appreciate the security of order at a 
time when it is shaken or lost in the country. It is the 
government's task to ensure that the institutions and 
organizations operate correctly, supplies are continuous, and no 
alarm is created through disorderly behavior. Actually, the 
difficult task of transformation demands internal peace in the 
country. This is the way I am in favor order and not the way 
some people try to add certain overtones to my way of thinking. 
It is my basic principle that everything should be decided at 
the place that has the authority from our constitutional 
institutions and our legal system to do so. Politics should not 
be done in the streets! The world also appreciates this. Let 
us just think, when is the often mentioned foreign capital 
inflow continuous? When does a foreign businessman decide in 
our favor? When he finds peace and security here. Already as 
interior minister, I said that I have to act without hesitation 
if the constitutional and legal order is violated in some way. 
In addition to the peaceful life of Hungarian citizens, world 
political and economic interests also have to be taken into 
consideration. If I sometimes say this in a somber voice or 
with flashing spectacles, then the imaginations of a very small 
group of people immediately start to operate and they ask, for 
example, if the elections will be held in time. They will. 
This is my message again. This is also part of the order. 
  [Szendrei] With a view to the coming new year, I would like 
you to lay out your cards. What can we expect from you, will 
you play in a team or will you rather rely on yourself? 
  [Boross] I will decide whatever I have to decide. At the 
same time, even as a minister, I held consultations. Sometimes 
I did not accept the advice. However, this is not typical. As 
we are aware, according to the Hungarian constitutional rules, 
the prime minister has a particular position. Nevertheless, the 
government is working. Independent people who are capable of 
decision-making are working in this government. It is a bad 
decision-making system if someone wants to have authority in 
issues that are not his business. I have always been very 
careful to avoid this. The person or the area that is 
authorized in the particular case should always make the 
decision. It follows that I do not usually discredit 
ministerial decisions. Undoubtedly some decisions have to be 
made by the prime minister, but I make sure that the government 
operates as a body. Naturally, in addition to this, I fulfill 
the functions that the Constitution assigns to the prime 
minister. 
  [Szendrei] In the past year, the life of the 
coalition-leader MDF has been upset by internal fighting many 
times. We have also seen resignations. Can the party continue 
to weaken or can you be sure that unity will be established? 
  [Boross] I can say with a clear conscience that it is 
unnecessary to expect further conflicts within the MDF. We have 
passed a period in which we have been strengthened and our unity 
has been established. The speed and the system of the 
nomination for the prime ministerial position also showed this. 
With the segregation of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party 
[MIEP], the MDF has been freed from fruitless and often 
emotionally motivated debates. Separation is always painful, 
but it can only be advantageous if it is unavoidable. The lines 
have been cleared with the establishment of the MIEP. Among 
other things, it can be seen that the MDF is not identical to 
the party that was shown -- often provocatively, even before the 
international public -- by the party's minority. Now we have a 
clear situation. There is an MIEP and an MDF. 
  The MDF has freed itself from the situation where various 
statements cast a shadow over it. After the nomination, which 
was done in a very definite and democratic framework, everyone 
acknowledged the votes. The main speaker of the party that had 
separated from us actually announced, in front of Parliament, 
that he, to a considerable extent, agreed with the opinion of 
the opposition Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the 
Federation of Young Democrats [FIDESZ] on the issue of the 
nomination. These kinds of statements were made by Istvan 
Csurka, therefore it is not surprising that I was unable to win 
his vote. This is how the situation is clear. We are no longer 
forced to work together in disharmony, trying to hide the 
differences of views. We have come to the end of a natural 
process. We now have order in the MDF, but the leadership never 
demands automatically unified thinking and actions from the 
membership. 
<H5>  Elections Are Not a Joust </H5>
  [Szendrei] In the "Letkerdesek" [vital issues] program on 
television you mentioned that demagogy might also play a 
significant role in the elections. How big is the danger that 
the MIEP, using demagogy, will gain large popularity and push 
the electors to the right? 
  [Boross] First of all, in addition to the MIEP, the other 
side is also prone to demagogy. Naturally, I hope that sober 
reasoning will characterize the campaign. At the same time, we 
can sadly expect the danger of demagogy, I again emphasize, also 
from the left. Generally it is difficult to draw the line 
between demagogy and irresponsible promises. I hope that these 
elements will not dominate the election preparations. This also 
depends on to what extent the Hungarian public accepts 
high-sounding false slogans. I dare not make predictions. 
However, I can certainly say that demagogy and overtly extreme 
campaigns have never been successful in Hungary. It is 
impossible to win more than 10 percent of the votes this way. 
The vast majority of our citizens are perfectly aware of the 
value of loud voices. 
  [Szendrei] Many things have been coordinated and even a code 
of ethics has been drawn up. In your view, what is needed to 
keep the elections clean, correct, and easy to overview? 
  [Boross] Politicians and the printed press that is 
influenced by political groups will have a vast role in this. 
Generally, the press in Hungary is independent, but we know how 
this is to be interpreted. If honest self-moderation prevails 
then we will not be the ones to spoil a better-than-expected 
atmosphere in the election campaign. The consensus will be 
upset if certain newspapers use a different tone in spite of the 
gestures of the political groups that influence them. I would 
like to trust that their styles can be brought closer together 
and I expect an honest competition, although not a joust. 
Otherwise it will be hell on earth. Everyone has lists and 
files, slander can be published. This would make me very 
disappointed. I would not like to fight in an arena where many 
participants do not adhere to the rules of the game. 
  [Szendrei] You also assign an important role to the press. 
Recently, especially the television and radio have been loud 
with skirmishes. In your progam, you promised a quickly 
completed media law and settlement of the leadership issue. In 
your view, what kind of media should we have? 
  [Boross] The world of communication has great significance. 
Remember that at the end of 1990, the chairman of the television 
banned screening an interview with the prime minister. I guess 
I need not prove how absurd this is. Even this could happen 
here. This is unprecedented. Therefore, we have to start from 
the premise that the radio and television are national media. 
The adjective is not accidental. They have to deal with 
universal issues that affect the country and the nation, and 
they cannot be workshops for polemics that are inclined to be 
partisan. The country's affairs have to be shown. In the years 
following 1990, the Hungarian media did not strive to keep equal 
distances. On the contrary, they were characterized by some 
kind of anti-government bias. This was coupled with the serious 
financial interests of certain people. I do not like these 
conditions because these are dishonest and unnatural. Secret 
interests are hiding behind these conditions. I especially do 
not like it when militant journalists bombard the tired 
citizens, who wish to rest and entertain themselves, with 
disputes about the media's internal conflicts. These battles 
evoke unnatural reactions. Therefore, order has to be 
established, good programs have to be made, and these have to be 
offered to the audience in time. Everyone has to be familiar 
with the basic elements of discipline in the public service 
institutions. 
<H5>  More Poor, More Rich </H5>
  [Szendrei] I believe that many people are much more 
interested in their own fate than in the media struggle. 
According to estimates, some 2 million people are living below 
the subsistence level. The fate of the elections and of 
democracy could be decided because of the increased poverty. 
  [Boross] It is irresponsible to talk about general 
impoverishment. Statistics have to be used carefully. The 
numbers do not distinguish between people living on 10,000 
forints pension in villages where they have a small garden or 
land, and the old people in Jozsefvaros [Budapest district]. 
The calculations prove to be very superficial. From the 
numbers, I can even sense an intention to idealize the 
circumstances of the 1980's. However, if we look at 10-year-old 
newspapers, we can see that even they were writing about 
impoverishment. 
  [Szendrei] Do you doubt that poverty in the country has 
increased in the past three years? 
  [Boross] I and not trying to avoid this question. We have 
to start from the premise that the process of the change of 
ownership caused much upheaval in Hungary. It has to be 
admitted that an official selection has also been started and 
there are indeed more poor people, but there are also more rich 
people. However, this process of polarization started as early 
as in the 1960's. At that time, though, the newspapers, 
directed from the party center, did not write about rich people. 
Therefore, yes, we can see that there is a strata that is 
becoming poor and we have to aid them from the state's welfare 
fund. However, I do not think it likely that we have to provide 
for 2 million people. In my view, we have to pay more 
attention, through various methods, to approximately 1 million 
people. Ill-fated people will always exist. However, we have to 
distinguish between these people, too, because in addition to 
the needy, people who take the benefits to the pubs also emerge. 
They cannot be lifted out of their deviant lifestyles through 
financial support or actions. In my view, in their case, the 
initiative of the local governments is useful when they give 
food and warm clothing to families with many children. 
  [Szendrei] In addition to poor families, the government and 
the country are also poor. This issue can be approached many 
ways; I will summarize it in two words; budget and state 
administration. 
  [Boross] It cannot be denied that the budget deficit is 
depressing. This can be reduced in a number of ways. For 
example, as it has been done in some countries, the living 
standards suddenly decreased while the deficit was being 
reduced. Our society would not have tolerated this. The 
problems of the state administration mainly appear on the 
revenue side. Naturally, I am not saying that the expenditure 
side should not be reviewed. However, let me add that those who 
cry out for the rapid reform of the big distribution systems, do 
not necessarily know what they are talking about. From a state 
budget point of view, the health service can be made cheaper if 
the citizens pay more. 
  [Szendrei] People have already noticed this because, for 
example, the hospitals cannot even always give the basic drugs 
to the patients, and their relatives go to the pharmacies for 
the drugs. 
  [Boross] This might be so or it might not be, but the main 
point is that hospitals operated without financial restrictions 
for decades. An adequate level of medical work can also be done 
with careful financial management. The Hungarian institutions 
have to learn this, and I could, already now, mention many good 
examples. 
  [Szendrei] When the state administration expenses are 
criticized, it is often mentioned that state institutions are 
not frugal, either. 
  [Boross] I would like to hear this general criticism in more 
concrete terms. People who demand cheaper public administration 
might not even understand its professional components. 
<H5>  In a Squeeze, Inside and Outside </H5>
  [Szendrei] I know that this is your pet topic. 
  [Boross] It is indeed, because the establishment of modern 
public administration was one of the crucial elements of our 
development in the 19th century. If someone wants cheaper 
public administration, he might be surprised when looking at its 
budgetary details. Some 65 percent of expenditure is on wages. 
When can this be reduced? If we dismiss at least 20,000 public 
service employees. If someone wants this then he should come up 
with this program! The staffing of our public administration is 
not high in European terms. 
  [Szendrei] In that case, how can the position of the budget 
be improved? 
  [Boross] For example, in the area of tax controls and tax 
discipline. Taxes have to be paid! In addition to establishing 
more balanced budget conditions, this also makes it possible to 
reduce the public duties and the payment obligations of 
entrepreneurs. I claim that the often-mentioned levies, rather 
than the taxes, are the biggest problem for entrepreneurs. The 
36- percent company tax cannot be said to be high, but the level 
of public dues prevent increased employment. The labor force 
has become expensive. Therefore, the level of expenses has to 
be reduced. When talking about increasing the revenue, we must 
not forget about the customs. This is not easy, either. 
Hungarian customs control was based on the transactions of a 
few dozen export- import companies. In the market economy, this 
number increased 1,000-fold. It takes years for the customs 
authorities to establish an adequate infrastructure for the new 
tasks and for well-trained experts to work in this field. 
Well-trained customs officers cannot be created overnight. 
However, an encouraging process has also begun in this area. 
The main point is that if the gross domestic product increases 
-- as we can already see in industry -- then the problems of the 
budget decrease. 
  [Szendrei] Let us remain with the macro-economy. Foreign 
trade was a success story for two years. In 1993, our income 
from exports decreased almost dramatically. How can we regain 
our lost foreign market positions? 
  [Boross] By saying as much, that this is a big problem, I 
acknowledge that we have to take this seriously. However, what 
can be the solution? 
  [Szendrei] This is what I would like to know. 
  [Boross] Well, you see, this is the governmental role. You 
would not ask this question of the opposition. 
  [Szendrei] I will not forget to ask them when they are in 
government.... 
  [Boross] Do not be pessimistic.... Let us face the facts. 
In 1993, western recession reached such levels that brought 
serious political problems to the surface. Unemployment above 
20 percent is not unknown. The situation is similar in other 
countries that are approaching the European Community. 
Industrial output is falling in countries where this was 
considered impossible. Let us just look at the German economy. 
It is a natural consequence that the market tightens. This has 
especially negative effects on countries that are forced to 
export, and Hungary is one of these. The eastern part of Germany 
is in no better position. Billions have been invested in 
developing the eastern German industry, but the public mood 
cannot be called cheery there, either, because of the lack of 
markets. Let us return to Hungary. For three years, our 
balance of payments was positive. You can look at the data from 
the 15 years preceding this. When did we last have three such 
years? 
  [Szendrei] Agricultural Minister Janos Szabo recently gave 
an interview to MAGYAR NEMZET. According to him, the facilities 
of Hungarian agriculture reach the world standard, but the 
results are way below this. When can the changes in agriculture 
bring results and when can we expect the Hungarian agricultural 
products and processed goods to reach their old fame? 
  [Boross] The fact that 1 billion forints were lost because 
of reduced agricultural exports is the first and most depressing 
premise. It is not only a slogan, it is true that the drought 
caused immense problems. This government cannot create rain, 
either. However, it is encouraging that the land is protected 
by a thick layer of snow just now. If 4 million metric tons of 
grain is produced then we can be satisfied. We do not need 
more. The world market is saturated. If Ukraine launches 
itself then we will have another competitor. Hungarian 
agriculture can become more successful if we produce more 
labor-intensive and special varieties. The market requires 
modern types of fruits and vegetables, and I could list many 
products that the disintegrating cooperatives stopped producing. 
New quality is needed! The possibility of this lies within the 
changing ownership conditions. In spite of the difficulties, 
the farmers are still willing to produce, which is proved by the 
fact that the autumn-sown area is equal to the average of the 
past 10 years, and the use of chemical fertilizers has 
increased. It is definitely positive that the purchase of 
agricultural machinery is showing an increasing trend. 
<H5>  Without Stray Intentions </H5>
  [Szendrei] Many educational institutions are struggling with 
their tasks amid uncertainties. What can the government do to 
ensure that the new generations acquire the intellectual 
ammunition to build the future in secure circumstances? 
  [Boross] We have already been making great efforts to 
improve the conditions of basic education. Just to mention one 
fact, we built 2,000 gyms in the past three years. We have also 
restored numerous schools. In the three years, the number of 
students entering higher education increased three-fold. 
Therefore, we have moved off from the low point where Hungarian 
higher education was in the socialist system. We have an 
education law. It is possible that this is being criticized for 
various political reasons, but it exists. We will have a basic 
national curriculum in January. The adjective is also important 
here. Apart from the fact that some people tried to create 
confusion in certain cases, secure conditions prevail in 
Hungarian education. I am not saying that we cannot and need 
not create even better conditions. As for the level of 
education, this depends on the teachers. I still remember the 
teacher of the town middle school whom everyone greeted. 
  [Szendrei] The nation and the adjective national are given a 
prominent role in your thinking. The neighboring countries 
often accuse the Hungarian government of ringing irredentist 
tones when, at international forums, it speaks up for the rights 
of Hungarians living beyond the border. How can the two 
demands, namely good-neighborliness and tolerance guaranteed by 
rights be met? 
  [Boross] This requires elaborate political maneuvering. We 
cannot ignore the consequences of the fact that the Hungarian 
nation lives within the current borders of the country. 
[sentence as published] We have to acknowledge this and it is 
also included in our Constitution that we are responsible for 
the Hungarians living beyond the border. For all Hungarians. 
It is infinitely important to create trust in our neighbors 
that we do not have vagrant intentions. The accusation of 
irredentism emerges against us when the leading political 
circles of the neighboring countries have a guilty conscience, 
because of their policies regarding the Hungarians. Looking at 
the countries in the neighborhood where serious polemics can be 
heard, we can confidently state that it is not Hungary that can 
be qualified as nationalist. 
  [Szendrei] Does this mean that, similarly to Jozsef Antall, 
you also claim to be the spiritual prime minister of 15 million 
Hungarians? 
  [Boross] This is natural. All governments have to be aware 
of the fact that Hungarians are living in a larger area than 
what is included within the state borders. Without being 
suspected of having aggressive intentions, we have to deal with 
the way Hungarians are living in other places. We have to know 
whether they are given the necessary conditions if they want to 
live their lives as Hungarians. This is also part of the 
individual rights, because if someone was born a Hungarian, then 
it should not depend on the state borders whether he can remain 
a Hungarian. This indeed is an organic part of the rights of 
freedom. [passage omitted] 

<H5>    Before Vital Voting] </H5>
  [Szendrei] We are facing a new year. In addition to the 
usual good wishes, what do you wish for the country in 1994? 
  [Boross] Naturally I also hope for a happier new year, which 
we could do with. I wish for the public to make a wise decision 
at the 1994 elections. The effects of this decision will be 
very important. We are facing a historic vote. I believe that 
the way of progress will be shown by the trend of the MDF, which 
I also represent. We promise balance. I trust that the 
citizens can see from the four years of governmental work that 
we can adequately handle the promising slogans. We will also 
have to sum up the past three years in 1994. We will have to 
examine where we have to correct our work. I wish that the 
Hungarian public be satisfied with us.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jozsef Szajer, chairman of the National </F>
Committee of the Federation of Young Democrats, by Ferenc Hajba; 
place and date not given: "The FIDESZ Remained in the Center"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Hajba] According to the 
opinion polls, Hungarian voters find it difficult to understand 
why the Federation of Young Democrats [FIDESZ] has moved away 
from the center and why it is signaling to the government 
parties even at the price of considerably reducing its own 
former popularity. What is making you drift to the right: the 
awakening desire for conservatism or the taste of power? 
  [Szajer] The FIDESZ remains in the center and it is open in 
both directions; it has not denied its liberal values for a 
moment, and it has no desire whatsoever for conservatism. It is 
a fact, however, that the FIDESZ has refused to participate in 
the increasingly radical political polarization. We try to 
remain objective. Given that the Hungarian Socialist Party 
[MSZP] is our main electoral rival, we are formulating our 
criticism of the MSZP more firmly. This also derives from our 
center position. [passage omitted] 
  [Hajba] There is something behind the fact that you are now 
forced to explain yourself to a public that earlier sympathized 
with the FIDESZ. If the FIDESZ remained in its old position but 
the public thinks that it is drifting to the right, does this 
mean that many people's eyes have deteriorated simultaneously? 
  [Szajer] No. The public probably senses a sham-movement. 
Political public opinion has moved, not we. The FIDESZ is 
sticking to the essence of its economic policy and ideology as 
formulated in 1990. However, the public did not acknowledge 
this at the time. They failed to analyze or discuss it, and the 
press also manifested some sort of reserved sympathy toward our 
party. It did not criticize us and did not ask questions. Most 
people saw the FIDESZ as a romantic, pure, and democratic human 
rights movement. However, a movement would not have been able 
to survive; thus, we had to transform into a professional party. 
  This is one aspect involved. The other is that, at this 
year's election, no party is expected to get as many seats as 
the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] got earlier. Thus, we will 
probably have to think in terms of a coalition of various 
parties, and this automatically means compromise. This is 
natural for a party, but it is not necessarily welcome to people 
who still regard the FIDESZ as a group or movement of romantic 
guys opposing something. 
  [Hajba] In my opinion, people have nothing against 
compromise; rather, they think that the future allies are not 
suitable for the FIDESZ. It seems that this country has had 
enough of bad political marriages. 
  [Szajer] Several parties have declared their willingness to 
form a coalition with the FIDESZ, but we have not yet gone 
anywhere to ask for any girl's hand in marriage; we only 
cooperate with the other liberal party, the Alliance of Free 
Democrats [SZDSZ]. Therefore, there is no basis whatsoever for 
any combination before the elections. [passage omitted] 
  [Hajba] From the viewpoint of stability, it is difficult to 
envisage how the two coalition parties sticking to their ideas 
will be able to cooperate with the liberal SZDSZ and the FIDESZ, 
if these political organizations maintain their original image. 
  [Szajer] I would not enjoy such a coalition either. 
However, it is impossible to exclude the possibility 
completely. I think that there is no longer any question that 
the current government coalition has to go. This is precisely 
the goal of the FIDESZ, namely to make sure that no such 
coalition can again be formed after the elections. 
  [Hajba] Viktor Orban announced... 
  [Szajer] That was not an announcement; it was only an 
idea... 
  [Hajba] In other words, Orban's words probably caused 
surprise because of earlier statements. When Peter Boross spoke 
of a possible coalition with the FIDESZ in a foreign newspaper, 
Viktor Orban regarded his words as a political provocation. 
  [Szajer] The FIDESZ did not sign a preliminary agreement 
with any coalition party. Viktor Orban answered a question and 
confirmed the party's position, namely that the FIDESZ is open 
in every direction and can envisage cooperation with all the 
democratic parties. 
  [Hajba] In that case, you do not consider the MSZP to be a 
democratic party because, according to Viktor Orban's statement, 
the FIDESZ would not form a coalition with the MSZP. 
  [Szajer] Among the members of the opposition roundtable, the 
FIDESZ was the first to declare that the MSZP cannot be excluded 
either. It is another matter whether the National Committee 
would accept a coalition in which the MSZP is the leading force. 
  [Hajba] Would the National Committee accept this? 
  [Szajer] Most probably not. 
  [Hajba] What if the MDF were the strongest party in the 
future coalition? 
  [Szajer] I think the National Committee would not accept 
that either; we would prefer to stay in opposition. Naturally, 
it is another situation if we have the chance for a coalition 
under a strong liberal dominance. Therefore, a lot depends on 
who asks whom for a coalition and what bargaining position we 
achieve at the elections. Until then, it is totally useless to 
say categorical and exclusive things.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Arpad Goncz by Kveta Kovacsova in </F>
Budapest; date not given: "Hungarian President Goncz: We Are 
One Family"] 
  [Text] Budapest -- Hungarian President Arpad Goncz 
granted MLADA FRONTA DNES an exclusive interview prior to the 
meeting in Prague between the representatives of the Visegrad 
Four states and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  [Kovacsova] How do you view the status of the small 
democratic countries in Central Europe at a time when a new 
strategic balance is being sought on the U.S.-Russia-NATO level? 
Is there any future for a joint course of action by these small 
countries? 
  [Goncz] Economic and political integration, as well as 
integration in the security policy sphere, is not only in the 
common interest of the Central European countries, but is also 
in the interest of West Europe. This contributes to stability in 
the region. We are aware that all four states are coping with 
more or less the same problems in the economic and, to a certain 
extent, social spheres. Integration could alleviate the 
negative impact of transformation. 
  It is also important for our states to infiltrate West 
European markets, something that is becoming more and more 
difficult due to the current economic recession affecting our 
partners there. If we are successful in this, we can reckon with 
the modernization and development of our own economies. In my 
opinion, this would also improve our market's importing 
capability. 
  The Visegrad Four states together represent a 
100-million-strong, demanding, and unsaturated market. We are 
situated conveniently close to West Europe. We can also 
participate in developing partnership relations between other 
states in Central, East, and West Europe. 
  Cooperation among our four states is always more 
advantageous 
than an individual course of action. We have countless 
opportunities for mutual integration. Despite the different 
geographic location of the individual countries, the region 
forms a coherent unit. A community involving the Visegrad Four 
states is far more attractive for the West than each state is 
individually. 
  When integrating with Europe, it is unnecessary to proceed 
in 
the same way and enter into the organizations there at the same 
time. We tried this before, and I would prefer not to talk about 
the outcome. We face similar tasks in the integration 
processes, but we are at various stages of development, whether 
this involves legislation, economic relations, or national 
security policies. We are also keen on cooperation in human 
rights issues, environmental protection, and guaranteeing social 
stability. The essence lies in not formalizing our relations, 
but in keeping each other informed and -- where possible -- in 
coordinating our points of view together and bilaterally and not 
throwing spanners in each others works. 
  I am always glad if Prague succeeds in doing something first 
and I would be pleased if Prague were to express its pleasure at 
something we succeed in first. 
  [Kovacsova] We would be interested in hearing Hungary's 
point of view regarding the United States and Russia and also 
regarding relations between the Hungarians and the Americans and 
between the Hungarians and the Russians in the political, 
cultural, economic, or other spheres. 
  [Goncz] Apart from the United States and Russia, Germany is 
no less an important partner for Hungary. In my opinion, it 
will be important to forge close economic ties in parallel with 
all three of the aforementioned states. To date, U.S. 
investments in Hungary amount to around $3 billion. Influential 
American-Hungarians, who play a similar role in cultural 
relations with the United States, have been of assistance in the 
influx of U.S. capital. There are numerous experts of Hungarian 
origin at U.S. universities who can partially influence public 
opinion and ferment ideas together. 
  Germany is an important and traditional economic partner and 
it is -- as it is to you -- favorably inclined toward us. This 
stems from German knowledge of the conditions in our region. 
  As far as our relationship with Russia is concerned, since 
the last Soviet soldier withdrew from our country, there have 
been no obstacles preventing the formation of friendly -- I 
emphasize friendly -- relations. Our political contacts are 
perfect. I have met three times with President Yeltsin and our 
meetings have always led to specific and matter-of-fact 
agreements. 
  Although our foreign trade with Russia now only amounts to 
20-25 percent of its former volume, this country is still a 
vitally important trading partner for us. It purchases 
agricultural products, including apples and wine, from northern 
Hungary; Russia is one of the largest importers of wheat, 
medical supplies, and Ikarus buses. Therefore, it is in 
Hungary's interest to ensure not only that the Russian market is 
open but also that it is sufficiently solvent. 
  Undoubtedly, it is in Hungary's crucial interest to ensure 
that the democratization process in Russia is not halted. We 
are keen for the United States to assist and support this 
process. We have the same view regarding Russia's incorporation 
into the system of European cooperation and organizations. 
  [Kovacsova] Regarding European security, what is your 
country's stance toward the Balladur plan, a plan aimed at 
greater stability? 
  [Goncz] The plan appeals to me very much. I think it can be 
further adapted. I consider the goal to improve this region's 
internal stability to be extraordinarily important. The issue 
of ethnic minorities -- one of the priorities of Hungarian 
foreign policy -- is of particular concern to us. 
  Hungary is not striving for unilateral advantages for the 
Hungarian minorities, but for all the minorities living in the 
states in our region, which is like an ethnic mosaic. Ethnic 
minorities are a problem for every state and, therefore, we have 
to seek standard principles and a common denominator that would 
define equal commitments. 
  Ethnic Hungarians have been living since 1920 in more states 
under various circumstances and have different experiences. 
Such minorities always bear a dual responsibility. They should 
assist the overall development of the majority state where they 
will enjoy success only if they are loyal to it. However, they 
also have moral ties to their own community and to their mother 
state with which they have cultural and linguistic links. The 
two states involved can always assist in this. This reasoning 
is purely positive, and is definitely not directed against 
anyone. Implementing it could help a great deal in the interest 
of an internal settlement for this region. That is, at least 
until the common borders are absolutely permeable. 
  [Kovacsova] In your opinion, in what way could mutual 
relations between Hungary and Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech 
Republic, or Hungary and Poland change following the Prague 
meeting with President Clinton? 
  [Goncz] At the moment, we do not know exactly what the talks 
on 12 January will concern, because we do not know the 
conclusions to be reached at the NATO summit from where 
President Clinton will travel to Prague. Afterwards, he will 
hold talks in Russia. 
  Independently of this, it is important for the Visegrad Four 
states to consider the development of their economic relations. 
We have a free trade zone agreement. This is an important plus. 
  The problem is that the Visegrad Four states have virtually 
the same deformed economic structure. I think, however, that it 
is possible to find together the means of expanding mutual 
trade. It is pointless to compete with each other on third 
markets. 
  I attach no less importance to a systematic exchange of 
political information and to coordination. We could quite 
easily slip up without them. We do not have conflicting 
interests, our friendship has not been impaired by anything, and 
our cultural traditions and ways of thinking are similar. We 
also speak the same language politically and the development in 
our societies is identical. 
  It is essential to expand and intensify regional cooperation 
and I emphasize that we will get by without establishing 
administrative structures. If the need arises, the foreign 
ministers, the prime ministers, and even the heads of state can 
contact each other for a personal exchange of views. If a 
certain issue becomes acute or if a difficulty crops up in the 
system of relations, it is sometimes enough merely to life the 
telephone. 
  [Kovacsova] What kind of role could the endeavor to become a 
full-fledged partner for the advanced parts of Europe and the 
United States play for our region? 
  [Goncz] Our integration with Europe will be considered at 
the end of the century. I think it could be sooner. Perhaps 
not for all of us at the same time. It could happen that we 
will dispatch the Czech Republic as our avantgarde. Or, it will 
send us into Europe as a vanguard. Whoever is first will 
reserve a place for the second. It is essential that he does 
not slam the door in the other's face. 
  We perceive the significance of Euro-Atlantic cooperation as 
our incorporation into the European security system on a 
pancontinental scale. At the moment, I cannot say what role the 
reformed NATO and the Western European Union will play and I 
cannot say at what pace we will proceed in modernizing our 
economies. I consider these three elements to be the most 
important, while I reckon that they can be intensified at a 
different pace. 
  I propose that we think about which of them we want to 
cooperate in and how, even without written treaties. 
  After all, we are one family. If we do not realize this, 
then we are real dimwits.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on interview published by the Prague </F>
paper LIDOVE NOVINY on 27 December with Ferenc Kulin, vice 
president of the Hungarian Democratic Forum: "According to 
Kulin, the MSZP May Win Next Year"] 
  [Text] Ference Kulin thinks there is a good chance that it 
will be possible to form a conservative-Christian-liberal 
government coalition after the parliamentary elections in 
Hungary next year, although power relations within the coalition 
will be different from the present. The interview with the vice 
president of the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum] appeared in 
the Monday issue of the Prague paper LIDOVE NOVINY. 
  According to Kulin, while it is possible to imagine that the 
socialists will win a relative majority in the elections, they 
will not be able to find the necessary partners for a governing 
coalition. Such an intention would not find uniform support even 
in the ranks of the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats], asserted 
the vice president of the Hungarian Democratic Forum. He 
excluded any possibility that his party would form a coalition 
with either the socialists or with the extreme right party of 
Istvan Csurka. 
  Concerning the foreign policy priorities of the Boross 
government, Kulin said that Jozsef Antall had already become 
convinced that it is not possible to achieve European 
integration at the cost of relations with neighboring countries. 
"I cannot imagine that Hungary would want to get some kind of 
defense from West Europe against its own neighbors," said Ferenc 
Kulin. In his view, Hungary does not want to develop it 
relations with its neighbors on the basis of some romantic 
outlook from the last century, that is, it does not want to make 
its starting point the wrongs it suffered from [the treaty of] 
Trianon or the desire to acquire territory. Instead, it is 
striving to have the human rights as well as the collective 
rights of the Hungarian minorities guaranteed within the 
framework of the European Union.

<F P=106> [Transcript of an interview with Budapest Metropolitan Mayor </F>
Gabor Demszky by Gyorgy Nej on a 168 ORA radio program; date not 
given: "Bargaining and a Hairsbreadth: Party Television Is Not 
Good Television"] 
  [Text] Individual applicants will soon be able to 
know whether it was worth their while to queue up for frequency 
allocations, and then the state's monopoly of the [electronic] 
media will essentially have ceased in Hungary. Among the 
applicants in the queue we find also the metropolitan 
administration's television station. According to the intentions 
of its founders, it will have also a public-service role, but 
after a time it is to become self-supporting. Gyorgy Nej 
interviewed Metropolitan Mayor Gabor Demszky about the plans for 
the TV station and, naturally, about related media matters as 
well. 
  [Nej] The metropolis [Budapest Metropolitan Council] has 
filed an application for a frequency allocation. But recently 
the newspapers reported that the metropolis has received a 
temporary license for trial operation, valid for three days. Are 
we dealing with two separate matters, or do the two items 
pertain to one and the same thing? 
  [Demszky] The issue is the same in both cases. The 
metropolis 
has formed a broadcasting corporation, with an initial capital 
of 100 million forints. The metropolis is the principal 
shareholder, with 99 percent of the equity, but a foundation is 
also a shareholder. The foundation's board of trustees comprises 
the metropolitan clerk and the directors of the metropolitan 
public utilities. The foundation was established in the late 
1980's and is called Television Broadcasting for Budapest. The 
foundation and the broadcasting corporations have filed separate 
applications for frequency allocations. A combination of 
land-based television broadcasting and cable TV is involved in 
the first instance; and in the second instance, an opportunity 
for direct reception, to which every resident who owns a TV set 
and an ordinary TV antenna will be able to tune in. With the 
judging of the applications and the allocation of frequencies, 
the state's monopoly of the electronic media will essentially 
cease. I think it is also very much in the government's interest 
that henceforth nobody be ever able to say that in Hungary there 
is only government-operated television, financed and controlled 
by the state. 
<H5>  A Media Charter From Europe? </H5>
  [Nej] Yet how is it possible that the five-member licensing 
committee consists exclusively of persons whom the government 
has somehow placed in office? They include the prefect of 
Budapest with the rank of state secretary; a close associate of 
the late Jozsef Antall; a deputy state secretary; a jurist from 
the Ministry of Justice; and someone else appointed to similar 
office. 
  [Demszky] As an applicant, it would not be in my interest to 
analyze the government's considerations that have led to this 
situation. There are jurists on the committee, probably because 
of the argument that this is a legal question that must be 
decided. Of course, this is merely my assumption. Obviously, 
however, you should be putting this question not to me but to 
those who appointed the members of the committee. And you should 
ask also the committee members as to why specifically they have 
been chosen. But I believe that all this goes far beyond the 
committee's competence and jurisdiction, which is actually the 
issue here. 
  Thus when I seek government considerations of greater 
importance and say that this is in the government's interest, I 
do so because, on the one hand, I am familiar with the 
international responses to the clashes in Hungary's media war, 
and to the government's actions in this matter. And on the other 
hand, because I attended the Strasbourg Conference sponsored by 
the Council of Europe and the European Union, where this 
question was on the agenda. The state of the media in the 
countries of East and Central Europe was discussed, on the basis 
of a report that presented a thorough analysis of the situation. 
The matter of the media in East Europe is a political issue of 
sufficient importance to warrant that the Council of Europe 
adopt an international charter to serve as a guide for these 
erring democracies, on how to create independent electronic 
media, how far government influence over them may extend, and to 
what that influence may relate at all. In my opinion, 
incidentally, government influence may relate only to financing. 
  An international charter could spell all this out in the 
form 
of recommendations. This could be of considerable help, and not 
just to Hungary. After all, this problem exists in the 
neighboring countries as well. The charter could contribute also 
toward easing domestic political tensions, and the government 
ought to consider it for that reason as well. 
  [Nej] On the basis of all this, how do you assess the 
metropolitan administration's chances of obtaining a frequency 
allocation? 
  [Demszky] The metropolitan administration's prospects for 
obtaining a frequency allocation in the near future are very 
good. For the metropolis, by applying for a frequency 
allocation, wants to provide useful information for the benefit 
of local residents, as a public service. In addition, it wants 
to concern itself with political matters that affect the lives 
of Budapest residents. And there are also economic reasons why 
we may be hopeful. The venture is well provided with capital. 
<H5>  A Billion Forints To Start With </H5>
  [Nej] Is there more money than just the 100 million forints? 
  [Demszky] Much more. About ten times as much. Which can 
truly 
guarantee that this television station will be able to stand on 
its own feet and finance its own programs even during the 
transitional period until it becomes self-supporting. According 
to the television station's business plans, it will be able to 
support itself on revenue from commercials. 
  [Nej] And will it be public-service television, financed by 
the metropolis and some foundation respectively, or will it be 
commercial television that is partially self-supporting? 
  [Demszky] It will be commercial television that broadcasts 
also public-service programs. In other words, the television 
station's structure will be a mixed one. The metropolis will 
establish the television station and hold a certain amount of 
equity in it, but will not have a majority stake. We do not want 
to continue financing the station with ever newer grants each 
year; instead, we would like to see it become self-supporting. 
At the same time, through our share of equity, we would like to 
attain a degree of participation in the corporation that will 
enable us to prevent its dissolution. In other words, to prevent 
the majority shareholder from pushing through at anytime a 
resolution for the corporation's dissolution. And we also want 
to be able to influence programming policy in a way that will 
preserve by all means the station's public-service nature. 
  [Nej] The Budapest Metropolitan Council's application for a 
frequency allocation has met with opposition from the very 
outset, even within the council itself. The objections against 
it were that the station would be oppositionist, and its 
promoters would include also persons like George Soros, for 
instance, who is not exactly popular among people to the right 
of our government circles. Another objection was that the 
television station would be using public funds, but its 
operation would be managed primarily by members of the 
opposition with liberal leanings. How can all this be organized, 
and where will the money come from? 
  [Demszky] Primarily the First Hungarian Investment Fund will 
provide the money, although also George Soros will actually 
invest a smaller amount. The Budapest television station will 
broadcast public-service programs locally, rather than 
nationally, which automatically excludes the station's ability 
to compete with the national electronic media. And the station 
will not be oppositionist in the sense that the opposition 
parties, and oppositionist tone and ideology will be the 
dominant in it. It would be foolish to strive for that. And not 
just because the ruling party has warned against it, but also 
because we are learning from the bad example. Aside from all 
that, party television, politically influenced, proselytizing or 
strongly ideological television, is simply bad television. 
  [Nej] But it can be assumed that you people would want to 
offset what, many people claim, is happening in the 
public-service electronic media. 
  [Demszky] I wish to repeat, that is not possible. After all, 
our area coverage is much smaller, to begin with. The solution 
is simple: one has to offer good television broadcasting. 
  [Nej] By the way, how did the Metropolitan Council vote on 
the proposal to establish the television station? 
  [Demszky] The SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats], FIDESZ 
[Federation of Young Democrats] and MSZP [Hungarian Socialist 
Party] voted for the proposal. The governing parties were 
against it. I do not remember exactly how many votes there were 
for and against respectively. But the proposal did pass, with a 
qualified majority. Anyone who expects to earn revenue from 
commercials cannot afford to be biased or to have proselytizing 
tendencies. Instead, he must strive primarily to satisfy the 
viewers' demands. 
<H5>  Expo and the Metropolis </H5>
  [Nej] The year of Expo is approaching. This television 
station could easily turn metropolitan residents against Expo, 
but it could also support Expo just as easily. Since the 
metropolitan administration is not exactly Expo-friendly, what 
will its television station do? 
  [Demszky] We have to get ready for 1996, to welcome the four 
million people who foreseeably will visit Expo. We are not 
denying that, and it would be foolish to do so. It is in the 
interest of the metropolitan administration to have the 
necessary infrastructure in place by then. Because, on Expo's 
account, the metropolitan administration will be able to obtain 
developmental resources [from the government]. In other words, 
this way the metropolitan administration will be able to build 
more than if the construction projects were financed solely from 
its own resources. This is something we have always emphasized. 
  The problem was that the metropolitan administration did not 
receive any developmental resources during the past two years, 
because an agreement was lacking between it and the program 
bureau. In other words, there was no decision on who would be 
responsible for which investment projects, whether financing 
would be time-commensurate or based on performance, and so 
forth. Now only a hairsbreadth separates us from an agreement 
that clarifies these questions, and in 1994 the metropolitan 
administration will receive 6 billion forints for development, 
from the funds appropriated for Expo. In addition, the 
metropolis will also receive budgetary grants. We will have no 
objections if the television station presents these investment 
projects and shows that the work is actually progressing. After 
all, that too is news about our city. 
  [Nej] Is it possible that you will be getting a frequency 
allocation merely to make the metropolis interested in staging 
Expo? Is this actually political bargaining? This way the 
metropolitan administration will also get its 6 billion 
forints... 
  [Demszky] Last summer and autumn the government actually 
realized that the metropolis was in a bargaining position. 
Therefore the fiscal administration decided to provide grants 
for us, over and above the appropriations for Expo. Actually the 
metropolis is being compensated for losing its 35-percent share 
of the revenue from individual income tax collected on its 
territory. We are indeed bargaining continually. 
  [Nej] Is the television station included in the deal? 
  [Demszky] In the form of a frequency allocation, the 
television station is not a part of this deal. 
  [Nej] From where will the television station recruit its 
professional staff? If someone at PESTI HIRLAP, for instance, 
wanted to work for the liberal metropolitan administration's 
television station, regardless of who controls it, would he get 
a job? Or would someone from a liberal workshop have a better 
chance of getting the same job? 
  [Demszky] The metropolis has 290 institutions, but I have 
never yet interfered in their personnel policies. Nor in what 
activity an institution ought to pursue. Of course, there is an 
abundant supply of unemployed professionals on the labor market, 
and therefore it will not be difficult to assemble a team. 
Incidentally, the team has partially been assembled already. 
Only one name has been made public so far: Janos Betlen will be 
the station's news editor. Naturally, he has been chosen by the 
station's general manager, and not by me. Thus the metropolitan 
administration must be aware of its exact limits, and neither 
the metropolitan mayor nor the [Metropolitan Council's] media 
committee may interfere in questions of editorial or programming 
policy. Aside from enforcing one aspect: namely, that the 
television station must broadcast also metropolitan 
public-service programs. 
  [Nej] The addressee of the temporary license for trial 
operation during the Christmas holidays is TV-3 Budapest. Will 
that be the name of the metropolitan television station also in 
the future? 
  [Demszky] There is no final decision on this question as 
yet. 
That too will have to be clarified at the next meeting of the 
media committee. The strategic investor will also have to be 
consulted on what name would be acceptable to him. Regrettably, 
the call sign BP-1 is already reserved. That will also have to 
be taken into consideration in our final decision regarding the 
station's call sign.

  [Text] Answering an accusation that in the current budget 
there was no increase -- in comparison with previous years -- in 
the expenditure on education and the health service, the prime 
minister pointed out that this year only 84 percent of the 
budget expenditure was available for distribution. The rest 
would be swallowed by the servicing of debts -- the internal 
debt and the foreign ones. 
  [Begin Pawlak recording] So if we want to compare budgets, 
then we could compare indices in the relative system within the 
proportions of the budget but also within the proportions of 
that part of the budget which is available for sharing out. And 
there is significantly less to be shared out than a year ago -- 
and practically the whole of the budget deficit at the moment 
goes on financing the internal debt. 
  So if we look at it in this way, then the amounts for 
education and the health service are not so bad in comparison 
with last year. [end recording] 
  The fact that on 1 January parishes took over only a part of 
the entire number of primary schools, means that the whole 
operation of schools being taken over by self-governments had 
been badly prepared by the previous government, said Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak and the head of the Council of 
Ministers Office, Michal Strak. 
  [Begin recording] [Pawlak] If one were to -- 
administratively -- bring about a situation in which the 
parishes were to take over the schools then probably today there 
would be not so much a row with the teachers as a row with the 
parishes -- which did not always have the possibility of 
financing these schools, especially in the case of smaller or 
weaker parishes. 
  [Strak] May I just add one more comment regarding the pilot 
program: We decided that mayors would decide whether they were 
taking over schools or not. I have a set of figures here: There 
are 1,015 schools in the towns which were included in the pilot 
program, of which 580 have been taken over by the mayors. So 
this liberty in decisiontaking is successful -- for mayors and 
self-governments carried out investigations and consciously made 
up their minds. [end recording]

  [Text] Warsaw, 7 January: On Friday, the Sejm adopted a new 
geological and mining law, that will replace the law that has 
been in force for 40 years. There were 245 deputies for the 
adoption, 16 against, and four abstaining. During the debate it 
was stressed that the present law ameliorates the eternal 
conflict between the need to extract the resources of the earth 
and the obligation to protect the environment. 
  The law specifies a new method of exploring for and 
obtaining 
natural resources from the earth. The provisions of the previous 
law were determined for the needs of the former economic system 
(the mining law in 1953 and the geological law in 1960). It, 
among other things, regulates the principles for the extraction 
of minerals, the granting of concessions, issues of work safety 
underground, and responsibility for damage from subsidence. 
  The law reserves the ownership of mineral deposits to the 
state treasury. Minerals such as sand or coal that are to be 
found on the territory of someone's property do belong to him, 
except if he wishes to sell them, in which case a concession is 
required. 
  The new law, among other things, changes the method of 
collecting the dues for mining subsidence. Hitherto this took 
place on administrative lines, whereas it now finds itself at 
the disposal of the courts, where the basis for claims is the 
civil code. The law has abolished the provision whereby the 
entity responsible for the damage was obliged to cover the costs 
only up to a level equal to the cost of building a single-family 
house, irrespective of the level of damage caused. Currently, 
compensation is to cover the full value of the damage. Those 
extracting "the riches of the earth" will be forced to take into 
account in extraction costs the payments for environmental 
protection that have so far been omitted. 
  The geological and mining law regulates in detail the 
principles for the granting of concessions to foreign entities 
for the search for and extraction of minerals. Payments for 
concessions are henceforth to be negotiated with every entity 
separately. 
  The draft geological and mining law had been in parliament 
for a year and a half. The Sejm adopted the new law on 29 May 
of last year, but the dissolution of parliament made impossible 
the continuation of the legislative process. The government of 
Waldemar Pawlak directed the draft for renewed consideration by 
the Sejm as a matter of urgency.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Dan Stanca: "We Will Be Sold Out for a Third </F>
Time"] 
  [Text] The meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and 
President Boris Yeltsin will not be a mere routine one, at which 
a few more nuclear missiles will be scrapped or the race for 
more Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) treaties will be 
continued. This meeting will decide the fate of quite a few 
people and of several nations and even whole countries. 
Therefore, next week's meeting in Moscow will be on a par with 
the Yalta and, more recently, the Malta meetings. The Iron 
Curtain came up at Yalta, through Stalinist-type methods that 
did not bother about or waste time with niceties. At Malta, 
Mikhail Gorbachev's reasoning (with its Brezhnev-type 
limitations) -- faced with the economic disaster of the entire 
Eastern bloc but also with President George Bush's adroitness -- 
had to make important concessions to the free world. There, the 
Russians lost their former empire, but secretly hoped that that 
crash will be short-term. At the forthcoming meeting in Moscow, 
we will see if that failure is going to be sealed or whether the 
Russian forces are going to turn against the United States and 
the West asking for their rights. 
  What has happened since Malta? In the past four years, the 
repressive communist-centralist system has collapsed noisily, 
amidst the cheers of the crowds. But quite paradoxically, and 
parallel to this visible downfall, the old structures were 
restored more or less enigmatically from one case to another and 
from one country to the other, in a function of the specific 
conditions of development or backwardness prevailing in the 
respective state -- to use the well-known phrase. The former 
German Democratic Republic was the first to escape and was 
swallowed by the strong machinery of West Germany. Poland, 
Hungary, and Czechoslovakia brusquely remembered that they do 
not belong to Eastern Europe, but rather to Central Europe; 
consequently they felt that they must strictly distance 
themselves from their former Council for Mutual Economic 
Assistance [CEMA] and Warsaw Pact partners. Thus, the 
"Trilateral" came into being, out of conceit and the desire to 
forestall would-be future surprises. These surprises began to 
appear from the moment when a country like Romania, where the 
anticommunist revolution had been the most radical and violent 
and whose interwar record has been obviously hostile to the 
left, went astray as early as 1990 both internally and 
externally. Internally, by convincing the foreign countries -- 
something which not even our most hated enemies would have 
managed to do so well -- that the communists are still in power. 
Externally, by signing the shameful treaty with Moscow, which 
basically sanctioned our previous relationship with our master 
beyond the Dniester. The comeback we have made of late, 
particularly in 1993 (the Council of Europe and so forth), has 
come rather late and has only had a formal significance -- it 
was just dust in the people's eyes, only that our dignitaries 
are wearing protective glasses. The true integration is not 
ensured by our national flag being hoisted in Strasbourg, but 
rather by our admittance to the Euro-Atlantic security bodies, 
which everybody craves for, but few will achieve. That is why 
the U.S. President's visit to Europe, correlated to the NATO 
meeting, acquires an overwhelming importance. Will we be sold 
out for the third time? The theory of the Iron Curtain has been 
ever-more successfully replaced by the theory of the sanitary 
cordon in the propaganda campaigns of the international media. 
Faced with scores of millions of hungry hordes from Russia, the 
West has been obliged to take defensive measures. For this, it 
must knowingly sacrifice a group of countries, which will thus 
become a buffer between it and the convulsions of the Russian 
colossus. These countries will definitely not be the "award" 
countries of the Visegrad treaty, with whose representatives 
Clinton will also meet in Prague. Neither will they be the 
Baltic countries, which, in the opinion of historians, represent 
a jewel of Catholic civilization in the north eastern part of 
the continent. These countries will be the pitiable Ukraine, 
Romania (Moldova), and Bulgaria. Maybe the Red Army's 
triumphant march of 1944-45 up to the gates of Berlin cannot be 
undone in only 50 years, but rather in 100 years! What is our 
only chance? That Bill Clinton's saxophone mind will clear up 
and realize that a strategic zone for NATO is not so much 
Central Europe as the Balkans, where the much desired stability 
cannot be ensured by Greece alone. The much flaunted theory 
that Romania is a bridgehead in this convulsed region must be 
implemented. Otherwise, by selling us out for a third time, the 
West will sell itself out.

  [Text] A press communique faxed to us by the spokesman of 
the Romanian Presidency reveals that, today, President Ion 
Iliescu received letters signed by the presidents of the 
National Peasant Christian Democratic Party [PNTCD] Corneliu 
Coposu, the Civic Alliance Party [PAC] Nicolae Manolescu, and 
the Liberal Party '93 Horia Rusu. In those letters, the 
signatories express the wish that the respective parties should 
participate in the talks initiated by President Ion Iliescu, 
within a joint delegation of the Democratic Convention of 
Romania [CDR]. 
  On the same issue, Romania's president also received a 
letter 
signed by Mr. Emil Constantinescu, president of the Democratic 
Convention of Romania, in which he announces the composition of 
the delegation. In connection with these letters, the communique 
notes the following: 
  Since the invitations for participation in talks were sent 
out, Romania's president showed readiness to meet with the 
political parties represented in the parliament in the way the 
respective parties decide to choose. Initially the president of 
Romania intended to arrange a meeting with all these parties. 
Considering that the political parties that are included in the 
CDR expressed their wish to come individually to the talks, the 
president agreed to organize the talks in this way, proposing 
that the talks should take place before 1 January 1994. 
However, most parties that are CDR members preferred to come to 
talks after New Year's eve. In the past days a false fuss has 
been created about the participation of parties included in the 
CDR to the talks, the invoked pretext was the declaration of the 
president's spokesman made on 7 January 1994. The respective 
statements referred to the bantering declarations made by Mr. 
Constantinescu about the talks initiated by the president -- the 
CDR president anticipating the sure failure of those talks -- 
blended with offending statements about the head of the state. 
Such declarations are even more difficult to understand since 
they come from a person who aspires to play a certain role in 
the country's political life and considering that they show 
disregard for an elementary rule of democracy, namely the 
respect due to the institutions of the state. As a mater of 
fact, those assessments lack any politeness and are rude even to 
the parties that are included in the convention and had already 
accepted talks with Romania's president. 
  The received letters indicate a change of position of the 
parliamentary parties that are included in the convention, as 
far as the formula of participation in talks is concerned. The 
president does accept the new formula but does not accept the 
pretext invoked for this change of position. The exact date of 
the meeting will be convened by the Presidency's adequate 
department, reads, in conclusion, the press communique received 
by the Radio from the Romanian Presidency's spokesman.

  [Text] This afternoon, Romania's President Ion Iliescu met 
with representatives of the Democratic Forum of Germans in 
Romania at Cotroceni Palace, our correspondent Sorin Croitorescu 
informed us. 
  In a statement made at the beginning of the meeting, Mr. 
Paul 
Filipi, the president of the forum, said that the goal of the 
meeting was to mark the date of 8 January 1919, when the 
Transylvanian Saxons, on the basis of people's right to 
self-determination, through their National Council, assembled in 
Medias, proclaimed unity with the Kingdom of Romania. 
Describing the historical importance of this act, Mr. Filipi 
stressed the role of a connecting bridge between Romania and 
Germany played by the German minority, a role also acknowledged 
in the treaty of friendship and cooperation between the two 
countries, concluded in 21 April 1992. 
  The meeting was attended by representatives of the German 
minority from various regions of the country, who presented to 
the Romanian president the problems that they are currently 
facing in the areas of education and religion, as well as the 
state of mind of citizens of German nationality. They requested 
that a law on minorities be drafted and asked President Ion 
Iliescu to issue a declaration in which it is recognized that 
the German minority in Romania suffered discrimination after 
World War II and that the compensatory measures that they are 
demanding are justified. 
  In a statement made to the press at the end of the meeting, 
President Iliescu said that, in our country, there is a 
constitutional framework for the development of a common life 
between the majority population and ethnic minorities, noting 
that, within this context, the claims expressed by the 
participants are resolvable and there is a chance for the 
citizens of German nationality who left Romania to return to the 
homeland.

<F P=106> [Article by Christophe Chatelot: "The Worsening of Social </F>
Malaise in Romania Reawakens the Trade Unions"] 
  [Text] Four years after the downfall of the Communist 
regime: The ravages of the economic crisis--more than one-third 
of the population is below the poverty line--are leading 
Romanian trade unions to mobilize themselves. 
  Bucharest--From our correspondent. Four years after the fall 
of the communist regime, the very clear revival of social 
disputes has thrown tens of thousands of demonstrators into the 
streets in Romania and multiplied work stoppages in the public 
sector during the second half of 1993. And, no doubt, the worst 
is yet to come. 
  "Romanian trade unions are now reaching maturity. They have 
passed the simple boundaries of salary claims, to which they had 
limited themselves until recently, in order to tackle the 
problem of economic transition." The opinion is that of Octavian 
Partenie, an adviser to the prime minister in charge of 
relations with the trade unions, and it appears to be confirmed. 
The country's main federations of trade unions have, in effect, 
just issued a call for a general strike to take place during the 
last two weeks of January to protest the devastating effects of 
the economic crisis and to demand that the government resign. 
  The issues leading to discontent among the workers are 
legion. Even though the restructuring of the sprawling public 
sector has not yet begun, the number of unemployed, according to 
official counts, has already reached 10.4 percent of the 
working-age population, but the true figure is doubtlessly much 
higher. Prices have increased 300 percent this year, flattening 
the savings and wages of a population that had already lost 40 
percent of its purchasing power since 1989. 
  More than one-third of the Romanian people now live below 
the 
poverty line with an average monthly wage of less than 300 
francs, according to government statistics. And clouds are 
gathering on the horizon. The International Monetary Fund will 
certainly extend a new credit of $700 million to Bucharest, but 
that credit is accompanied by stern recommendations to 
accelerate reform and to enhance budgetary rigor. 
<H5>  "Not a Capitalist Model" </H5>
  There are so many elements which probably will for the first 
time burden the population and thus provide new battalions of 
discontented people for the trade unions, which assert that they 
have already attracted more than two-thirds of all wage-earners. 
Nevertheless, their claims are not without a conspicuous paradox. 
  Riding the swelling waves of discontent, they have made 
themselves champions of reform, even though that process could, 
in the end, risk transforming the unions into a party of union 
members. In essence, the restructuring processes have resulted 
inevitably in a multiplication of failures. As for the 500,000 
PME [private entrepreneurial family associations] created since 
1990 and already responsible for 30 percent of the gross 
domestic product, they are practically nonunionized. 
  Bogdan Hossu, the leader of Cartel Alfa, one of the main 
confederations of trade unions, challenges this ambiguity: "We 
defend the construction of a social economy based on the market 
and not a South American-style capitalist model." To adapt to 
the new environment in the country, the trade unions have 
gradually tightened their ties with their base. A score of 
confederations participated in the first collective negotiations 
with the government in 1991. They now number less than ten, and 
it is thought that in a few months there will not be more than 
three or four which are truly representative. 
  In other respects, the unions profit today from the result 
of 
better means of communication. Mr. Hossu charges: "The political 
parties are stalling, and the government has proved its 
incapacity to resolve the crisis." According to him, the trade 
unions are, therefore, "the only hope for the population," and 
the unions do not hesitate to venture into the political 
terrain. A few weeks ago, Miron Mitrea, the executive chairman 
of the CNSLR-Fratia [National Confederation of Free Trade 
Unions--Brotherhood], the other large workers' organization 
along with Cartel Alfa and National Trade Union Bloc, called for 
the formation of a "coalition cabinet," uniting an opposition 
party and several groups of the existing majority. Since then, 
the idea has been taken up again more widely. 
  Courted by the political parties, the Romanian trade unions 
are raising the bids just when, exhausted by a difficult year, 
the government's days appear to be numbered. Unless, that is, 
the trade union quarrels and lack of unity do not allow the 
souffle to collapse. The negotiations with the government, 
lacking a common plan of action, as well as the more underhanded 
question of dividing up the funds of the UGSR [General Union of 
Trade Unions] (about 5 million francs), which was the only trade 
union organization under the communists, have made the unions' 
previous call for a general strike last May fail. 
  Since then, the trade union leaders have dominated the 
dialogue. They manage the UGSR's war chest cooperatively, and it 
was with a single voice that they called for mobilization to 
take place in January, unless the consultations openned on 27 
December by President Ilisecu with the leaders of the main 
political parties, lead to a future reshuffling of the 
government. The trade unions would then see their first demands 
satisfied, but, for all that, the deep causes of social tension 
would not disappear.

  [Text] This morning Mircea Rucareanu, our reporter 
accredited at Victoria palace [government headquarters], 
addressed a number of general interest questions, now, at the 
beginning of the year, to Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu. 
Among other things, Vacaroiu assessed that over the first half 
of the year inflation will grow slightly, by 7 to 9 percent, but 
as a result of the package of measures intended to regain the 
balance of the macroeconomic structure of the country, during 
the second half of the year inflation will decrease to 3 to 5 
percent. The average rate of inflation over 1994 will thus 
reach 75 to 90, perhaps 100 percent. 
  The executive has prepared a number of draft bills that 
should be debated by parliament, from among which Vacaroiu 
mentioned the draft bills on the setting up of a stock exchange 
market, the draft bill on public finance, and the draft bill on 
the introduction of local taxes. 
  Asked about a possible government reshuffle, the prime 
minister answered that the executive is always considering 
reshuffles, depending on the results of the work accomplished by 
ministers and state secretaries. Vacaroiu stressed that in the 
current transition the government needs the best minds, with 
good organizational skills, who could provide a new impetus to 
the reform process.

  [Text] The recently established Agency for Restructuring 
represents an important step in Romania's economic reform. The 
agency is a government body that is in charge of restructuring 
the state-owned companies and certain public corporations. 
  In an interview granted to one of our correspondents, Mr. 
Mircea Cosea, chairman of Romania's Council for Economic 
Coordination, Strategy, and Reform, emphasized that one has to 
do away with the conception that economic restructuring merely 
means the closing down of companies and the growth of 
unemployment, as that process may also have positive effects by 
reviving certain large companies that are very important for the 
economy to adapt to the new market economy structures. 
  By a decision of the Prime Minister [Nicolae Vacaroiu], 
University Professor Dr. Dumitru Dan Popescu was appointed head 
of the new Agency for Restructuring. Until now, Popescu was 
holding the office of counselor of the minister of finance. 
  Cosea also mentioned the fact that work has already begun to 
transform the property vouchers into shares and, thus, establish 
a stock exchange that will act as a source of capital, as well 
as moral support for both the respective companies and the 
shareholders. The first privatization actions to be implemented 
in the first month of the year will refer to branches that have 
not been targeted until now, such as social work, scientific 
research, and local administration, Cosea added.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Petre Mihai Bacanuy: "Dictatorship in </F>
Disguise"] 
  [Text] At the end of the year people customarily draw up 
balance sheets. Unfortunately, there are very few things of 
which Romania can boast. Things such as the most-favored-nation 
status or the country's admittance to the Council of Europe 
remain mere empty phrases for the man in the street as long as 
he does not feel, in some way or other, that he does not have to 
put up with cold and hunger any more. Apart from that, there is 
nothing but a persistent post-socialist sadness, despite the 
oscillations of the political pendulum. 
  No incompetence, no partial reforms, no unraveled economic 
structures have been admitted by anyone, and this has exhausted 
our economy and required enormous sacrifice on behalf of the 
Romanians, who are trying in every way to make sense of the 
years that followed the collapse of the Ceausescu regime. 
  Dear readers, I have to tell you that we [journalists] try 
very hard to present the good things and the positive results as 
well. 
  Unfortunately, disastrous results are far more numerous in 
our country. Their list is topped by inflation, which has 
increased by over 300 percent. 
  The Vacaroiu cabinet has survived solely because it could 
count on the support of the nationalist-communist parties. Just 
one of them, the PUNR [National Romanian Unity Party], was 
rewarded with a number of offices of prefects, state 
secretaries, ministry directors, or FPS [State Property Fund] 
directors. Now that the political auction has begun at 
Cotroceni [interparty talks initiated by President Iliescu to 
strike a political pact], these parties are demanding 
portfolios. As it is known, the PUNR wants those ministries 
that deal with reform. [Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania 
Chairman Victor] Surdu also wants about five portfolios for his 
party. The PUNR kept threatening the government that it would 
withdraw its support, but eventually it did nothing of the kind. 
  It is true, our country is not run by a single party any 
more, but the rulers still do as they wish, because they are 
holding all the control mechanisms of a totalitarian regime in 
their hands. In that sense they are behaving like the members 
of a single party, because that is what the government 
coalition, which has monopolized all sectors, actually is. And 
single parties never acknowledge the mistakes that they make; on 
the contrary, they try to hide the truth and increase the 
confusion. No matter what consequences their mistakes have, 
they never admit them. The sole thing that they failed to 
control is the press. But they found a solution to that problem 
as well: They ignore it and they publish as many government 
dailies as they can, which are then extensively quoted on radio 
and television. 
  The president is still dreaming of a reformed government of 
national unity. But all he is doing is acting as a stand-in for 
the executive. However, the supreme state institution has 
strayed away from reality. Mr. Iliescu's current 
"consultations" are mere propaganda meetings intended to make 
the parties put their swords down and to make the people think 
he is holding the opposition on the leash. Considering the way 
in which the consultations started, I am quite sure that the 
whole thing will eventually turn into a manifestation of 
devotion for the president. 
  By mid-January Mr. Iliescu will certainly summon the trade 
unions as well to come to Cotroceni for "consultations" to 
conclude a "social pact." 
  The idea of such a pact must have come to him at the end of 
this dark year, after he had invented the concept of a 
"political pact." Having clearly announced that talks would 
begin with the parties represented in parliament to examine the 
possibility of setting up a coalition government, Iliescu began 
to sing another tune, the planned negotiations turned into 
"consultations" intended to conclude a "political pact," and 
what is even more, he launched the idea of a "minimal platform 
to be signed by every party, regardless of its orientation." 
The political pact is just an alibi for Mr. Iliescu, so that he 
can rule authoritatively afterward. He wants to line up all the 
parties and then manipulate them as he wishes, without 
renouncing his political monopoly. 
  Cotroceni Palace admits that "the current situation has to 
be 
surmounted," but it does not want a different government any 
more, but rather merely a "political pact." The moment the 
trade unions and the civic forces slacken their pressure, they 
immediately feel free to invent formulas that even children 
would refuse to accept. The message of the unions is clear: no 
more talks with this government. Mr. Iliescu pretends not to 
understand and advances his bombastic "political pact." And 
what kind of political pact? What did Cotroceni Palace 
concretely propose? Everyone knows what the unions and the 
opposition want. In the opinion of the rulers a political pact 
means that the opposition should freeze, hold its hands up, and 
say "yes" to everything that is concocted and issued as 
government decrees by Mr. Vacaroiu's apparatchiks. 
  The amendments formulated in categorical terms by the IMF 
are 
not exactly the best reason for Romania's population to jump for 
joy. They are long-term measures aimed at implementing the 
reforms, the establishment of a market economy and a fully 
democratic society. The parliamentary majority, including the 
PDSR's [Social Democracy Party of Romania] allies, which have 
continuously attacked the IMF, do not want public debates and a 
referendum on that issue, to see who favors and who is against 
that package of laws, that -- although quite unpopular -- would 
still mean the beginning of reform. That is why they came up 
with the idea of having it passed in a concealed way, in the 
form of government decrees [issued during the parliamentary 
recess], that is, actually bypassing parliament. 
  Or, the intention of IMF was exactly the opposite: Have the 
memorandum passed though the Caudine Forks of parliament. The 
reason invoked by the government coalition: The parliamentary 
recess is too long to do that. And everyone knows that 
parliament has not yet sanctioned the decrees issued by the 
previous government and, besides, by the time the ordinances 
reach parliament, not much can be altered anyway. Another 
reason for their preference for the bill empowering the 
government to adopt the reform measures requested by the IMF is 
to protect the PDSR against the attacks of the nationalist 
extremists in parliament, as the latter would have been put in a 
delicate position: Should they vote in favor of the very things 
that they have been cursing all along? So they prefer to have 
the measures that mean the beginning of reform adopted without 
anyone noticing and have the decrees cover up for the disaster 
caused by the mismanagement of the country. 
  The opposition, which is fighting for reform, cannot reject 
the bills requested by the IMF either, but it combines them with 
other reform measures that cannot be adopted unless debated in 
parliament. The opposition wants details about the compensation 
to be offered to companies operating in the red. Otherwise, 
what is the use of having a parliament? And why should reform 
be promoted covertly? 
  This time the parliamentary majority made use of its 
strength 
and voted, while alone in the hall, to empower the government to 
rule by decree. Despite the fact that the necessary quorum was 
lacking, that the altering of fiscal bills can only be decided 
by parliament, and that [Chamber of Deputies Speaker and ruling 
party executive chairman] Adrian Nastase is talking all the time 
about the observance of the Constitution, he is the first one to 
take the liberty of ignoring it by submitting a bill to the vote 
when the quorum is lacking. By validating the results of the 
ballot held under these circumstances, he actually introduced a 
dictatorship in disguise. He created a dangerous precedent by 
using pressure and violating both the Constitution and the rules 
on the functioning of parliament. [Chamber of Deputies Deputy 
Speaker Dan] Martian and Nastase proved that they are prepared 
to do anything and they would call for a ballot even if just the 
two of them were present to vote. 
  The extremists are making open threats. [Greater Romania 
Party Chairman Corneliu] Vadim [Tudor] is warning Iliescu that 
he will "pay with his head" if the government coalition is 
joined by CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania], because that 
would mean that the extreme nationalist forces would be left 
outside the coalition. It serves Iliescu right, let them accuse 
him of treason! Let him have Vadim in opposition! He would 
make such a fierce opposition -- C.V. Tudor cautions -- that the 
president's political career would last no longer than just a 
few weeks. 
  Despite this, relations are cordial between the PRM [Greater 
Romania Party] and the PDSR. Mr. Nastase and Vadim seem to 
understand each other without having to utter so much as a word, 
despite the fact that the PRM has recently begun to attack 
[Romania's National Defense Minister Lieutenant General Niculae] 
Spiroiu as well. 
  The ruling coalition is visibly irritated. The PUNR has been 
negotiating with the ruling party [PDSR], Cotroceni Palace has 
seemed to favor a PUNR-PDSR coalition as a solution, and a great 
deal of promises have been made to the PUNR. The latter claims 
that it even has an agreement in writing signed by the PDSR. 
The PUNR wanted a cohabitation, just the two of them, and it 
desperately wanted to join the government. Now that it has 
struck an alliance with the PDAR [Democratic Agrarian Party of 
Romania], they both want portfolios, especially that of national 
defense. Funar wants to replace General Spiroiu, a minister who 
has survived three governments, and wants to appoint [4th, 
Transylvanian Army Commander General Paul] Cheler to that 
office. Cheler is the one who was threatening to open fire on 
us, and now that we see that the oppression has continued in 
Romania, we are ready to believe that he would really have done 
so. 
  The trade unions accept the "social pact," a phrase also 
taken over by the Presidency and used instead of the old term, 
"consensus." The unions have also declared that no further 
dialogue with the government would make any sense. It is true, 
resignation has especially overtaken the poor. But let us not 
forget that about 11 million people in Romania are poor. The 
government has repeatedly postponed the deadline for the 
implementation of what it promised during the negotiations with 
the unions, which do not reject the reform, and rather favor it. 
By telling people, via all channels, that privatization causes 
unemployment, the PDSR is continuously trying to distort the 
claims advanced by the unions. The message of the unions was 
clear: They intended to mobilize the parliamentary majority to 
vote in favor of the censure motion, that is, to depose the 
government. What more does the parliamentary majority expect 
besides the trade unions' consent to close down companies that 
are counter-productive, operating in the red, and to reconvert 
industry and the labor force? Meanwhile the trade unions have 
become quite radical as they realized that the state authority 
is lying to them and immediately forgets the plans put down on 
paper without ever implementing them. 
  What else is there in the top list of 1993? 
  The corruption among officials should also be included. The 
corruption disease is one of the most powerful forces acting for 
social-political disintegration. The general confidence placed 
in state institutions is vanishing just as the dossiers of the 
corruption cases that have reached their climax will. We will 
become accustomed to corruption. The deadline for parliament to 
report on corruption cases was set for the end of 1993, but the 
law- makers forgot about it. They did so for the very simple 
reason that the hotbed of corruption is Cotroceni. Corruption 
seems to be the moral and juridical basis of the democracy 
promised by Mr. Iliescu. Messrs. Florica and Hortopan [former 
high-ranking Interior Ministry officials who made disclosures 
about a number of corruption cases] have convincingly revealed 
in the press how the mechanism of lies and corruption functions. 
However, everything remained the way it used to be, because 
that is what the state authority wanted. It admitted that there 
is corruption, but denied that there are corrupt people. Which 
means that we did not go far enough with our revolution. The 
corrupt state has not yet collapsed because it is still under 
the control of those who emerged on top of the ruins of 
communism and who are the enemies of radical reforms. And there 
are no signs that the executive, the top of the state, will soon 
be purged to eliminate political banditry. Everywhere in the 
world the heads of mafia bosses and corrupt ministers are 
rolling, except in our country, where they appear smilingly on 
television as the champions of reform. 
  While compiling the 1993 top list we should not forget 
Caritas [the large-scale money-multiplying pyramid scheme]. 
That was possible only because the Romanians, fed up with 
promises and poor, are all trying to work out a magic formula 
that would bring them luck and make them rich quickly. One of 
the publishing houses even came out with a book titled "Caritas 
or the Romanians' Salvation by Themselves." Anyway, Caritas has 
managed to make a laughing stock of us Romanians all over the 
world. 
  Tiraspol should also be included in the list with its 
illegal 
death sentence passed against Ilascu. Ilascu's fate has made us 
forget about the chance, which we missed, that emerged 
immediately after the Moscow coup attempt on 23 August 1991, 
when Bessarabia, after it declared its independence, could have 
united with the mother country. 
  And last but not least, the top list should also include his 
majesty the king, who is trusted by an increasing number of 
people as a force that could really bring about reconciliation. 
The king announced his intention to join the Romanian nation on 
the day of the 75th anniversary of the Great Union, saying he 
did not know whether he would live long enough to see another 
round anniversary celebration of the Great Union. The fact that 
he was denied an entry visa proves that the old system is still 
alive. 
  Such was, in broad terms, the year 1993. Somber. How 1994 
will look depends on us, but also on parliament, which in its 
extraordinary session scheduled to begin on 3 January will not 
allow the installment of dictatorship, albeit in disguise.

<H3>  Entrepreneurs More Optimistic About Business 
Prospects </H3>
  The poll on business expectations carried out by the Office 
for Economic Forecasting and Policy of the Slovenian Chamber of 
Economy (SKEP) on the eve of 1994 reflects greater optimism than 
in 1993. Entrepreneurs are more optimistic in their forecasts 
for 1994 for both production and sales, while their export 
expectations are even greater. 
  Following the remarkable pessimistic forecast in June and 
slightly more favourable one in September, the December forecast 
for 1994 showed that the number of entrepreneurs expecting an 
increase in production has risen by 30 per cent, while those who 
are optimistic about sales outnumber those who are pessimistic 
by 32 percent. The greatest modification in expectations is 
expected in the area of production and sales opportunities -- in 
the third quarter of 1993 the number of those who expected a 
decrease in production was seven percent higher than the number 
of those who forecast growth, and the number of optimistic 
forecasts for sales was 15 percent lower. 
<H3>  Over One Third of Respondents Believe 1994 Will Be Better 
Year </H3>
  Results of the Stik survey, a public opinion poll carried 
out 
by DELO, show that almost one third of those polled expected 
1944 to be worse than 1993, 36.7 percent believe 1994 will be 
better, and 37.3 percent would be satisfied if 1994 turns out to 
be the same as 1993. A greater number of respondents expect 
that the economic situation in Slovenia in 1994 will deteriorate 
rather than improve. As few as 26.8 percent of those polled 
expect the situation to remain the same in 1994. The poll was 
carried out from 21 to 22 December and included 1,177 people. 
<H5>  Better Expectations for 1994 </H5>
  As many as 39.9 percent of Slovenians believe life will be 
better in 1994, 24.4 percent maintain it will be the same as 
this year, and 28.2 percent expect it to be worse, the SPEM 
marketing research company reported in a poll which included 387 
respondents. The most vital part of the population, in 
particular men between 30 and 54 years of age, believe that 
Slovenians will lead a better life in 1994 than in the current 
year. 
<H5>  Optimism Gaining Ground </H5>
  Almost one half of the direcors of medium-sized and large 
companies included in a poll carried out by the Gral agency and 
published in the GOSPODARSKI VESTNIK weekly said that sales on 
the domestic market would remain unchanged. A strong third of 
the directors expect the sales to increase, while only as few as 
one tenth of those polled expect that their companies will sell 
less on the domestic market in 1994 than in the currrent year. 
  According to the same poll, a brighter atmosphere is 
prevailing among Slovenian exporters. Almost six tenths of 
those included in the poll are hoping their exports will 
increase in 1994, while only one tenth of them expect that their 
sales on foreign markets will fall. The expectations of the 
directors included in the poll about their business standing are 
very high, since only two out of one hundred directors 
interviewed expect that the current situation will deteriorate 
in 1994.

  [Excerpt] Belgrade--From our correspondent. 
  The only thing of concern to citizens is whether the [exit 
tax] will lead to new shortages. Now that the election is over, 
stores are empty again. But what cannot be found in stores can 
be bought at open-air markets. The goods come from Turkey, 
Greece, and other neighboring countries. Not even soap can be 
obtained in Yugoslavia without smugglers. 
  This is underlined by the case of gasoline. If it were not 
for smugglers, lines several kilometers long would form at gas 
stations, and rationing coupons would have to be introduced. A 
gasoline smuggler commented on the government decision to impose 
an exit tax on local Radio 202: "I smuggle gasoline from 
Hungary. I have a friend in Subotica, and after each border 
crossing I leave gasoline at his place. After a few days I 
transport it by truck to Belgrade to sell it at a price of two 
or three German marks [DM]. Now I will lose DM60 if I make six 
border crossings. For each transport I have to pay DM30, 
totaling DM180. That makes a daily cost of DM240. I will 
continue to smuggle since I am unemployed, but from now on, a 
liter of gasoline will cost from DM5 to DM6 in Belgrade." 
  The same will be true for other smuggled goods. However, 
there will be only a few buyers able to pay the new, higher 
prices. Therefore, there will be fewer who support their 
families by smuggling. It seems that the Yugoslav Government has 
introduced the most efficient blockade of Yugoslavia. Once 
again, it will replenish its coffers and empty the pockets of 
its citizens at the same time.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mirko Sagolj: "Europe Must Make a Choice"] </F>
  [Text] Another Geneva meeting is behind us and the destiny 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina is more uncertain than ever. Ministers of 
the European Community may think they did something, as the 
three negotiating sides signed a 20-day cease-fire and as the 
same people are supposed to meet again in the middle of January, 
hoping to sign a final agreement -- but that is just another 
deception and self-illusion. 
  If Europe is still not aware of its responsibility for the 
events in Bosnia-Herzegovina and for consequences of its utterly 
incomprehensible and irrational policies, perhaps it will 
realize it now. 
  The Serbs are still defying it and demonstrating the 
impotence of its policies, degrading them to the level of the 
influence of the United Nations. It is not even capable of 
making them agree to or force them to allow the opening of Tuzla 
airport for humanitarian purposes, let alone remove their 
artillery around Sarajevo or stop them advancing the borders of 
"greater Serbia." 
  German Minister Klaus Kinkel seems to have finally realized 
where things are headed or has been the first to say what the 
world already knows: That Europe will pay a high price for 
their ill-conceived policies toward the events in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Kinkel was not led to that evaluation only 
by the failures of the Geneva and Brussels negotiations, but 
probably by a much wider European context of political events. 
It is now certain that, for the first time since World War II, 
tanks are determining state borders in Europe, and that European 
politicians accept that. Now it is difficult to imagine what 
such a precedent could mean for the future and destiny of all 
Europe. We can perhaps imagine it, but how to face such a 
concept when it could prove to be disastrous for the entire 
continent? 
  If that is not a convincing enough argument for Europe -- 
which persists in removing the hands of the United States from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina -- to come to its senses and collectively 
start defending freedom and democracy, perhaps the results of 
the recent parliamentary elections in Russia, where the "Russian 
Seselj" Vladimir Zhirinovskiy won the largest share of the vote, 
will help Europe in that. These are first significant political 
moves of the Russian right, whose full blast is yet to come. 
These elections showed that even Yeltsin does not have a 
ready-made answer for that challenge or better than dim 
prospects, and that political processes have not even begun in 
Russia, and this encourages the events on the territory of 
former Yugoslavia, as well as the fact that the world has not 
been willing or able to stop Serbian expansionism. If it could 
not stop the Serbs, how can it stop the expansionism of Russia? 
  Zhirinovsky is not a political clown as some naively think. 
Many monsters of the world seemed like clowns at the beginning 
of their political career, but that did not prevent them from 
misleading the masses and dragging them into major political 
adventures. And the postcommunist vacuum is ideal for such 
leaders. 
  The new Russian political fact called Zhirinovskiy -- if 
that 
means anything to Europe at all -- has already come up with a 
political slogan that can set the Russian as well as other 
orthodox masses into motion to the point where they will form an 
unpredictable political deluge. And while, on the one hand, 
Kinkel spoke about the high price that Europe will have to pay 
for its misguided politics, on the other Zhirinovskiy has 
revealed his ultimate political goal: Creating an alliance of 
countries stretching, as he said, from the Bering Straits to 
Warsaw and Belgrade. Yes, yes, to Warsaw and Belgrade. Does 
that mean anything to Europe? And Zhirinovskiy's dream borders 
of a greater Russia are too narrow for him, and he wants to 
expand them, having said "Where there is as many as one member 
of the Orthodox Church, that is Russia." 
  There is not much time left before the Geneva talks resume. 
If the European Community really intends to halt one aggression 
before having to deal with another, incomparably more dangerous 
one, it will have to present far more radical demands to the 
Serbian side at the next Geneva conference, and it must be 
prepared to implement them to the full, or, as Kinkel says, one 
day it will have to pay a high price for its policies. There is 
not much choice.

Military Industry; Belgrade's Bold Plans"] 
  [Text] Belgrade, 28 Dec -- It is well known that after the 
disintegration of Yugoslavia most weapons and military equipment 
remained in Serbian hands. Furthermore, Belgrade is constantly 
at work on refining its plans for the further militarization of 
the country. 
  The embargo against Serbia on the import of weapons and on 
the acquisition of new weapons and military technology most 
certainly will contribute nothing toward lessening of tensions 
in the Balkans. 
  The interest of the Serbian political leadership in the 
defense industry increased after the partial withdrawal of the 
army from Bosnia in June 1992. The bulk of the former 
Yugoslavia's arms industry was concentrated in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Belgrade succeeded in relocating parts of 
this industry across the Drina River, including some plants from 
central Bosnia and important divisions of the "Sokol" aircraft 
manufacturing firm from Mostar. However, it failed to gain 
control over key defense industry capacities in Bosnia, 
including plants such as the infantry ammunition factory in 
Konjic, the explosives factory in Vitez, the military equipment 
factory in Bugojno, and some other defense plants in Tuzla, 
Zenica, and Gorazde. 
  As a result, Serbia faces mounting problems with the 
production of infantry ammunition. It turned out that 
manufacturing ammunition at the Titovo Uzice plant is too 
costly. They solved this problem by resorting to foreign trade 
operations run through the affiliated company "Jugoimport" from 
Belgrade. This trade is flourishing despite the embargo. Working 
through Jugoimport, Serbia is exporting M-84A tanks, missiles, 
guns, 6O to 12O-mm mortar shells, flamethrowers, air defense and 
anti-armor guns, various types of all-terrain vehicles, 
communication systems, electronic systems for G-4M Super Galeb 
aircraft, and so forth. In exchange, Serbia receives from Greece 
ammunition made by manufacturers in Western Europe, according to 
the Montenegrin weekly MONITOR. 
  Meanwhile, Belgrade continues to work on improving its 
1,000-km range missiles. The Yugoslav Army's highest ranking 
officers concluded several agreements regarding "defense" 
strategy at a secret meeting in Belgrade on 9 June, however, 
they focused most of their attention on the improvement of 
long-range missiles. 
  Zivota Panic, the Serbian chief of General Staff, visited 
Iraq in March and is said to have visited Russia before that. 
During these trips, a group of his associates probably drafted 
and finalized plans for the transfer of technology and know-how 
to improve the range of the Serbian missile systems, which are 
quite similar to the Russian and Iraqi missile systems. 
  Vojislav Seselj, a chetnik leader, who was apparently very 
familiar with these dealings, made public statements in Europe 
and, in particular, threatened Croatia and Slovenia with 
long-range missiles. He might have received the data on the new 
missile systems, which they are still working on feverishly to 
improve, from the then chief of the Counterintelligence Service 
who was later replaced because of his contacts with the 
Chetniks. 
  Military analysts in Belgrade think that the Serbian army 
does not yet have such long-range missiles, which does not mean 
that it will not have them shortly. There could be problems 
manufacturing special types of propellant. These problems, 
however, are not at all unsurmontable. 
  It is certainly not possible to interpret the improvement of 
missile capabilities as an effort to establish peaceful 
relations. There is also ever increasing talk that the institute 
in Vinca is working on the "cold fusion" process, which would be 
used to fit the 1,000-km range missiles with nuclear warheads. 
All these activities are causing quite a stir among observers in 
Belgrade. Various rumors are spreading -- whether substantiated 
or not -- asbout imports of "cold fusion" technology. We have 
learned that Genadij Sikin, Russian ambassador to Belgrade, 
visited FRY President Zoran Lilic on 9 December. Brief press 
agency releases reported that they talked about illicit nuclear 
materials trade in East Europe. 
  Then in the middle of December, the Belgrade Sava center 
hosted a symposium titled "Aviation 93." The ongoing development 
of a Yugoslav supersonic aircraft (NA) was the topic of one 
unofficial session. This project began in the early 1980's. 
  In June of last year, the Serbian political leadership, 
working through the then Air Force commander Bozidar Stevanovic, 
began the process of acquiring legal title to the 
Aviation-Engineering Institute in Zarkovo near Belgrade. This 
institute has various capacities, including wind tunnels to 
carry out various experiments, e.g., to reach a velocity of Mach 
five. It is also capable of manufacturing supersonic jets. 
  It is not yet known whether Milosevic has secured an export 
market for these planes. This would be the only way to make this 
project economically feasible.

<F P=106> [Article by D. Nedeljkovic: "Hundred of Problems in Oil </F>
Industry"] 
  [Excerpt] -- Data on oil and gas production and oil 
refining speak louder than words. In 1991, NIS [the Oil Industry 
of Serbia] processed 7 million metric tons of oil derivatives; 
in 1992, 2.6 million tons; in 1993, 1.17 tons. There is no magic 
wand; the constant shrinking of state priorities is of no help. 
Such drastic reductions of available quantities made it 
impossible to meet the market's normal requirements. According 
to NIS Director Djakovic, it was a real achievement to muddle 
through the sowing, harvesting, and heating seasons. At the same 
time, domestic oil and gas production has been growing until 
this year, while imports of oil and gas began decreasing last 
year to eventually grind to a complete halt this year. According 
to Production Manager Stankovic, NIS is spending its own 
reserves and cannot sustain even zero economic growth anymore. 
In oil and gas production, zero growth means that the exhausted 
reserves -- equivalent to about 2 million tons of oil a year -- 
must be replaced by new deposits. Besides, oil wells' yields 
decrease with age, and, of 800 oil and 100 gas wells, half are 
more than 20 years old. 
  The problem lies not only in the absence of imports of oil, 
gas, derivatives, spare parts, equipment, raw materials, and 
intermediates but also in the government pricing policy. Oil and 
derivatives are sold at the 8 to 13 percent of the world price. 
Stankovic says that it would be better to give them away as a 
gift than to "charge" them to consumers using some complicated 
procedure. 
  And what about the oil refinery in Pancevo? This enterprise, 
valued at one billion dollars, which had the lowest number of 
employees per ton of processed material in the former Yugoslavia 
and whose productivity was on a par with that of the rest of 
Europe a few years ago, is forced to work below the minimum 
efficient production level. Instead of processing 12 to 13 tons 
daily, the refinery workers must be satisfied when they have raw 
materials to process two million tons [sentence as published]. 
The work force endeavors to use ingenuity to make up for 
scarcity of everything -- from chemicals to spare parts. It is 
better not to think about how long we can continue this way and 
what the results will be. After all, the elections are coming.

<F P=106> [Article by Z. Mihajlovic: "Bread and Milk at the Flea </F>
Market"] 
  [Text] For months now, the people in the rural areas have 
been just looking at shop windows, because, with the exception 
of naked window mannequins, there is no merchandise to speak of. 
Shopping is done on the market, the flea market, or on the 
nearby street corner where the supply is superior to that of all 
the supermarkets put together. The capital resisted the gray 
economy monopoly somewhat longer. Now and then, some money would 
trickle from the Topcider mint, colorful displays would appear 
on shelves, and checks would be hurriedly shaken "from the 
sleeve." However, after the August economic measures and the 
freezing of prices, legal trade cannot come out of a latent coma. 
  Shopkeepers are trying to figure out how to beat the 
manufacturers, who, in the past few months, have been delivering 
merchandise -- which is a source of life -- only for foreign 
currency. They also have to turn the tables on the consumers 
who survived the second part of last year with the help of 
checks. 
  Up until the New Year, this illusion of "plenty" somehow 
kept 
the tide at bay, but after the inflatory explosion and the 
holidays, massive inventories began. The few shops whose doors 
are still open will not accept checks, while cash has been 
considered gold for some time now. People were gripped by panic 
because of the prices expressed in billions, but even more 
because of the shattered illusion that one can live on loans 
indefinitely. 
  On the other hand, private shopkeepers who have been backing 
the good choice of goods with green banknotes for months look at 
you as if you were from Mars when asked whether they accept 
checks. Some of them have even decided to stop the farce with 
the dinars and have started putting the prices in German marks. 
To quote one of "them": "Not only do I pay for the merchandise 
in foreign currency, I also bribe business partners extensively. 
This is the only way to ensure that there is bread at noon and 
milk and dairy products throughout the day. I have to beg 
farmers for eggs, cheese, and vegetables. They do business only 
in German marks, they do not know what to do with piles of 
pfennings." 
  Is this the end of legal trade? Still-valid regulations 
state that merchandise can only be paid for with the national 
currency, which was banned from all business transactions a long 
time ago. 
  If this status quo continues, it is absurd even to talk 
about 
the chances of legal trade surviving. In a situation where the 
manufacturer conditions every delivery with payment in hard 
currency, we will not be able to survive after the end of 
January, says Ratko Lukovic, manager in the "Beograd" department 
stores. The only way to survive is to sell the merchandise 
under the same conditions, that is, for German marks. However, 
the Federal Government has introduced this possibility only for 
a narrow assortment of goods, of which the import components 
make up over 50 percent [sentence as published]. At the same 
time, it has returned everything to the beginning by giving the 
consumers the chance of paying in dinars or checks. The state, 
which secured the little money that has been coming into the 
budget from sales taxes, is also in for a bad time. Customs 
fees constitute a symbolic amount because of the symbolic 
export-import trade. The only thing that can save legal trade 
is settling this monetary and financial chaos. The inflation 
has to be trimmed down to reasonable figures. The out-of-control 
printing of money has resulted in there being far more money 
than merchandise.

<F P=106> [Article by Panta Dzambazovski: "Who Will Pass the Second </F>
Barrier?"] 
  [Text] Macedonia has lived in a politically pluralistic 
atmosphere for almost four years, since the moment the political 
parties were formed. This small area of around 26,000 square 
kilometers, with its population of just over 2 million, has 
demonstrated an enormous interest in political and party 
politics. Almost unbelievable: According to official data from 
the registration services of political parties and movements in 
the Republic of Macedonia, 58 political parties and seven 
associations of a political nature had been registered by 
October 1993. 
  Yet interest in party membership or affiliations is 
decreasing after years of meetings, rallies, and gatherings, 
following the initial national and political euphoria. 
Television coverage of parliamentary sessions are further proof 
of this -- initially, the programs were more popular than soccer 
or light entertainment programs, and the debates, the repeats, 
and the "jokes" were retold at home, in the street, and in 
cafes. However, today it may be concluded that these programs 
are no longer popular and that basic political interest is a 
thing of the past. 
<H5>  The Dangerous Years -- Perfect Tranquility </H5>
  Nonetheless, in this relatively short democratic period of 
four years, parties with influence and a proper image, with 
their large memberships and affiliations among the citizens, 
have proliferated. Mainly, these consist of parties that caught 
the "first train" to registration -- the SDSM [Social Democratic 
Alliance of Macedonia], the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian 
Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Movement for Macedonian 
National Unity], the PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity], and 
the LP (formerly Reformist Forces -- now the Liberal Party], and 
they won most seats in the first pluralist Macedonian 
Parliament. The MAAK [Movement for All-Macedonian Action] and 
the League for Democracy, which were the first to hold 
constituent assemblies (4 February and 11 February 1990), 
although achieving a proper image (national and all- 
encompassing) and affiliations, suffered a disaster at the 
elections and since then their fall has continued in that 
eternal and merciless void called politics. The Social 
Democratic Party of Macedonia (the first party in Macedonia to 
register), the Democratic Union-Peasants Party of Macedonia, the 
Macedonian National Party, the Party of Yugoslavs in Macedonia, 
the Labor Party, and some others created and registered in 1990, 
although on the "first train," remained at the political 
margins, while, despite their modest election results, the 
Socialist Party and the National Democratic Party have kept a 
constant level of support among their constituencies, 
membership, and affiliates, and they retain a degree of 
political influence. As for the other parties subsequently 
created, only the Democratic Party of Serbs in Macedonia, the 
Democratic Party of Macedonia, and the Democratic Party, created 
last year, have remained in the ratings. 
  Macedonia has passed through the years of living 
dangerously, 
of war and peace, social disturbances, disorder, and chaos in 
the world of transition, in accordance with its own historical, 
political, geographic and strategic conditions, in relatively 
perfect tranquility. The same refers to parliament, maintaining 
its own standards, without early elections, something that is 
probably far from praiseworthy but that certainly reflects the 
situation in a state that was seen as one of the youngest states 
in the world, but capable of dealing with internal and foreign 
problems and frustrations. 
  Macedonian politics has displayed in the international arena 
a temperate and constructive policy whose only problem is the 
dispute with Greece, in which the angels are, in any case, on 
our side. This conclusion can be seen by the Christmas 
recognition of Macedonia on the eve of the Greek presidency of 
the European Community. 
  As for domestic policy, Macedonia has a number of its own 
problems and unsolved frustrations that need to be settled in 
the course of time. It has to do, first of all, with the social 
sector. Our international state interests are not visibly 
imperiled by the domestic political scene, because these have to 
be viewed within the framework of foreign policy. It is not 
possible to expect radical shifts, regardless of who might come 
to power after the second parliamentary and presidential 
elections to be held this year, because part of the Macedonian 
strategy has been built on the basis of Macedonian Balkan 
equidistance, the maintenance and reinforcement of Macedonia's 
independence and neutrality. It can now be seen that the idea 
of Macedonia as a country of peace and stability internally and 
regionally has become dominant and that it will be difficult to 
foster radical or nationalist ideas. 
<H5>  Basic Political Issues </H5>
  Going back to the political party scene in Macedonia, and 
bearing in mind the foreign policy of our state and its 
international recognition, one must inevitably take into account 
certain political processes that might affect the state's future 
political profile. Namely, as the time of national euphoria 
passes, which has set the Balkans on fire and is still burning 
in its central parts, the reverse process has begun in our 
state. It is a process toward abandoning national and 
nationalist engagement and turning toward everyday life. It is 
the everyday life of dealing with basic questions requiring 
precise answers and precise political engagement. 
  The year 1993 is very illustrative in explaining this 
process. Namely, a number of events took place to indicate this 
process. A number of parties were burdened with internal poison 
and divisions. These parties had nationalist programs or 
engaged in effectively nationalist political activities. The 
past year saw, as was mostly exposed by the media, a division 
within the largest party of the Albanians in Macedonia, the PDP. 
In effect, the PDP used only half of its strength last year on 
purely party politics and within the government coalition. 
  In practice, all its activities were limited by the 
political realities in a country in which nationalism did not 
win through, and in which such a nationalist party, through its 
exponents (ministers and delegates), could see how far the 
highest ladders could go -- to the negotiations with mediator 
Arens, where the real and demanded possibilities remained 
somewhere in the middle. [sentence as published] The radical 
wing of the Tetovo branch, headed by Menduh Taci, appeared as a 
reaction to these activities, threatening to withdraw from the 
institutions of the political system if the nationalist demands 
of the Albanians were not met, but declining to offer a concrete 
political platform. The two opposing factions politically 
divided the Albanian population, something that could also 
divide the party and jeopardize the campaign of the Albanian 
parties in the forthcoming elections. 
  The Democratic Party of Turks of Macedonia [DPTM], another 
nationalist party, is experiencing serious disunity. Unlike the 
situation within the PDP, the current president of the DPTM, 
Erdogan Sarach, has been accused of radicalism by the party's 
Skopje branch. Calls for the Turks to leave Macedonia, the 
events in Zupa, and reports that genocide against the Turks is 
in progress in the eastern parts of the country are the main 
arguments for the branch's opposition to the party leadership. 
The party's general assembly is expected to bring the matter to 
a conclusion -- determining whether the populist or the civic 
concept will prevail in this party, whose membership is drawn 
exclusively from the Turkish minority in Macedonia. 
<H5>  Disunity Before the Elections </H5>
  The question of whether the political disposition of the 
Serbs in Macedonia is seriously influenced by the political 
forces of its northern neighbor will be answered in the course 
of this year. The beginning of 1992 saw the Democratic Party of 
Serbs registered. Many divisions, and political and national 
pluralism interlocked within the party. The party's president, 
Boro Ristic, successfully led the party until the signing of the 
agreement with the Macedonian Government, through the mediation 
of Arens, when there emerged a definite division within the 
party between those in favor of Serbian national unity and those 
in favor of "settling down" and accepting a minority status in 
line with European standards. It is yet to be seen whether the 
radical current headed by the new president of the DPS, Dragisa 
Miletic, will unite the Serbs in one party and with one idea, 
although all the internal circumstances suggest that there will 
certainly be political disunity within this population, too. 
  The Muslim party, the SDA [Party for Democratic Action] has 
experienced similar disunity. The faction of the first 
president of this party, Sadrija Hasanovic, has continued to 
follow the majority of its genuine principles, while another SDA 
faction has emerged, led by Rizvan Halilovic, as well as the 
SDA-Islamic Road, located in Tetovo. 
  The VMRO-DPMNE must also be mentioned as a nationalist 
party, 
as its activities were determined by external political 
processes -- the breakup of Yugoslavia, the emergence of 
Macedonia as a state, and its road to international recognition. 
This party is very interesting for political analysts. Despite 
all the forecasts, it achieved success in the second round of 
the elections. Nonetheless, it lost its chance (to use its 
number of deputies) to form a parliamentary majority and then a 
government. It seemed to be unable to deal with the reality of 
the political circumstances and the election results because of 
its nationalist concepts, and its escape from the political 
realities became an integral part of its political platform. 
However, this was the point where the differing internal party 
interests collided, resulting in a bolstering of party factions, 
whose independent activities reached a point where new parties 
were formed as some factions deserted the party. First, the 
vice president of VMRO-DPMNE, Vladimir Golubovski, formed the 
VMRO-Democratic Party in 1991, and later the VMRO-Goce Delcev 
(1992) and VMRO-United (1993) appeared, while the latest party 
to be formed from a VMRO-DPMNE faction has been the 
VMRO-Patriotic Party, located in Bitola and led by former Vice 
President Dimitar Crnomarov, to which the deputy Mitko 
Atanasovski is inclined. A number of VMRO-DPMNE members joined 
the Ilinden-Free Democrats, which then became the Democratic 
Party within the Pan-Macedonian Association of political 
prisoners and those persecuted for the ideas of VMRO-Goce's. In 
addition, some eminent VMRO-DPMNE members and district officials 
went over to the Democratic Party led by former SDSM leader 
Petar Gosev. 
  Party disunity may not be the preserve of the national 
parties alone, but what is obvious is that party turmoil is 
characteristic of them alone. The former leader of the SDSM, 
Petar Gosev, failed to attract a single deputy or member of the 
party leadership. Nor has the Liberal Party achieved any greater 
success, either. 
  However, this year's elections will show the views of the 
citizens of our state, as well as the state of the parties in 
Macedonia. And the citizens' vote will certainly provide the 
most accurate answers to all the questions put forward in this 
article.

  [Text] [Vukovic] There is almost general consensus that 
despite the optimism that seemed never to have been greater the 
talks in Geneva and Brussels last week yielded "meager results." 
Does this assessment also apply to Montenegro's vital need for 
the lifting or at least the suspension of the sanctions? 
  [Lekic] Bearing in mind the diminishing number of 
controversial, although complex issues, it is true that 
optimistic expectations prevailed, and even possibilities for 
the signing of an agreement. In the introductory speech at the 
plenary session, Lord Owen said that very little stood in the 
way of the agreement. The three sides that actually represent 
the three nationalist structures of the authority are more or 
less continuing with their maximalist demands for the time 
being, lacking the readiness to strike a decisive compromise. 
For this reason the pressure of the international community is 
at the moment on all three sides. The Muslim side is now 
assuming greater responsibly for the rejection of the 
Serbian-Croatian agreement, which, formally speaking, reflects 
the opinion of the majority in Bosnia-Herzegovina at the moment. 
True enough, this is a majority born out of a suspicious 
alliance like the earlier Croatian-Muslim alliance that sufficed 
for the international community to recognize Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
by which the fire in this republic was definitely lit. 
  However, an agreement of the three sides, a principle that 
should have been respected from the very beginning, can be 
reached in the coming rounds of the talks. As is known, the 
signing of the peace agreement on Bosnia-Herzegovina parallel to 
the favorable development of other elements of the peace process 
will open a perspective for the progressive suspension, that is 
to say, lifting of the sanctions, which gives rise to certain, 
naturally, moderate optimism. 
  [Vukovic] My impression is that certain "sub-questions" are 
unexpectedly (in light of the assurances by the state 
leadership) getting complicated or perhaps this is merely 
becoming evident now. I am primarily thinking of Prevlaka. 
  [Lekic] A part of the so-called European Union position 
paper refers to the demands that the Muslim and also the Serbian 
side gain access to the sea. The actual circumstances of these 
efforts are hypothetical for the time being. 
  Throughout the entire course of diplomatic activities, 
including this latest one, the position and insistence of our 
republic was that Prevlaka belongs to Montenegro. The present 
compromise solution for Prevlaka, as perhaps the only 
observation of the conclusions of the London conference, has 
brought no serious incidents, which was noted with satisfaction 
at the last plenary conference. However, a fair and definitive 
decision will be reached when Prevlaka formally falls to 
Montenegro. 
  [Vukovic] What about the demand that the blockade of Bar 
harbor be lifted to receive humanitarian aid? By the way, to 
what degree did the "assistance" of Radovan Karadzic [president 
of the Serbian Republic] and [FRY Foreign Minister] Vladislav 
Jovanovic help this initiative? 
  [Lekic] The committee for sanctions at the demand of 
incumbent Montenegrin authorities and the FAO [UN Food and 
Agriculture Organization] on 11 June 1993 passed a general 
decision to open Bar harbor for the humanitarian aid to the 
former Yugoslav republics. The renewed operation of this harbor 
has been postponed. It is only left to us to analyze why this 
decision is not being put into effect and, naturally, to fight 
for its alteration. 
  [Vukovic] Immediately upon their return from Brussels, 
[Montenegrin] President Bulatovic said that "in normal times 
there would be much less need for Montenegro as well as Serbia 
to have independent diplomacy," and that "it is much better that 
we strive toward observation of the federal Constitution and 
leave this activity to the federal organs." Many understood 
this statement as characteristic of the president's laying of 
the ground for the abolition of your ministry? 
  [Lekic] I have no knowledge of preparing the ground for the 
abolition of the ministry nor that this issue is topical. I 
know that so far the Montenegrin president of the republic and 
the prime minister have favored the normal functioning of the 
ministry, among other reasons, to adhere to the Constitution. 
  [Vukovic] Until recently your departure to the post of 
ambassador in Rome has been "topical" in the corridors and 
lately there has also been some talk that you might take the 
post of federal foreign minister. I presume that you have heard 
about both options and my question is: Is there any substance 
in either of them? 
  [Lekic] Between Rome and Belgrade I would give priority to 
Podgorica, naturally for as long as I enjoy the trust of the 
public and the authorities in power. Within my decisionmaking 
domain I shall give priority to what I judge to be in the 
interest of our republic. 
  [Vukovic] To sum up -- even when Montenegro's 
international status normalizes, is there a reason for 
Montenegro to remain without its own diplomacy? 
  [Lekic] In any form of normalization you speak of there will 
be no serious arguments for Montenegro's remaining without its 
own diplomacy. On the contrary, valid historic and state 
interests exist for the continuation of this important attribute 
of Montenegrin statehood. 
  [Vukovic] The Peoples' Party and the Serbian Radical Party 
do not conceal their dissatisfaction with your work and believe 
that you are pursuing a "separatist" diplomacy for Montenegro. 
Please comment. 
  [Lekic] I strive for the reputation, the interests, and the 
international recognizability of Montenegro by acknowledging 
reality, naturally, all this not at others' expense. Those who 
do not conceal their dissatisfaction with such efforts at the 
same time do not conceal their attitude or intentions toward 
Montenegro. 
  Regarding the Peoples' Party, I would not judge it on the 
basis of the statements and moves by some of its 
representatives. In other words, I would like to believe that 
there are many among its members and sympathizers who respect 
Montenegro and its state and henceforth support the state 
activities that are in its interest. 
  [Vukovic] In the Montenegrin opposition block there is also 
certain mistrust in you. 
  [Lekic] Bearing in mind the outlined principles we are 
striving for, I have some difficulty in identifying my 
antagonism to all the forces that truly and rationally work for 
the interests of Montenegro. If you are referring to the 
mistrust of those who in the foreign affairs sphere constantly 
champion foreign military intervention against the Serbs in 
Bosnia and the extension and tightening of sanctions, thus, for 
something that does not significantly differ from, for example, 
the official views of Turkey, then I would not comment, for, I 
hope, wholly rational reasons. In any case, all political 
forces perfectly legitimately strive to gain power and personal 
aspirations should be treated as normal. 
  [Vukovic] It seems to me that the so-called Serbian block of 
parties in Montenegro is irritated by the manner in which you 
conduct the Montenegrin foreign policy, as well as your clear 
identification as a Montenegrin in a national sense. Has 
somebody from the ruling party (among those who claim that 
"Montenegrinhood [crnogorstvo] without Serbianhood [srpstvo]" is 
not possible) reproached you for anything in this sense? 
  [Lekic] I am not aware of anyone reproaching me for anything 
like this. 
  [Vukovic] What is, therefore, your attitude toward 
Montenegrinhood with or without Serbianhood, especially in 
concrete contemporary political events? 
  [Lekic] I was always repulsed by the mythologizing of the 
intolerant idea of ethnocentrism. I must admit that we perceive 
terms like Serbianhood and Montenegrinhood, which otherwise 
frequently cause people intellectual and other excitement, as 
expressions of romantic rhetoric and old-fashioned pathos. I 
have never heard, for example, the terms Englishhood or 
Frenchhood although these are big and old nations. 
  Aspirations of individual political factions that are based 
on the past and the attempts to accomplish the mythical and 
mystical variant instead of the sober and contemporary option, 
give rise to big errors. Political demagogues are transforming 
the mythical variant into altogether lowly political goals. 
Instead of controversies and mystification of Serbianhood and 
Montenegrinhood, the question of the Montenegrin-Serbian state 
interests is the one that rationally poses itself. I favor the 
search for rational state relations, economic, and cultural 
cooperation, by which historic alliances as well as state and 
legal peculiarities (of Montenegro and Serbia, two old counties) 
would be reinstated at the same time. 
  [Vukovic] The elections in Serbia are over. The electoral 
campaign has shown that literally all the parties there consider 
the present Yugoslavia to be a transitional solution on the way 
to the final goal -- the alliance of the Serbian lands. Do you 
keep to the position you stated in POBJEDA this April that such 
an initiative is unacceptable for Montenegro because Montenegro 
has an established state and national awareness, and the recent 
one in THE INDEPENDENT that Montenegro has its own tradition of 
statehood and does not wish to embark upon an adventure by which 
it would risk the loss of its own identity? Can you imagine 
Montenegro in such a state formation and yourself as the foreign 
minister in the republican government, if Montenegro were to 
have one at all then? 
  [Lekic] I can immediately answer that I do not see myself 
as foreign minister in such a formation. I would also like to 
state my opinion that all peoples have a legitimate right to 
self-determination, the Serbs included. I am not familiar with 
the concept of such an alliance but I presume that it is 
necessary to respect the will of all who are envisaged for such 
an alliance. 
  I did not change my opinion regarding Montenegro as a civic 
state and the alliance of the Serbian lands, which I have 
clearly explained in POBJEDA and recently in London's THE 
INDEPENDENT. In any case the Montenegrin state is not for sale. 
I believe that its centennial continuity will continue in the 
forms on which the majority of its citizens will decide and 
which the minority will democratically respect. Faced with the 
new historic challenges and experiences, Montenegro, an old 
state, that is to say, the Montenegrin people with recognizable 
state and national identity, will know how to chose their 
historic ways. In these bleak historic times we are all again 
sitting the test of historical maturity and ethics. If we are 
worthy of Montenegro and its pure and exalted idea, we will not 
make a wrong choice. 
  [Vukovic] What kind of Montenegro would you by no means wish 
to see in the future? 
  [Lekic] I would not like our political, cultural, and 
religious differences transformed into clashes that would later, 
depending on the winner, lead into Manichaean division into 
heroes and traitors. In this century alone our ancient 
divisions have left sorrow and scars on the Montenegrin people, 
who live with history, bearing it as a tragic burden. 
  For this reason it is our duty to reach a political and 
cultural consensus regardless of all the differences so that by 
collective responsibility we meet the present challenges.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Dr. Irfan Ljubijankic by </F>
Sejad Luckin; place and date not given: "Bosnia Has Friends"] 
  [Text] Dr. Irfan Ljubijankic has been head of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina for some three months. In diplomatic terms, 
this is certainly a short period for making any radical changes, 
and he has had additional difficulties: the communications 
isolation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the war conditions that 
result in additional factors in the way our country appears 
abroad. On the other hand, the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina are 
still hoping that the international community could, by putting 
more pressure on the aggressor, speed up the solution to the 
crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is only an additional burden 
for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Minister Ljubijankic 
personally. 
  [Luckin] Minister Ljubijankic, you have recently presented 
an 
initiative to the NATO secretary general for Bosnia-Herzegovina 
to be accepted into the military alliance Partnership for Peace. 
What was the reason for this, and does it announce a new course 
in the foreign policy of Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
<H5>  We Are a European Country </H5>
  [Ljubijankic] No. This is only the natural course of our 
becoming a European country. On 23 December last year we 
submitted a kind of application, a letter that I addressed to 
Manfred Woerner, in which I presented our intentions and our 
willingness to meet all the requirements to become a member of 
Partnership for Peace. As you know, Partnership for Peace is an 
initiative -- the response of the United States to the request 
of Eastern European countries for admission to NATO. The United 
States could not accept the full membership of the Eastern 
European countries in NATO, probably in diplomatic and political 
consideration of Russia, but it set the framework within which 
cooperation with NATO is possible. Such is Partnership for 
Peace. Within this group the countries would have to coordinate 
their military programs, their military industries programs, 
their strategic goals, and their military maneuvers, in other 
words, all the elements of military strategy and their military 
and political organization. 
  [Luckin] Where do you see the positions of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in this alliance? 
  [Ljubijankic] We consider ourselves part of Europe. We are 
a country that has had the same experience with totalitarian 
communism as the countries of Eastern Europe. We can thus enter 
this NATO project on an equal basis, on the grounds of our 
cultural, geographical, and political characteristics, and our 
efforts to create a democratic country. Therefore, Europe is 
our framework, as is democracy; cooperation with the Western 
military Alliance is our choice. 
  [Luckin] On the other hand, however, our republic is often 
reproached in international circles for providing a place for 
Islam to break through into Europe. What is your interpretation 
of this and of the criticism that we are too oriented toward the 
Arabic countries in our foreign policy? 
  [Ljubijankic] I would not say that we are criticized for 
this in Europe; these are our own dilemmas. We are a European 
country and we can be nothing else. Our peculiarity is that we 
are a European country with a centuries-old Islamic tradition. 
This is perhaps a new quality, and an interesting symbiosis 
that the world perhaps fears a little. We must explain to the 
world what this is and dispel the fear and prejudice. I see no 
reason for religion, as a private matter for the individual, to 
be a cause of fear in a secular state. 
<H5>  The Process of Forming the State </H5>
  [Luckin] The war conditions and the communications blockade 
are, no doubt, additional problems for the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs. How do you see the present activities, as well as the 
process of constituting this ministry? 
  [Ljubijankic] You see, we are in the process of forming a 
state. The people who came to power at the democratic 
elections, who readily took over the responsibility too, are 
mostly people with not too much experience in the state and 
legal organization of the Muslim Bosniak people and Bosnia as a 
state. When I say Muslim Bosniak people I do not exclude them 
from Bosnia; they are an integral part of the multicultural 
Bosnia, just as the other components are. 
  The activities of our ministry at a time of war are subject 
to our efforts to organize a better state. Naturally, this is 
much more difficult in war conditions, but we have succeeded to 
a great extent. The ministry plays a role in establishing the 
country abroad, in which we have also succeeded to a great 
extent, although we are faced with a blockade that has its 
sociological and political causes, which I would not like to go 
into now. However, it is a fact that we have friends in the 
world, and it is a fact that many organizations, individuals, 
and eminent intellectuals support the existence of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. That official policies do not always follow 
public opinion results from the fact that official policies 
always follow highly pragmatic interests, the geostrategic 
interests of a country or the group of countries to which it 
belongs. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, naturally, has another 
task, 
which is to develop a diplomatic-consular network that did not 
previously exist. This is a major and serious project, and we 
sometimes lack experience in carrying it out, but we certainly 
have a resolute intention to complete it and incorporate it into 
the state system. 
  [Luckin] There has been much talk about the selection of 
ambassadors. Could you clarify the criteria for their 
selection, and what do you say to the stories about this being a 
way to put certain prominent people in safe places, far from the 
war in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 

<H5>    Strategic Goal -- An Integral Bosnia-Herzegovina </H5>
  [Ljubijankic] I would not say this is correct. The criteria 
are similar to those in other countries: an established 
political profile, an established political attitude and 
structure that corresponds to the positions of our country, as 
well as all the general criteria, such as language, education, 
and even physical appearance. 
  [Luckin] What direction will the future efforts of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's diplomacy take in presenting and supporting 
the interests of our country abroad, and have there been any 
changes in the international view of the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Ljubijankic] We all have a unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
our hearts. If you listened to President Izetbegovic's speech 
at the constitutent session of the SDA [Party of Democratic 
Action] City Council of Sarajevo, you will have heard his vision 
of the tactics for achieving that goal. I have nothing to add 
or take away from that statement. Therefore, an integral 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is our strategic goal, but the circumstances 
on the ground will not permit a rapid realization of it. 
Naturally, this kind of Bosnia- Herzegovina is our right, and, 
in my opinion, we should neither cede it nor give it to someone 
else. 
  An integral Bosnia-Herzegovina in these areas is an 
achievement of centuries of history, so to speak. We were 
destined to be the ones to create Bosnia-Herzegovina as an 
integral state, and we should not drop it in such a short time. 
I think that there have been certain changes in the attitude of 
the international community toward an integral 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, but they are still ineffective. There have 
been changes, but they have not yielded any results yet. These 
changes should have more impact; they should be more effective 
and more efficient, and really change the position of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in the negotiating process. Europe still 
believes that the solution that it has offered would be a modus 
vivendi, that it would be a way to bring peace to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We would, naturally, not like it to be 
peace at any price. 
  [Luckin] There are opinions that a more aggressive foreign 
policy toward the countries of Western Europe, especially 
Britain and France, could significantly change the position of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Ljubijankic] People sometimes think that diplomacy is 
something that just requires additional engagement, an 
additional effort, to make things change for the better. 
Diplomacy is a series of small steps, and there are no 
spectacular results, not even in the case of great countries, 
let alone with a small country that has suffered a lot and that 
has been developing its diplomacy through a war. Therefore, we 
could not expect any great gain or great change if we were to 
redirect our diplomatic activities toward England and France. 
Indeed, we have done so. 
<H5>  There Is Always Someone Obstructing </H5>
  I have spent seven days in London, and there have been some 
positive results since this visit. There have also been several 
letters. We have made certain commitments -- naturally, within 
the diplomatic framework. England has indirectly made a 
commitment to work on a better understanding of our position of 
a country at war. We have suspended all our activities 
concerning pressing charges against England at the International 
Court. As far as France is concerned, there have been some 
positive changes, but, you see, there is always another France 
or another England. When these countries are prepared to make a 
concession, a change in the position in the collective bodies of 
the international community that are relevant in making 
decisions, there is always someone to obstruct that. I therefore 
think that it is not only a matter of France and England, but a 
larger number of countries that simply will not allow 
Bosnia-Herzegovina enough room to maneuver for it to survive. 
Luckily, we do have friends. The United States is one of them. 
However, the United States is strongly tied to France and 
England in implementing its strategic interests and the 
strategic interests of all NATO.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on Izetbegovic's speech at the founding </F>
session of the SDA City Council in Sarajevo on 12 January: "To 
Love What the People Love"] 
  [Text] The founding session of the Party of 
Democratic Action [SDA] City Council was held in Sarajevo. 
President of the Presidency Alija Izetbegovic attended the 
session; we present certain parts of his speech. 
  "The party has done much since it was founded and we have 
nothing to be ashamed of. We have heard of certain failures, 
which we have to eliminate. They concern mainly our 
carelessness, and it often happens that people who do not belong 
in the party enter it. It is nice to open up, and we should do 
it. Why? What has happened in Bosnia-Herzegovina is what 
happens to a people once in a thousand years. It will take a 
historical distance to assess the terror and the scope of the 
tragedy that has befallen us. This is a terrible thing, and not 
a single stone has been left upon another. If Bosnia has 
changed, if everything has changed, why should we think that the 
people have not changed? Some thought they could make a living 
by making speeches, by elbowing their way to positions, by 
referring to what they had done before. The party should open 
up to everyone who wants to join us in the struggle for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and this people." 
<H5>  Cleaning Up in the Party </H5>
  ``After 20 months of such trials, you must have a criterion 
for seeing who is still with this people and who is not! 
Mistakes can no longer be forgiven. Earlier, we could select 
people, make mistakes, and justify them by saying we do not know 
how someone is behaving and so on, but no such excuses are valid 
today. Please, have those who have not passed the test removed 
from the party. You will be doing the party a great favor by 
doing so. I would thus use another term apart from the opening 
up of the party, and that is the cleaning up of the party -- 
removing those who do not belong in it. 
  ``Every party has the problem of having honest but 
incompetent people on the one hand, and very competent but very 
dishonest people on the other, and there are often qualms as to 
what to do. In this dilemma I would advise you to opt for the 
honest. It is very rare to have a very competent and at the 
same time honest man. Usually the combination is at the expense 
of either one or the other, but, I emphasize, if we have to 
choose, let us opt for the honest people, and we will surely not 
be wrong. Be especially careful with those who are now 
distributing office premises and apartments, those who have sent 
their children to diplomatic positions, and those who have a 
tendency to get involved in underhand dealings with foreign 
currency. 
  ``We are a large party, but we do not know the technology of 
power. You have heard of the saying that if something is not 
mentioned in the papers, then it did not happen and vice versa. 
It thus happened that, since we did not pay enough attention to 
these media, they organized the resistance, and we did not. Let 
me remind you that reality is one thing, and that the papers 
create another reality. The papers that are in the hands of 
one-tenth of the people create great people in Sarajevo, in 
Bosnia; they determine what each party has done, and so on. 
  ``Several days ago I told the people in the Central Office 
to 
prepare a monograph on the past 20 months of war, to present it 
realistically, without embellishing anything, if it is at all 
possible. I appealed to them to present this history of our 
contribution, our role in the defense and the saving of Bosnia- 
Herzegovina as objectively as possible, merely to put the facts 
together. This monograph will be finished in two to three 
months. A large quantity of material on what we have done in 
Sarajevo and other cities is being collected, and then we will 
invite the other parties to say what they have done. Not what 
they have said, not their stories: We support integral Bosnia, 
we are fighting, we hope -- but what they have truly done to 
preserve Bosnia! 
  ``I will give you the example of Hadzi Sfet, who is one of 
the first heroes to die in the fighting when we tried to take 
over Vogosca. The man gave his life. He went there knowing 
there was little chance of his coming back. I must mention our 
heroes, who are, among others, Safet Zajko and Ramiz Salcin. 
They are all prominent members of the party. We will make a 
list of our heroes, and make it known what the SDA has given in 
the struggle. 
  ``In April 1992 there were terrible attacks in several 
places 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- in Mostar, Bijeljina, Sarajevo, and so 
on. The war was flaring up. The Patriotic League could not take 
the blow. It simply could not take it. It resisted as much as 
it could -- in some places to a greater, and in some to a lesser 
extent. Naturally, everything depended on the quality of the 
people, on their courage. In some places the resistance lasted 
10 days, like in Foca, while in Zvornik it lasted much longer. 
It was a heroic battle, I think it lasted 36 days, and everyone 
died in it. Every one of them was a member of the SDA. 
  ``In Sarajevo, apart from the resistance of many 
spontaneous groups, the Patriotic League did the most. The 
former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] was expelled from the city. 
This was on 2 May 1992. The history of successes and failures, 
of victories and defeats, and of our struggle against the 
occupier, that is, our history, is yet to be written. I again 
appeal to those who are working on this monograph not to make 
any embellishments. What we have done is enough for us to 
proudly say: We have done this! This is our contribution! Now 
you, gentlemen, tell everyone where your members are, where your 
officials are. Naturally, our success is partly the result of 
the contributions of other nations -- Croats, Serbs; members of 
other parties, but the greatest part of this struggle was 
carried out by the Muslim people, by the SDA. That this is not 
known should be attributed to the image that the press has 
created, which never corresponds to reality. This is the case 
even in the places where the press is developed, let alone here, 
where the press is often the monopoly of a small group of people 
who are given some 10,000 German marks to write what they want. 
  ``I would like to state clearly that I do not want an 
Islamic 
republic, but I want Islam to survive in these areas, regardless 
of whether the others like it or not! We here illustrate a 
European Islam, we illustrate a modern Islam. We can do a lot 
in this respect, both for the East and for the West. Perhaps it 
is our mission to portray Islam for what it really is, to 
portray it through civilized, cultured people, which, thank God, 
we have managed so far. God has put us to difficult trials 
here; we have been slaughtered, killed, our women and children 
have been killed, our mosques destroyed. We will not kill women 
and children, we will not destroy churches; this is not our 
policy, although I should say that sometimes this does happen, 
unfortunately. This should not happen. There are a certain 
number of soldiers present at this session, and I would like to 
use this opportunity to tell them this, and they should tell 
everyone else -- we should not be doing this. We will win 
because we will respect other religions, other nationalities, 
and other political opinions, and because we will try to be 
democrats in this great misfortune. 
<H5>  Respect for Others </H5>
  ``The Turks ruled Serbia for 400 years, and yet Decani, 
Sopocani, and Hilandar [Serb monasteries] remained, because the 
people stuck to the religious books and did not destroy other 
people's places of worship. Never follow the principle of an 
eye for an eye. Act according to the law that says that women 
and children must not be killed. Finally, we belong to the 
people who say: We should work, we should fight, and the result 
is not in our hands, because people do not rule history. God 
rules history and things will be as God says. 
  ``This is an opportunity to tell you this -- I had a talk 
with Tudjman, and you know he has offered us the agreement that 
has been called `confederacy,' an `alliance in all fields' and 
so on. Naturally, I received this paper, which Tudjman expected 
me to sign immediately. He was surprised that I had not signed 
it. I was surprised that he was surprised, and I had reason to 
be. He offered something I had not come to discuss. Naturally, 
I said we would consider it, as it is an important document, 
very important, but it requires consideration. 
  ``At dinner the cochairmen were surprised I had not signed 
it. I quoted the Greek proverb: `Timeo Danaos et dona 
ferentes.' Beware of the Greeks bearing gifts! We will take a 
better look at this gift, and if it is a true gift, and not a 
Greek one, we will probably accept it. 
  ``This talk with Mr. Tudjman was rather hard. After a few 
hours of talking I suggested that there be no borders. If you 
want, let Croatia stretch to the Drina River, and us to the sea. 
At a certain moment, Tudjman told me: 'Bear in mind that this 
is a discussion of a dual division of Bosnia. What is being 
offered now is a tripartite division in which the Muslims are 
getting the devil's share.' I had to keep reminding Tudjman 
that I was a representative of a state delegation. 'Remember 
how things were in 1939. The Serbs and the Croats sat down and 
divided Bosnia. This could happen to you. Do you not see the 
realistic danger?' I replied to Mr. Tudjman that there was no 
Alija Izetbegovic then. I exaggerated a little there. 
Naturally, I could not save Bosnia if it were not for the 
200,000 soldiers who are defending it. 
  ``We have to preserve this party -- we should reorganize it, 
transform it, but we have to preserve it. The SDA has become 
the symbol of our people, and a symbol of planetary importance. 
The SDA is very strong on other continents, too, for example in 
Australia. In Germany, in Heidelberg, a great meeting was held 
several days ago. It was a meeting of 29 SDA organizations in 
Germany. Therefore, no matter how much criticism we have 
regarding its failures, the Muslim people cannot renounce this 
party. We will continue to make the party stronger, creating a 
powerful support for our people, primarily here, but also abroad. 
<H5>  Congratulations to the Fighters </H5>
  ``As far as the army is concerned, I congratulate all our 
fighters. We have the main body of this army; its flesh and 
blood, so to speak, are members of the party or its supporters. 
The officers are most often not, and they do not have to be. 
Several days ago I had a meeting at the military headquarters 
in Konjic, which I ended with a short message to the soldiers: 
Be like your people! These people are courageous, clever; love 
what your people love. 
  ``They keep telling us to fight for an integral Bosnia. 
There is no integral Bosnia without the Serbs and the Croats. 
If the Serbs do not want Bosnia, and there are 1.3 million of 
them, then it is difficult. I do not know if the Serbs will 
want an integral Bosnia, and I do not know when. As far as the 
Croats are concerned, I think that most of them do, except for 
Boban! Some of them want to be with us, which is a great hope. 
All the Muslims, most of the Croats, and a smaller number of 
Serbs want Bosnia. After all, more than a half of the people 
want this Bosnia. We still have the right to emphasize the 
principle that we want the integral Bosnia because the majority 
of the people want it. If there is peace, we will try to create 
a republic that will serve as an example, and in which no one 
will be prosecuted for their religion, nationality, or political 
belief. I would also like to add that this will be a country in 
which the Muslim people must never again experience genocide. 
In my opinion, this is the most important law.'' 
  President Izetbegovic continued the speech by talking about 
the necessity for a commitment to improving the social position 
of the soldiers and civilians who have become disabled in the 
course of the aggression, and about the importance of our 
obligation to take care of the children and the families of the 
martyrs in the way that is worthy of their sacrifice for the 
defense and liberation of the homeland. 
  ``There is a specific phenomenon in Sarajevo, a constant 
attempt at making a division. It is the enemies who are doing 
it, remember that. This attempt to fragment the city into parts 
for the simpletons who came from the country and the rest of the 
people -- lately even the people from Sandzak, and others. 
There is a little charm there, but it is a great deception, and 
I do not know if the people are aware of what they are doing. 
We are besieged and we are all the same here, no division is 
allowed. This is an illness that could have terrible 
consequences. Go and count the graves of the Sandzak people 
around Sarajevo, and those who make the divisions will be 
ashamed. This is the more unfortunate section of our people, 
some of them have been left across the Drina River; they are 
there and we are here. This is the way things happened; we 
cannot bring them together, but when we try to divide things in 
an artificial way, it is not good. The people who are here 
should be represented everywhere because they are fighting along 
with us. 
  ``Finally, what else can I say but what a poet said: `We 
swear upon the great God that we will not be slaves!''' These 
were the closing words of the speech with which Alija 
Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, 
addressed all present.

<F P=106> [Address by Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris </F>
Silajdzic to the extraordinary session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Government in Sarajevo on 24 Jan -- live] 
  [Text] [Silajdzic] I open the extraordinary session of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government on the critical situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, caused by the insufficient delivery of 
humanitarian aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina. The situation has not 
been more serious since the beginning of the aggression, and it 
is threatening to turn into a veritable catastrophe. We need to 
inform the international public and all the responsible factors 
in the international community about the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We call for the international factors' 
engagement in order to at least alleviate the consequences of 
the policy conducted by the international community regarding 
the organization and delivery of humanitarian aid to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  At the 20 January meeting in Geneva, convened by the 
European 
Union, it was agreed that the international community would use 
force if needed to secure the delivery of humanitarian aid to 
all parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This conclusion was preceded 
by the talks that we held in Geneva on 18 November with Mrs. 
Ogata, and on 29 November 1993, a joint declaration regarding 
the free passage of humanitarian convoys was signed by military 
commanders. This declaration was based on an earlier agreement 
reached with Mrs. Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
[UNHCR]. 
  Unfortunately, from that time until today, nothing has been 
done to implement the European Union's decision, although it had 
the support of all the other relevant international factors 
worldwide, including the United States and Russia. 
Unfortunately, for certain countries, this decision was just a 
pretext for lifting sanctions from Serbia and these countries 
invested all their efforts in this direction. The humanitarian 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina became steadily more difficult. 
Convoys with humanitarian aid are experiencing increasing 
difficulties in reaching certain parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
This situation began as far back as mid-October, with the UN 
Secretary General's decision to suspend the delivery of 
humanitarian aid to central Bosnia for a full month. To this 
very day, we have not been able to recover from this break. At 
the same time, this foreshadowed the grave humanitarian 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The international public was 
[word indistinct], worried, they spoke about the imminent 
winter, the catastrophe, however, nothing concrete was done to 
prevent the present situation, which must be qualified as 
dramatic. 
  The Bosnia-Herzegovina Government assesses that the reasons 
for such a dramatic situation primarily lie in the systematic 
and constant pressure applied to the sovereign, independent, and 
internationally recognized state of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its 
legitimate and legitimately elected authorities. The pressure 
consists of making the legitimate authorities in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina accept the aggressors' ultimatum, and 
legalize genocide and aggression in its own country. 
  The international community has not consistently 
implemented Chapter 7 of the UN Charter on the collective use of 
force against an aggressor. It has not allowed the legal and 
legitimate authorities to arm their people for the defense 
against the aggression. That right, as we know, has been 
envisaged by UN Charter Article 51. The Security Council, let 
us remember, adopted over 30 resolutions on the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The only resolution it has implemented so 
far is Resolution 713 that imposes an embargo on the import of 
arms on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, which only 
affects, as we know, Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  We have been pointing out for some time that the system and 
organization of the UNHCR in Bosnia-Herzegovina is illogical. 
The UNHCR does not have its headquarters in Sarajevo but in 
Zagreb, therefore in a country that is deeply involved in the 
conflict with Bosnia-Herzegovina. The organization of the 
logistic centers of the UNHCR does not conform with the state 
organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the system of 
information exchange between the government and the UNHCR is 
inadequate, so we have grave difficulties in obtaining reliable 
information. 
  We are particularly concerned about the structure of the 
humanitarian aid delivered, which does not suit the needs of the 
population. Most of the humanitarian aid consists of flour. 
However, the population lacks a significant amount of foodstuffs 
that it must have after 22 months of starvation -- considerable 
amounts of sugar, fats, meat products, vitamins, clothes, and so 
on. 
  As for the quantity of humanitarian aid -- [Refugees and 
Social Welfare] Minister Smajkic will later give some more 
detailed information on that -- I would only like to mention one 
fact: A person on the territory under the control of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Government, that is, the legal authorities of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, received 2.89 kilos of food in December. I 
repeat, on the territory under the control of the legal 
authorities of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a person received 2.89, that 
is, under three, kilos of food in December. A person on the 
territory under the control of the Serb aggressor received 4.31 
kilos of food, while a person on the territory controlled by the 
HVO [Croatian Defense Council] received 9.61 kilos of food. 
These are facts. Minister, you have to confirm this. What is 
the source of this information? [Unidentified voice: UNHCR]. So 
these are reports from the UNHCR. 
  On the other hand, over the last few months -- according to 
the UNHCR reports -- convoys have been organized every day for 
parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina under the Serb aggression, or for 
western Herzegovina. The explanation for this is that these are 
territories where there are no military operations. So, in 
places where there are military operations the population is 
punished in two ways -- they have the military operations, and 
they do not get humanitarian aid. 
  The humanitarian aid is distributed to the entire population 
in parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina that are occupied, regardless of 
whether they are refugees or not. That is the case in Bijeljina 
and Banja Luka, even though there has not been a single day of 
fighting in either of the cities, and the population can, under 
the circumstances, organize its own production of food. 
  In the context of the pressure that is being exerted on the 
legal authorities of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the international 
community has recently been exerting pressure by the mere 
mention of withdrawing the UN forces from Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Everyone here has heard of the case of Tuzla airport. Futile 
discussions have been held about that for months. The airport 
in Tuzla is not being opened because the aggressor does not give 
his approval. Therefore, the opening of the airport in Tuzla, 
the opening of the corridors for humanitarian convoys, the 
delivery of humanitarian aid in general, all this depends on the 
aggressor's good will, and that has been the case for 22 months 
now. That is the basic problem that we have with the 
international community. The international community is not 
prepared -- as they agreed in Geneva -- to use force against 
everyone who obstructs humanitarian convoys. 
  Before ending, I would like to stress some positive things. 
Where mostly needed, airdrops of certain amounts of food, the 
necessary amounts of food, have been reaching the people of 
Maglaj, Tesanj, Mostar, and elsewhere. That is an operation 
carried out by the United States, Germany, and France. This is 
a commendable move, but we cannot rely on airdrops, as these are 
small quantities and the operations are too expensive and cannot 
last long. So the question arises of land convoys. If there 
are no land convoys, if we do not get the understanding of the 
neighboring countries, particularly those where there are large 
quantities of humanitarian aid, if these convoys do not head off 
for Bosnia-Herzegovina and if their passage is not secured by 
the UN forces, then the international community can expect a 
humanitarian catastrophe in Bosnia-Herzegovina very soon.

<F P=106> Interview with Iko Stanic, member of the Croatian National </F>
Council of Bosanska Posavina, by Ivan Sabic; place and date not 
given: "We Belong to Both Herceg-Bosna and Bosnia-Herzegovina"] 
  [Text] [Sabic] The Province of Bosanska Posavina was 
founded despite the decision of Herceg-Bosna to establish in 
this area a zupanija [parish] with special government. What is 
the reason for this? 
  [Stanic] We believe that the founding of a zupanija did not 
suit the Posavina inhabitants, i.e., that this was not a 
solution of the territorial- political problem of the Bosanska 
Posavina. 
  The reason for this is a whole series of specific 
characteristics, mainly its distance from Herceg-Bosna. 
Moreover, one should not disregard the fact that we are under 
occupation, so that our interests and the interests of Croats 
who live in the free territory of Herceg-Bosna are not the same. 
Our specific characteristic is also that we are not at war with 
the Muslims. Our relations are very correct, Croats and Muslims 
are waging the war together against those who attacked them. 
  [Sabic] How would you define the position of the province in 
relation to Herceg-Bosna and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Stanic] We believe that we are entitled to a place both in 
the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Herceg-Bosna. Simply stated, 
we are part of the Croatian body but also of the internationally 
recognized state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In declaring the 
province we are not threatening what Herceg-Bosna has positively 
achieved thus far, nor do we intend to do anything that would 
lead to a conflict among the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  No political or legislative body existed in Posavina, there 
was no unified government because municipalities were directly 
linked with Herceg-Bosna, so that the founding of the province 
was a great accomplishment. 
  [Sabic] You say that you do not want a conflict to occur 
among the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, certain 
political disagreements exist, and with the founding of the 
province of Bosanska Posavina they gain importance. 
  [Stanic] A political conflict already exists, but it will 
remain just that. I must emphasize that the HDZ [Croatian 
Democratic Community] as well as representatives of political 
and military leaderships, cultural societies, and the Church 
participated in the convening of the first general assembly of 
Bosanska Posavina. 
  A few days later, the same people who participated in the 
proposal of the decision and in the conclusions publicly 
disassociated themselves from the decisions of the assembly, 
which is rather unbelievable. We believe that this is the 
influence of the people from Herceg-Bosna, which means that 
there is an effort from one center to carry out a policy that 
should be valid in the entire territory. 
  [Sabic] Posavina residents held assembly meetings even 
before 
the one at which the decision on establishing the province was 
made. How many assembly meetings were altogether held? 
  [Stanic] What is in fact happening, what each of these 
gatherings mean was probably not explained in the best way. 
There was only one general assembly, the one that was held in 
Slavonski Brod. Before that, an assembly of Croats who emigrated 
or were exiled from Bosanska Posavina was held.

<F P=106> [Article by Ranko Vaskovic: "The Multiparty System Contested </F>
by Media"] 
  [Text] Although it still has not been defined as a state 
under international law, nor has it been recognized as a new 
state community under the political documents of the 
international community now in effect, the Srpska republic [RS] 
has all the attributes of statehood, manifested, first of all, 
in the existence of the supreme political bodies, the Assembly 
and the government, to which, of course, the functions of the RS 
president are added. When it is taken into account that the new 
Serbian state in Bosnia has its own government news agency, and 
government radio and television as well, all the necessary 
conditions have been met for the optimum functioning of a legal 
and political community, which, to be frank, also has a very 
strong army and police in addition to the institutions mentioned 
already. 
  The news media, above all television and radio, impart 
particular importance and features to everything that has been 
said so far about the attributes of RS statehood, which were 
brought about under the difficult reality of war, which has 
persisted for nearly two years now. In singling out radio and 
television, we did not mean to underestimate the importance and 
role of the many publications operating on the territory of the 
RS, but only to recall the special place they have in informing 
the Serbian people. Recently, for instance, media interest in 
the RS has been centered not only on the events of the war, but 
also on the political activity of certain political parties, 
above all the Serbian Democratic Party [SDS]. However, the 
political activity of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS], the 
Socialist Party of the RS, and other parties, and indeed even 
certain associations and political organizations not organized 
as parties, is just as important. After all, the very fact that 
during the birth and evolution of the new Serbian state a 
multiparty system has grown up out of the social and political 
stratification of the Serbian people, which is an essential 
condition of parliamentary democracy, places a special imprint 
on the upcoming democratic and multiparty elections in the RS, 
which will be held when all the necessary conditions are brought 
about. It should be emphasized that even the present Assembly of 
the RS is a multiparty body, although the SDS has a sizable 
majority. 
  The thaw in the activity of the political parties registered 
in the RS has not been given proper weight or treatment in the 
media, especially television. There is no doubt that this can be 
seen when various news releases and reports are issued for the 
public and are addressed to the Serbian people and thereby also 
to the membership of the parties addressing them through the 
media. The most recent example is the news item recently 
broadcast from the television studio in Pale on the Second 
Newscast concerning the news conference held by the Serbian 
Radical Party in Banja Luka. The only message to the public from 
the leadership of the Serbian Radicals of the RS reported from 
that news conference in that news item was that the instruments 
of the law-governed state are being applied more effectively on 
the territory of the RS, and that is all! Can it be that nothing 
more was said at that news conference of the SRS of the RS about 
anything else happening in the RS? Did that party's leadership 
really summon a sizable number of journalists just for one 
sentence?! Nor are we inclined to believe that the leadership of 
any party which intends to participate seriously in the 
proceedings of the parliament of a state, and that would thereby 
also apply to the leadership of the SRS of the RS, would dare to 
send to the public by fax or other means of communication just 
one sentence about its discussion with the newsmen. The costs of 
such a project (!) would be much greater than the political 
effect they might achieve by their presentation to the members 
of the media. This is not an isolated case. A similar fate has 
befallen news releases and reports issued from news conferences 
of other political parties, except for the Serbian Democratic 
Party, whose record so far on behalf of the RS has not been 
challenged by anyone. But the way in which news releases of 
other political parties are issued through the government news 
media, especially RS Television, which beyond all doubt is the 
one most watched and and the most influential, is not fair and 
should be changed immediately. After all, a piece of news, 
however important and subtly written, cannot have great value if 
its broadcast time on television is reduced to a mere 20 seconds 
or so! 
  The media neglect of the political activity of certain 
political parties in the RS, whether the blockade by the leading 
news media is deliberate or inadvertent, constitutes a negative 
political legacy which thousands of Serbs belonging to various 
political parties will be looking at in the upcoming election 
campaigns in the RS. After all, the upcoming multiparty 
elections in the Serbian republic Krajina and then in Serbia as 
well, will have a strong political impact on overall political 
events in the Srpska republic. And if there should be a 
political solution for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina in the near 
future, one that is acceptable to all three nationalities 
involved in the conflict, the scheduling of the first multiparty 
and democratic elections in the RS will not be so far off.

<F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Rasim Delic, commander of the </F>
General Staff of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina; place and date not given: "Expecting 
Turnabout"] 
  [Text] Former commander Safer Halilovic, who allowed 
the formation of irregular units and who did not prevent the 
formation of private armies that looted throughout Sarajevo, was 
replaced by Rasim Delic. Delic was born in Celic near Brcko in 
northeastern Bosnia. After his elementary school education he 
enrolled in a military school. He is one of the few officers in 
the Bosnian Army who has graduated from the Staff Command 
College [komandno-stabna skola]. Anyone in the Yugoslav 
People's Army who wanted to reach the rank of general had to 
complete his studies at this school. He left the Yugoslav 
People's Army with the rank of colonel. On 12 April 1992 he 
deserted and joined improvised units of the Territorial Defense. 
Before he became commander, he was the head of a logistics base 
in charge of arms procurement. The import and transportation of 
the bulk of the arms with which the Bosnians have been supplied 
have passed through his former base in Visoko, near Zenica. One 
of his first actions at the helm of the Bosnian Army was not 
carried out on the front lines, but in Sarajevo itself. 
  [NEDELJNA BORBA] Local bosses were dispensing justice in the 
town and the surrounding hills as recently as February. 
  [Delic] They are called bullies. 
  [NEDELJNA BORBA] Where have they disappeared to? 
  [Delic] In Sarajevo there were several smaller and larger 
groups, above all in the old part of the town. These groups 
operated outside the system of command and did not recognize the 
military hierarchy, nor were they obeying orders. Members of 
these groups also took part in the fighting, but in their own 
way. We had a mountain of problems with them. They were 
involved in criminal activities, they were abducting people, 
forcing them to dig trenches, and stealing money. They also did 
even worse things. We know about several murders that were 
committed by them. This had nothing to do with the nationality 
of these people and their units. They only wanted to profit from 
the war. The thrust of that action solved the problem of two 
main disobedient groups, which began to obstruct the work of the 
legal authorities, thus damaging the reputation of the state of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. After that we took care of the lower 
ranking people involved in war profiteering and criminal 
activities who were using the uniforms of the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to disguise their activities. First, we had 
to make sure that this would not cause or lead to any retreat 
from the front lines, that it would not lead to internal 
clashes, and that the entire thing was carried out 
professionally, as appropriate for a state. 
  [NEDELJNA BORBA] How do you think you will win this war? 
  [Delic] I do not know whether the world will let anyone win. 
They have introduced an arms embargo only on us. Despite this, 
we are the only military force on the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina that is gaining in strength every day and has 
the possibilities for further military consolidation. Croatian 
units, without direct support from Croatia, are not an army at 
all. Serbian paramilitary formations without arms and without 
direct support from the Yugoslav Army would not be a special 
force either. From the organizational and staffing point of 
view, we have the best prospects. If we had the suitable 
technical capability for operations, if we were at least 
technically nearly as strong as the aggressor's forces, there 
could be a turnabout in the war. This would be important 
because after that the negotiating position of our country would 
be considerably more favorable and the chances of a sensible 
political solution much greater. 
  [NEDELJNA BORBA] Who is fighting on your side? 
  [Delic] The brunt of every army is borne by the lower and 
middle ranks. We have people of every profession in the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, ranging from university professors to 
workers and farmers. This is a war for survival and all those 
who know that fighting is the only way to survive and to win 
freedom and peace are taking part in it. Of course, not all of 
them bear the same burden. People who used to be in political 
and administrative services are perhaps hit the hardest, but 
they are also taking part in other spheres. The final victory 
will not only be won by military action. All those who stayed on 
our territory are involved in the fighting. If nothing else, 
they suffer because of the war. 
  [NEDELJNA BORBA] What is your attitude toward those capable 
of fighting but have fled the country? 
  [Delic] Wars produce heroes, deserters, cowards, war 
profiteers, and completely normal people. The brunt of the war 
is being borne by normal people, by ordinary men who do not 
stand out from the the crowd. Those who become media stars have 
become that because of the war. Many people taking part in the 
fighting remain anonymous. They are in the trenches, and they 
are the only heroes of this war. This is why we can condemn 
those who left. But also, just because of that, we can show 
understanding. People are either afraid or have their own views 
on it. Nevertheless, peace will be established one day and the 
state will have to confront them. My view differs from that 
held by others that they should be banned from coming back. 
There are not enough people in Bosnia for us to allow ourselves 
to prohibit them from coming back. The only thing that we 
should do is prevent those who left before the war to make a 
profit out of it. I personally would not want to see them come 
back as investors of capital or to take up important posts. One 
must know that there is a difference between those who fought 
and those who did not.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, president of the </F>
Polish National Bank, by Andrzej Woyciechowski at the Radio Zet 
studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of Radio Zet" program--live] 
  [Text] [Woyciechowski] Radio Zet's guest today is Mrs. 
Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, president of the Polish National Bank 
[NBP]. Good morning to you. 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Good morning. 
  [Woyciechowski] When will we see the new, beautiful money 
about which we hear so much? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] We can see the new and beautiful money 
at 
the beginning of next year. One can say that to some extent we 
have been deliberately preparing the public for the fact that 
the redenomination must take place, so as not to catch the 
public by surprise. A draft of the law is already prepared and 
let us hope that the parliament will debate it, then I hope the 
new money --that is the elimination of a few zeros--will take 
effect at the beginning of next year. 
  [Woyciechowski] How many zeros will that be? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Four. 
  [Woyciechowski] Okay, four zeros which means that 10,000 
zlotys today will equal 1 zloty then. Why did it take so long to 
conduct the operation? Why was it not done on 1 January of this 
year? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] First of all, it is a very serious 
operation--as you might imagine--which must be conducted by NBP 
along with the government, or practically speaking with several 
of the government's ministries. Completely different statistics 
must be introduced adjusted to the new money, and that applies 
to every economic unit. So this kind of operation cannot simply 
be implemented just like that, because someone says it is time 
to do it, but instead, there would have to be a combined 
government effort. Well, it so happened that this 
government--practically speaking--was officially established at 
the end of last year, and that would be.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And that was the main reason 
for the delay--the fact that there was no one to talk to? Or 
was it the risk that this government would cause an increase in 
inflation and so forth? Was it a political risk, or.... 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, interrupting] There is of course always 
the risk of fueling inflation,but we try not to think about it, 
rather we think about convenience, so to speak, for people who 
use the money, the banknotes. We take into account the fact that 
currently various machines refuse to deal with the number of 
zeros that big, so we tend to concentrate our attention on the 
technical side, and we do not think that inflation has increased 
in Poland. 
  [Woyciechowski] You mean it will be dropping? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I hope so--such are the assumptions made 
by the finance minister in the budget bill, and we also share 
[word indistinct]. 
  [Woyciechowski] Who makes the decision on 
denominations--you, 
the government, or the president? Who decides? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] From a formal standpoint, it is the NBP 
that makes the decision, since according to a law on NBP its 
chairperson is responsible for introducing new banknotes and 
[word indistinct].... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So practically speaking, you 
could make the decision all by yourself? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Formally speaking--yes, but you know, 
some laws should be changed, such as the Penal Code and the 
Commercial Code since the figures included there will have to be 
changed, so from a formal standpoint, it would be a good thing 
if.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean fines and various 
other monetary amounts included in various laws? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Yes, so changing these laws I would say 
requires legislative action. 
  [Woyciechowski] Is it true that the new money is beautiful 
to 
look at? You have seen it. 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, laughing] I guess one could say that, 
but 
that is a matter of state secrecy. 
  [Woyciechowski] I know and I understand that. Is the money 
already printed and ready to be used? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, hesitating] That is also a state secret. 
  [Woyciechowski] It is? But my understanding is that the 
money is already printed because if it was not, you would say 
so. But storing all this money must require using some 
incredibly huge warehouses, some incredibly vast amount of 
space. Is the money being stored in Poland, or somewhere like 
Switzerland or a Caribbean island? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] You know, of course I cannot reveal that 
either, but you have to keep in mind that we have some space for 
storing the money currently in circulation, I mean the 
million-zloty banknotes, as well as all the 500,000-zloty 
banknotes [laughing] if I got it right .... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And these probably take up 
more 
space than the new banknotes? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] That really takes up a lot of space and, 
by the way, I must say that practically speaking, ever since I 
took up this post, high-denomination banknotes have not been 
printed--I mean during my term of office--and sometimes we have 
to take upon ourselves the consequences of previous printing 
issues, and I mean not just a few times, but in the majority of 
cases. 
  [Woyciechowski] What will happen to the dollar, I mean its 
radical devaluation [dewaluacja skokowa]? There is a 
lot of talk about it now--some would like to see it, others 
would not. Will it happen, and what does radical devaluation 
mean? And who needs it at all? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Well, I would say that is always the 
biggest problem to me and I do not like it very much when 
various lobbying groups--and also sometimes representatives of 
governments, unfortunately, take part in this, that was the case 
both with the previous government and this one--I mean I do not 
like it when they speak of a necessity for such a devaluation, 
since first of all, that decision is in the range of powers of 
the NBP chairperson.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That is you. 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Yes. 
  [Woyciechowski] And do you want to see such a radical 
devaluation or not? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] No, I do not want to devaluate.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So will it happen or not? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I think there are no reasons whatsoever 
for this type of measure in the immediate future, and I will 
explain specifically why I believe that to be the case. It is 
not because I said so, or that [laughing] my word is the 
determinant factor here, but the fact is that since October of 
last year, there has been a process of very high increases in 
foreign-currency reserves. Let me give you an example: At the 
beginning of last year, we were planning to have an increase in 
foreign-currency reserves in the range of $200 million whereas 
in fact we already have $300 million at this point.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Foreign-currency reserves are 
represented by those dollars which [words indistinct]? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] The dollars which are in the banking 
system. 
  [Woyciechowski] Where does that money come from? The 
situation is so bad, and suddenly we have more dollars? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I mean, fortunately--as in every country 
with a market economy--the foreign-trade balance is just one of 
the indicators, and just one of the sources of reserves. We 
happen to have a foreign-trade deficit, but there are many other 
sources of [word indistinct] I would say, for instance through 
privatization--for example the two recent bank privatizations 
mean big amounts of foreign-currency reserves, in this case the 
money is coming into Poland from abroad. And there is also the 
[words indistinct] that some people have savings in dollars.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So this is a kind of 
individual 
import--people bring dollars from abroad and they deposit them 
in banks, then exchange those dollars into zlotys.... 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, interrupting] Yes, that is a kind of 
individual import. So I would say there is a lot of concern in 
Poland about the Eastern border, but we know that there are 
constant purchases made from beyond the Western border, and that 
means an influx of foreign currencies into our country, like the 
German mark, which naturally is included on the list of hard 
currencies. So we are having an increase in foreign-currency 
reserves, and the previous devaluation in August took place only 
because reserves were decreasing.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But let me go back to the 
issue of the foreign-trade deficit for a moment. People say that 
the foreign-trade deficit is enormous, that imports exceed 
exports by huge amounts, and the recent figures are $2.5 billion 
per year--these are huge figures--but my understanding is that 
there is no problem because we have the money? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] We have the money. The most important 
thing for a central bank is its level of reserves, and not the 
most recent foreign-trade balance, I would say. The current 
balance of payments is more important. That payment balance also 
includes other sources apart from just the foreign-trade 
balance. That is quite a natural thing to happen. Let me give 
you an example that is perhaps spectacular: The United States 
has been having a [word indistinct] negative foreign-trade 
balance, and nothing bad is happening to that country as a 
consequence of that, and nothing bad is happening to the 
dollar--on the contrary, it keeps rising on foreign markets. So 
it is important not to link the foreign-trade balance to 
foreign-currency reserves. That is the popular thinking in 
Poland, but it is a relic of a centrally planned economy--at the 
time there were no other sources of income whatsoever.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean, of the socialist 
economy? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Correct. 
  [Woyciechowski] So that means the situation is good? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Yes, it is, from the standpoint of.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] We have a lot of dollars. 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Besides it is a very good thing that we 
have the imports of technology, because an economy that is 
already reviving--we will have an increase of 4.5 percent in the 
gross domestic product--needs new technologies and it needs 
imports, whereas on the other hand consumption 
imports--according to data from the Central Office of 
Statistics--have been declining. So that is a natural and normal 
phenomenon for an economy that was behind other economies, in 
terms of technology, and that is now developing. 
  [Woyciechowski] So there will be no devaluation of the 
dollar? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] For the immediate future, there are 
no.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What does immediate future 
mean? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, laughing] You know, that would be going 
into details. I can say this much: If we were to see a sudden 
decrease of foreign-currency reserves which would go on for a 
substantial period of time, then we would think about it. But 
what we do have even now is constant devaluation--and let us not 
forget that--every month, or practically speaking every day, the 
zloty is devalued by between 10 and 20 zlotys in relation to a 
foreign- currency index where 45 percent is taken up by the U.S. 
dollar. 
  [Woyciechowski] That is simply a result of inflation. 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Exactly. And it is our view that there 
will be no need for an additional devaluation during this entire 
year, providing the foreign-currency reserves keep rising the 
way they have been since October of last year, and even if the 
rate of increase is slower, there will be no need for a 
devaluation, either. 
  [Woyciechowski] How do you feel about the draft budget? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Generally speaking, it is good in the 
sense that the budget deficit is not too big--that is the most 
important thing to me--and also that the level of financing the 
budget deficit planned to be implemented by the NBP is 
acceptable to us, I mean the 30 trillion zlotys.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] The budget deficit will be 83 
trillion zlotys--according to plans--and you will supply 30 
trillion zlotys of that amount. 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Yes, I will lend the money, that is 
exactly [words indistinct].... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] How will you lend the money? 
Will you charge interest? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Yes, I will lend the government money at 
the standard market interest rate, and the market interest rate 
is in the range of approximately 30 percent.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So you will actually make 
money 
on the loan? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Correct, and the government will also be 
happy to see 80 percent of NBP revenue being transferred to the 
budget by me.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Wait a minute, it has gotten 
terribly complicated here. The government faces a budget 
deficit. You loan 30 trillion zlotys to the government charging 
a very high interest rate.... 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, interrupting] It is a normal market 
interest rate, not a very high interest rate at all. 
  [Woyciechowski] And that 30 trillion is our money, belonging 
to all of us --our savings, our public money so to speak, is 
that right? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Naturally, what you said is included in 
there since the money I collect within NBP accounts are banks' 
mandatory reserves, whereas it is society that deposits money in 
the banks. 
  [Woyciechowski] So in a word, you loan the 30 trillion 
zlotys 
charging a high interest rate, but the interest rate is then 
taken over by the government indirectly since the government is 
NBP's owner, as it were? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] No, the government is not the owner of 
NBP, but even despite that, I have to transfer 80 percent of 
NBP's revenue. The government is not the owner of other economic 
units that are legal entities either, but these units still have 
to pay a 40-percent income tax. 
  [Woyciechowski] So this is like that pre-World War II Jewish 
anecdote: Somebody loans money and everybody benefits. The 
government loans money to itself, and it is our money--can one 
say that it is our money? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, laughing] Yes, one can say that. The 
method has been accepted in all those countries with market 
economies facing a deficit problem, and we must say here that 
even Germany is facing the problem of a budget deficit, and it 
is a usually accepted practice that citizens--or economic 
units--finance the budget deficit by lending money, and of 
course they make money on the transaction. 
  [Woyciechowski] And if the Sejm increased the deficit, would 
you lend more money? I mean more than 30 trillion zlotys? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I must admit that for the time being I 
am 
not taking that possibility into account since the 1994 budget 
bill is the government's draft, the government enjoys a stable 
Sejm majority, and despite the debates or some complaints that 
various needs were not satisfied, I am strongly convinced the 
budget will be passed in the form it was proposed by the cabinet. 
  [Woyciechowski] What is domestic debt? Recently there has 
been talk that our foreign debt--reaching into the billions of 
dollars--is really peanuts, and that what is really important is 
domestic debt. But few people know what the term means. Who 
lends whose money to whom? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Well, our foreign debt is not exactly 
peanuts. But it is true that the problem of domestic debt has 
been completely ignored up to now, simply because people thought 
that somebody gives money to finance the deficit--just like you 
used the word give here--it could be the central bank, or 
somebody else. The truth of course is that nobody just gives 
money to anybody. The government borrows the money and has to 
repay it later. And on top of that, in Poland the government 
borrows money for relatively short periods of time--if you take 
the United States for instance, there are treasury bonds there 
which are for as long as 30 years, for example. In Poland of 
course, no citizen or economic unit makes that kind of economic 
investment for that kind of time period, and that is why such 
instruments are impractical in Poland. As Finance Minister 
Borowski nicely described, the domestic debt has been 
snowballing, which means the more money you borrow, the more you 
have to repay. That is also a warning in terms of the magnitude 
of the budget deficit--there was talk that it could exceed 5 
percent, or that we can allow to have it at the level of 6 or 7 
or 8 percent--naturally, you can have such amounts if you have 
the money with which to pay it back. But it turns out that the 
problem is not that simple and that a government in debt simply 
has to repay its debt, and since the financial instruments in 
Poland are of a short-term nature--that is generally speaking up 
to one year and only some government securities are for three 
years, for which there is less demand than for the one-year 
securities--therefore the government has to plan in every 
subsequent budget the amount of money it will repay. Which is 
several dozen trillion zlotys. 
  [Woyciechowski] And the figure keeps rising. 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Exactly. 
  [Woyciechowski] So the domestic debt is about treasury 
bills, 
government securities, and what else? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Those are the two instruments--treasury 
bills purchased by banks, including NBP, and government 
securities purchased by the public at large. More and more 
people know now that if one buys government securities, one can 
deduct over 12 million zlotys from taxable income with regard to 
income tax, and that is why we had those lines of people at 
banks to buy securities, even on New Year's Eve. So you see, 
citizens lend money. 
  [Woyciechowski] Do you gamble on the stock exchange? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, laughing] No, but I purchased government 
securities. 
  [Woyciechowski] And is it worthwhile to gamble there? What 
is your view on all these jumps in share prices at the stock 
exchange, and on this massive demand to buy shares? Is it a 
normal phenomenon, or are we so preoccupied by this beginning of 
the stock exchange and the beginning of capitalism, that we 
spend too much money? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I think you are right on both counts 
there. I would say the question you posed is very good, but it 
should be addressed by Stock Exchange Chairman Rozlucki, not me. 
The exchange is a new institution of our market economy which is 
going through its development, and I would say the more economic 
units there are, the more stable and reliable the exchange will 
be. And then one will not be able to say that some profits made 
there are inflated or unrealistic, because the basis for the 
functioning of this whole capital exchange will be widened, that 
means speedy privatization. By the way, the government is 
heading in that direction. 
  [Woyciechowski] Recently you gave customers of private banks 
quite a scare by saying that not all of them have NBP guarantees 
and that one should take a good look at a bank before depositing 
money there since it could go bankrupt. Could you explain a 
little bit on how [words indistinct]...? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, interrupting] The problem is that this 
is 
the way Panorama put it. But all I said was that it is a wise 
thing to keep money in different banks, just like it is a wise 
thing to keep it in different places as well. That applies to 
banks, but also to the stock exchange, for instance, or to trust 
funds. Simply put, it is not a wise thing to keep all the money 
you have in one place, or all on one shelf in a closet. But I 
would not caution generally against private banks because there 
are some of them that are very good and they are very active on 
the stock exchange, but even those that are not there can still 
be very good, and on the other hand there are state-owned banks 
that are very bad. According to the law, private banks do not 
have guarantees with regard to deposits the way state-owned 
banks do, except we will shortly have a law on securing 
deposits, but even despite that NBP, of course, pays out up to a 
certain amount in case a bank like that goes bankrupt, except 
that currently, basically speaking, because the Baltic Bank, 
which has declared itself insolvent, is being taken over by 
[name indistinct] Bank, so people will not lose any money in 
that case, and we hope that the other bank--which is 
Interbank--will manage to be saved nevertheless, so there is no 
such danger. But it is beyond dispute that there is also a bad 
situation in the cooperative sector, and in those cases, even 
though the state practically provides guarantees to all 
cooperative banks, unfortunately I had to declare one of them 
insolvent the day before yesterday, and that was the 18th case, 
and that despite the fact that there are guarantees by the 
state. One will still have to wait because the way the finance 
minister interprets his guarantees is that he will begin paying 
out, but only after the insolvency proceedings are over, which 
may last up to two years .... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So these customers face the 
danger of not being able to use their accounts for two years? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] In a way, it is really a danger, but the 
civil rights spokesman spoke out in defense of those customers 
and now the Supreme Court will issue a decision on that. 
  [Woyciechowski] How does one tell a good bank from a bad 
one? 
You say there are good and bad examples both among private banks 
and state-owned ones, so the ownership question cannot be the 
way to tell. So what is it? Is it beautiful furniture, a lot of 
computers, and nice ladies waiting to serve you? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, laughing] No, that is not the way to 
tell that, either--oftentimes they are banks that used to have 
problems in investments because they actually invested 
customers' deposits, not the banks' own capital. That is 
undoubtedly not a simple issue for an average man on the 
street--I mean the bank's balance or the solvency 
coefficient--it is like secret information, as it were. When 
interest rates are very high, that becomes dangerous. But the 
question is: What are extremely high interest rates? There used 
to be banks where there were extremely high.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean Grobelny's bank, or 
other cases as well? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Not just that, but also even Bogatyn's 
bank which we have taken over and now NBP is its owner. There 
was also the case of Prosper Bank of which NBP also became the 
owner now--they used to apply such flagrantly high.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And that becomes suspicious? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Only if they are flagrantly high. There 
have to be some differences among banks--that is what 
competition is all about. So I stress it that they have to be 
flagrantly higher than on the average in the banking system. 
  [Woyciechowski] When will Polish banks be all beautiful to 
look at, stylish, and very efficient? When will they have a 
network of computer connections, when will they eliminate lines? 
There is a lot of talk now that making the banking system 
healthy is a major step toward the market economy. How much time 
will it take? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I am sure it is hard to predict that 
with 
precision, but I think the establishment of the National 
Clearing Chamber--which is a system of clearing accounts among 
different banks and currently more than 40 banks participate in 
it--represents major progress. I can say that the time required 
to have financial means transferred between banks was cut short 
from a week to about two days. I know that there are complaints 
voiced sometimes--indeed, some banks procrastinate, and we try 
to intervene, but that is not the fault of the connection system 
but of specific banks, I would say. I think that competition 
continues to be the best advancing factor. Besides, we also have 
the TellBank network, which also serves the purpose of settling 
accounts among banks. It is very modern and we currently even 
use a satellite--I say we, because NBP is the majority 
shareholder in TellBank, and it seems that there are really 
banks out there with which customers are satisfied, and where 
clearing accounts takes a very short time, and the others will 
unfortunately not survive the competition--that is just life. 
  [Woyciechowski] And when will we have a situation like it is 
the world over, where everyone has a credit card, with all the 
money coming into the account, and one does not have to deal 
with all those huge amounts of cash? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Some measures have already been 
initiated. The PKO Bank has introduced such a card--I do not 
have one, but my colleagues there have shown it to me--and that 
also constitutes part of the competition. The banks that 
introduce such measures and make the customers' lives easier 
will gain customers. The products are already on the market. 
There are Visa and American Express cards all issued by.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But not by Polish banks? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] By Polish banks [as heard]. The most 
important thing is...[changes thought] Well, there is a Polish 
card issued by PKO BP whose extent is rather limited, but we are 
an open country, we can use foreign credit cards. Let us hope we 
will have Polish ones as time goes by. 
  [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the conversation. 
Radio Zet's guest today has been NBP President Hanna 
Gronkiewicz-Waltz. Thank you very much. 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Article by Lucian Vasile Szabo: "We Read in Timisoara, Four </F>
Years After the Revolution, Leaders of Reprisals Free; After 
Being Acquitted They Became Businessmen"] 
  [Text] The date 16 December 1989 was the beginning not only 
of anticommunist revolutionary activities in Timisoara 
[Temesvar], but also of reprisals executed by the defenders of 
the Ceausescu regime. On 16 December hundreds of people were 
arrested, locked up in the Pop Sapca Street jail and in the 
cellar of the police, where they were subjected to brutal 
treatment. On 17 December the avengers took up arms and shot 
into the defenseless crowd. The wounded and the dead were 
falling, and blood was pouring on Temesvar streets. Four years 
after this tragedy, the names of the murderers are still 
unknown. Ceausescu's executioners allied themselves with those 
who shot at the demonstrators, and they succeeded in 
discrediting and burying the idea of justice. 
  During the revolution, the Reprisal Commando was comprised 
of 
activists from the army, the Securitate [secret service], the 
fire brigades, and the [Communist] Party. Only a few of them 
were sentenced in the Temesvar trial and in some local trials. 
For the bloodbath in Temesvar, the following persons were 
prosecuted: Emil Macri, Ion Popescu, Traian Sima, Filip 
Teodorescu, Gabriel Anastasiu, Ion Deheleanu, Petru Moraru, Ion 
Baciu, Nicolae Chircoias, Gheorghe Atudoroaie, Ion Corpodeanu, 
Tinu Radu, Iosif Veverca, Gheoghe Avram, Valentin Ciuca, Eugen 
Misea, Laurentiu Preda, Tiberiu Grui, Viorel Bucur, Eugen 
Peptan, Gheorghe Ganciu, and Iosif Emilian Zamfir. Beyond the 22 
defendants, four party leaders were also prosecuted: Ion Coman, 
Cornel Pacoste, Ilie Matei, and Radu Balan. Petru Moraru and 
Emil Macri died in prison. 
  Almost two years after the trial began, the court handed 
down 
a sentence. Of the 26 defendants, only eight were sentenced: Ion 
Coman to 25 years, Radu Balan to 23, Cornel Pacoste, Ion Popescu 
and Traian Sima to 20 years each, Ion Deheleanu and Ion 
Corpodeanu to 18 years each, and Iosif Veverca to 15 years. The 
rest of them were acquitted for lack of evidence. Of those who 
were sentenced, Traian Sima and Ion Deheleanu are still behind 
bars; the rest were freed for reasons of illness. 
  Traian Sima, former Securitate commander in Temes county, 
declared that he did not wish to be freed for health reasons, 
"only through an amnesty or feet first" (dead). Ion Deheleanu's 
daughter replied to our inquiry that we should look for him in 
two or three months, by then he would be at home. The medical 
certificates would soon be completed. Ion Corpodeanu is at home. 
I visited him and talked with him through the window. He looks 
good. He does not comment on the events of December 1989. 
Although he is frequently seen in one of the stores of his son's 
firm, he claims he did not become a businessman. He says he only 
goes there to buy mineral water. Ion Coman, who was also 
released for health reasons, moved and we could not find him. 
  Of the acquitted, Filip Teodorescu started writing cheap 
mysteries, and he is making good money. Tinu Radu and Valentin 
Ciuca became businessmen. They own the TIVAL IMPEX import-export 
company together with an Arab entrepreneur. They export cement 
and oil products for hard currency. Tinu Radu stated that they 
were saving money dollar by dollar for a business venture. The 
former police officer Viorel Bucur, whose role in currency and 
gold dealings before 1989 was well known, was not sentenced. 
During the reprisals he led generals Nuta and Mihalea to the hot 
centers of the revolution. Today he is a successful businessman, 
owner of the FARFALA and VIBASS companies. 
  Among the army officers who took part in the reprisals, the 
names of Paul Vasile and Gheorghe Gheorghe are known. The former 
was given the order to recapture from the demonstrators the 
tanks stranded on Gyiroki Street. The command was: by any means. 
Paul Vasile recaptured them. Very many people died and were 
wounded on that occasion. Since then, Paul Vasile has been 
promoted to the rank of colonel, and he is the chief of the 
general staff of the Temesvar motorized regiment. Several people 
stated that the squad which opened fire on the demonstrators was 
under the command of Gheorghe Gheorghe. He was also promoted, 
moved to a different army unit, and was awarded the title 
"Veteran of the Revolution."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jan Fuelle: "The Half-Life of Disintegration"] </F>
  [Text] The rainbow is beginning to fade. This is perhaps 
the briefest way to characterize the events of recent weeks. The 
Slovak prime minister is increasingly less successful in 
maintaining at least the personnel compactness of the movement, 
if not the solidity of prevailing viewpoints. In addition, many 
of the steps that he undertakes under the constant pressure of 
recent events, and those undertaken by the most faithful 
followers under his leadership, give rise to unpleasant question 
marks at best and to fears at worst. 
  After the elections, Vladimir Meciar was promising sweat and 
tears. Outwardly, this formulation did not sound overly 
optimistic while it was sympathetically modest. Except that in 
the rhetoric of meetings and "10-minute sessions" he more 
frequently speaks of successes and has seen an economic miracle 
where it simply does not exist. Vladimir Meciar has thus gotten 
himself into a very curious situation--he fulfilled that which 
he promised, but is refusing to admit it.... 
  By coloring the sweat and tears a rosy color, we become 
witnesses to many other paradoxes. Those who were formerly 
faithful are being characterized as having little faith and, 
according to the prime minister, no longer have the right to sit 
in parliament. The formerly faithful speak of Vladimir Meciar as 
a person for whom falsehood is a working method. All of this 
mutual sniping tends to convince us primarily of one factor--the 
Slovak prime minister has managed to bring about the most 
tenacious opposition within the movement that he himself 
established and leads to this day. 
  The events of recent days, at a minimum, convinced him of 
yet 
another fact--he cannot even believe all of those who are 
remaining within the movement. Prior to the negotiations at 
Trebisov, Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik granted an unusually 
candid interview to NARODNA OBRODA. He did not use diplomatic 
language to speak of the events that took place at Zlata Idka, 
and it was as though he had forgotten about his profession on 
the occasion of other sharp and unequivocal formulations. Why 
then is the result of the Trebisov negotiations outwardly again 
so unequivocally in favor of Vladimir Meciar? For example, 
perhaps because during the final balloting, Jozef Moravcik and 
several other members of the movement's leadership were behind 
closed doors. 
  The resistance that is growing in several waves within the 
HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia] will likely 
definitively surface during the voting on the state budget for 
next year. It can be expected--much as was the case when a vote 
of confidence for Viliam Sobon was being taken--that the HZDS 
delegates will show each other their ballots. Except that this 
method has once before proved not to be viable--precisely during 
the above-mentioned vote--and it is therefore only with 
difficulty that success can be anticipated. 
  Moreover, in voting on the proposed state budget, there is 
more involved. Following the experiences of 1993, the delegates 
will have a more difficult time raising their hands in favor of 
a budget that is submitted at the last moment, one in which the 
opposition does not criticize the deficit, but above all 
criticizes the fact that it is compiled unrealistically. If we 
place the rarely unified opposition and the currently quarreling 
delegate clubs of the HZDS and the SNS [Slovak National Party] 
on one side of the scale, it is only with great difficulty that 
one can believe that the budget for next year will be 
successfully approved. 
  If this were not to succeed, it will only be the logical 
culmination of everything that has occurred during the past 
year. A very poor relationship with the opposition, the gradual 
development of a lack of confidence and suspicion within the 
HZDS parliamentary delegation, an expedient coalition between 
the HZDS and the SNS, "toughened" more by personnel shifts 
rather than by clean relationships and clear goals. 
  Let us return once more to the introduction. After the 
elections, Vladimir Meciar was actually promising sweat and 
tears. He fulfilled his promise, except that he himself would 
rather speak of an economic miracle. In forecasts for the next 
year, he speaks of the fact that we shall halt the downward 
trend and begin to climb upward in 1995. And this is the very 
thing the voter should perceive. Realistic promises, even if 
they are presented with unrepeatable self-confidence, become 
unrealistic. Given today's economic situation, in Slovakia as 
well as throughout the world, we have a long way to go before 
achieving an economic miracle, halting the recession, and seeing 
gradual growth. Professional disseminators of optimism have a 
difficult time today. Realists have become pessimists. 
Pessimists consider realists to be turncoats. 
  We shall find out soon into which categories we shall be 
able 
to place delegates after the voting on the proposed state 
budget. It is not much, but perhaps it will please at least the 
pessimists.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jan Sopoci: "The Phenomenon of Meciar and </F>
Slovakia"] 
  [Text] I have no idea how historians will evaluate our 
first post-November years and the first year of the independent 
Slovak Republic with the passage of time, but I am convinced 
that in doing so they will have to devote most of their time and 
attention to explaining the place and role of Vladimir Meciar in 
the political and the other life of posttotalitarian Slovak 
society. It is already clear today that this most prominent 
political personality of the first years of post-November 
Slovakia has influenced the developmental direction of our 
country at least until the end of the millennium in a decisive 
manner, irrespective of the future fate of V. Meciar, as well as 
the Slovak Republic. 
  In contrast to ourselves, who are Meciar's contemporaries, 
the historians of future decades will have an easier task 
because they will already have the results of his political 
activities to benefit (or to the detriment of) Slovakia and its 
inhabitants before them, and, moreover, in contrast to 
ourselves, they will be able to approach the evaluation of V. 
Meciar's activities more objectively and with less partiality 
than is the case today. That is because we, the contemporaries 
of Meciar, can be divided either into his unreserved friends, 
allies, or followers or into crystal-clear opponents or even 
enemies. The fact that today it is difficult to find people in 
Slovakia who take a different, say, neutral, position with 
respect to this politician, is symptomatic. The "Meciar 
phenomenon" has brought about a situation in which a 
(diminishing) part of the population feels that he is the 
personification of everything that is good, positive, whereas 
the other portion of the population, on the contrary, tends to 
view him as the personification of everything evil, negative, 
which is a phenomenon that can be connected with the personality 
of the politician. 
  Foreign political scientists and publicists virtually 
consider V. Meciar to be one of the charismatic, authoritarian 
politicians who have emerged in the postcommunist countries of 
Europe during the first years following the demise of the 
totalitarian regimes and who will, after a time, be replaced by 
a different type of politician (in the event these countries 
undergo democratic development), representing other methods of 
engaging in politics and governing in the country. The necessity 
for the departure of such politicians from the political life is 
justified on the basis of their inability to secure political 
stability, democracy, and economic prosperity in the countries 
that they govern, or rather that they previously governed. 
However, foreign political scientists point out that such 
politicians are generally not willing to recognize their 
failures and depart on their own on that basis, which generally 
still further complicates the situation in their countries and 
which, as shown by the Georgian experiences, for example, can 
even lead to a catastrophe. 
  I hope that Slovakia is not threatened with such a 
development, but the fact that many foreign observers already 
categorize Slovakia among the internally unstabilized East 
European countries with hard-to-predict developments is an 
alarming fact. At the same time, however, it is also the logical 
culmination of our development thus far, mostly of the fact that 
Slovakia has hitherto not proven able to come to terms with the 
consequences of its previous "historical traumatizations," 
irrespective of whether these included the Magyarization, 
Czechoslovakism, populism, or Stalinist socialism. Even for that 
reason we must deal with the "Meciar phenomenon" today.

<F P=106> [Article by (TA SR): "Swine Plague in Nove Zamky District"] </F>
  [Text] The first incidence on the territory of the Slovak 
Republic of the infectious classical-type swine plague was 
recorded on 7 December. The virus was detected in animals raised 
on a private farm in Chramec, in the district of Rimavska 
Sobota. The infection spread graudally to six more private 
farms. According to the information provided by the State 
Veterinary Administration, it was possible to identify the 
source of the infection: The virus originated in two wild boars 
recently shot in the vicinity of a breeding station owned by the 
Agricultural Cooperative in Chramec. Subsequently, the infection 
was also diagnosed in animals kept by privately operating 
farmers in the villages of Blhovce, Hodejov, and Janice. 
  As a protective measure, hunts for wild boars were then 
ordered in areas surrounding these places. From samples taken 
from the wild animals shot in these hunts, it was established 
that the plague virus was present only in those coming from the 
area of the villages of Drna and Hajnacka. As of now, there are 
no reports of the disease having spread to the large hog farms 
in the Rimavska Sobota district. However, on 29 December, an 
additional locality was added to the number of those affected by 
the infection. The Agricultural Cooperative Farm "Kolta" in 
Stara Dedina reported a number of animals infected by the virus. 
Strict preventive measures were immediately adopted on both that 
farm and in the local protected zones. On 30 December, the 
District Disease Prevention Commission decided to liquidate all 
exposed animals on the farm. Until last night, altogether 1,297 
animals either died or had to be destroyed. 
  In view of the current emergency, the State Veterinary 
Administration has published a reminder addressed to all 
breeders of hogs that states that it is their responsibility to 
follow and strictly apply all appropriate preventive measures 
authorized by the Central Commission for Disease Prevention on 
15 July.

  [Text] Brussels (from our correspondent) -- Yesterday at 
NATO headquarters, Boris Cizej, Slovene ambassador to Brussels, 
delivered a letter from Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle to NATO 
Secretary General Manfred Woerner, stating that Slovenia wishes 
to be included in the Partnership for Peace. 
  Including Slovenia in the NATO framework would mean 
increasing the distance from the harrowing confines of the 
former Yugoslavia. The administration as well as the parliament 
have already decided in favor of Slovene observer status in the 
North Atlantic Council for Cooperation, in which East and 
Central European countries and the former Warsaw Pact members 
cooperate with NATO. The concept of Partnership for Peace offers 
new opportunities which would eventually pave the way to regular 
NATO membership. This Western military alliance is supposed to 
satisfy two demands: that of the former Warsaw Pact members 
seeking new security assurances and that of Russia opposing NATO 
expansion to its borders.

people who are either Slovene citizens, of Slovene descent, or 
close relatives of Slovene citizens still live in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  At the most, 500 people would be evacuated from Sarajevo 
this

to evacuate from Bosnia-Herzegovina all Slovene citizens, their 
spouses, and their children, except men of draft age who have to 
have the permission of the Bosnian Government. Also included in 
the evacuation will be also the grandparents of Slovene 
citizens, providing they live in the same household.

They evaluated Slovene-Russian cooperation, which intensified

have broadened, which has had a positive impact on economic 
cooperation. After several years of decline in trade with 
Russia, Slovenia last year increased exports 20 percent and 
achieved a positive trade balance. According to some estimates, 
the value of this year's exports could surpass $300 million, 
which would place Russia among Slovenia's five largest trade 
partners.

without authorization, according to Samo Trebse, Slovene head of 
distribution. 
  The data show that, as of yesterday, Croatia has used more 
than 13 million kw per hour. The Slovene distribution system has 
been recording "stolen" electricity. Each hour, day and night, 
it has notified the Croats by fax that they have exceeded their 
quota. So far over a hundred reminders have been sent. The 
employees were unable to tell us what they plan to do if Croats 
continue to violate the agreement. They are awaiting 
instructions from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Croatia 
continues to import about 6 million kw per day from neighboring 
countries.

  [Text] As of January 18, Slovenia has been repaying its 
outstanding liabilities to the Consortium of Commercial Banks 
through a special account (fiduciary account) at Dresdner Bank 
in Luxembourg. The decision, adopted by the Slovenian government 
at a session on January 13, means that Slovenia no longer pays 
its outstanding liabilities directly to the account of 
Commercial Banks in New York, but instead accumulates the money 
in its special account. 
  The government decided to take this step following the 
unsuccessful negotiations with the Consortium. The Consortium 
was not prepared to accept Slovenia's proposal to pay off 16.4 
percent (US $500 million) of the total former Yugoslavia's US 
$4,200 million debt. While other financial institutions, such as 
the International Monetary Fund and the Paris Club, were in 
favour of the assessed 16.4 percent Slovenian share in the total 
Yugoslav debt, the Consortium insisted on the solidarity clause, 
to which the former Yugoslav republics bound themselves when 
they took out the loans. The Consortium insists that Slovenia 
should pay off $1,200 million, which is 28 percent of the joint 
Yugoslav debt. Slovenia will be channeling the money, intended 
for repaying outstanding liabilities to the Consortium of 
Commercial Banks, to its special account in Luxembourg until the 
two parties reach an agreement.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Highway Construction Plans in </F>
Slovenia--Project of Century"] 
  [Text] This year we will begin the largest investment 
project in Slovenia, which some call the project of the century: 
the accelerated construction of highways. According to this 
plan, 318 kilometers of highways and modern roads will be 
constructed by 1999, leading from the West (Koper) to the East 
(Lendava), branching off in the direction of Sezana and Nova 
Gorica (Italy) and Sentilj (Austria). The project should 
stimulate a new investment cycle. 
  In July, the State Assembly ratified the transportation 
agreement between the Republic of Slovenia and the European 
Union [EU]. (One of six European routes between East and West, 
the Barcelona-Kiev route, crosses Slovenia.) The EU agreed to 
provide 150 million ECU's during the next three years. The 
highway planning, construction, maintenance, and management will 
be supervised by the newly established Slovene Highway Authority 
(DARS), which will begin construction this year on nine 
sections, including Arja Vas-Vransko, Hoce-Arja Vas, and 
Sentilj-Pesnica, totaling 121 kilometers, as reported by STA 
[Slovene Press Agency].

<F P=106> [Article by D.H.: "185,000 Holders of Dual Citizenship"] </F>
  [Text] Ljubljana--Yesterday we reported on the Interior 
Ministry news conference on the topic of dual citizenship. We 
received quite accurate data on the number of citizens of the 
Republic of Slovenia who hold dual citizenship. These data 
should be given some serious consideration. 
  There are 169,313 people from the former Yugoslav republics 
who have received Slovene citizenship in accordance with Article 
40 of the Law on Citizenship, of whom 78,000 (46.7 percent) are 
from Bosnia-Herzegovina and also hold Bosnian citizenship, 
60,000 (34.8 percent) from Croatia, 22,000 (13 percent) from 
Serbia, 5,000 (2.9 percent) from Macedonia, and less than 5,000 
(2.8 percent) from Montenegro. 
  It is known that 80 percent of the almost 170,000 citizens 
from other republics of the former Yugoslavia who have received 
Slovene citizenship are unskilled workers. On average, they had 
resided in Slovenia eight years before obtaining Slovene 
citizenship, and a good fifth were unemployed. There are also 
15,000 Slovenes who live in other European countries or overseas 
and hold dual citizenship. In total, there are approximately 
185,000 citizens of Slovenia who hold dual citizenship.

<F P=106> [Interview with Predrag Lucic, FERAL TRIBUNE deputy editor, </F>
by Stevica Susa; place and date not given: "Mobilization in 
FERAL TRIBUNE"] 
  [Text] Two days ago, the Croatian police conscripted Viktor 
Ivancic, editor in chief of the satirical newspaper FERAL 
TRIBUNE. Because of its sharp and uncompromising language, the 
FERAL TRIBUNE is becoming ever more popular in Croatia and 
Slovenia. It is also a thorn in the side of the Croatian regime 
because of its critical and oppositional views. Predrag Lucic, 
the FERAL TRIBUNE deputy editor, in an interview with DELO, 
stated the motivation for drafting Ivancic and explained the 
position of the independent media in Croatia. 
  [Susa] Can you confirm the press agency report that Viktor 
Ivancic, the FERAL TRIBUNE chief editor, is now in the Croatian 
Army's Dracevac barracks in Split? 
  [Lucic] The above-mentioned press agency report is 
unfortunately true. Viktor Ivancic is in the Dracevac barracks 
now. He was brought there by the military police in accordance 
with a draft order of 31 December 1993. His call-up creates a 
precedent in Croatian public life. It is the first time that an 
editor of a publication was conscripted to be sent to the 
battlefield. I visited Viktor in the barracks this morning. The 
uniform suits him beautifully. I think that the Croatian Army 
has now gained a great deal and has the possibility of winning 
the war in Bosnia. Instead of the FERAL's slogan "Viva Ludez" 
[craziness], Viktor is now proudly proclaiming "Viva Tudjman." 
  [Susa] Ivancic was born in Sarajevo; according to some 
sources, Croats born in Bosnia are being drafted now. 
  [Lucic] This is true. The Helsinki Watch Committee has 
documented many such incidents. The Croatian Government has many 
reasons for drafting Ivancic. Viktor is born in Sarajevo. He has 
been living in Croatia since 1971 and is a Croatian citizen. I 
think that he was drafted to remove him from his position, which 
is not only immoral but also illegal. According to a Croatian 
law, an editor of a publication cannot be replaced if such 
replacement is not registered with the proper ministry. Of 
course, we have not done that. 
  [Susa] Will the drafting of Ivancic have a major impact on 
the publishing and editorial policy of the FERAL TRIBUNE? 
  [Lucic] Most texts for the FERAL TRIBUNE are prepared by the 
group Viva Ludez group, which is composed of Viktor Ivancic, 
Boris Dezulovic, and myself. Teamwork is now impossible. I think 
that a long absence by Viktor Ivancic could mean that the paper 
would cease publication. However, the next issue is ready to be 
printed, and it will certainly be distributed. 
  [Susa] Will you write about the drafting of your editor in 
the next issue? 
  [Lucic] Of course. Right now I am working on an article 
about 
the conscription of Gojko Susak, Croatian defense minister, who 
is, by the way, a Croatian citizen although born in Siroki 
Brijeg in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Feral will publicly demand that he 
be demobilized and allowed to do his job, in other words, the 
government should not interfere with the autonomous editorial 
policy of the Defense Ministry. 
  [Susa] Since FERAL is very critical of the government, it is 
considered state enemy number one by some Croatian state media. 
Do you approve of this? 
  [Lucic] I think that since Ivancic has been drafted, we 
should no longer be considered a state enemy. Apparently, FERAL 
employees are the key people who will finish the war in Bosnia 
to Croatia's benefit. From this moment on, we are thinking only 
about the war. I am joking. We have always been against 
interfering in the internal affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
it seems that we are paying for it now. FERAL has followed a 
long and thorny path, from winning Croatia's highest 
journalistic award to becoming an enemy of the state. However, I 
do think that this is normal, considering who is in power today. 
If you are half-way normal, you have to oppose them. FERAL will 
remain, and despite everything, respond to the authorities in 
its own style. We will see who will outlast whom. 
  [Susa] Do you approve of FERAL being sold together with the 
Belgrade VREME in Ljubljana kiosks? 
  [Lucic] Not as much as before. In my view, they have lost 
credibility since they published Arkan's advertisement. FERAL 
would never publish a party's advertisement for any money. 
However, VREME is still, without doubt, by far the best Serbian 
paper. After all, its editor, Petar Lukovic, writes regularly 
for FERAL. 
  [Susa] What would you wish for FERAL in the new year? 
  [Lucic] Fewer of our staff being drafted and more good and 
witty texts, more moderate than mostly cloudy weather. My 
message to Slovenes: "Long live Janez Jansa!"

Article Type:CSO 

<F P=106> [Article by Ivana Anojcic: "Who Proclaims a State of </F>
Emergency?"] 
  [Text] One of the most frequent topics in recent days has 
been whether a state of emergency will be declared in Serbia or 
not. There is talk about the arguments for and against, but 
least frequently of all about whether and how it is possible to 
accomplish it legally. That is why we talked about this with 
Aleksandar Simic, a member of the Republic Electoral Commission 
(in its expanded form). 
  He believes that a state of emergency will not be declared 
because he thinks that there is a sufficient amount of reason 
and also that a state of emergency is not the way out. That 
would be tragic as the finale of the effort to pursue the 
Serbian nationality question at the global international level, 
he explains, adding that the principal political figures in 
Serbia have displayed a great deal of arbitrariness in 
decisionmaking, so that even this possibility must be reckoned 
with; in his opinion, it would be done through the federal state. 
  Simic also explains all the obstacles to instituting a state 
of emergency because the federal and republic constitutions are 
not in harmony. The model for the 1990 Serbian Constitution was 
the Constitution of the Fifth Republic in France, which was 
tailored to suit De Gaulle and afford strong presidential power. 
That was also what was desired here after the crisis in Kosovo. 
  The president's greatest two powers are contained in Article 
83: to proclaim an immediate danger of war and to declare a 
state of war and state of emergency. The first two possibilities 
are an option if the Assembly does not meet, but the president 
of the republic may declare a state of emergency without the 
Assembly, but on the recommendation of the government. Under the 
Constitution, a state of emergency may be instituted for only a 
portion of the territory, and when it is declared, the president 
may also issue the relevant enactments. Simic emphasizes that 
the state of emergency is always associated with a portion of 
the territory. 
<H5>  Jurisdictional Conflicts </H5>
  The state of emergency should actually be regulated by the 
federal Constitution, which requires that the highest legal 
enactment of the republic be brought into conformity with it. 
However, the federal Constitution was adopted in April 1992 and 
was modeled on Germany's Constitution, with strong powers for 
the government. Article 99 provides that when the Federal 
Assembly is unable to meet, the federal government, after it has 
heard the opinion of the president of the republic and the 
presidents of the chambers of the Assembly, proclaims the 
immediate danger of war, a state of war, or a state of emergency. 
  "That is the situation at the moment," Simic says, "because 
since the Serbian Assembly was dissolved, there is no Chamber of 
Republics in the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Assembly. 
The greatest paradox is that the federal Constitution allows the 
mandate of deputies in the Chamber of Republics to be regulated 
not by the federal Constitution and law, but rather leaves this 
to the member republics of the federation." 
  Simic goes on to say that the federal Law on Defense was 
passed in both chambers of the Assembly, but in different 
versions. The Chamber of Republics accepted the amendments of 
the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro, whereby the 
opinion of the member republic is obtained for institution of a 
state of emergency, and if the Assembly is unable to meet, the 
opinion of the republic government is obtained. The day before 
the Citizens Chamber was to decide on that law, the federal 
government rejected those amendments. Pavle Bulatovic, defense 
minister, presented the reasons for that rejection, and Ratko 
Markovic said that if the Federal Assembly consulted the 
republic assemblies or governments about proclamation of an 
immediate danger of war, state of war, or state of emergency, 
that would amount to instilling a confederal element in federal 
law. Because the law was not passed in the same version in the 
two chambers, a commission was formed to reconcile the versions, 
and it did not complete its work before 22 October because the 
Serbian Assembly was dissolved. Under the federal Constitution, 
the decision in the Citizens Chamber is then applied, which 
means that there are no consultations with republic assemblies, 
according to the interpretation of our informant. 
<H5>  Differing Approaches </H5>
  Article 4 of the law spells it out: When it finds that a 
danger exists or the sovereignty, territory, independence, 
constitutional order, or security of the country are threatened, 
depending on the volume and degree of the danger that is 
imminent or has presented itself, the Federal Assembly shall 
proclaim an immediate danger of war, a state of war, or state of 
emergency. It elaborates even further concerning the state of 
emergency: Should there be internal unrest of sizable 
proportions, so that the country's constitutional order is 
threatened with violence, or when natural or other disasters 
occur and threaten the lives of citizens, their property and 
material goods on a large scale, a state of emergency may be 
instituted. 
  Simic believes that on the basis of that article the federal 
government could institute a state of emergency, also citing 
Article 135 of the republic Constitution, which states that 
Serbia will not respect the SFRY Constitution if it violates 
Serbia's equality or threatens its interests in any other way. 
Because the constitutions have not been brought into conformity, 
this provision might also apply to the present federal 
Constitution.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The 31 December issue of the Belgrade 
weekly NIN in Serbo-Croatian on page 14 carries a report on a 27 
December Belgrade NTV [Independent Television] Studio B program 
that showed exercises by a military police unit of Yugoslav Army 
Special Corps forces. NIN reports that the program showed 
special unit soldiers practicing responding to street 
disturbances and their actions against the demonstrators. NIN 
observes that the television pictures reminded viewers of recent 
unpleasant events in the streets of Belgrade but that this time 
Yugoslav Army soldiers rather than regular policemen clad in 
blue uniforms were involved. The weekly reports that, according 
to the TV program, Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff Momcilo Perisic 
tried to explain the preparation of the special units for 
possible conflict with "their own people" by citing Article 133 
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] Constitution, which 
states that "the FRY has an Army that defends its sovereignty, 
territory, independence, and constitutional order." NIN states 
that Perisic explained the meaning of "constitutional order" by 
criticizing "some parties that understand their role in the 
political life of the country in a distorted way and are trying 
to overthrow the government." 
  The constitutional order of the country cannot be equated 
with the activities of the political parties and their struggles 
for power, NIN remarks, adding that it is the Army's duty to 
defend the constitutional order, which is defined in the FRY 
Constitution by regulations that, for example, refer to 
Yugoslavia as a "sovereign federal state founded on the equality 
of citizens and member republics...." Discussing the high cost 
of financing the Army at the expense of the people, who "are 
literally starving," NIN asks whether the special Army police 
unit will now go on to attack the "hungry and impoverished 
people when they take to the streets to rightly protest the 
situation in which they find themselves without being 
responsible for it."

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The 14 December issue of Belgrade 
POLITIKA in Serbo-Croatian reports on page 16 that Armin Pohara, 
the "military-political adviser" of Cazin Krajina leader Fikret 
Abdic, had stated recently that the ultimate goal of Alija 
Izetbegovic's policy is "to create a new Muslim citizen and a 
new state founded on militant Islam, regardless of how large 
this state might be or where it is situated." Pohara points out 
that one can increasingly find local Muslims who dress and 
behave like mojahedin and find "their image in religious 
fanaticism" and who, in waging war, invoke the name of Allah. 
Pohara warns Europe to concern itself seriously with Muslim 
fundamentalism and the creation of the first Islamic state in 
the heart of Europe. 
  Viewing the repercussions that the creation of a Muslim 
state 
would have on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, POLITIKA 
cites Predrag Simic, director of the International Institute for 
Policy and Trade in Belgrade. Simic judges that the existence of 
such a state would result in permanent military tension in the 
region and that the borders of the newly founded states would 
not be peaceful but increasingly resemble those between Israel 
and its Arab neighbors. Simic believes that the Republic of 
Srpska would suffer most in this situation through retaliatory 
attacks by the Muslim state. He warns that the corridor between 
the Serbian states would become a battleground because the 
Muslims would attempt to break it to gain access to the Sava 
River. It should be expected that an Islamic state, strengthened 
by the support of the Islamic world, would establish links to 
Sandzak, Kosovo, and Macedonia, Simic states, pointing out that 
statistics show that Albanians will become the majority 
population in Macedonia by 2005.

<F P=106> [Article by N. Trklja: "Tarle: For Us, Krajina Is Zanzibar"] </F>
  [Text] What are the chances for 300,000 Serbs expelled from 
Croatia to return to their homes, if there are any chances at 
all? 
  The Association of Refugees and Exiles in Yugoslavia has 
sent 
a letter to United Nations General Secretary Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
in which the refugees and exiles request that he help facilitate 
their return to their homes. Zvonko Tarle, secretary of the 
association, commenting on this new request and on real 
possibilities for such an initiative, points out that dilemmas 
exist concerning the resolution of the refugee problem. Namely, 
the issue of refugees can be resolved by means of so-called 
humanitarian relocation or return of refugees. 
  This association is opposed to the relocation of the 
population and insists on the creation of the conditions for the 
return of the people to their own homes. Tarle says that Serbs 
from Croatian towns do not feel that the republic of Serbian 
Krajina [RSK] is their own mother state, that they did not fight 
for it, and that, on the other hand, Yugoslavia, where they have 
found a temporary residence, does nothing about their return to 
Croatia. 
  "For many Serbs from the cities, Krajina is just like 
Zanzibar. This is understandable, because for someone who had 
lived in Zagreb or Rijeka, Knin or Glina are rather remote. We 
cannot obtain a passport because the authorities send us to the 
RSK offices. Yugoslavia sacrificed 300,000 Serbs from Croatia 
for the legalization of the RSK, and none of us want to live 
there," Tarle says. 
  The return of Serbs to Croatia is an issue of exceptional 
importance because, as Tarle says, Serbs would become 
participants in political life there. "Tudjman wants the Croats 
to return to the RSK. Recently a delegation even went to 
Butrus-Ghali to insist on this, and no one ever mentioned this 
issue to the officials on our behalf," secretary of the 
Association of Refugees and Exiles says. 
  "Refugees from Bosnia have similar problems," Tarle says, 
adding: "These people who fled to Yugoslavia are not army 
deserters. They simply did not want to participate in the bloody 
civil war. At the same time they do not want to join some 
single-nationality state of Karadzic's, they want to return to 
the Bosnia they once knew and in which they lived. The majority 
of refugees from Croatia, about 80 percent, came with the first 
wave in 1991. Many got used to life here, but they want to be 
able to travel to Croatia and want arrangements for their return 
to be made. We do not have specific data on the number of 
refugees who wish to return to their homes, but we have 
conducted polls which indicate that the majority favor such an 
option." 
  "For example, all 7,000 exiles from Dubrovnik wish to return 
there, and it is the same with the 10,000 Serbs from Rijeka, and 
at least 60 percent of the 30,000 Serbs from Osijek want to 
return to their homes," Zvonko Tarle points out. 
  "Certain differences exist among the refugees from Croatia. 
Refugees of the former Yugoslav Army officer type who lived 
there for 10 to 15 years should be distinguished from the Serbs 
whose families had lived there for 200 to 300 years and whose 
roots are there," Tarle says. 
  Zvonko Tarle warns that the Croatian assembly will soon, 
maybe even today, pass the law on the expropriation of the 
property of people who fled. Thus, the property of all the Serbs 
who left Croatia will actually be taken away. Even before this 
law, the practice of transforming the Serbian people into a 
minority had been underway in Croatia. Namely, if a Serb in 
Croatia obtains citizenship papers he becomes a citizen of that 
state and his status, instead of that of a people, becomes that 
of an ethnic minority. "All of this is well-known," Tarle says, 
"but Yugoslavia up to now did not insist on these issues 
anywhere in the world and did not do anything in order to 
protect the rights of Serbs in Croatia. This is how it was also 
in Slovenia. Yugoslavia did not show by any gesture that it was 
interested in its citizens and their property, and former Prime 
Minister Panic even recognized Slovenia," Tarle says. 
  Answering the question whether it is not too early to speak 
about a return to Croatia while the war is still going on and in 
circumstances when Serbian churches, like the one in Karlovac, 
continue to be demolished, Tarle says that the association does 
not support the return of refugees and exiles but the creation 
of conditions for their return. In his opinion, there will be no 
final peace in this territory as long as all the Serbs do not 
return to Croatia and the Croats to the republic of Srpska. He 
believes that the most recent explosion and destruction of the 
church in Karlovac was not an act of the Croatian Government but 
of Croatian extremists. "Such acts are not in the interest of 
the government there, and it condemns them. Even Cardinal 
Kuharic, who recently invited Serbian priests to return to 
Croatia, condemned such an act of vandalism. Metropolitan Jovan 
remains in Ljubljana and is not even thinking of going to 
Zagreb, although I think that he would be safe in Zagreb, and 
the people there would protect him with even tanks if that were 
necessary," Tarle say.

<F P=106> [Interview with Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov by Dragan </F>
Jovanovic; place and date not given: "We Are All Captives"] 
  [Text] For Macedonians, Kiro Gligorov has already become 
more than the head of the Macedonian state. He has made his 
place in Macedonian history as the statesman who finally 
accomplished what Goce Delcev [Macedonian politician in 19th 
century, founder of the terrorist Internal Macedonian 
Revolutionary Organization that fought against Ottoman 
authority, and for Macedonian autonomy within a Balkan 
confederation] had dreamt of. Everybody will tell you so, the 
Macedonian intellectuals, classic and alternative, as well as 
the opposition leaders, and the so-called ordinary citizens. 
"May our state live as long as possible," is what everybody 
says, a peasant women from a village in Galicani, as well as a 
clerk from Skopje. President Gligorov is not only in the pink 
of health, but he is also the statesman of the country in which 
one shoots only on the New Year's eve and when hunting ducks om 
Lake Ohrid. Gligorov acknowledges that NIN is an old friend of 
his. 
  Having heard that I am going to interview Gligorov, 
economist 
Dr. Ljubomir Madzar tells me in NIN's editorial office: "If 
there is any wise politician in the Balkans, then it is Kiro 
Gligorov." 
  [Jovanovic] I listened to your New Year expose in 
parliament, when you made a concise assessment of everything 
that happened in the last three years, particularly in 1993. 
Did you forget to say something in that general address to the 
Macedonian Parliament and public? 
  [Gligorov] I certainly missed many things, keeping in mind 
that the expose must not be too long, but rather sufficient to 
comprise some of the most important things that had happened. 
Still, I certainly did omit some things: First of all, I spoke 
little about the events taking place north of Macedonia, about 
the war that is still going on, and the peace prospects. I 
deliberately skipped that topic in my expose, because, right 
now, it is really difficult to say anything in that respect. In 
certain moments it seems to me that so much blood has already 
been shed, that the economic position is so bad, so that the 
logical conclusion should be the imminent end of the war. 
  However, one has to take into consideration the fact that, 
unfortunately, a readiness for further conflicts and the 
prolongation of the war also exists. I am not sure that, after 
everything that has happened in Sarajevo recently, the war might 
not perhaps accelerate. That is what I am afraid of. Any war 
has its end, but it is sad when one sees what is happening day 
after day, how many victims the war has already claimed, all the 
devastation, and so forth. As though everybody is certain that 
the war will end only when virtually everything that was built 
over decades is in ruins. That is something that cannot but be 
our concern as well. Not only because the war, as long as it 
lasts, can always spread to the surrounding regions and states. 
We in Macedonia cannot be at ease, because some of our 
perspects for a stronger, more rapid development cannot be 
expected while the war is still raging in former Yugoslavia. We 
are all captives of that situation. We are all hampered in a 
way, in the situation of closed borders, barriers, hate, and so 
forth. 
  I did not state it in my expose, but I think it is important 
that, among the Macedonian people, no hate toward the neighbors, 
or toward all other peoples with whom we lived, or are still 
living -- in the Balkans -- has been created. I think that is 
very important. Perhaps, we shall further suffer the 
consequences of the sanctions, closed borders, and so forth, 
yet, one day when everything comes to an end, we shall be able 
to communicate with all the peoples around us without a twinge 
of conscience that we hated them, or caused some conflicts. I 
think that nobody will be able to say that our behavior was a 
contribution to the war becoming even more severe. I think that 
is very important. And if there is anything I am satisfied 
about, it is exactly that: The Macedonian people has been 
looking at the conflict around us with a feeling of sorrow that 
something like that is happening, and that we are incapable of 
doing anything to make the war stop, or at least to prevent its 
continuation. On our part there has been no malice, nor has 
there been any sort of warmongering, but there has rather been 
the dominant desire not to spoil the relations we developed over 
decades while we were living together. Also, we have never 
shown a trace of malice toward the neighbor-countries with which 
we have never lived in a union, but with which, right now, in 
these circumstances, we are communicating much better in terms 
of economy, culture, and such things, because we are facing a 
time that demands open borders. 
  Tomorrow, when all this comes to an end, we shall be able 
to offer a hand to each party with all our hearts, and to take 
part in the collective efforts to stop the Balkans being a blind 
alley of Europe, to make Europe stop treating it as a 
destructive virus, like something that constantly causes new 
problems. I think I probably did not say enough in my expose, 
that the further destiny of the Balkans will depend, above all, 
on whether democracy will definitely win in each of the Balkan 
countries, whether the conditions will be created for a 
development that would rest upon democratic institutions. I do 
not have any illusions about it, I do not think that it will 
happen tomorrow, or that such a process may be accomplished 
overnight. 
  [Jovanovic] What is your estimate of when such a process 
will be finished -- in two, three, five years? 
  [Gligorov] Well, I think that two election periods are 
inevitable, yet it is difficult to say how long it will take for 
each of the Balkan countries to accomplish that. Because, the 
conditions are different from country to country, but 
unfortunately, the longer the war is, the worse effects it will 
have on those democratic processes. Still, I believe that if 
democracy wins in each of the Balkan countries after the war, it 
will also mean the victory of the orientation toward the market 
economy, which is supposed to have its own social 
characteristics, and, on the other hand, also the ecological 
characteristics, which are very important for the future. 
  [Jovanovic] I am quite pleased with your being the first to 
mention the importance of ecology.... 
  [Gligorov] If they were to find a place for those elements 
in the economy, I think that would be a more painless way for 
the Balkans to prepare itself to enter Europe. In that respect, 
one needs time, one needs certain phases in the development of 
the political and economic systems. All other elements are 
quite favorable for the Balkans, which has many things to offer 
in terms of culture and the level of civilization, and to 
contribute to the enrichment of the European cultural scene. In 
addition, one must create a political atmosphere in which all 
conflicts and disputes will be settled by political means, in 
democratic ways, because conflicts are still an inevitable 
thing. One cannot suddenly come into a conflict-free state from 
such a conflict-ridden situation, where a war is in full swing. 
Conflicts will continue, but what makes the difference is the 
means that will be implemented for the settlement of those 
conflicts. 
  [Jovanovic] Since you again mention the war and conflicts, 
and your fear of the deterioration of the war in Bosnia, how do 
you comment on the famous CIA report, that was denied in the 
meantime? According to the report, Slobodan Milosevic is the 
only leader in Serbia who is worth talking to. The report 
states the possibility of the war spreading to Kosovo. True, 
Macedonia is not mentioned, but it says "even further to south." 
  [Gligorov] I do not believe in the authenticity of that 
report. It has already been denied two or three times in 
different ways. By itself that report is of no interest to me, 
but what I am suspicious about is the rationale of that report. 
If we view the United States as the only global strategic 
force, then America can only have an interest in the prevention 
of the further spread of conflicts in the Balkans. The spread 
of the war that is now going on to the north of Macedonia, 
sooner or later, means the involvement of two NATO member 
countries, that is Greece and Turkey. If the war were to spread 
to Kosovo and Macedonia, then it would be a scenario remembered 
from the not-so-distant history: The Balkan Wars. I do not see 
any interest of the United States in such a war, because it 
would shake NATO quite badly, and cause much deeper 
repercussions in Europe, in contrast with the current war, which 
shakes not only Europe but the whole world, but which, however, 
has its own limitations. It is still a war in one enclave, it 
cannot generate European consequences in the sense of its 
spreading out of the Balkans. However, a war in which Greece, 
Bulgaria, Serbia, Albania, and later Turkey were to take part, 
would have much more far-reaching consequences, and that is the 
sense in which the presence of the U.S. troops here, in 
Macedonia, is interpreted, as well as support for the prevention 
of the spreading of the war. 
  [Jovanovic] The following question must be boring for you, 
still, when we talk about the Americans, on one hand we have 
their military presence in Macedonia, which is at this moment 
quite productive, regardless of which angle we view things from, 
that is, from which neighboring country's point of view. On the 
other hand, the United States has not yet recognized the 
Republic of Macedonia. What do you think the United States is 
waiting for? Is it only the pressure exerted by the powerful 
Greek lobby, or is something else the matter? 
  [Gligorov] In that respect, the position of the United 
States is quite complex, or better to say delicate. Because 
Greece is a NATO member-country, and a U.S. ally. On the other 
hand, it is obvious from its behavior, that the United States is 
aware of the fact that Macedonia is the factor of stability in 
the south of the Balkans, which is evidenced by Macedonia's 
behavior in general, the way in which it became independent, how 
it arranges interethnic relations, what its attitude toward the 
neighbors is like, what its attitude toward the European policy 
is like, and so forth. For that reason, the United States 
helped us in certain situations, they sponsored our admittance 
to the United Nations. So, one can say that the United States is 
in a very delicate position, and it is probably relying on time 
to solve certain things. I do not think there is any other 
reason, any other combination that is behind the United States' 
reluctance to recognize Macedonia. 
  [Jovanovic] Nevertheless, that is something that not only 
the Serbian regime, but also the Serbian opposition, are 
manipulating with. It is claimed the United States wants to 
rule from Macedonia. 
  [Gligorov] Why would the United States rule from Macedonia, 
and what for? If that was the case, a much greater number of 
U.S. troops would be stationed here, rather than a symbolic 
number of troops. And their number is symbolic only to add 
political weight to their presence. 
  [Jovanovic] Is the initiative for Macedonia's admittance 
into NATO, which has already been endorsed in parliament, 
precisely on the same path -- that the Republic of Macedonia 
should provide itself with political integrity on one hand, 
while on the other hand with sovereignty? 
  [Gligorov] Security is built, above all, through membership 
in the United Nations.... Each UN member-country is provided 
with some general security, because its membership gives it the 
possibility to count on the protection of the United Nations. 
Second, security is also built through membership in the CSCE. 
We have not yet managed to become a member of the CSCE, because 
Greece opposes that, but Macedonia has been admitted as an 
observer. Third, in terms of security, the two opposing 
alliances, that is the Warsaw Pact, and NATO, no longer exist. 
So today, after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, the only 
collective factor of security is NATO. And seen politically, 
our orientation is the European option, that we, in 12, or 15 
years, gradually, by phases, enter the European Union. I believe 
it will be the orientation of all Balkan countries. On the 
other hand, the European Union and NATO are quite compatible 
institutions, although they are separate, and have distinct 
tasks. Now, our parliament's decision does not mean that 
Macedonia will become a NATO member-country tomorrow. It is 
more an expression of our determination, a declaration. We know 
that, regardless of our aspirations, we cannot be instantly 
admitted into NATO. 
  [Jovanovic] At this moment, the reasons for Greece opposing 
the recognition of Macedonia are generally known. However, much 
more interesting and unclear are the reasons why Serbia, that is 
the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], has not recognized 
Macedonia yet. Would you, please, comment on the latest 
provocative statements by Mihajlo Markovic from the Socialist 
Party of Serbia, saying that "Serbia knows how to make Macedonia 
join Serbia, that is Yugoslavia?" 
  [Gligorov] I would not comment on any of those statements. 
I would rather express a feeling: Objectively seen, Serbia and 
the FRY have absolutely no reasons not to recognize Macedonia, 
and vice versa, Macedonia has no reasons not to recognize the 
FRY, and there are no reasons for those acts not to be done 
simultaneously. The FRY did that in the case of Slovenia, but 
the other side showed no readiness to do the same. It is not my 
job to assess what the FRY's interests are.... Considering the 
situation not only as a statesman, but also as a man, I think 
that the recognition of Macedonia by the FRY at this moment, and 
the recognition of the FRY by Macedonia, would be quite helpful, 
first of all to the FRY. That would definitely show that the 
charges accusing Serbia of preparing to spread the war to the 
south, or to ignite a war in Kosovo, are not correct. The 
credibility of the peace option that is supported by Milosevic 
now, who is stating everywhere that Serbia wants peace, and that 
it will do anything for peace, would increase considerably. The 
recognition of the Republic of Macedonia would be a right move 
that would strongly boost the credibility of Yugoslavia. 
  [Jovanovic] And, why do you think Milosevic is not making 
such a move? 
  [Gligorov] Probably because of the relations with Greece. 
Second, the current period of political life in Serbia makes it 
clear to us that there are forces in Serbia that are against the 
recognition of Macedonia. 
  [Jovanovic] Who do you think has a firmer attitude toward 
Macedonia: the opposition or Milosevic? 
  [Gligorov] It is hard to say now, in the time following the 
elections. Many things were said in extreme excitement.... We 
have slid back into history too much, we are giving too much 
significance to what happened in the Balkan wars, going as far 
back as to the battle of Kosovo [14th century]. Naturally, in 
such an atmosphere, ghosts that we thought had vanished are 
reviving. For all time, in 45 years of shared life, I had the 
impression that the great majority of Serbs, holding almost 
inconsiderably different views, accepted and experienced that 
we, the Macedonians, are a different people, and that they 
accepted Macedonia as a republic, as a state according to the 
Constitution of former Yugoslavia. Now, some ghosts of the past 
are reviving.... 
  [Jovanovic] Not only that, but also some ideas about the 
Balkan Orthodox confederation, and the Pan-Slav empire.... 
  [Gligorov] I am expressing in advance my doubts in all the 
alliances that are founded on religious or ethnic bases. Such 
alliances existed in the last two or three centuries, and we 
know how they ended up! The foundation of an alliance on an 
ethnic or religious basis will bring about a new division of 
Europe, and a new division of the Balkans, and, in such 
circumstances, the Balkans will suffer most. And therefore I 
think that, basically, one should support the general course of 
Yeltsin toward the Europeanization of Russia, aiming at Russia's 
becoming a part of the European family. Europe will continue to 
live as a Europe comprising many nations, and many different 
religions. 
  [Jovanovic] You mean the Europe according to the formula of 
Goce Delcev? 
  [Gligorov] Yes. He said, such a long time ago, that he saw 
and understood the world as a community of different peoples 
that were competing with one another on the cultural plane. 
  [Jovanovic] That is actually the project of the European 
Union.... 
  [Gligorov] That is right. The project is about the creation 
of a common civilization in which no country will lose its 
individuality, its identity, and every each of them will 
contribute to the common cultural treasure. The Balkans has 
many things to say in that respect. 
  [Jovanovic] Let us go back to the relations with Serbia: 
Are there indications that something is changing in those 
relations? Was there any half-secret, or secret meeting between 
you and Milosevic? 
  [Gligorov] No, after the meeting in Ohrid we have not met. 
  [Jovanovic] Are there indications, or initiatives for a new 
meeting? 
  [Gligorov] No. Neither secret, nor public initiatives. 
  [Jovanovic] It is claimed that one of the reasons for a firm 
Serbian attitude toward Macedonia is an unfavorable status of 
Serbs in Macedonia. I see that the Macedonian Parliament has 
adopted a document, the so-called "Memorandum of Understanding." 
What is the essence of that document? 
  [Gligorov] That is a good document. In fact, it conveys and 
accepts everything that, in European documents, refers to the 
rights of different nationalities, national minorities, and so 
forth. As for the real situation, look, you are staying here, 
and you see that, in our society, no nationality, including the 
Serbian, has been treated badly. On the contrary. Look at the 
TV news, theater, film, you can see everywhere people with 
Serbian family names. In Macedonia that is a normal thing. 
Even when the Yugoslav People's Army [YNA] left Macedonia, we 
held on to that principle. And that principle says that 
everybody who wants to stay here, can stay. I would be 
satisfied if such a document, regarding the rights of 
Macedonians in Serbia, was adopted in Serbia. 
  [Jovanovic] Let us move to the Macedonian program of 
economic stabilization.... 
  [Gligorov] Our program of stabilization is something neither 
new, nor unknown, nor original. First of all, if one accepts 
the market economy, then several things are to be observed. 
Firstly, property. Secondly, the market. Thirdly, opening up 
to foreign countries. The market must not be introverted. 
Money must not be issued without any control, and not to 
mention the use of that money to cover the budget, or 
investments. 
  [Jovanovic] Which is in some countries the strategic 
policy.... 
  [Gligorov] Some things are known, and they just need to be 
implemented. In such circumstances, the restrictive program 
like ours carries a great risk in itself. That must be said. 
However, any postponement in the name of our more easily 
accomplishing the goal later is a delusion. We know that from 
the experience of former Yugoslavia -- the reform would have 
been most easily accomplished in 1965. So, one ought to start 
radical changes as soon as possible, given the support of the 
international financial institutions: the IMF, the World Bank, 
the London Bank for Cooperation with Eastern Countries, the 
European Community. Without it, the task would be extremely 
difficult, and it would go beyond the limit of social endurance, 
and one has to take into account that limit as well. 
  [Jovanovic] You have mentioned the danger of the transfer of 
the so-called filthy technologies. 
  [Gligorov] The transfer of filthy technologies reflects the 
attempts of many countries, which is happening right now, to 
more easily surmount the problems of development, and that is 
the line of least resistance. 
  For the time being, we can hardly expect that foreign 
capital 
will suddenly start flowing into Macedonia, and that, regardless 
of the aid for development, it will be flowing in through the 
pipes of the international financial institutions, the World 
Bank, the World Financial Corporation, the Agency for 
Development, and other banks. No project will be accepted 
without our consent. For that reason, the country should be 
organized in such a way that the people must not forget the 
ecological factor. Given that awareness, nobody would be able 
to sell us some filthy technologies. All institutions that are 
engaged in ecology, above all the movement for ecology, should 
organize themselves, and get involved in choosing and approving 
the projects, so that the destiny of some underdeveloped 
countries that lacked experience and caution does not 
necessarily have to fall upon Macedonia. 
  [Jovanovic] At the end. What was the hardest time for you 
in these three years, and what were the happiest moments, when 
you felt most satisfied? 
  [Gligorov] There were two hardest moments. First of all, 
the moment when the YNA was supposed to leave Macedonia -- the 
uncertainty whether we would accomplish an honest agreement, 
which would be a good capital for the future, or whether it 
would come to a conflict. At the time, the danger existed that, 
in such an atmosphere, a wrong move could be made, either on the 
part of the YNA, or on somebody else's part, for instance, 
somebody could have tried to surround a garrison, or to provoke 
some army units. That was a very tense atmosphere, particularly 
when the first metal coffins started arriving from the north, 
being the aftermath of the initial skirmishes and clashes. 
Somehow it happened that those first victims were Macedonians. 
In a very short time, 43 soldiers were killed. We had to use 
all means to prevent getting involved in the war. 
  The second moment was the Lisbon declaration, when it looked 
as if our fate had been sealed by the decision of the group of 
12 in Lisbon: The European Community would recognize Macedonia 
as a state only if it were to eliminate the word "Macedonia" 
from its name.... That could have also generated some unpleasant 
and dangerous events, which could have spread as well, 
eventually. That was also a dramatic moment that lasted about 
six months. In that period, we were politically and 
diplomatically isolated, we were not able to explain our 
political position. However, everything was settled at the 
meeting in Edinburgh six months later, in December 1992. 
  [Jovanovic] And when did you feel most satisfied? 
  [Gligorov] Well, that is certainly the long-awaited moment 
of Macedonia's admittance into the United Nations. That was a 
tough process, although everybody knew we met all the 
conditions, which was also unambiguously confirmed by the 
Badenter arbitrating commission, underlining certain qualities 
that ranked us first, ahead of Slovenia. And despite 
everything, we were supposed to wait until April 1993, while, 
let me remind you, Badenter's report had been submitted on 15 
January 1991. The admittance to the United Nations is an event 
that not only pleased me most, but also relieved me in a way.

<F P=106> [Article by Lumturie Ibraimi: "Trade Put to the Test -- the </F>
Police in the Role of Customs Officers"] 
  [Excerpts] The embargo against Serbia is setting up 
obstacles for Macedonian citizens who import various articles 
from Turkey. A while back, there was a disagreement at the 
Turkish border. The Turkish border organs would not allow 
Macedonian citizens to export goods from Turkey, saying that 
they would be going to Serbia, since they identified Macedonia 
with Serbia. For 24 hours, the border guards held the Macedonian 
citizens at the border, until they received an order from the 
Turkish Government that they would be allowed to export. For 
this reason and for many other reasons, importers of various 
articles are experiencing many other difficulties, especially 
with the Macedonian police who, after the border control, stop 
the merchants and carry out unnecessary inspections, despite the 
fact that they have all the necessary documents. We are 
presenting the opinions of some merchants on this matter: Etem 
Billali said: "The irregular status of Macedonia has caused us 
serious problems with the Turkish border organs. Likewise, the 
unnecessary inspection by the Macedonian police and the 
mistreatment which we endure en route are just too much. We do 
not get any better treatment at the Skopje customs office. The 
customs fees are astronomical and they have no relation to the 
purchase price of the articles. The customs fees force us to 
increase the price of the articles." Musa Lamallari and Adnan 
Aliu said: "To tell the truth, this is a hard job. The 
mistreatment which we suffer until the goods reach the market 
will cause us to abandon this activity and to seek some other 
solution. The embargo against Serbia, which has a considerable 
effect on us (the citizens of Macedonia), the fear of traveling 
by night through Bulgaria, the mistreatment at the border and at 
the Skopje customs office are enough to make us give up all of 
this, which is the source of our existence." [passage omitted] 
  Extensive inspections by the police are also being carried 
out in Bit Pazar. Persons who do not have the necessary 
documentation for selling goods on the market have to undergo 
these inspections. Bejtulla Bajrami told us that, a few months 
ago, he had to turn over 1,300 pairs of socks, confiscated by 
the police, although he had already paid the customs fees for 
them. The matter went to court and the outcome is not known. The 
general impression remains that the embargo against Serbia and 
customs problems are two main obstacles to the normal 
development of trade in Macedonia.

<F P=106> [Article by Endre Babus: "Prime-Ministerial Election; A Man </F>
From Afar"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Peter Boross was born in 1928 
in Nagybajom in Somogy county. Between the ages of 10 and 17, he 
was educated in the Koszeg military academy. The strict 
discipline of the school left a deep impression on him, as he 
said in a later interview. After his graduation from the 
Budapest law school (1951) he wanted to become an attorney, but 
because "in the 1950's I was not a good enough cadre to do so," 
he found a position at the finance department of the Budapest 
city council. He was discharged from that position in 1957, 
according to his curriculum vitae, because in 1956 he joined the 
revolutionary council of the intelligentsia. While he was under 
police surveillance between 1957 and 1959, he worked as a food 
service inspector, restaurant manager, and finally as a 
traveling picture salesman. In the next half decade, he was 
assistant manager, and then from 1965, for a quarter of a 
century, he was at the head of the South-Pest Food Service 
Company (DVV) as deputy director, and later as director. 
[passage omitted] 
  Once, to a journalist's question whether as director he was 
able to remain "untouched," because internal counterintelligence 
had a predilection for infiltrating the food service industry, 
his reply was "yes," but he added: "As far as I was able to have 
an insight into this activity, an interest of this sort was not 
directed at the world of food service and the economy." 
  Before his retirement his company established two 
foundations. DVV created the Unity Foundation with a capital of 
1,000,000 forints [Ft], primarily in order that the company's 
employees would "rescue" the firm's property, namely that they 
would be able to buy inns, cafes, and restaurants through the 
Gastorg company, which was later established by the foundation. 
A portion of the stocks of the Budapest catering establishments 
given to Gastorg (for instance, the Hid and Attila restaurants, 
the Torony restaurant, and the cafe Medikus) became the property 
of Unity. Another packet of the stocks was given to the Country 
Builder Foundation, founded by DVV in 1988 (at one time, Jozsef 
Antall and Arpad Goncz were also on its board of directors), 
established to preserve the spiritual inheritance of Karoly Kos. 
Up to this day, the president of the board of directors of the 
Country Builder Foundation is still Peter Boross (HETI 
VILAGGAZDASAG, 8 May 1993). 
  When in May 1990 Prime Minister Jozsef Antall summoned him 
to 
the parliament, Boross thought of playing a role for at most two 
years as a retired counselor. However, he first became political 
under secretary, and later minister without portfolio. His task 
was to establish the loyalty of counterintelligence and 
intelligence. His statements after the blockade by the taxi 
drivers suggest that he belonged to the hardliners. "A legal 
crime was committed.... Of course one had to take into account 
the kind of reaction an attack by the police would have elicited 
in a yet unformed democracy of only five months. Let us not 
forget that this took place a few days before our admittance to 
the European Council," he offered a glimpse into the 
government's cards in December 1990 on the pages of PESTI HIRLAP. 
  After the discharge of Balazs Horvath, after 21 December 
1990, he became interior minister, and as such, deputy prime 
minister in the prime minister's absence. In the first year he 
was less visible, but after 1992--in August of that year he 
joined the Hungarian Democratic Forum--he increasingly became 
the strong man in the cabinet. He does not have many ties to the 
1989 negotiated revolution and its participants. If there is a 
person in the cabinet who is in favor of order, he is the one. 
Once he explained that it caused a lot of problems that the 
majority principle could not prevail in cardinal issues, due to 
the two-thirds laws. He also criticized the law on legislation, 
because it accorded too much power to parliament and thereby 
slowed decisions down and made them sluggish. "My favorite 
predecessor, Ferenc Keresztes-Fischer, who was in power during 
the time of Horthy, issued an executive order to solve several 
problems for which today I need a two-thirds majority. He was 
able to achieve his goal in two months, while I need 
one-and-a-half or two years," he said to PESTI HIRLAP in 
December 1992. 
  In August 1993, when Jozsef Antall's illness became more 
serious, he announced that he considered a transitional period 
of at least 10 years necessary, characterized by a much stronger 
executive power than the present one. "I am not the one saying 
this," he emphasized another time, "but according to many 
people... it is sometimes a mistake to be so constitutional." At 
the beginning of 1993 he greeted with approval the "message" of 
the conference on public administration, namely that present-day 
modern states are being dismantled from above by international 
treaties, from below by local governments, and from the inside 
by trade unions. With reference to the interest of citizens he 
declared: The spread of crime, the prevention of an increase in 
environmental pollution, and the implementation of social 
policies presupposes a strong state. 
  Although Boross, just like Jozsef Antall, has been for years 
among the leadership of the Hungarian League on Human Rights, he 
has a serious aversion to absolutizing freedoms. "After 
individual values came to the front, Europe is now realizing 
that it has gone too far.... Personal freedom is valuable only 
as long as it does not entail the risk that someone could knock 
me on the head in the street any time," he explained to 
NEPSZABADSAG in his typical pragmatic way in August. 
  For a long time, his political ideas were remarkably close 
to 
Istvan Csurka's right-wing radicalism. He made negative 
statements about the opposition. The opposition had no ideals, 
he explained once. He had ideals: Unlike his "boss," he went to 
Kenderes to the funeral of Governor Miklos Horthy. In his 
assessment, in earlier periods of Hungarian parliamentarism the 
attacks were more open and direct, that is to say, they had a 
more "Hungarian" character. In some respects Hungary was in a 
more difficult situation than Germany was after the world war, 
he said in September 1992, because in Hungary the transition 
took place peacefully. In Hungary, the spirit of the preceding 
dictatorship has not been totally eradicated, he lamented. 
  On 23 October 1992, Boross at last endeared himself to 
right-wing radicals. He urged Nurnberg-style trials to avenge 
unpunished crimes. Still unclear is his role in the incident on 
Kossuth square on the same day, when President Arpad Goncz, 
freedom fighter of 1956, was prevented from delivering his 
official address in part by youngsters bearing fascist insignia. 
Because of this incident, a few days later in parliament the 
Smallholder Representative Sandor Olah urged the interior 
minister to resign. Instead of doing so, the interior minister 
indirectly blamed the president for failing to deliver his 
speech amid jeers. 
  About Istvan Csurka, whom he called his friend in the fall 
of 
1992, Boross allowed himself a few critical remarks only six 
months later. However, at the time when the prime minister's 
condition deteriorated, the criticism was mixed with a certain 
amount of glorification. "Istvan Csurka's role was perhaps the 
most significant in the period of dismantling the old regime. 
One must not forget that. Just as Garibaldi's role in the period 
of Risorgimento [revival, in Italian]. Then followed 
the period of governing, and Cavour, who knew that registrar's 
offices had to be established, systems of taxation had to be 
introduced, and then one did not know what to do with 
Garibaldi.... There are individuals who are suitable to lead in 
certain historical situations, but are just about useless in a 
consolidated historical situation," he brooded again in PESTI 
HIRLAP in September 1993. 
  In the meantime, newer elements of his world view became 
known. He declared that sooner or later the church must achieve 
a proportion of 20 percent in education instead of the current 1 
percent, because this was the only way it could have an effect 
on Hungarian public opinion. As early as April 1993 he took 
steps against the direct broadcasting of parliamentary sessions 
on television. Instead, he proposed launching an "objective 
daily summary." Ever since then, he has been devoting special 
attention to the public media. During Boross's temporary "prime 
ministership" at the time of Jozsef Antall's medical treatment 
in Koln, the radical right wing implemented a takeover of the 
state-run radio and television. Subsequently at a forum in 
Veszprem he announced that "healthy country kids" were needed on 
radio and television who spoke a more beautiful Hungarian. 
  The countryside-Budapest opposition has appeared in his 
speeches before. "I have been living in Budapest since 1947, but 
I have never become a real resident of Budapest. There is a 
certain Budapest trait I don't like; arguing in cafes is not a 
pasttime I find attractive." [passage omitted]

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The 21 December issue of the Zagreb 
weekly DANAS in Serbo-Croatian on page 4, commenting on the 
recent murder of 12 Croats in Algeria by Muslim fundamentalists, 
states that the murder directed world attention to Algeria as a 
new focus of international terrorism. DANAS notes that the 
murder of Croats in Algeria is closely linked to the war in 
Bosnia, adding that the Croats were murdered "because the 
Islamic integrationists have been expanding all over the world, 
and, it seems, have linked the Croats, just as the Serbs, to the 
suffering and slaughter of brother Muslims in Bosnia." DANAS 
claims that Bosnian Presidency Vice President Ejup Ganic, "the 
greatest integrationist and Croat-hater among the Bosnian Muslim 
leaders," had recently visited Algeria and, earlier, Libya, 
adding that it is known that a large number of Algerian 
mojahedin have been fighting on the side of the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. "The West will perhaps now understand the 
danger of creating an Islamic state in Bosnia, in which radical 
and extremists leaders would prevail," DANAS concludes.

<F P=106> [lnterview with Josip Jakovcic, Karlovac parish priest, by </F>
Ratko Peter: "An Enemy Did This"] 
  [Excerpts] [Jakovcic] What took place, according to police 
reports, at 0418 on Christmas morning was a criminal and 
political act. This building is in the center of Karlovac, it is 
the property of the Serb Orthodox Eparchy, but it is also part 
of the city. Regardless of who the perpetrator was, which is 
still not known, this act did not benefit Croatia, quite the 
contrary. These people are the enemies of our country. 
  Everything happened at a time of intensive talks with local 
Serbs, during the peace initiative of President Tudjman, on the 
greatest Catholic holiday, a time for peace, love, unity, and 
forgiveness. This was an act which deserves condemnation. Tt did 
not happen when thousands of shells were falling on the city, 
and it should not have happened now either. We presume that it 
was a premeditated act intended to destabilize all of us here. I 
want to stress that it was also an act from which all the 
citizens want to disassociate themselves. 
  [Peter] After this terrorist act, for which there is no 
justification, could you tell us what the current mood in 
Karlovac is? 
  [Jakovcic] Quite a few citizens of Serb nationality left the 
city, and about 6,000 Serbs live in Karlovac today. They live 
and work in a normal way, just like all the other citizens. 
[passage omitted] 
  The burden of Karlovac is about 16,000 exiles, half being 
from Slunj. Recently, Karlovac citizens have been upset by 
Muslims who travel every weekend to Cazinska Krajina across the 
control point in Turanj. UNPROFOR convoys also pass through 
Karlovac, which upsets the citizens. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Radoje Arsenic: "It Was Confirmed That Mercep's </F>
Unit Committed Crime"] 
  [Excerpts] The recently published confidential report of 
the Croatian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MUP) on crimes by 
Mercep's "special purpose" unit, which, judging from everything, 
were committed as a function of the ethnic cleansing of Serbs in 
Croatia, provoked a shock in the ranks of the ruling regime that 
reached its very top leadership. This entire case was given 
official weight in an unusual way by precisely the chief actor 
in the affair--representative in the Assembly's House of 
Zupanijas (House of Parishes) and chief inspector of the 
republic MUP Tomislav Mercep. 
  At the last 1993 meeting of the House of Zupanijas, which 
started yesterday, he asked the government a representative's 
question in which he requested the protection of the legal state 
and the answer to the question "whether the Republic of Croatia 
will undertake measures against the people who betrayed the 
state secret" by publishing the above-mentioned report in GLOBUS 
(about which we have reported in detail). 
<H5>  The Bloody Path of the Criminal Group </H5>
  It is interesting that Mercep did not deny what was written 
in this text. With such a declaration he in fact confirmed the 
authenticity of the MUP report, from the content of which, i.e., 
description of a series of crimes against citizens mostly of 
Serb nationality (along with a few Croats), it directly follows 
that, along with the immediate perpetrators, the war criminal is 
the very same Tomislav Mercep who commanded this unit, the 
purpose of which was obviously liquidation. This fact and the 
bloody path of Mercep and his criminal group from Vukovar, 
across the Pakracka Poljana and Zagreb, to Gospic and back, has 
been known among the Serbs in Croatia for a long time, but his 
crimes (as well as those of other criminals) have been concealed 
from the Croatian public or declared "dirty Serbian propaganda." 
  It is even more interesting that not only Mercep confirmed 
in 
this manner the authenticity of the report on his own crimes; 
its authenticity was also confirmed by Minister of Internal 
Affairs Ivan Jarnjak, himself, responding last night in the 
House of Representatives to the representative's question by 
Franjo Greguric on the same topic. Greguric, namely, was 
interested in the "position of the MUP in connection with the 
accusations presented in the GLOBUS article on human rights 
abuses by Mr. Mercep, assembly representative, and his 
collaborators," as well as "about measures for the protection of 
citizens and their property." 
  Minister Jarnjak immediately answered that, on the occasion 
of this article, "a thorough investigation" had been carried out 
in the MUP, that the above-mentioned confidential report was 
drafted on the basis of "talks with the suspects, i.e., those 
who were interrogated in connection with the tragically killed 
Zec family" (it is symptomatic how persistently he avoids the 
word crime and similar expressions), and that this report was 
drafted "at the request of the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitutional Order" (which at the time was headed by Josip 
Manolic). The report was written in three copies, one was left 
with the Zagreb Police Administration and two were delivered to 
the above-mentioned office (which was the focal point of control 
of all the Croatian intelligence services and police). 
  Jarnjak also said that "according to the statements of 
people 
who were able to obtain the report no one gave the report to 
anyone outside the MUP." [passage omitted] "This material is at 
the attorney general's office. Thus, he should have continued to 
work on this case, and he should have been asked to start the 
entire procedure. When the court establishes the validity of 
this report, then someone can be charged, and the case can be 
made public. I think that the case was not handled in a proper 
manner and that this was ill-intentioned." 
  Let us recall that the state public prosecutor in the last 
year was Stjepan Herceg, who recently submitted his resignation 
without explanation (he did not undertake anything in regard to 
this case, or at least it has not been made known to the 
public), while the four murderers of the Zec family were 
acquitted before the Zagreb court "because of procedural 
errors." It is not hard to conclude what kind of a sign this is 
for the functioning of the "legal state" in relation to the 
members of the Mercep unit. At any rate, today the assembly 
appointed Krunislav Olujic, an HDZ representative from Osijek, 
to the office of the state public prosecutor. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski: "How Many Candidates for </F>
President?"] 
  [Excerpts] There will be many candidates in the 1995 
presidential election campaign. Today, it seems, there are slim 
chances for the parties or political groups to agree on and 
support joint candidates. RZECZPOSPOLITA reporters have asked 
politicians from the PSL [Polish Peasant Party], UD [Democratic 
Union], the PC [Center Accord], and UP [Union of Labor] whether, 
in their opinion, it would be possible for the parties to change 
their minds in that regard, and if the possibility exists, as 
the election draws closer, for eventually having two major 
candidates, one from the right and one from the left. 
  Some of the political parties are faced with a difficult 
decision. For UD, it is whether to put forward Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki, Jacek Kuron, or Hanna Suchocka as its candidate. The 
PSL has to make a choice between Waldemar Pawlak and Jozef Zych. 
The ZChN/PC/PL [Christian-National Union/Center Accord/Peasant 
Accord] coalition is considering nominating Wieslaw Chrzanowski 
[ZChN chairman] or Adam Strzembosz [president of the Supreme 
Court]. These dilemmas may become more obvious closer to the 
election. 
  The SLD [Democratic Left Alliance] candidate will be 
Aleksander Kwasniewski. UP is looking for a person not 
affiliated with any party and also prefers a woman; perhaps it 
will be Ewa Letowska [a former ombudsman]. Other political 
parties also have their candidates. It is not yet known whether 
President Walesa will seek reelection, although many observers 
of the political scene maintain "he has made up his mind to 
run." [passage omitted] 
  Would it be possible, despite everything, to have in the 
presidential election two serious candidates--a candidate of the 
right and a candidate of the left? [The following are responses 
to this question.] 
<H5>  Janusz Piechocinski (PSL) </H5>
  I do not see this as a possible outcome. The presidential 
election plays a significant role in building and popularizing 
the political parties. [passage omitted] I think that there will 
be many candidates in the first round of the election. Every 
important party will see a chance for itself to have its own 
presidential candidate. At this point, the interests of the 
right or the left blocs differ from those of the political 
parties. The access to the media, the possibility to introduce 
the party's program--these are opportunities that are too 
attractive not to take advantage of. I think no division into 
Solidarity and non-Solidarity candidates will be taking place. 
It is rather unthinkable for UD to have a candidate together 
with the right. 
<H5>  Andrzej Celinski (UD) </H5>
  A lot depends on the constitutional provisions in this area. 
If the president is going to be elected by the parliament, 
neither Walesa nor Kwasniewski will run, in my opinion. If the 
president is to be elected in a popular election, two strong 
candidates are a likely possibility. In my view, there is a 
strong possibility that post-Solidarity parties will back the 
same candidate. Then it would be Walesa. I cannot exclude the 
possibility of a third candidate--not a party candidate but, 
rather, a person of great authority in society. Here we can 
learn something from the number of votes Professor Religa gained 
in the Senate election [a famous cardiologist who received 
503,304 votes]. Obviously, at this point in the discussion, 
every party talks about its own candidate. 
<H5>  Jaroslaw Kaczynski (PC) </H5>
  I think this is rather difficult but not impossible. This is 
the only way if we want to win and not allow the left to win. It 
would have to be a person who is able to gain the support of the 
strongly anticommunist electorate as well as that part of the 
electorate that holds moderate views. In the second round of the 
election, this person will have to be able to get a substantial 
number of votes from the rural electorate. I do not see such a 
person in the political parties. I do not think Walesa could be 
such a person. From the PC's point of view, this is out of the 
question. I am convinced that he [Walesa] would be defeated. 
[passage omitted] 
<H5>  Ryszard Bugaj (UP) </H5>
  I do not see this as a possibility. I think there will be 
many candidates. The choice in the election between two 
candidates--as I understand it, they would be Walesa and 
Kwasniewski--would be destructive, and I am convinced that, in 
spite of everything, this will not happen. Our [UP] candidate 
will be a nonparty individual, possibly put forward together 
with other parties.

<F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Dziewanowski, former Polish ambassador </F>
to the United States: "A Change of Guard or the Guardhouse"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The editors asked a question 
that quite a few people are asking these days: How did the 
victory of the postcommunists in the September elections happen? 
It is good that they asked, and it is good that such discussion 
is under way. This discussion is not hair-splitting or a barren 
exercise compounding the sense of disaster, as we may think at 
times when feeling discouraged. Nations that shun, fear, or feel 
ashamed of the truth about their own mistakes often pay a high 
price later. As is known, he who does not learn from his 
mistakes is condemned to repeat them. Even worse, societies that 
look for explanations of their mistakes without trying to 
analyze them and pinpoint their actual causes rely on fabricated 
explanations, or, in other words, they construct myths because 
they fear hard truths. That is why such discussions and 
confrontation with the past are needed, are even indispensable, 
unpleasant as they may be. 
<H5>  How Did It Happen and What Happened? </H5>
  To answer this question with some exactitude, we first have 
to determine more closely just what happened. 
  Well, first of all, in 1989 power was taken from the 
communists. Besides, some people say--not without being somewhat 
right--that it was the communists themselves who yielded power. 
And, indeed, in 1989 they did not try to hold on to power by 
resorting to force; instead, they sat down (on their own 
initiative) at the "roundtable." But that is only part of the 
truth because it happened only in 1989, after resorting to force 
no longer had the chance of succeeding. Previously, in clinging 
to power, which they had seized by precisely an alien [Soviet] 
and not their own force, the communists had repeatedly, or 
rather continually, been resorting to force. They did so in the 
years 1945-54, and in an exceptionally frightful manner at that. 
They also did so during the Poznan [bread riots] in 1956, in 
Warsaw and other cities in 1968, in 1970 [workers' massacre] on 
the coast, in 1976 in Radom, at Ursus [Tractor Plant] and 
elsewhere, and last--again on a large scale--in 1981 [martial 
law imposed] (and during several subsequent years) throughout 
the country. It thus cannot be said that avoiding to resort to 
force and sitting down at the "roundtable" used to be a favorite 
custom of communists. 
<H3>  The First Time They Avoided Force and Resorted to the 
"Roundtable" They Lost Power </H3>
  That took place in an atmosphere of enthusiasm and elation. 
Some people compared that event to the atmosphere and emotional 
tension associated with great Polish national uprisings. But 
that was not so, considering that the transfer of power took 
place in the absence of violence and victims and thus led to 
various distinctive consequences--good, admirable, and 
praiseworthy ones, but also some less admirable. But inasmuch as 
the "roundtable" nature of that transfer has already been the 
subject of numerous discussions, accusations, insinuations, and 
demagogic utterances, anyone who discusses it should at the same 
time define his position on it so as to avoid misunderstandings. 
As for myself, I believe that the decision of the democratic 
opposition in those times to sit down with the communists at the 
roundtable was correct and definitely more justifiable than a 
boycott. 
  As a result, the communists lost power, and this happened in 
the absence of bloodshed. This was followed by a four-year reign 
of the then opposition, which became the ruling group, to its 
own great amazement and astonishment. 
  That period is now over, and it is time to sum it up 
briefly. 
Of course, I am aware that a penetrating assessment would be 
premature; besides, many of the related matters are still 
incomplete, and the last cards have not been dealt yet, nor is 
the last act of the drama over. Still, a definite era in history 
is certainly over. 
  In view of the customs that during that period became 
widespread in public life, in view of the flood of false 
accusations, slanders, and reproaches lacking even a modicum of 
truth, several fundamental things must be said before evaluating 
that period. 
  The then democratic opposition took on the burden of 
responsibility for the country without being properly prepared 
for it. That happened not so much through its fault as chiefly 
through the fault of those who had relinquished power on seeing 
that they could no longer wield it (and they deserve praise for 
becoming aware of it). Here several obvious things, little if at 
all known to the present-day voter, should be pointed out. Well, 
the essence of the communist system consisted precisely in that 
all important documents, facts, statistics, and information 
concerning the state were secret and not accessible to the 
opposition, and attempts to gain access to them, if only in 
order to understand better the surrounding reality and to 
consider the future, were punished and viewed as hostile 
antistate activities. Attempts to learn about such domains as 
national defense, foreign policy, domestic security, the actual 
budget and state expenditures, or even about true figures on the 
state of public opinion (insofar as they were at all known) 
meant immediate imprisonment or something even worse. Then, too, 
consider that all of the higher posts and sometimes even entire 
professions and kinds of work had been reserved exclusively for 
members of the ruling party, and, in the case of particularly 
sensitive occupations, for especially trusted functionaries, 
whom Orwell termed members of the "inner party." I am not 
referring here solely to the diplomatic service or the General 
Staff. Eighty-odd percent of village chairmen in Poland used to 
belong to the party.... 
<H5>  Waiting Would Have Been Impossible </H5>
  Independent thinking about the system of society, foreign 
policy, national defense, the direction of economic policy, and 
political alliances had been permitted by only a handful of 
privileged individuals within the party. If nonparty members 
tried to engage in such thinking, they were ridiculed, their 
sanity was questioned, and they were accused of being morally 
disqualified, of "politicking," sowing discord, displaying 
overweening ambition, and being irresponsible. Their attempts 
were unethical and suspicious, or at least that was how they 
were depicted. 
  As a result, in accepting responsibility for the government, 
the members of the then democratic opposition faced an 
incomparably more difficult task than the previous rulers, who 
had anyhow failed to cope with it and thus brought about 
economic collapse and hyperinflation, turning this country into 
a major international debtor. 
  Given its insufficient preparation, should the opposition 
have accepted responsibility for governing, or should it rather 
have shunned it and waited? Wait for what? Wait until the 
country is drowned in chaos, until inflation is growing at a 
rate of several hundred percent daily, until blood is shed? By 
then it was perfectly obvious that the communists were incapable 
of ruling and that a continuation of the existing situation 
would result in disaster. It has to be honestly admitted that 
the then leadership of the PZPR [Polish United Workers Party] 
probably was aware of this problem and drew its own conclusions. 
It was also understood by the individuals heading (or rather 
creating the leadership of) the democratic opposition, who 
engaged in intense internal disputes, because experience had 
taught them to distrust the communists. After all, Poland was 
the first country to enter upon this new road; at the time, the 
USSR had not yet disintegrated, the Warsaw Pact was still 
operational, and the Berlin Wall still stood intact and guarded. 
Friends of the PZPR, such as Honecker, Ceausescu, Zhivkov, and 
others, were still in power at the time. The Polish opposition 
was aware that they were likely to oppose it, by force.... 
  Really, people who claim nowadays that they had known from 
the beginning that there should have been no negotiations or 
compromises with the communists are wise after the fact; at the 
time they were silent. 
  Upon taking over the government, the members of the former 
opposition succeeded within a couple of months in introducing a 
set of economic, financial, and social measures that served to 
halt inflation. Further, they commenced the indispensable and as 
yet uncompleted process of privatization, made the zloty 
convertible, strengthened the currency, filled store shelves, 
and assured Poland of fuel and energy independence. Nowadays, 
when we consider the East and the situation of certain countries 
of the former USSR, we can see what Poland would have been like 
had these reforms not been accomplished. Those individuals who 
are making such outcries about Polish sovereignty should 
consider what the situation would have been like had we not 
afforded to this country, for example, additional possibilities 
for securing supplies of crude petroleum and gasoline. After 
all, it was not so long ago that farmers used to wait for days 
in line in front of gasoline stations and turn their farms into 
unsafe, flammable petroleum-storage areas. 
  In addition, during those first few years of the new 
government, a major reduction of foreign debt could be 
accomplished. Note incidentally that, during the recent 
electoral campaign, a "responsible" politician uttered on 
television some nonsense about truck convoys carrying $2 billion 
in government funds each week from Poland to Switzerland. His 
knowledge of the reality is such that he believes that 
substantial funds are carried nowadays in trucks, but, more to 
the point, consider that $2 billion weekly means $104 billion 
annually. Polish exports have never so far exceeded $15 billion 
a year. Therefore, $104 billion sounds like black magic. Should 
any Polish government succeed in thus multiplying dollars, it 
should stay in power forever. At any rate, a man who believes 
that money is carried to Switzerland in trucks should not be 
elected; after all, everyone knows that it is carried there in 
socks. 
  But let us return to reality from Cockaigne. It is a fact 
that Solidarity governments have brought about a 50-percent 
reduction of Polish debt in the so-called Club of Paris--that 
is, more than $20 billion. They also concluded a highly 
satisfactory agreement with united Germany, established amicable 
relations with all of the neighboring countries, and brought 
about the withdrawal of Russian troops from Poland. 
  In speaking of Solidarity governments, I mean not only 
particular cabinets but also the Belweder and the entire system 
of society established during those four years because a no less 
important accomplishment of those four years has been the laying 
of the foundations of parliamentary democracy based on the rule 
of law, even if it is not too popular nowadays and has deserved 
considerable criticism. That will be discussed hereafter. But 
there is not the slightest doubt that the existence of an even 
not too efficient parliamentary system is ever so much better 
than the lack of any such system. 
  Also established were mass media that are, though 
experiencing a number of ailments (chiefly childhood ailments), 
moderately independent and operate in the absence of censorship; 
they may be making many mistakes, but they represent a fairly 
effective means of social control over the government and the 
bureaucracy. 
  All this has happened during those four years and by now 
taken sufficient root to make possible a fairly efficient (and 
so far proceeding without any major shock) transfer of power to 
the new governing team. 
  Here we arrive at the core of our reflections. 
  Montaigne wrote in his "Twenty-Third Essay," "Those who try 
to topple the government are most often the first to fall, 
crushed under its ruins; the fruit of unrest is rarely harvested 
by its initiator; usually the water is thus muddied and stirred 
for the benefit of other fishermen" (in Boy-Zelenski's 
translation). And Bernard Shaw wrote that revolutionary 
movements attract the best and the worst elements of society. 
<H5>  Was It a Revolution? </H5>
  The fact that not a shot was fired and no window broken, 
that 
the Bastille was not demolished, and that no one was immured in 
it, might conflict with the idea of a revolution. On the other 
hand, the fact that an entire class or, rather, a large social 
group--the party nomenklatura may not have been a 
class according to classical definitions but certainly was a 
very large and influential group and perhaps also something 
more--was rather suddenly deprived of influence and largely 
replaced may indicate that all this was something of a 
revolution, considering also that the prolonged [communist] era 
of nearly total stagnation was superseded by a period of great 
social, occupational, etc. mobility. But it is not important 
what we call it, a revolution or whatever. I am engaging in 
these reflections only to justify the reference to Shaw's highly 
significant dictum and also to mention Cocteau's sober and 
skeptical remark, "The purity of a revolution may at most last 
two weeks." 
  In our Polish case, that lasted somewhat longer, but not by 
much. Soon afterward, in addition to the lack of preparation, 
there appeared selfishness, greed, lack of moderation and often 
also of decency, corruption and abuse of power, and, in the end, 
the craving to amass money rapidly. All of this soon surfaced, 
sometimes in the form of a caricature, as when family affairs 
were settled with the aid of the public prosecutor's offices, 
and sometimes in a more threatening form, as when public affairs 
were resolved with the aid of secret documents. In addition, the 
poor quality of a large segment of the new political class--I 
hesitate to use the term "elite"--has become clear. For God's 
sake, what kind of elites are they, considering that they are 
ignorant of the surrounding world, cannot foresee elementary 
consequences of their actions, and cannot correlate elementary 
facts. But still? According to Slownik Wyrazow Obcych 
[Dictionary of Foreign Terms], published by the PWN Press, 
an elite is "a group or assemblage of persons displaying some 
distinguishing characteristic." It is not unlikely that the last 
Sejm did indeed consist of people displaying some distinguishing 
characteristic, but I am not going to define it. 
<H5>  The Composition of the New Political Class Proved Weak </H5>
  The astonishing stupidity of the Right has already been 
widely discussed in print, so there is no need for me to 
describe it. The trouble is that this concerns parties, 
movements, and fringe parties that had attracted 20 percent of 
the vote but, at present, are not represented in the parliament 
[because none of these parties won at least 5 percent of the 
national vote]. But, of course, the point is not just the feeble 
intellectual qualifications of certain activists--I hesitate to 
call them politicians. For there also are the numerous hasty 
decisions made by such a serious, experienced, and merited 
institution as the Roman Catholic Church. It behaved to some 
extent as if it was bereft of the experience of 20 centuries or 
of the 20th century. 
  The unpreparedness and immaturity of the Solidarity forces 
were reflected in, among other things, their failure--and that 
was a grave shortcoming--to explain to the public, carefully and 
clearly, their goals and intentions; even though they had a 
program of action, they were unable to make it sufficiently 
detailed and convincing. 
  Trusting too much in their authority, their mission, and 
their historical rationale, the Solidarity forces neglected to 
consider what democratic politicians must always keep in 
mind--namely, that the principal yardstick of a politician's 
effectiveness is not whether history declares him to be right 
but whether voters declare him to be so, and in the very next 
election, at that. The "war at the top" and the destructive and 
sometimes shameful nature of successive electoral campaigns 
dealt a heavy blow to such an approach by Solidarity. 
<H5>  What Then Did Happen? </H5>
  There was a change of guard but, by then, in a new 
guardhouse, in which different rules apply. It may be that the 
new sentinels will adapt themselves to the altered 
environment--and then this change will benefit Polish democracy. 
It would be beneficial if all of the main political forces in 
Poland were to share in succession responsibility for carrying 
out the reforms needed to have Poland enter the 21st century as 
an equal partner of other European countries rather than as an 
island of backwardness. That will be a long and difficult social 
process, which is not surprising because changes on such a scale 
and in such depth are bound to last much longer than was 
expected in the beginning. In order that the creation of a 
genuine and efficient democracy, that sole system of society 
assuring social and economic progress, may be crowned with 
success, it is also necessary for voters to realize that no one 
can work miracles in politics or the economy, that manna does 
not fall from the sky and plums do not fall from trees into 
mouths. Should this happen, perhaps a stable and responsible 
parliamentary democracy, meaning something different from a 
system under which some people try to carry out needed changes 
(and, in the process, make mistakes, which is natural) while 
others merely criticize them and promise a rose garden, will 
finally begin to operate in Poland. 
  But, of course, the outcome may also be different. If the 
new 
government discontinues the reforms or, in the event of some 
crisis or under the pressure of the electorate, protects its 
position at the expense of a loss of currency stability and 
economic progress, if it fences off Poland with barriers of 
customs duties and prohibitions, and if it smothers private 
enterprise with taxes, then the opportunity will be forfeited, 
and, after some time, we shall again face a major economic, 
social, and political crisis. 
  Summing up, what happened happened, and it cannot be undone. 
But the consequences may vary, and I believe that they still 
cannot be prejudged. The basic problem is that all of those 
shocks and twists and turns in our country are part of a much 
broader, worldwide great crisis of leadership, which nowadays 
can be observed in practically every country in the world. No 
continent has been bypassed by that crisis. But that is a 
subject for separate reflection. 
  Nowadays, ours is not the only country in which, 
chameleonlike, power keeps changing its shape and hues while 
perching on a swaying and weak branch. A reason for optimism is 
that this creature does not, insofar as we know, behave 
irrationally.

Strak"] 
  [Text] "The expression `putting in order' and not `reform' 
better describes what we want to do," said Minister Michal 
Strak, chief of the Office of the Council of Ministers, in 
response to a question on changes proposed in the functioning of 
the public administration. He called drafts proposed by the 
previous government "historical documents," not suitable for 
implementation. He also provided information on the demand of 
the coalition parties for the dismissal of voivodes in a number 
of voivodships, arguing that, in France, after each 
parliamentary election, 60 percent of the prefects are changed. 
To this, opposition politicians stated derisively in the halls 
that the new government wants to introduce its own "apolitical" 
people into the administration. 
  The 47-year-old Michal Strak is a political scientist and 
Polish philologist by education. During the 1970's, he worked as 
a journalist at WIES WSPOLCZESNA and ZIELONY SZTANDAR [both 
newspapers dealing with rural and agricultural issues], and 
later in the Ministry of Culture and Art. Beginning in 1989, for 
three years he was the director of the Cabinet of the minister 
of state at the Chancellery of President Wojciech Jaruzelski. 
With Lech Walesa's presidency, he was dismissed from that 
position by Jaroslaw Kaczynski. 
  Michal Strak began his political career in the Rural Youth 
Union [ZMK]. He became a member of the United Peasant Party 
[ZSL] in 1971 [predecessor of the PSL (Polish Peasant Party)]. 
He currently serves as deputy secretary of the Chief Executive 
Committee of the PSL. He is considered to be the major 
ideologist of the PSL and is the closest colleague and adviser 
of Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak. Following his advice, 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] deputies voted in favor of a vote 
of no-confidence for the government of Hanna Suchocka [referring 
to the December 1993 parliamentary refusal to grant absolutorium 
to the Olszewski and Suchocka governments]. 
  Strak is married and has two children.

Hall"] 
  [Text] Participants of the II Conservative Party Congress 
once again elected as chairman the present leader of the party, 
Aleksander Hall. He was the only candidate for the position. 
Before the vote, he assured the delegates that only the Left is 
his enemy. At the same time, he came out in favor of cautious 
cooperation with the PChD [Party of Christian Democrats], the 
SLCh [Christian Peasant Party], and the UPR [Union for Real 
Politics], ruling out the PC [Center Accord], the ZChN 
[Christian-National Union], the PL [Peasant Accord], the UD 
[Democratic Union], and the KLD [Liberal-Democratic Congress] as 
political partners. Six of the 10 candidates recommended by Hall 
serve in the new administration of the party. 
  Born in May 1953, Hall was engaged in opposition activity as 
early as when he was in middle school. Upon completion of 
studies in history at the University of Gdansk, he was employed 
as a teacher. In 1977 he was cofounder of the Movement in 
Defense of Human and Citizen's Rights, and two years later was 
leader of the liberal-conservative Movement of Young Poland. 
After his dismissal from teaching by the authorities, he became 
an independent journalist. When martial law was declared, as a 
Solidarity activist, he went into hiding until 1984. Hall took 
part in the [April 1989] "roundtable" discussions [between the 
communist government and Solidarity]. In Tadeusz Mazowiecki's 
government, he was minister in charge of contacts with political 
parties. He left this position when he became involved in 
Mazowiecki's presidential campaign. Beginning in November 199O, 
he chaired the Forum of the Democratic Right in the UD. Hall 
left the UD and, in 1992, formed the center-right Conservative 
Party, which, within the framework of the Catholic Electoral 
Committee "Fatherland," gained no seats in the last 
parliamentary election [September 1993]. 
  Aleksander Hall is a bachelor.

<F P=106> [Article by Miroslaw Cielemecki: "`An Army in Agony'; In the </F>
NATO Armies, the Equipment Modernization Index Is 35-40 Percent; 
In Poland, It Has Dropped Below 20 Percent"] 
  [Text] In 1939 the Polish Army held its own for more than a 
month. Some generals think that today, in the event of an 
all-out attack, it would not be able to hold out any longer than 
Westerplatte did [seven days] half a century ago. 
  In 1987, which military men called the worst time for the 
Army in the last two decades, 3 percent of GNP was allocated to 
defense. In the years 1988-92, the real budget of the MON 
[Ministry of Defense] dropped by more than 60 percent. In 1990 
people were talking about a "survival budget," and then about an 
"agony budget." Defense spending this year amounts to about 30 
billion zlotys (1.9 percent of GNP). 
  When the president asked Admiral Piotr Kolodziejczyk, 
minister of defense in the governments of Tadeusz Mazowiecki and 
Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, to resume that post, he [Kolodziejczyk] 
demanded as his price that the Army receive (as it had six years 
ago) 3 percent of GNP. The General Staff estimates that with 
that level of funding the military will not be able to preserve 
even its present, modest, level of fighting power. 
  The Army may break down almost completely within two years. 
  Funding cuts over the last two years have chiefly hit 
procurement of new equipment because, in the words of the 
General Staff, "the opportunities for savings in other 
activities have already been exhausted." In 1992, according to 
some sources, 12 percent of the MON budget was allocated to 
procurement. The prediction that in 1995 the costs of new 
equipment will account to 30 percent of the budget are likely to 
prove fairly accurate. 
  Last year the weakest member of NATO, Turkey, spent $4.18 
billion on defense. The defense budget of Portugal, which is 
one-fourth the size of Poland, is estimated at about $1.8 
billion. During the same time the Polish MON was allocated 
somewhat less than $1.5 billion. 
  Budgetary shortfalls are not the only indication of the 
weakness of the Polish Army. About two-thirds of Poland's 
military equipment is imported, mainly from the former Soviet 
Union. There would be nothing wrong with this if it were the 
latest Soviet weaponry. This is, unfortunately, not the case. 
Obviously, no army in the world is outfitted with nothing but 
the latest equipment. The so-called equipment modernization 
index in the NATO armies is, however, 35-40 percent; in Poland 
it has dropped to below 20 percent. 
  The Polish electronics forces have comparatively good 
equipment for detecting aircraft and missiles. However, some of 
the equipment for combating aircraft and missiles will soon have 
to be consigned to a museum. There is a particularly acute 
shortage of surface-to-air missiles. Much of the antiaircraft 
artillery dates back to the 1950's and 1960's. We have no 
airplanes or helicopters for conducting electronic warfare. 
  The equipment of the communications troops is simply 
terrible. 
  They are using obsolete radios, lines, exchanges, etc., that 
are often 30 years old. The communications equipment is bulky, 
heavy, difficult to deploy, and extremely easy to intercept and 
jam. Unlike modern armies, which already have many such systems, 
Polish divisions do not have computerized microwave 
communications systems that make it possible to transmit 
friendly information and counter enemy communications. 
  The Polish Air Force, which is not in bad shape from the 
quantitative standpoint (507 combat aircraft), has, however, 
only 12 modern MiG-29's and several tens of the more or less 
modern MiG-23's. The rest of the Air Force consists mainly of 
obsolete MiG-21's. In the Vienna negotiations, Poland is 
assigned a ceiling of 130 combat helicopters. In actuality, we 
have only 30 Mi-24's, which were procured in the 1980's and are 
now slipping into obsolescence. The Air Forces of the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia have 20 MiG-29's, approximately 70 
MiG-23's, and about 50 Mi-24 helicopters. The small army of 
Belarus (about 144,000 soldiers) has 390 modern MiG-28, MiG-27, 
MiG-23, Su-27, Su-25, and Su-24 combat aircraft and 80 Mi-24 
attack helicopters. Ukraine (with 230,000 soldiers) has more 
than 1,400 combat aircraft (including, for example, 255 
MiG-29's, 95 MiG-25's, 190 MiG-23's, 40 Su-27's, 30 Su-25's, and 
220 Su-24's), 240 Mi-24 attack helicopters, and at least seven 
bomber divisions and brigades that are equipped with 40 Tu-16 
bombers and more than 110 Tu-22's and Tu-26's. 
  The Air Force of the Federal Republic of Germany took over 
from that of the German Democratic Republic only MiG-29 fighters 
(24 of them). The other aircraft, which are considered modern in 
Poland, the Germans just did not want. The German Air Force is 
twice as powerful as the Polish one from the standpoint of 
amount of equipment and much stronger in terms of numbers (among 
other things, 195 Tornadoes, 150 F-4's, and 160 Alpha Jets). 
  The Polish ground forces come off equally poorly in the 
comparisons. Of our neighbors (with the exception of Lithuania), 
only Slovakia and Belarus have fewer tanks. Ukraine has twice as 
many as we do. 
  Of 2,850 Polish tanks, only about 700 are reasonably modern 
T-72's. 
  The rest have long been out of production, although some are 
somewhat modernized T-55 tanks. The arsenals of the Czech and 
Slovak Armies include 815 T-72 tanks, Belarus has 1,520 T-72's 
and 310 T-62's, and Ukraine has 1,000 T-72's, 2,100 T-64's, 200 
T-62's, and 300 of the ultramodern T-80's. The Bundeswehr has 
2,370 Leopard 1 tanks and 2,020 Leopard 2 tanks. The number of 
Polish BWP-1 and BWP-2 armored combat vehicles, which are 
considered somewhat modern, is about 250 below the CFE-1 
[Conventional Armed Forces in Europe] ceiling. By the year 2000, 
the little modern rocket artillery that Poland now has will lose 
approximately 50 of its combat value. 
  The military power of a country is determined not just by 
the 
number of soldiers and amount of equipment it has, but also by 
the level of training of its reserves. If a threat were to 
arise, the Swedes and the Germans would each be able to quickly 
mobilize about 700,000 reservists who have undergone constant 
training. According to specialized foreign journals (in Poland 
such data are secret), the Polish ground forces are able to 
support about 420,000 reserve soldiers. From analyzing the 
number and scope of the exercises that have been conducted, it 
is doubtful that the reserve army is really combat ready. It is 
an open secret that, due to a lack of money, the Polish MON has 
reduced reserve training below the bare minimum. 
  The system for training reserve officer cadres has 
completely 
broken down. Among the most tightly held secrets are the status 
and quantity of equipment intended for reservists. It turns out 
that only personal weapons and field uniforms are in adequate 
supply. The situation regarding other kinds of equipment is 
considerably worse. In all likelihood, the reserve units are 
equipped with obsolete tanks, combat vehicles, radios, etc. 
  In the event of a war, the reserve army and in-place units 
are supplemented with auxiliary equipment from civilian 
industries, for example, heavy cars, buses, excavators, 
bulldozers, etc. In previous years civilian "contingents" were 
required to be ready and available on terms dictated by the MON. 
Officers from the mobilization units monitored compliance. 
Nowadays, during the period of changes in ownership and 
restructuring, the old plans have fallen apart. Private 
companies do not respect the mobilization assignments, nor do 
state firms, citing a lack of resources. The extent to which the 
national territory is prepared for a possible war has 
deteriorated to a catastrophic degree. An analysis of the food 
market (grain, flour, meat) indicates that state strategic 
reserves have declined significantly. It turns out that fuel 
reserves have also shrunk. 
  Many civil defense activities are also in poor shape. If it 
were necessary to evacuate large population centers, there would 
probably be chaos. There would be shortages of transportation, 
food, shelter, etc. People have ceased to comply with the 
requirements (common in other countries) relating to building 
civil defense shelters in new buildings. Investors cite a 
shortage of funding. Workers of the central institutions and 
some of the personnel from several factories would find shelter 
mainly in the capital. No new shelters are being built, and the 
existing ones are being allowed to deteriorate. The situation is 
similar in other parts of the country. The civil defense system 
has even had to eliminate a significant portion of the automatic 
warning siren installations for mobilization.

<F P=106> [Draft state budget for 1994 presented by Deputy Prime </F>
Minister Marek Borowski to the Sejm in Warsaw--live] 
  [Text] Mr. Speaker, may it please the house. On behalf of 
the Council of Ministers I present to the house the draft state 
budget for 1994. As every presentation of income and expenditure 
of the state, the budget reflects the state and possibilities of 
the economy. It is also a synthetic expression of a programmatic 
line of the government. It is developing both from the past and 
the present conditions. It is necessary to distinguish where we 
inherit the legacy of the 50 years of recent history, where of 
the last four years and where of two months' work of the 
Waldemar Pawalak cabinet, not just to stop transferring 
responsibility between successive groups in power. The awareness 
of achievements as well as errors seems to be needed to 
formulate an effective economic policy for a period of several 
years, the policy, which we are initiating with this draft 
budget. 
  The parties making up the coalition will not keep secret the 
sins of real socialism. Although we do not consider it to be a 
period of only errors and failures, we still inherited an 
economy not adapted to competition in the world markets, with a 
developed but inefficient and highly expensive system of social 
benefits, and finally with enormous foreign debts. This 
inheritance has had and still has a serious impact on all 
budgets, beginning in 1990 and including the present one. 
Ignoring these facts would simply be dishonest. Everybody who 
thinks that this government wants to conceal anything is wrong. 
  It is the same dishonesty, however, to persist in 
proclaiming 
that a mess had been made of the economy until 1989, and from 1 
January 1990 it has been solely set right. Decisions were also 
made in the nineties, the negative effects of which we 
experience now and will experience for a long time to come. We 
consider it a mistake to completely open customs borders and to 
allow large imports of goods for consumption, undercutting many 
branches of industry and agricultural production, contributing 
to a large drop in output and increased unemployment. These 
effects become more intense by keeping fixed foreign currency 
rates for too long. This policy has been gradually abandoned, 
but considerable damage has already been done. 
  We also consider it a mistake to abolish an upper limit for 
the so-called obligatory dividend [tax on the book value of 
company assets] and later continuing to apply this and other 
discriminatory forms of taxation of state enterprises for a long 
time. A new solution was put forward after only three years 
within the framework of the state enterprise pact. Until then 
this policy was impairing the activity of many state enterprises 
and contributed to the increase of their debts, exceeding real 
capabilities for repayment. 
  We also consider the introduction of the policy of very high 
interest rates immediately after 1 January 1990 to be a mistake, 
not only as regards new, but also earlier bank loans. After few 
months a large number of enterprises, including those with big 
manufacturing potential, and also individual citizens, farmers 
in particular, were facing the prospect of complete insolvency, 
for which they were not to blame. The effect was the same as in 
previous cases--a drop in production and a rise in unemployment. 
These two occurrences undermined the financial foundations of 
the functioning of the state. A drop in production has a 
negative impact on the income side of the budget, and the rise 
in unemployment causes an increase of expenditures for benefits 
and social care, and for the pensions system. 
  A permanent deficit of the state budget since 1991 has only 
in part been caused by unavoidable events, such as the 
disintegration of the Soviet market. Economic policy of previous 
ruling groups considerably contributed to its existence. The 
deficit was not a creative one. Mining, metallurgy, and other 
branches of industry were not restructured thanks to it. Housing 
construction was not revived and there was no improvement in the 
public sector. There was, however, a gradual increase of 
domestic debt for financing this deficit. 
  The cost of servicing domestic debt, which in 1991 was about 
2 trillion zlotys [Z] will rise to Z66 trillion in 1994, and 
together with other settlements to Z82 trillion, and this is 
beyond recall. Interest paid by the budget to the banks for 
loans raised for financing the deficit has to be repaid 
regularly and in full, otherwise the banking system, weak and 
burdened with bad debts, faces complete disintegration. This is, 
in effect, the most negative inheritance from the economic 
policy of the governments of the nineties. 
  An increase of output and national income, which appeared in 
our economy in 1993, is, of course, a positive phenomenon. We 
have to maintain and consolidate this positive trend. We have to 
remember, however, the level from which this increase began. If 
we are able to maintain this rate of increase in the next years, 
we will reach the highest level of national income of 1989 as 
late as in 1997. Only then can we count on financing the public 
sector, for example, at the level of 1989, but still on the 
condition that we are able to cope with budget expenditures for 
servicing domestic and foreign debts. 
  Politicians who are indiscriminately praising the present 
economic growth behave a little like a doctor who, while 
treating a patient, accidentally breaks his hand and then tours 
the country showing slides depicting how well the broken hand is 
setting. 
  The whole thing, after all, is much more complicated: A 
patient's health condition does not depend on the condition of 
one hand, so the condition of the economy cannot be evaluated 
merely by the index of production growth. Exports have dropped, 
competitiveness of Polish goods has dropped, the deficit in the 
balance of payments has risen to disquieting levels, 
unemployment has risen to dangerous levels, and a process of 
material and civilization stratification of society continues. 
The system of social welfare and health protection has remained 
ineffective and untouched by any reform, despite the passage of 
four years. Very high levels of debt of enterprises--with almost 
half of them bringing losses--continue. Most banks are facing 
serious difficulties. Restructuring processes in industry are on 
in their initial stages. In agriculture there was a considerable 
drop in the stocks of cattle, pigs, and poultry. 
  May it please the house. I believe that arguments concerning 
the past should now be ended because society expects from us 
actions for the future. It expects the resolution of concrete 
problems. Certain conditions, however, have to be met in order 
that it can happen. I want to make it perfectly clear that 
Waldemar Pawlak's government recognizes and appreciates the 
efforts that his Solidarity predecessors took to reform the 
economy. He who opposes it, drastically misses the realities. 
  We are, however, demanding that while fighting against 
certain myths, we should not create new ones, that everything 
that was most important has been done, that the biggest problems 
have been resolved and that there is nothing else to be done but 
a simple continuation of the course started by our predecessors. 
Meanwhile, errors made in recent years and the accumulated 
negative phenomena convince us that such a one-sided propaganda 
of success is groundless. It would be better for all to give it 
up. 
  Mr. Speaker, may it please the house. The budget bill 
submitted to the esteemed house closes with the amount of Z610 
trillion on the credit side and the amount of Z693 trillion on 
the debit side. The deficit therefore amounts to Z83 trillion. 
Objectives that the government sets and that are a base for the 
construction of the 1994 budget, assume a further reduction of 
inflation, and at the same time the speeding up of the tempo of 
the development of the economy and an improvement in the foreign 
balance of payments. They also assume a real growth of pay and 
the reduction of the pace of the growth of unemployment. 
  Let me describe briefly some of the figures. It is assumed 
that the gross domestic product should increase by 4.5 percent, 
project investment by 6 percent, exports also by 6 percent and 
imports by 2.5 percent. To obtain such results we will have to 
depart from a hitherto passive state policy toward the growth in 
production and exports--it will require rationalization and a 
change in the structure of imports as well as application of 
many pro-investment and pro-export solutions. I will present 
these actions when I speak about the government priorities in 
the sphere of budget expenditure. 
  Two main factors are the source of inflation in Poland. 
First, the budget deficit, second, the increase of cost, partly 
brought about by price rises on energy carriers. Prices for 
electricity and gas unfortunately have to grow together with 
general inflation if we are to secure adequate funds for 
investment in these branches. The government cannot make only 
nice and easy decisions. On the other hand the government is 
fully aware of the impact of rises on citizens' standards of 
living. That is why, while preparing the budget, we assumed that 
prices of energy carriers would rise slower than so far, and 
slower than it transpires from an agreed World Bank scenario of 
approaching world prices. A planned pace of these price rises 
has also been reduced in comparison with the provisions of the 
budget policy prepared by the previous cabinet. I emphasize 
these facts because recently some media have been exposing only 
our intentions as regards price rises, as if it would have been 
invented by the Waldemar Pawlak government while previously 
there were only reductions. As far as a planned rise of the 
so-called council apartment rent, its introduction will be 
combined with the introduction of the government law on rent and 
housing allowances. Should the house reject the introduction of 
the allowances then the scale of rent rises would obviously be 
reduced. 
  Inflation in Poland has not been prompted by induced demand, 
but it can be the case with uncontrolled pay rises. Although the 
government is determined to abolish the so-called 
popiwek [excess wage tax]--an appropriate bill is 
ready--it could not accept a proposal to put it into effect from 
1 January without any other control of pay rises. The bill will 
soon be presented to trade unions for consultations. 
  We have been receiving signals, however, that some 
enterprises, guided by inaccurate information and unjustified 
expectations, are going to raise wages in anticipation of the 
law being introduced. I consider it necessary to state that 
until new regulations are introduced, the excessive wage tax 
will be calculated and collected in accordance with the present 
rules. 
  Keeping price rises within planned limits is a matter of 
utmost importance not only for the feasibility of the budget 
itself, but also for the economy as a whole, and for our 
citizens. 
  Fiscal policy is an important part of general economic 
policy. Its detailed provisions are included in the document on 
directions of fiscal policy prepared by the Polish National Bank 
[NBP] and submitted to the house. They will be presented by the 
NBP president. For my part, I would like to say that there 
exists the convergence of views and a mutual will for 
cooperation between the government and the central bank. 
  May it please the house. The shape of the budget adopted by 
the government is based on the following assumptions, arising, 
and I underscore this, from the program of the coalition. First, 
the budget for 1994 should be conducive, to a greater possible 
extent, to the growth of production, investment and export, and 
should maintain and consolidate economic growth. This month the 
government will adopt a decree on concessions on investments. 
They appear indirectly in the budget as a factor reducing income 
from taxes. 
  Both the state and private organizational units, domestic 
and 
foreign capital, and legal and natural persons, including the 
payees of the recently introduced fixed tax, are all equally 
entitled to these concessions. Exporters and economic units that 
will initiate project investment of a particularly high value 
will be able to take advantage from additional preferences. 
Moreover, the government will soon make amendments to the decree 
on tax concessions, when new jobs are created in areas 
threatened with particularly high unemployment. It will be done 
in such a way that a concession will be a real one, rather than 
just a theoretical incentive for investors, as has been the case 
so far. 
  In many countries an important role in stimulating the 
project investment and exports is played by special security, 
warranty, and collateral funds. Such activity in Poland is still 
in its early stages. The government has set aside resources in 
the budget bill for this purpose. The corporation for the 
assurance of export credits will receive extra funds thanks to 
which its operation and influence on the increase of Polish 
exports will be strengthened. A fund for credit guarantees, 
supporting investment and development as well as privatization 
of small and medium-sized enterprises, will be created, also 
from foreign resources and premiums of the interested economic 
units. In the budget bill we propose considerable, threefold, 
increases--from Z8 trillion to Z25 trillion--to the limit of 
State Treasury credit guarantees. The government is ready to 
increase its involvement in economic processes and will do so in 
the manner that is proper for the market economy. Guarantees as 
well as reguarantees for important investment and development 
projects, carefully and cautiously considered and granted, 
should galvanize the economy in a significant manner. A similar 
role is played by government orders in the arms industry to 
equip the Armed Forces. In the latest stages of work on the 
budget the planned expenditure by the Ministry of National 
Defense was increased, which ensured at the same time that 
several aims would be implemented: that the employment levels in 
the ailing arms industry would be maintained, that production of 
suppliers to the arms industry would be stimulated, and finally, 
that the condition of weaponry in the Armed Forces would improve. 
  Resources for the promotion of exports are increasing almost 
threefold. We are creating conditions for the increase of 
domestic and foreign project investment in Poland by conforming 
the relevant customs policy. Restructuring processes, of course, 
if only they are pursued properly, have a significant importance 
for the increase of efficiency throughout the economy. 
Experiences we have had so far in this sphere are not, 
unfortunately, the best. Much money has been spent with meager 
results. In the 1994 budget we are increasing resources for the 
restructuring of industry from our national and foreign 
resources from Z2 trillion to Z6 trillion--concentrating them on 
coal mining and sulphur industries. A real opportunity is thus 
being created, and at least seven of the most loss-making 
collieries will be shut down within two years, which will reduce 
the social costs of extraction of this basic raw material for 
energy. We know that this is a difficult and socially painful 
process, but it is inevitable from the point of view of the 
economy as a whole. Its implementation will require the 
allocation of considerable amounts of money for social welfare. 
The budget provides for relevant resources for this purpose. 
  One of the biggest obstacles in galvanizing the economy in 
Poland today is a low availability of credits and a high 
interest rate. We want to overcome those barriers by starting 
institutions of guarantees, which I discussed just a moment ago. 
The lowering of the interest rate is, however, not possible by 
just administrative decisions. The interest rate has been and 
will be dependent on the inflation index; its lowering always 
requires the allocation of considerable resources to compensate 
losses the banks suffer when they grant preferential interest 
rate credits. 
  Extensive involvement of funds from the budget for this goal 
is neither possible nor justified--with only one exception, 
which is agriculture. Its specific nature leaves it unable to 
invest and develop in the conditions of expensive credits. But 
agriculture, investing and buying means of production, is a 
factor for animating industry and the whole economy. The 
government decided to considerably increase--from Z1.5 trillion 
to Z2.5 trillion--the sum for partial financing of interest on 
preferential credits for agriculture. At the same time we want 
to establish a preferential interest rate on a level 
considerably lower than so far. Total outlays on agriculture, 
including payments from the Polish National Bank to the fund for 
restructuring and debt clearing of agriculture, and World Bank 
loans, will amount to Z18.7 trillion. This is Z2 trillion more 
than the previous government planned to allocate to agriculture 
in 1994. The largest increases concern partial financing of 
preferential credits, the agency of agricultural market, and the 
fund for restructuring and debt clearing of agriculture, that 
is, the mechanisms and institutions vital for the stabilization 
of the agricultural market and increased production. 
  The budget bill also includes other provisions important for 
agriculture, its infrastructure, and farmers themselves. One of 
them is the decision creating a possibility for giving 
assistance to the bank of food economy; another considerably 
increases contributions for the farmers' social insurance fund 
in connection with a rise of farmers' pensions. Many times from 
this rostrum words were spoken about farmers who feed and 
defend, about respect for farmers' toil, and about the 
importance of agriculture for the economy. Unfortunately, not 
much transpired from these words, and allocated funds were often 
wasted. These words would sound unnatural if spoken by me, the 
more so that history does not know the cases where the minister 
of finance becomes a farmers' favorite--except after his death. 
[laughter, applause]. 
  May I, therefore, ask the house to permit me, as the 
minister 
of finance, to address the farmers and their representatives in 
a language appropriate for my office. Esteemed farmers, we have 
common business to do. There is money, let us use it better than 
our predecessors. 
  May it please the house. The second government priority, 
after actions consolidating the growing trends, is the slowing 
down of the decrease of expenditures for the public sector, 
which has been decreasing for years. This assumption is to be 
implemented through the increase of the real value of wages, in 
accordance with the law on wages in the public sector, recently 
adopted by the house, and through maintaining real substantive 
expenditures at the level of 1993. Funds for the public sector 
make up nearly half all expenditures. Every pledge in this 
sphere means a great strain for the state budget. The government 
has decided, however, to make such a move, as further cuts for 
the public sector, which used to be a constant practice in the 
past, would mean a threat of complete collapse. 
  We are aware of the fact that employees of the so-called 
public sector have been expecting that this year's budget will 
bring a real increase in expenditure. Unfortunately, it is not 
yet possible, apart from the health and justice ministries. We 
will stop the decrease this year. Progress in this field will 
depend on the scale of future economic growth, discipline in the 
implementation of the budget principles, and on reasonable 
spending. 
  The government plans to speed up work on the implementation 
of generally binding rules of public commissions and the reform 
of the most expensive--apart from social security--part of the 
budget, which is the health service. We will prepare and present 
by the end of the first half of this year a complex idea for the 
reform of the welfare system, which at present burdens the 
budget with the need for subsidies amounting to many millions. 
Also, the systematic handing over of further institutions, which 
provide public services, to local government, should bring about 
the rationalization of public expenditure. 
  The third priority accepted with the drafting of the budget 
for 1994 is the strengthening of the protection system for the 
poorest. The lowest old-age and disability pensions were 
increased as of 1 January by decision of the Sejm. Also, 
spending on social welfare, including that for pregnant women, 
allowances for housing and for new residential and day care 
welfare institutions, will increase considerably. We are aware 
of the fact that resources allocated for this are not 
sufficient. That is why the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy 
and provincial governors, in cooperation with parishes, will 
undertake actions to improve their effectiveness so that only 
those who need these resources most will receive them. 
Additional, significant resources for the poorest will also be 
secured by reform of the system of family allowances. The 
government will put forward to the Sejm the draft law on this 
matter by the end of the first quarter of this year. 
  The problem of fighting unemployment and its negative 
effects 
is closely connected with the social welfare protection of the 
poorest members of society. The basic method of this fight is 
and will remain to increase economic activity and to encourage 
to create new jobs. The allocation of resources in the budget 
takes into account principles of the development of the 
infrastructure which is the part of economy that requires a lot 
of work. Resources for communications, telecommunications and 
construction of the road system will be granted. This will 
enable us to not only make up for our civilization's 
circumstances, but also to create new jobs. First, jobs can be 
created in the construction of communication networks and 
highways, and in industries which produce materials for this 
purpose, and later in the services created. 
  A significant 60 percent increase in active fighting of 
unemployment, which includes public works, is planned in 1994. 
The government will concentrate on regions where they will be 
most effectively used. 
  There are further ways to increase resources for allowances 
for those who are in need. In order to do so decisive steps must 
be taken and incidents of corruption eliminated. I mean here the 
illegal employment of Polish citizens and foreigners, which 
takes place without fear of punishment, avoidance of national 
insurance contribution payments by employing workers on single 
commission contracts. It is also about making more flexible the 
way periods of receiving allowances can be shortened in areas 
where there is a greater chance to find work, or extended in 
other regions. It is also about the implementation of unified 
rules applied to sick payments for state and private enterprises. 
  The government will present the appropriate proposals for 
the 
legislative regulation of all these issues to the esteemed 
chamber in the near future. The government has acknowledged the 
need to assure the resources that are indispensible for the 
successful completion of the operation to reduce foreign debt, 
and as a result the mobilization and effective exploitation of 
foreign capital as the fourth priority. This is a matter of 
fundamental significance, of which not everyone is perhaps 
aware. Poland needs foreign capital for two reasons, at least. 
First, because stable, long-lasting economic growth requires 
investments, and our internal savings are insufficient. Second, 
because we must gain the hard currency resources to help balance 
the deficit in foreign trade and also for the repayment of our 
debts. The inflow of this capital so far seems modest, since 
Poland is constantly treated as a country of increased risk. I 
wish to confirm that Poland is unchangingly interested in a 
final accord as to the reduction and restructuring of foreign 
indebtedness, including one with the London Club. This accord 
should, however, take into account the limited payment and 
budgetary possibilities of our country. 
  Mr. Speaker, may it please the house. The preparation of a 
budget, taking into account the above priorities, is not 
possible on the basis of the budget guidelines prepared by the 
government of Hanna Suchocka. Even with the most optimistic 
implementation programs there would have been a shortfall of at 
least Z20 trillion, without which there could be neither 
additional resources for agriculture nor for the increase of the 
lowest pensions and annuities, nor for investment allowances, 
nor for the assistance of exports and the restructuring of 
industry, nor for the increase of expenditures for social 
welfare assistance. Things would also have to end on a 
successive--already now traditional--cut of expenditures in the 
budgetary sphere. So as to prepare a budget that is in 
accordance with the program of the coalition, but also 
realistic, the government of Waldemar Pawlak has within a short 
period of time prepared the drafts of laws increasing budget 
revenue by a shortfall of 20 trillion, that is, by 1 percent of 
the gross national product. The additional income will come 
primarily from those spheres of our economy where, on account of 
legal allowances, taxes were not paid, and also from those where 
people succeeded in not paying them. An increase in the rates of 
universal taxation is also deemed to be necessary. Here, 
however, the principle was adopted of a just allocation of the 
tax burdens, burdening to a lesser degree the persons with 
average or low incomes. The allowances that could only be fully 
taken advantage of by the rich have been limited. The principles 
of taxation of the churches have been changed. The critics of 
the government's policy make efforts to draw attention to only 
one strand of the income side of the operation, the increase of 
taxes on the personnel incomes of the populace. Meanwhile, 
additional incomes on this account will be lower than the 
incomes that the previous government acquired in 1993 as a 
result of freezing taxation thresholds, to say nothing of the 
fact that this maneuver most strongly effected people on the 
lowest incomes. Changes in taxation principles, such as the 
application of duty-paid seals to excise products, the 
obligation to declare all bank accounts, a wider than hitherto 
application of bank accounts rather than cash payments, a ban on 
lowering incomes from one activity through the addition of 
losses on other activity, a widening of the obligation to 
document expenditures with VAT [value-added tax] invoices, and 
the introduction of lump-sum taxation for some taxpayers will be 
decisive for the increase of revenue. 
  Simultaneously, the appropriate resources have been reserved 
in the budget to ensure an increase in employment and an 
improvement in the remuneration payments for the Treasury and 
the customs services. It is also planned to create a so-called 
customs police, together with a statutory subservience of the 
Main Customs Office to the Minister of Finance. Alongside the 
aforementioned customs seals for excise products, the esteemed 
chamber will have presented to it the drafts of laws on the 
registration and identification of taxpayers and also a law 
improving the implementation of tax inspection. If all these 
activities were not undertaken, incomes would increase by around 
31 percent. This is the result the previous government planned 
to achieve. On the other hand, the draft budget presented to the 
esteemed chamber assumes that incomes will increase by 35.2 
percent, within which the incomes from VAT and excise payments, 
as well as from customs duties--which are in the greatest degree 
associated with the so-called gray sphere--will increase 
respectively by 44 and 39 percent. 
  Taxations on income from enterprises and individuals are, on 
the other hand, rising by only around 30 percent, which is the 
result of the introduction by the government of investment 
allowances, and also the need for repayment to citizens in the 
current year of the taxes overpaid over the last year, which 
also limits the field of maneuver by the government. This year, 
this will be an especially high sum, amounting to around Z7 
trillion. Of other incomes, it is worth mentioning the incomes 
from backlogged taxes that have been or are being abolished, 
inter alia from turnover tax and the obligatory dividend, which 
total Z4.2 trillion. This is the result of the introduction of a 
mechanism for debt restructuring for economic entities on 
account of these taxes, taking the situation at 31 December 
1992, or else 30 June 1993 at the latest with respect to certain 
taxes, and which is assumed in the economic program of the 
coalition. I stress these dates with emphasis, so as to warn the 
enterprises that have in the last few months--counting upon a 
restructuring of debts--ceased to pay their due taxes on time. I 
also draw attention to the fact that this will not be a 
straightforward remission of debts, but the creation of an 
opportunity for enterprises. In exchange for the repayment of 
some of their overdue payments for the current year and the 
coming years [as heard], their remaining part will be deferred, 
and next, even remitted. 
  The increase of incomes assumed in the budget law is very 
high. The government holds the view that their further increase, 
together with an increase in expenditures, could indeed 
facilitate the adoption of the budget, but will thereby hinder 
or altogether make impossible its later implementation. For, if 
it then transpired, after a few months, that the planned incomes 
are not received, and that the assumed budget deficit cannot any 
longer be increased, cuts in expenditures would be necessary, 
and these are always significantly more painful and socially 
embarrassing in the course of the year than when we consciously 
adopt specified limits at the start of the year. The government 
perceives the need for and possibilities of an effective search 
for other sources of budget income. A plan for the transfer of 
road tax into the price of fuel is being considered, which could 
assure additional incomes from motorized foreign tourists. The 
introduction, to a certain degree, of border payments, and also 
the taxation of stock exchange operations--in all of these cases 
however, a careful analysis is required, as is preparation of 
the appropriate legal solutions, and also care. For instance, 
the transfer of road tax requires finding a method of 
compensating parishes [gminy] for their loss of income. The 
universal border payments that are being proposed by some people 
require a careful study of the law in force and at international 
agreements. And a clumsily introduced taxation of the stock 
exchange might lose the State Treasury significant incomes from 
privatization. This issue arouses much emotion, which is why I 
will allow myself to devote it a little more time. 
  Ownership transformations occupy an important place in the 
economic policy of the government--Minister for Ownership 
Transformations Wieslaw Kaczmarek will speak about this more 
widely later. This is reflected in the draft budget, in the 
increase of incomes from privatization from Z7.5 trillion to 
Z12.3 trillion. The basis for such planning is the intention to 
more widely exploit the stock exchange as a source of income for 
the State Treasury. The fact that there is a favorable market 
trend here, and also that this form of privatization enjoys, 
relatively, the greatest social support, constitute a good 
prognosis. 
  The bext examples are given by the flotation of the 
Wielkopolska Credit Bank and the Bank Slaski. The Wielkopolska 
Credit Bank was sold before the bull market began and at prices 
that came to around 80 percent of the book value, which gave to 
the budget around Z350 billion. A few months later, for Bank 
Slaski, the budget gained over Z3 trillion, of which sum half 
was already earned, thanks to the decisions of the present 
cabinet. It is precisely thanks to these incomes that we will be 
able to significantly increase the preferential credits for 
agriculture and increase the resources for restructuring 
industry. 
  We hear words of criticism on the part of various people, 
including those admitting to left-wing views. Once they opposed 
any form of the sale of banks. Now, they have nothing against, 
but are sour about the fact that the Bank Slaski was sold too 
cheaply, expressing the astounding thesis that this sale took 
place at the cost of society. Simultaneously, they demand the 
decisive taxation of stock exchange incomes, counting on 
significant incomes on this account and treating this as a 
litmus test for the left-wing credentials of the government. 
Meanwhile, the benefits to the State Treasury from the bull 
market on the stock exchange exceed all the incomes that are 
capable of being attained from the taxation of stock exchange 
turnover. Rather, it is necessary to consider how to accelerate 
the introduction onto the stock exchange of new companies, 
thereby normalizing its functioning. A tax on incomes would, on 
the other hand, cause a fall in share prices, and thereby a fall 
and not an increase of budgetary incomes. On the other hand, as 
was justly noted by Prime Minister Pawlak in his speech a week 
ago, stock exchange investors obtain significant profits and 
should at least in part share them with the budget. That is why 
the government is analyzing the possibility of applying a small 
treasury payment to stock exchange transactions, and after also 
collecting the indispensible information from foreign stock 
exchanges, will consider the presentation to the esteemed 
chamber of the appropriate draft law. I will repeat once more 
that special care is required, since it is not permitted, for 
any doctrine, irrespective of whether it be liberal or left 
wing, to deprive the budget of incomes intended for important 
social purposes. 
  Mr. Speaker, may it please the house. I have discussed the 
planned expenditures and incomes in the draft state budget for 
1994, concentrating not so much on dry figures as on the guiding 
idea that accompanied the government in the course of its work 
on the budget. I would in similar fashion like to present the 
problem of the budget deficit. It has been set at a level of Z83 
trillion, that is 4.1 percent of the gross national product. 
This is not any kind of magic figure, such as the famous 5 
percent from two years ago. This is also more than the budget 
deficit for 1993. The deficit is after all nothing more than 
just the part of expenditures not covered by incomes. The 
government must thus find another source to finance it. The 
possibilities are in essence, three. First, direct finance by 
the NBP, or more simply, the issue of additional money. The 
government has agreed with the NBP that this finance should come 
to at least Z30 trillion at source, with the option of 
increasing this sum by a further Z5 trillion. In the view of the 
NBP and many experts a further growth of this finance would be 
dangerous for the meeting of one of the fundamental guidelines 
of the budget--lowering the rate of inflation to 27 percent on 
annual average. A second possibility for financing the deficit 
is for the state to borrow from citizens and enterprises in the 
form of the sale to them of state treasury bonds. The government 
assumes a significant increase of this sale, from Z8 trillion to 
Z13 trillion, that is by almost 60 percent, but the 
opportunities here are in an obvious way, limited. Finally, the 
third source is borrowing money from the banks. The budget here 
functions like every other drawer of credit, only that it is an 
especially reliable one. In exchange for credits, the budget 
tranfers treasury bonds to the banks and they must be bought out 
on time, otherwise no bank will grant successive credits. The 
borrowing of money at the banks has, however, two faults. When 
the deficit grows, and with it bank credits for the budget, the 
credit available for the economy falls, which weakens the 
developmental trend. Second, credit is expensive, and the budget 
must pay high interest payments in return. This precisely is the 
famous servicing of the internal debt that burdens the budget 
for 1994 and succeeding years. For these two reasons, counting 
on the fact that the banks will finance any deficit is not only 
unrealistic, but dangerous. 
  The government and the NBP assume that the budget deficit 
now 
finds itself at the limit of the possibilities of its financing 
by the banks. It could even be that the sum exceeds this 
threshold, since the detailed analyses of many, albeit not all, 
government, bank, and independent experts have indicated Z80 
trillion as the maximum sum for the domestic deficit, this of 
course with the inflation rate that has been assumed. This is 
thus with certainty a deficit that is difficult to finance, and 
the government addresses a strong plea for it not to be 
increased by the esteemed chamber in the course of work on the 
budget. 
  Mr. Speaker, may it please the house. The most important 
problem for Poland at the moment is the crisis in public 
finance. In 1991, the costs of servicing the internal debt came 
to Z2.5 trillion; in 1992 it was Z24 trillion; in 1993 it was 
Z48 trillion; in 1993, Z82 trillion. We have already come to a 
point where the size of the deficit and the interest paid to the 
banks for credit granted to cover it, and increasing without a 
break since 1991, are almost equal. With a certain degree of 
simplification, this signifies that all the money that the 
budget will borrow this year for the coverage of the deficit 
will have to be immediately returned to the banks by way of 
repayment of interest. The crisis of the Polish public finances 
is all the greater since we are also repaying interest on 
foreign credits. In 1994, this will cost Z30 trillion, which 
together with the servicing of the internal debt comes to Z112 
trillion, over 50 trillion greater than in 1993. Everyone who is 
not satisfied with this budget must take this fact into account. 
  The question what to do next should be asked. The government 
treats this problem seriously. Soon after the draft budget was 
submitted to the Sejm we started to work on possible ways of 
development of the state budget in 1995, and even further until 
1997. Only the prediction that we will soon put forward will be 
able to plan further, long-term activities, including working 
out realistic principles of the socioeconomic policy until 1997. 
  The government hopes that such budget predictions will be 
widely discussed in the parliament, by economists, trade unions, 
employees, and employers. It seems that Poland must go through 
not one but at least two major tests during the period of 
transformation. We have put behind us the shock therapy of 
1990-91. Another test is ahead of us--overcoming the crisis in 
public finances. We are convinced that together we will find the 
best way out of this difficult situation. 
  May it please the house. In the discussion on Prime Minister 
Pawlak's statement last week some deputies expressed doubts on 
whether or not the government has an economic program. Well, 
Prime Minister Pawlak's government has the program and, what is 
more, this program is no secret. It was widely presented in the 
coalition agreement adopted by the Polish Peasant Party and the 
Democratic Left Alliance at the beginning of October 1993. The 
government is faithful to this program, and slowly but 
consistently implements it. This program has certain gaps, we 
are not hiding this fact, because some problems have been left 
to be discussed later. 
  The coalition is new, and learning, and this process is not 
strange or unusual. However, the program is something different 
from concrete laws, decisions, and instructions, which are the 
tools for its implementation. Those tools are systematically 
created according to the hierarchy and time necessary to carry 
out an analysis. First, laws have already been adopted by the 
chamber and they have been implemented. Today, on behalf of the 
government I have presented the most important of those 
tools--the draft budget law. 
  The government fully supports preferences from the election 
programs written into the coalition agreement. Not all of them 
can be immediately implemented, for obvious reasons--lack of 
resources. The conflict between long-term commitments and the 
present ones has been the main dilemma for the economy from its 
very beginnings. The welfare of states and societies always 
depends on whether this dilemma is wisely solved. If we can rise 
above particular interests of the groups and look at the budget 
with the long-term interests of the state in mind and secure 
consistent and joint implementation of its aims, then in the 
next few years we will consolidate economic development and 
speed up investments, increase exports and improve 
competitiveness on international markets. We will create better 
conditions for integration with the EC, we will overcome the 
crisis in public finances. We will stop and slowly limit the 
extent of unemployment, and finally we will cure the system of 
services and social welfare. 
  The draft budget for 1994 mirrors the choice made between 
right, but competing aims. I am deeply convinced that time will 
show that choices made by us were right. As to repeated 
accusations of continuation and not sufficient changes, I will 
repeat what we have been saying over and over again. We admit 
that we want to continue the stabilization of the economy, the 
limitation of inflation, and the reshaping of inefficient 
structures. On the other hand, we are changing to a more active 
stance toward investments, exports and agriculture, and also 
moving toward a privatization policy that is more pragmatic and 
favorable to the interests of working people. We are 
strengthening the protection of the poorest, we are holding back 
the degradation of the budgetary sphere, we are more justly 
allocating burdens and sacrifices. We want to have a pragmatic 
policy, free from superflous ideology and doctrinarianism, and 
according to the principle: As much continuation as is 
necessary, as much change as is possible. 
  Mr. Speaker, deputies. The budget for 1994 is in your hands.

<F P=106> [Article by B.I.W.: "It Does Not Fulfill Anyone's Dreams; </F>
Unofficially on the Budget"] 
  [Text] "This budget has been presented by a 
government formed by the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] and the 
Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and was established as a result of 
our decisions. We should help the budget with our actions." This 
is the way Aleksander Kwasniewski appealed to the SLD Sejm 
deputies during the Wednesday [5 January] session of the SLD 
Deputies Club. Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak is said to have 
tried to explain to the PSL's Sejm deputies "how this kind of 
domestic debt came about and how the budget corresponds to 
keeping election promises." Most of the opposition Sejm deputies 
as well as the Union of Labor and some trade unionists who are 
members of the SLD intend to take a look at the budget draft in 
the Sejm commissions, even though they basically think it is 
bad. 
  The Pawlak government's budget draft was the main 
preoccupation of Sejm deputies in their unofficial talks, 
especially during sessions of the various parliamentary clubs on 
Wednesday. But there was not too much fuss about it. The draft, 
which "fulfills nobody's dreams" but which could not be any 
other way (as Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and finance 
minister, told his deputies) was perceived with calm before its 
first reading. "As far as I know, this is a special kind of law, 
which cannot be rejected at its first reading. It must find its 
way to the commission," said Jerzy Osiatynski of the Democratic 
Union [UD], who added that UD cannot approve of this budget 
because it is an instrument for implementing an economic policy 
that is different from that of UD. 
  Leszek Moczulski, chairman of the Confederation for an 
Independent Poland, called the draft a budget "of national 
disaster," and he also said that his party has not yet decided 
on a course of action, but it does not rule out submitting a 
motion for rejecting the draft at its first reading. 
  Borowski said during a session of the SLD Sejm Deputies Club 
that he hopes the PSL "will approve of the draft even though it 
will not be happy with it." Someone from the audience said at 
the beginning of the PSL Sejm Deputies Club's session that the 
budget is not satisfactory because it is not a budget of 
transformations. According to Janusz Piechocinski, in its 
statement in the Sejm, the PSL will be asking questions on the 
meaning behind the budget--and on what it is supposed to lead 
to--in the context of a four-year term of office by the 
government. They will also be asking what proportion of 
election-time promises the budget fulfills. "Borowski will have 
to respond outright: We will do this and this but not that or 
that because these will be included in the next budget." 
  "The PSL expects," he added, "that, while presenting the 
draft in the Sejm, Borowski will make it clear that its shape is 
a result of necessities, including servicing both the foreign 
and the domestic debt." 
  While answering questions from SLD members about to what 
extent the budget is a continuation and to what extent it 
represents change, Borowski jokingly replied that it is a "new 
budget to the extent of 3 percent because this is by how much 
revenues exceed what would have been in a draft submitted by 
Hanna Suchocka's Cabinet." He said the latter revenues are 
somewhat "tightened up." 
  Kwasniewski made an appeal to "think positively" about the 
draft and to reconcile the "harsh economic reality with social 
expectations." He also said that, on the issue of submitting the 
budget before the commission, just as during the entire vote on 
the budget, a strict, clubwide discipline will be enforced in 
the SLD. Stanislaw Wisniewski, deputy chairman of the All-Polish 
Trade Unions Agreement, told RZECZPOSPOLITA later that, in that 
case, he may be absent from the vote. He will not oppose the 
budget during its first reading, but he does not have great 
hopes that the commissions will manage to improve it 
significantly. That is why he will be counting on 30-40 SLD 
members to support his position during the final vote on the 
budget. Another deputy chairman, Waclaw Martyniuk, thinks it is 
just simple "trade union rhetoric," while, regarding the vote, 
he will... at this point he snapped two of his fingers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Moving on From Esprit and Race"] </F>
  [Text] ESPRIT [European Strategic Program for Research and 
Development in Information Technologies], the first major EC 
R&amp;D 
programme and the pattern for most of the others that followed, 
is dead. RACE [Research and Development in Advanced 
Communications Technologies in Europe], too, has become past 
history. But as with John Brown, their souls go marching on in 
the shape of the current programme on "Telematic Systems of 
General Interest", or STIG, as it is often referred to in 
Brussels, after the initials of its title in French. 
  According to the Commission, by contrast with ESPRIT and 
RACE, STIG is mainly an application oriented programme. It has 
seven sub-programmes which bring together: 
  -- Users from areas of major economic and social importance; 
  -- System and service providers from the information 
technology and telecommunications sectors. 
  The Seven sub-programmes, with their budgets in mecu 
[million 
European Currency Units] are (April 1993): Administrations 
(41.64); Transport Services (125.42); Health Care (97.8); 
Flexible and Distance Learning (DELTA); Libraries (22.69); 
Linguistic Research and Engineering (22.69); and Rural Areas 
(14.11). 
<H5>  Background </H5>
  Modern economies are moving towards the information age. In 
future, industrial efficiency and the delivery and quality of 
services will increasingly depend on information and 
communication technologies. Over the next decade, most 
information is expected to take the same form as computer data. 
The cost of this process is almost certain to drop sharply. 
  Very large gains in productivity will be made if a common 
European infrastructure can be provided for the research, 
industrial, service and user organisations involved in these 
areas. A prerequisite for the necessary large scale investment 
is an investigation into applications that would benefit from 
existing and emerging technologies. 
<H5>  Objectives </H5>
  The objectives of STIG are to promote cooperation between 
industry and service providers and to define a response to the 
needs of users and the developing market. Work on 
interoperability and standards will aim to remove a major 
barrier to free competition. 
<H5>  Some Achievements so Far </H5>
  STIG has drawn over 1,000 participants into its projects, 
concerted actions, and "accompanying measures". 
  Although the individual actions under STIG began by growing 
autonomously from their different contexts, they have gradually 
developed similar approaches in addressing RTD [Community 
Research and Technological Development] topics: 
  -- Identification of end-user requirements. 
  -- Determination of the technology and system engineering 
implications of these requirements. 
  -- Assessment of the techno-economic impact of the 
application. 
  -- The development of common functional specifications. 
  -- Piloting and validation of advanced telematics services 
irrespective of geographic location. 
  -- Identification of appropriate targets for standardisation 
in order to accelerate the implementation of telematics 
applications Europe wide. 
  -- Diffusion of results and know-how, and transfer of 
technology Europe wide. 
  -- Promotion of awareness of the impact of, and the 
opportunities for, these telematics applications. 
<H5>  Some Key Results </H5>
  The Health Care programme has created a common platform in 
its fragmented sector for researchers, health care providers and 
users, improving, through collaboration, the prospects for more 
effective competition. 
  Issues addressed include acute, chronic and specialised 
care, 
care in the home, and remote or sparsely populated areas. The 
programme has led to the establishment by CEN [European 
Standards Committee] of a technical committee for medical 
informatics. A laboratory reporting system has been set up to 
serve general practitioners. A tele-service is being set up 
which will enable donors and recipients of human bone marrow to 
be matched on a Europe wide basis. 
  The transport programme is paving the way for the 
development 
of the Europe wide availability of services and the 
interoperability of in-vehicle equipment, involving 
standardisation and regulatory action at European level. 
Research is being conducted on common equipment and credit 
arrangements to permit non-stop electronic toll collection and 
payment for parking and public transport throughout Europe. 
R&amp;D 
on safety includes anti-collision systems and vehicle and driver 
monitoring equipment. 
  The Flexible and Distance Learning programme is developing a 
standard work station for learners and tutors and a distributed 
network to join and interlink users at a distance. An 
experimental European training network has been set up to enable 
broadcasts by satellite of live TV training sessions with a 
low-cost video- conference to interconnect students with tutors, 
and a low-cost specialised satellite service is being researched 
to link Europe's Open Universities. 
<H5>  Telematics in the Fourth Framework Programme and Beyond </H5>
  Future EC Telematics research, the Commission has stated, 
will aim to: 
  -- Promote generic and seamlessly integrated information 
systems, providing swift, accurate, reliable and user friendly 
access to the full body of relevant information; 
  -- Increase the competitiveness of European system suppliers 
and service providers in the international market place by 
developing trans-European telematics solutions to specific 
applications based on the integration of distributed, networked, 
heterogeneous hardware and software platforms; 
  -- Shorten implementation time frames to maximise the 
financial returns to suppliers, by encouraging the development 
of only those systems which are clearly needed, and where 
telematics solutions are cost effective; 
  -- Promote best practice and open standards; 
  -- Build on previous telematics activities in Europe, while 
monitoring international developments to ensure that appropriate 
opportunities for European RTD are not missed; 
  -- Raise awareness of the economic benefits of telematics 
systems where specific users' needs have been identified by 
analysing the likely cost effectiveness of RTD in the particular 
application, and assist in the adoption of telematics 
technologies in new areas of application.

<F P=106> [Article by Jochen Wagner: "Crafty Accounting in Toepfer's </F>
Budget -- Little Future for New Environment Projects"] 
  [Text] The Federal Government intends to spend an overall 
total of more than 478 billion German marks [DM], DM1.35 billion 
of which have been allocated to Federal Environment Minister 
Klaus Toepfer. The opposition prophesies doom: "He can't even 
pay the branch office's phone bill with that." In spite of the 
budget cuts announced across the board, the Environment Minister 
can still show an increase of about DM90 million on paper. 
  According to the present draft, the Environment Ministry's 
budget includes a total of DM626.9 million in individual budget 
16 solely for the Federal Radiological Safety Office in 
Salzgitter, the major item -- around DM549 million -- being the 
neutralization and permanent storage of radioactive waste. 
  Over DM151 million have been earmarked for reactor safety 
and 
radiological safety, including DM21 million for improving plant 
safety at Soviet-design nuclear power stations. About DM52 
million have been injected into the budget for nuclear safety 
purposes. Other major budget items are the ministry itself, with 
about DM100 million, and the Federal Environment Agency with 
around DM93 million. The Federal Research Station for Nature 
Conservation and Rural Ecology has DM20.3 million, nature 
conservation in general receiving DM67.4 million. 
<H5>  Job Cuts </H5>
  The Federal Environment Ministry as such shows a total of 
806 
established posts for 1994 -- 34 less than this year. Posts at 
the Federal Environment Agency have fallen from 839 to 824, 
whereas jobs with the Federal Research Station have increased 
from 189 to 195. The Federal Radiological Safety Office is 
reducing posts from 580 to 574. This means a cutback from 2,448 
to 2,399 -- an overall loss of 49 posts. 
  The Environment Minister was shown no pity by his political 
competitors in the battle for cash. The costly "dynosaurian 
technology" that nuclear power entailed was held up as the main 
culprit for the financial imbalance within the environment 
budget. "We deplore the fact that, yet again, you have emerged 
from this year's budget savings round stripped bare. You owe 
your budget increase to crafty accounting. Permanent items in 
the radiological safety and reactor safety section artificially 
inflate the budget, but the room for maneuver in your 
appropriation is becoming smaller and smaller. More and more 
money is being spent as a result of the Federal Government's 
failed nuclear policy, and at the same time less is going to 
pioneering environment technologies, environment research, and 
traditional nature conservation, not to mention investment in 
the environment in the new laender," said SPD [Social Democratic 
Party of Germany] deputy Marion Caspers-Merk, criticizing the 
new budget in the Bundestag. 
  To rub salt into the wound, she accused the Federal 
Environment Minister of "incompetence in environment policy," 
referred to Toepfer's statements in the media as "a mixture of 
attempts at self-justification, buck-passing, and juggling with 
words," criticized his "passive stance," and opined that, 
"Toepfer, the environment policymaker, has no fight left in him." 
  Klaus-Dieter Feige (Alliance 90/Greens) said, "The emptiness 
of environment policy also finds expression in the federal 
budget for 1994. Once funds for radiological safety have been 
deducted, all that remains to the Federal Environment Minister 
is a risible DM200 million, about DM80 million less than in 
1993." 
  Dagmar Enkelmann (PDS [Party of Democratic 
Socialism]/Leftwing List) described the Bonn Environment 
Ministry's new budget as a "hoax package or an atomic waste 
budget." "With over DM1.3 billion, the 1994 draft budget shows 
an increase of 7.1 percent over 1993. However, viewed 
realistically, the environment budget remains stationary at 0.3 
percent of the overall budget." 
  Hans Georg Wagner of the SPD said, "It is not hard to see 
that the environment minister is once again the great loser. 
The actual environment and nature conservation sector has 
suffered a DM64 million or 3.3 percent cut in real terms. If we 
add the cuts suffered in the 1993 budget, the environment's 
share in the budget has taken a 17 percent cut since 1992. 
Since 1992, when the situation in the new laender caused an 
explosive growth in environmental problems for us all, the 
budget has shrunk by nearly one-fifth. We no longer have an 
environment policy in the true sense of the term. The federal 
environment minister is a loudspeaker for environment policy." 
<H5>  "Looks" Do not Matter </H5>
  In his 10-minute speech, the federal environment minister 
barely referred to the massive objections voiced by the 
opposition. Instead, Toepfer trotted out a series of well-worn 
statements, brandishing a sort of balance sheet as his 
contribution to the budget debate. "Our environment policy in 
Germany has created jobs. Environment policy currently provides 
employment for 680,000 people in Germany. About 50,000 people 
are directly employed in environmental reclamation as a labor 
market policy measure. In recent times we have employed 120,000 
people under job creation schemes. About 15,000 people are 
usefully employed on reclamation work in the lignite mining 
industry. The federal and land governments spend DM2-3 billion 
a year on this item; this spending does not appear in my budget, 
but 75 percent of it is borne by the Federal Government. What 
matters is that we get the environmental reclamation done, not 
whether I would like a better-looking budget." 
  Toepfer pronounced himself in favor of the creation of a 
disposal infrastructure involving private industry. "We need an 
environmental infrastructure for sewage treatment and waste 
disposal facilities, and for reclaiming contaminated land that 
we have inherited from the centrally planned economy of the 
former GDR. We want to attract private capital as well for this 
purpose. In the new federal laender, 46 sewage treatment plants 
are currently being planned or built, or have already been 
completed, with private capital -- DM4.3 billion are being 
mobilized. I should be happy if as many private sewage works 
had been built in the original federal laender in the whole 
40-year history of the Federal Republic. Hats off to those who 
have assumed responsibility there and achieved this. This is 
growth policy and environment policy rolled into one. We shall 
pursue it to the best effect." 
<H5>  Morsleben Can Still Be Used </H5>
  Referring to the dispute over nuclear waste disposal, 
Toepfer 
stressed that all forces in the Federal Republic, regardless of 
their ideas as to the duration and exploitation of nuclear 
power, had to reach a consensus on disposal. Referring to the 
controversial Morsleben permanent disposal store, Toepfer said: 
"Morsleben can legally be operated until the year 2000. The 
Nuclear Safety Commission has pronounced the Morsleben store 
still usable. The storage quality will be changed, and the waste 
will not be stored at the taxpayers' expense; the cost will be 
passed on in the form of fees to those who store material there." 
  Toepfer said that he aimed to abolish ecological subsidies. 
This meant altering prices, as prices changed behavior and 
brought about technological developments. This road toward an 
ecological market economy was more successful than ecological 
regulations imposed from above or planned economy 
considerations. The Federal Republic already enjoyed a 
worldwide reputation for environment engineering. 
  Individual budget 16 also features a couple of interesting 
items. For instance, the federal minister receives an annual 
salary of DM275,000 inclusive of local weighting, plus an annual 
official expenses allowance of DM7,200 and a per diem allowance, 
albeit reduced to take account of the per diem etc. to which he 
is entitled as a Bundestag deputy. The parliamentary 
secretaries of state receive annual salaries of approximately 
DM65,000 less. The "secret fund" at the minister's disposal for 
extraordinary service-related expense in special cases contains 
another DM60,000 for 1994, and there are DM380,000 more for 
public relations work. Another DM14.7 million are earmarked for 
work designed to raise public awareness (pamphlets, films, 
informative material), inclusive of DM69,000 for technical 
publications. 
  DM325,000 are budgeted for the official vehicle fleet, and 
an 
approximate total of DM3.8 million for traveling expenses, DM3.5 
million for the ministry's telecommunications bill, and just 
DM2.6 million for data processing. Long-distance data 
transmission alone costs around DM300,000. The books and 
periodicals budget amounts to DM995,000. 
  The German Nature Conservation Circle receives DM485,000 and 
the German Council for the Care of the Countryside DM321,000 in 
subsidies. Further subsidies to the tune of DM450,000 are 
awarded for schemes run by various nature conservation groups 
and associations. DM3.6 million are earmarked for dues payable 
to international organizations, and the United Nations 
Environment Fund due amounts to DM10.8 million. Dues to smaller 
international organizations (waterfowl research, lesser whales) 
come to about DM1.75 million. The Association of German 
Engineers receives about DM3 million for the "clean air" 
program, and a similar sum goes to the Environmental Standards 
Institute. Operating expenses for the Environmental Sample 
Bank, which will gradually begin to cover the whole federal area 
from 1994, rise from the current DM5.5 million to DM6.86 million. 
  Party disputes notwithstanding, as far as alternative 
figures 
in the Bonn government camp are concerned, SPD environment 
spokesman Michael Mueller said, "If Toepfer were to go, it would 
be even worse." 
<H5>  Brief Interview: Grave Error </H5>
  The interview with Federal Environment Minister Toepfer was 
conducted by our colleagues from the French periodical 
L'ENVIRONNEMENT MAGAZINE [EM], which publishes the original 
version in full and which has kindly allowed UMWELTMAGAZIN to 
print the following extract. 
  [EM] Do you really believe it is possible to reconcile the 
market economy with ecology? 
  [Toepfer] To be perfectly honest, yes. But the market 
economy can only solve its problems if it absorbs its 
environment protection costs. In a market economy, everyone 
tries to cut costs or offload them on to others or onto nature. 
This is one of its basic principles. My motive for introducing 
environment taxes is not to take more money from the taxpayer 
but to induce polluters to mend their ways. German industry 
complains about an excess of environment protection charges and 
claims that this is detrimental to competitiveness. The 
professional associations echo this cry. I have never tired of 
repeating that a proper environment policy creates new jobs, but 
in the current time of crisis the first item to be deleted from 
the budget is environment protection. In my opinion, this is a 
grave error that will create enormous problems in the future. 
  [EM] Are GATT and environment protection compatible? 
  [Toepfer] Of course. I have recently discussed this with 
Brice Lalonde, who is currently drafting a report on this very 
issue. In any case, I believe that environment protection as a 
concept must gradually find its way in so as not to halt the 
GATT machinery, by which I mean not leaving those countries that 
practise ecological dumping a free hand.

<F P=106> [Article by Hans-Juergen Mahnke: "Krueger Sets Sights on </F>
Alliances in Space -- Research Minister Does not Intend to 
Economize on Space Program"] 
  [Text] As Federal Research Minister Paul Krueger (CDU 
[Christian Democratic Union]) sees it, German industry must step 
up its research effort. It was true, he said, that there were 
good reasons for industry's share in research spending having 
fallen from 62 to 58 percent, but in Japan, for example, 
industry footed 80 percent of the research bill. "We must 
devise new approaches," Krueger told DIE WELT. As soon as he 
had taken office in May, he had appointed a strategy think tank 
comprising renowned representatives from the worlds of science, 
the economy, and politics. 
  A priority task was to amend the law -- he referred 
specifically to the laws on genetic engineering, animal 
protection, chemicals, and data protection -- so that 
innovations would no longer be thwarted. A lasting improvement 
had also to be achieved in the public's attitude to research. 
  Greater openmindedness with regard to research work had to 
be 
fostered, although the risks should not be swept under the 
carpet. Another priority was to convert recent findings into 
products: "We have outstanding basic research," but there were 
problems when it came to converting findings into new products. 
  He did not intend to economize on space projects. Unmanned 
space flight was increasingly approaching the commercial 
viability stage. However, one country could not shoulder 
larger-scale problems alone, and Krueger sets his sights on 
collaboration with the Americans and Russians in this connection. 
  Krueger is satisfied "by and large" with his ministry's 
budget appropriation. Although it had not been raised, he had 
obtained an extra 150 million German marks [DM] for work in 
eastern Germany in the budget debate. He hoped that this would 
primarily enable him to accelerate industrial research, as only 
1.9 percent of exported goods came from eastern Germany. 
  Nevertheless, a sword of Damocles in the shape of a DM5 
billion cut in the federal budget hung over his ministerial 
accounts, although he hoped that his ministry would not be 
seriously affected by it. He no longer had to put up the 
funding for the transrapid, but this in itself hardly eased the 
strain on his budget, as he still had to provide DM50 million a 
year for the associated research. Moreover, one of his 
ministry's future priority concerns was to be transport research.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Research and University Minister </F>
Umberto Colombo by MEDIA DUEMILA correspondent Giampiero 
Gramaglia, place and date not given: "Support For Research To 
Increase Employment" -- first five paragraphs are MEDIA DUEMILA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Umberto Colombo follows the tradition started by 
Antonio Ruberti (and immediately interrupted) of having a 
scientist who is a specialist at the ministry of research and 
universities. During this interview with MEDIA DUEMILA, Colombo 
describes the difficulties of a ministry, that more than many 
others, and with less justification, is being affected by the 
sacrifices of a period of crisis. 
  He was, almost without interruption, president of the ENEA 
[National Agency for New Technologies, Energy, and the 
Environment] from the end of the seventies to his nomination as 
minister in May. Colombo is 66 years old and comes from 
Leghorn, the same city as Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime 
minister. 
  He graduated with a degree in physical chemistry from Pavia 
and then taught applied chemistry. Between 1967 and 1979 he was 
director of the Donegani research institute and was, therefore, 
responsible for the development strategies of Montedison. In 
1979 he was nominated president of what was then the CNEN (today 
ENEA), a position that he left for a period of four months 
(November 1982-February 1983) to take on the presidency of ENI 
[National Hydrocarbons Corporation]. He returned to the CNEN in 
March 1983, at the time when the CNEN became the ENEA. 
  Whilst he was president, ENEA changed from being responsible 
for nuclear energy at a national level, to managing three types 
of initiatives: the new technologies, energy (not just nuclear 
energy), and the environment. In recent years, under the 
guidance of Colombo, the attention of the ENEA has turned to the 
problems of global climatic changes (the greenhouse effect) and 
of development that is in harmony with our resources. 
  Umberto Colombo is on the executive committee of the Rome 
club, and is a member of the Academia dei Lincei. In 1984 he 
won the Honda international prize for environmental technology. 
  [MEDIA DUEMILA] Italy is the G7 country that spends the 
least on research as a percentage of GNP. You denounced this 
situation more than once before you became minister. What are 
you doing now, and what do you intend to do to change this 
situation? What margins do you have for maneuvers in the 
current context of reductions in public expenditure? 
  [Colombo] We know that Italy's financial commitment to 
research and higher education is rather modest when compared to 
that of the other countries that we are usually compared with 
and we are doing everything possible to balance this situation 
despite difficulties regarding public funding. R&amp;D 
expenditure 
is about 1.4 percent of GNP. This is about half what the other 
major western countries spend. The universities are in a 
similar situation. Not only does Italy have a low level of 
expenditure, but the efficiency with which this expenditure is 
managed is also weak. 
  The most significant room for maneuver that we have at this 
time is that of improving efficiency and effectiveness. We are 
putting a lot of effort in this direction, using a number of 
different mechanisms: the coordination of programs, the 
evaluation and checking of the merit of research projects that 
are supported by public funding, and the streamlining of 
procedures. 
  [MEDIA DUEMILA] Italian research has often had little to do 
with industrial applications and production. It has given 
priority to the fundamental and theoretical aspects. What do 
you think can be done to assist the transfer of innovation to 
industry, and eventually through the introduction of laws? How 
do you think any such action could improve the competitiveness 
of the Italian system and, furthermore, influence economic 
recovery and employment? 
  [Colombo] By nature research must be subdivided into several 
levels, ranging from free basic research, to that with a 
fundamental direction, and the applied research that is 
conducted by industry. The problem is that of establishing forms 
of coordination between these various levels, singling out the 
subjects that are also of strategic importance for university 
and public research in such a way as to create the conditions 
required for technological development. 
  We are putting these guidelines into practice by creating 
special commissions to direct research leading to the main 
socioeconomic goals that are of interest to the country. 
  Every program should be monitored by expert evaluators from 
now on. They will also see to the exploitation of the results 
that are obtained in order to help transfer the results of 
public research. Then the peer review methods that are usual in 
advanced countries will also be applied in Italy. 
  The effort of bringing our industry up to the potential of 
international competition requires the technological development 
that is obtained from being able to translate the results of 
research into innovation, particularly by favoring small and 
medium-sized companies. We are therefore promoting and 
reinforcing public and private instruments to support these 
actions: technological information bureaus, information 
networks, and networks providing company support and bringing 
the researchers in specific geographical areas together. 
Support for valid research is also a condition for maintaining 
and structurally developing employment in the country. Our 
culture has not understood well that it is only possible to keep 
jobs by promoting competitive production at an international 
level and quickly preparing products to meet a demand that is 
rapidly evolving. Technology is the key instrument for 
attaining these goals. 
  [MEDIA DUEMILA] In which sectors of advanced research do you 
think Italy is best placed in a European and world context? On 
the other hand, in which sectors do you think the greatest 
efforts should be made? I would like your reply to concentrate 
on the sectors that are potentially strategic for the "Year 2000 
Horizon" including telecommunications, computers, semiconductors 
and biotechnologies. 
  [Colombo] It is true that generally speaking Italy holds an 
inferior position on the scientific and technological front with 
respect to the other advanced countries. However, it is also 
true that our research system is capable of exhibiting peaks of 
high, or extremely high, qualification in certain sectors. This 
is often thanks to individual researchers, or excellent small 
research groups. The problem is that these peaks cannot be 
amassed, or become a structural school. 
  The main exception to this picture is that of high energy 
and 
nuclear physics, where the great traditions of the Italian 
school have been maintained in a preeminent position at an 
international level. We must try to develop these points of 
excellence in order to generate science-based productive 
activities around them. 
  We are behind in the dominant and emerging technologies, 
such 
as computer science, advanced materials, and the new 
biotechnologies. Therefore our effort is being aimed at finding 
the strong points that can be levered, and these are not lacking 
here either, and singling out the scientific and technological 
segments that are structurally valid. In order to do this, we 
need to work closely with industry. Industry can work alongside 
the State effort, if we have a more longsighted strategic vision 
than at present. 
  [MEDIA DUEMILA] Italian research has never played the role 
of a lion at an EC level; and it has rarely managed to get a 
slice of the EC funding cake that was even equal to the sums 
paid in. Furthermore, the participation of small and 
medium-sized companies in EC programs has hitherto been less 
than was expected. What initiatives have you taken, or do you 
intend to take to avoid delays and shortages? As far as the new 
EC research program for the coming years is concerned, what 
activities do you think Italian interest should be concentrated 
on? 
  [Colombo] Italy does not manage to obtain the just return 
for research with respect to the contributions paid to the 
European Community. What are the reasons for this? A small 
volume of industrial research that mainly has short-term goals 
can only make the acquisition of European contracts difficult. 
  Analogously, the small amount of internationalization of the 
companies, particularly the small companies, makes it difficult 
for them to find partners in other countries, and this is 
necessary to have access to EC funding. We are working to 
improve this situation by reinforcing the technical support 
structures at the ministry, with the inclusion of a strong 
industrial component, that had little presence before. 
  [MEDIA DUEMILA] What is your opinion of the research 
priorities that have been hitherto suggested by the EC research 
programs that have been managed by Italian commissioners and by 
EUREKA [European Research Coordination Agency] since 1989? Do 
you think that the innovation gap between Europe and the world 
partners, the United States and Japan, is closing up or widening? 
  [Colombo] Unfortunately we must recognize that, although 
praiseworthy efforts have been made, the gap is widening, and 
Europe is losing ground. This is due to the fact that it has 
not known how to gain competitive advantage from new factors 
that were not its traditional ones. This does not mean that the 
EC and EUREKA programs have not been useful. In fact, without 
them, things would have been undoubtedly worse. They have not 
sufficed, because they have not been aggressive enough. The 
definition of EC programs takes an intrinsically long time, and 
the "bottom-up" type process of EUREKA finishes with dispersive 
choices being made. Lengthy timing, too many projects, little 
concentration of resources, and above all a conservative 
attitude that does not completely renew goals and productive, 
organizational, and administrative structures, are the European 
problems, that EUREKA and the EC programs do not manage to 
overcome, but only to ease. 
  [MEDIA DUEMILA] You have recently spent four months as a 
commissioner of the Italian Space Agency. Are there conditions 
for relaunching Italian space activity, and if so what are they, 
and how are they set out? 
  [Colombo] The space agency is coming out of a state of 
crisis that has characterized the last few years of its work. 
This has, in part, been due to the problems that were created 
by the lack of a clear definition in the law that set it up. 
The space sector is a sector that looks to the future. Here 
Italy has won a position of respect, both in Europe, and at a 
world level. We need to make better use of the resources 
available. Amongst other things, we must create a better 
synergy than in the past between civilian space and military 
space, given that the international political picture has 
changed, and consequently the technological goals that defense 
must have in the space sector are different. More in general, 
and not just with reference to space, it is important to focus 
on the problem of the so-called "dual use" products, so that the 
general crisis of the defense industry does not strike again on 
the national production machine.

<F P=106> [Article by Juergen Berke, Burkhard Boendel, Iris Roethig, </F>
Stefan Wichmann, Wolfgang Kempkens [for boxed item]: "Sentenced 
to Die in Installments"; Subheadline: "In the Land of the 
Philosophers, Innovations Grow Scarce. Faced with Enormous 
Hurdles, Numerous Developers Have to Give Up"] 
  [Text] The site of the wrongdoing is Goettingen. 
Unbeknownst to the innovative-shy management, engineers for 
Fischer and Porter, manufacturers of measuring instruments, are 
accomplishing things independently of any bureaucratic process 
of authorization and without arousing any suspicion. For weeks, 
the highly motivated tinkerers have been pursuing a product 
idea. They have been clandestinely siphoning off funds from 
other development projects, building a prototype and testing it 
on their annual leave time. 
  After six months now, the conspirators are presenting to a 
nonplused management the first measured-dose device that will 
control the operation of bottling plants for foodstuffs and 
medicines with milliliter precision. Department head Frank Otto 
gushes gleefully: "The system currently ranks among our 
promising future products with annual growth rates of up to 30 
percent." 
  The case of the Goetting developers is symptomatic of the 
research climate in Germany. In the land of the philosophers, 
fresh ideas are not raised. For fear of financial risks, 
innovations are, in fact, often nipped in the bud or else they 
get hung up in the tangle of management wrangles, petty 
departmental rivalries or support guidelines. And if, despite 
this, they do get launched, there is a shortage of capital or 
management quite simply stifles their transformation into 
successful products. In order to skirt such obstructionism, the 
few really creative German researchers currently tinker 
furtively 10-20 percent of their time. This is the alarming 
conclusion reached in an empirical study by Peter Augsdoerfer, a 
doctoral candidate at the University of Sussex in Brighton, 
England. 
  Creative individuals fare similarly. In the Federal 
Republic, 
geniuses, those bursts of color in the day-to-day dullness of 
research, are hardly welcomed any longer. Their work is 
routinely frustrated. 
  The debate on the position of the research and development 
sectors continues to intensify. This is because the country that 
went on to become one of the world's major economic powers 
through trailblazing inventions like the automobile, turbine, 
plastic, aspirin, chemical dyes, machine tools and countless 
anti-pollution systems, is running out of creative steam. 
According to Martin Benkenstein, professor of innovation 
management in Rostock, that means an "installment-plan death 
sentence" for Germany. 
  It cannot be attributed to insufficient support for 
research. 
There is hardly any other country that pumps so much money into 
this sector. Last year, industry alone made nearly DM47.5 
billion available. In turn, organized creativity in major 
research, universities and research institutes costs the 
Federation and the states DM33 billion. Representing a 2.58 
percent share of the gross domestic product, only Japan (3.04 
percent) and the U.S. (2.78 percent) are on a comparable level. 
But Hartmut Weule, managing director for research at 
Daimler-Benz AG, adjusts the ratios: fewer than DM5 billion 
(interview page 112) go for future projects. 
  That may be one of many reasons why, compared with Japanese 
and American success stories, the output of innovative products 
is alarmingly scant or at least drags on for too long. As a 
study surveying over 2,000 research projects from 164 companies, 
by the Duesseldorf corporate consultancy firm of Kienbaum and 
partners reveals, on average, it takes almost 10 years in 
Germany to reach the threshold of profitability.

  No wonder corporate and industrial researchers are 
increasingly worried about their competitiveness. In full page 
advertisements, BASF director Juergen Strube sees the 
"propitious climate for innovation" jeopardized. Hans-Juergen 
Warnecke, president of the Fraunhofer Society, is already 
alluding to a "crisis in innovation." Most German firms share 
this alarming assessment. Commissioned by WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE, the 
Dortmund Forsa Institute discovered that only 34 percent of 
surveyed firms find the current research climate stimulating. 
Nearly 38 percent feel it is rather inhibiting. An additional 28 
percent found themselves unable to render a verdict. Another 
result is also upsetting: almost 50 percent of those surveyed 
blithely declared that they did not have a single penny left 
over for research. 
  Paul Krueger must have sensed the disaster. In order to 
salvage what is still salvageable, the federal minister of 
research and technology hurriedly latched onto an idea of his 
predecessor, Matthias Wissmann and in late September he set up 
the "research and technology panel" to steer Germany out of its 
innovation lethargy. Edzard Reuter, head of Daimler Benz, and 
Heinrich von Pierer, chairman of the board at Siemens AG, are 
also members of the illustrious panel that has seven top 
representatives each from the business and academic worlds and 
one trade union member. 
  The research policy seminar will have to probe deeply into 
the subject. This is because the reasons for the technological 
deficiencies are to found not so much in the oft lamented long 
and drawn out authorization process, a society that is hostile 
to technology or too little support for research. Only one of 
ever two entrepreneurs bewails these things (see page 103). The 
fundamental trouble is the fear of risk taking. In the harshly 
worded judgment of Fraunhofer's director Warnecke: "Companies 
have grown lethargic. Decision making is delegated because no 
one has the courage to take a risk." 
  Worse yet, with increasing frequency, whether at 
universities, research institutes, or the companies' own R&amp;D 
divisions, fainthearted doubters and a gargantuan bureaucratic 
Moloch are quashing the creativity of nimble-minded 
trailblazers. This is a fatal strategy, since, the Kienbaum 
study indicates, on average, a single successful innovation 
requires 68 individual ideas. And more than 80 percent of these 
derive from a tiny group of highly talented researchers who, 
according to Rolf Berth, the study's author, "are, in fact, 
almost compulsively unable to leave anything just as it is." 
  Such employees are commonly brushed aside as oddballs and 
tolerated at best. As a consequence, most geniuses are 
meanwhile, in Berth's words, "frustrated outsiders." As 
summarized by the Kienbaum author: the "organized obstruction" 
of their ideas is "the chief culprit for Germany's waning 
innovativeness." 
  Wolfgang Ehrfeld is a prime example of a researcher who was 
foiled this way. Originally, the physicist, with the approval of 
his superiors, wanted to develop a cost-effective process for 
enriching uranium. In the mid-seventies he proposed to the 
Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center [KfK] a micro-engineering 
production process for a so-called thermal diffusion nozzle. But 
after the development of another technique, the 
ultra-centrifuge, it turned out that the nozzle would not bring 
in any return. Still, the physicist was unwilling to see the 
Liga process, as he called it, simply die off. "With it we can 
establish an entirely new generation of engineering, apart from 
nuclear engineering," he rhapsodized to the KfK management. 
  But Ehrfeld's persistence was reciprocated with little 
enthusiasm. KfK bigwigs were interested exclusively in nuclear 
engineering. Since Ehrfeld refused to have the notion squelched, 
the holder of over 30 patents essentially got involved in 
starting up the Microparts company to commercialize the process. 
  He needed official support to do so. He submitted one 
application after another. But the bureaucracy kept demanding 
more paperwork. When the file was virtually overflowing the 
government banged shut with ruthless arbitrariness, alleging 
that no one could any longer peruse it. The researcher was 
brusquely turned down and not much more remained of the 
previously promised injection of financing from the North 
Rhine-Westphalian ministry of science. 
  Only on the third attempt 20 years after his idea, is 
Ehrfeld 
now able fully to settle down in his field. Supported by the 
Rhineland-Palatinate's science minister, Rainer Bruederle, the 
entrepreneurial minded scientist, over the past two years, has 
founded the Institute for Micro-Engineering [IMM] GmbH in Mainz. 
Since then, with over 100 employees, it ranks as one of the 
pillars of German micro-engineering research. 
  For Hans Dietmar Sauer, chairman of the board of the 
Baden-Wuerttemberg regional credit bank, Ehrfeld's running the 
gauntlet of official channel is systemic. Just the application 
procedures, he stews, are "tangled and protracted." The 
documentation required to justify an application is "just 
overdone." Above all, absent the assistance of professional 
subsidy advisers, it is hardly possible to fill out the forms of 
the research bureaucracy in Brussels. "Only large companies can 
afford their own specialists for EC research programs," 
complains Sauer. 
  Yet, on the other hand, there is scarcely any funding 
available if it entails the development and introduction of new 
products which is always laden with risk. Although there are in 
Germany 90 companies that claim to shore up founders of 
companies with risk capital, most are subsidiaries of large 
banks and dread risk as much as their parent banks. This leaves 
a handful of courageous professional venture-capital companies 
that so far, however, have invested only DM500 million in 
revolutionary ideas and products. 
  Other methods of obtaining capital too are virtually off 
limits for domestic innovators. For example, the hurdles for 
access to Germany's stock markets are practically insuperable 
for fledgling high-tech firms. Banks play no part in the 
placement for the same reasons they adduce for their restrictive 
awarding of credit. And telephone contact, the only market open 
to high-tech firms lacking bank assistance is insufficiently 
liquid with turnovers of, at most, a couple hundred shares per 
day. 
  Worse yet, there happen to fledgling firms in the new 
federal 
states that often cannot even offer the banks property or 
production resources as collateral. That is what the energy 
department of Matech GmbH in Ostritz, west of Goerlitz in den 
Ruin, did. It primarily wanted to build wind-power systems and 
small hydroelectric and wood burning power plants. But start-up 
costs were too high. "There is a market out there for that." 
Johannes Schaefer, who was in charge of marketing, is absolutely 
sure of it. 
  The same problem confronted Peter Klein, marketing expert 
for 
image processing systems. He started up Tom Tech GmbH in Eching 
bei Munich and within three years, using ultra-sound technology, 
he developed a new system of medical technology that aroused the 
enthusiasm of physicians. It provides three-dimensional images 
of the inside of the human body with no impact on patients' 
health. Such images facilitate diagnosis, especially of heart 
diseases. 
  At first, everything went as planned. After the patent 
application, Atlas Venture GmbH joined in, willing to take on 
risk. According to Klein: "Even government research support was 
nearly clinched." 
  The first rude awakening occurred when Tom Tech's founder 
could contemplate gaining a market. Klein complains: "All at 
once we fell into a deep financing hole." Tom Tech still needs 
nearly DM10 million to develop the market through advertising, 
creation of a sales force and the manufacture of demonstration 
equipment. But the banks that were approached turned a cold 
shoulder. 
  As a result, the company is going abroad. In June, the first 
of a total 24 employees moved into the new headquarters in 
Chicago. Right now, over there, investors are waiting in line. 
The reason is that in the U.S., not only can venture capital be 
marshaled more quickly, but even stock market access is easier. 
In addition to the New York and American Stock Exchanges, the 
National Association of Security Dealers and Quotations [NASDAQ] 
is, above all, a bubbling source of financing. Several thousand 
high-tech firms are registered with it. With such financial 
assistance, companies like Microsoft, Apple and Lotus grew into 
large firms. 
  But companies themselves could do something to expedite 
innovations. They would first save on costs and, second, reap 
earlier profits. Simultaneous engineering is one of the tools 
that can be used to achieve this objective. It entails experts 
with different specializations working simultaneously on partial 
solutions for an innovative product. Constant and intensive 
communication is a prerequirement for success. According to the 
Kienbaum study, a mere four percent of German companies 
routinely make use of methods originating in Japan for 
expediting research projects. Even more disgraceful is that 70 
percent of the surveyed companies are not even aware of the 
concept. 
  Reis GmbH and Co. Maschinenfabrik, a manufacturer of robots, 
was among the first to have pulled off an astoundingly 
successful simultaneous engineering project. The prototype of a 
highly sophisticated forging manipulator was completed in the 
record time of only nine months. Development costs that normally 
would have amounted to DM1.6 million, were cut to DM1 million. 
The service outlay for the prototypes was halved. The 
Obernburgers even met the most ambitious of all objectives. 
Managing director Walter Reis recalls: "We wanted to lower the 
price by 40 percent, and we did it." 
  In early 1992 he had summoned to the conference table all 
the 
employees who would ever be involved with the projected robot: 
service and sales personnel, suppliers, control experts, 
mechanical engineers and designers. In this way, from the 
outset, the company avoided partial solutions that would have 
entailed high production costs. The maintenance engineers, in 
turn, lodged their veto opportunely, when the equipment's design 
threatened to impact on ease of servicing. Reis promises: "We 
will henceforth design new models using only this method." 
  In the tiny Black Forest hamlet of Schramberg, Junghans 
Uhren 
GmbH managed a similar feat of prestidigitation. Three small 
development teams there, including Oskar Flaig, who is even yet 
an accomplished horologist, together with marketing and 
designers, every year are turning out a product that is the 
first of kind in the world in the clock radio sector. The fourth 
group, according to Wolfgang Ganter, director of the R&amp;D 
division, is "responsible for visions that allow us to progress 
in the development of timepieces." 
  The latest vision is a new model that should finally win 
Junghans an international market. It will be controlled not by 
earthbound transmitters, as is presently the case, but by 
satellites that will calibrate every point on earth. Currently 
used time signals transmitted by ground stations in Europe, the 
U.S. and Japan, each have a range of only 1,500 kilometers. 
<H5>  Penalized Courage </H5>
  Normally, at least, economic success is based on dazzling 
engineering that also is environmentally friendly and on 
entrepreneurial courage. For Munich's Technocell AG, however, 
this combination led to disaster. Bavarian Zellstoff GmbH, a 
subsidiary in which the new engineering was performed, collapsed 
under the burden of DM490 million in obligations. 
  The formerly successful paper manufacturer had developed a 
new process for obtaining high quality cellulose. It financed 
this on its own, with no contributions from the federal minister 
for research and development's sponsorship fund. In their 
original factory in the Pasing section of the city, the valiant 
group from Munich built the pilot plant and optimized the 
process until it was appropriate for serial application. The 
cellulose activities were combined in a joint venture, 
Organocell Thyssen GmbH, in which Technocell and Duesseldorf''s 
Thyssen Handelsunion AG each held a 50 percent share. 
  But at present, however, managing director Gerhard Dahlmann 
is purely preoccupied with still rescuing his company and its 
technical know-how. No further financial resources can be 
expected from Technocell and Thyssen seems to have lost its 
enjoyment in the enterprise. 
  The self-styled Organocell process yields an especially 
tear-proof cellulose that can be processed into high quality 
paper. Unlike the conventional technique that environmental 
considerations precluded from Germany, the new process does not 
pollute the air or have polluted effluent. Large quantities of 
cellulose of this quality are imported exclusively from abroad, 
mostly from Scandinavia and Canada. The Organocell process 
afforded the German paper industry an opportunity to free itself 
of this dependency. It also offered the possibility of using 
domestic conifer woods that otherwise have scarcely any economic 
potential, for the production of paper. 
  Technocell (1989 turnover: nearly DM350 million) therefore 
confidently freed up a cool DM530 million to reengineer the 
run-down cellulose factory in Kelheim an der Donau into one of 
the most modern and environmentally friendly plants in the 
world. At the time, critics warned about the technical problems 
that surface in directly transitioning from a small pilot plant 
to a large engineering application. But these could be mostly 
solved. Finally and inauspiciously, there were the financing 
costs. On top of this, the new process is not economical at the 
current extremely low prices for cellulose. 
  The last alternative for rescue would be a potential 
purchaser. But there is none in sight anywhere around. No 
wonder, for as long as cellulose is allowed to be produced 
abroad cheaply and with damage to the environment, there is no 
prospect for the better, albeit more expensive, alternative.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hartmut Weule, Daimler-Benz managing </F>
director for R&amp;D; place and date not given: "`Under 
Pressure'"; 
Subheadline: "Daimler-Benz Managing Director for R&amp;D on 
Cultural 
Revolution Needed at Germany's Economic Core"] 
  [Text] 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Mr. Weule, it is rumored that the latest 
small car introduced by Mercedes-Benz was developed unbeknownst 
to upper management. 
  [WEULE] That is incorrect. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] But the rumor is still not off the mark. 
Small cars were taboo at Mercedes Benz previously. 
  [WEULE] Still, it is not possible to slip the development of 
a complete automobile past upper management. But there have 
already been similar instances in the history of our firm. For 
example, the designers once created a second design paralleling 
their official job and they caught upper management by surprise 
with it. But today that is no longer necessary. Since then we 
have gotten a management culture that is receptive enough to 
innovation. If the employees are innovative, they are 
encouraged. Back to the small car. Our research has been 
constantly at work on small cars over the past 15 years. 
Basically, it is not a novel subject for us. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Not infrequently, companies stifle 
creativity forcing employees to cobble together innovations 
clandestinely. What is going wrong at the core of German 
innovation? 
  [WEULE] We are not starving. Essentially, we have an 
excellent basis with well-educated personnel. Few industrial 
countries in the world enjoy this to the same extent. Even 
compared with the Americans and the Japanese we need not worry 
that we do not have enough clever, knowledgeable, and capable 
individuals. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] But innovative products bring others on 
the market. 
  [WEULE] There is a general problem underlying that. Not only 
researchers, but we Germans have grown lethargic about our 
successes. Developments take too long. They are too expensive 
and often they are not market-oriented. We lack the unqualified 
resolve and readiness to take on the risk to very rapidly 
transform our know-how into products that offer an opportunity 
to succeed. We also lack the will for both internal and all 
encompassing dialog to manage the transformation as efficiently 
as possible. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] So, as you see it, the Germany economy's 
waning innovativeness is not a matter of resources but primarily 
a mental and cultural problem? 
  [WEULE] Exactly. Here is just one example. In the Daimler 
company, the difficulty confronting us is that the researchers 
of the individual corporate sectors have developed their own 
world. The result was a not-invented-here syndrome. No one felt 
duly responsible. In order to do away with that, we have come up 
with something we call integrated R&amp;D management. If our 
researchers and developers are pondering a new car, they 
straightaway call in marketing personnel and product experts. In 
this way, the researcher becomes acquainted with market 
requirements and stumbling-blocks to production. After the 
get-together they return to their divisions with definite 
objectives and work together through goal-oriented networking. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Has there not been any resistance to this 
cultural revolution? 
  [WEULE] Sure. In fact, we had to exert pressure with 
definite 
formulations and a new form of budgeting. But now, those 
directly impacted are enthusiastic. Only middle management still 
has problems with it off and on. But bottom-up and top-down 
pressure will also solve this problem. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] You are pretty much out on a limb with 
this integrated approach. According to a current poll, only four 
percent of German companies make use of simultaneous management 
tools. 
  [WEULE] Then that study is portraying yesterday's world of 
industrial research. I know very many colleagues in research and 
they are all in the same processes as ourselves. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] So then, it is not all that bad. 
  [WEULE] Wrong. Nothing is accomplished with a new 
orientation 
just in industry. We have to accomplish the same in the large 
government sectors. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] So the government again gets the blame? 
  [WEULE] In our country, the problem is that we lean back 
greatly relieved and always with very smug looks on our faces 
when we attend to the ratio of R&amp;D spending to gross social 
product that is approximately 2.7 percent. My quarrel then is 
continuously with economists and politicians. Of the total DM80 
billion going to the R&amp;D sector, only a small portion is 
actual 
research. The lion's share goes for development, that is, 
towards safeguarding markets, now and in the immediate future. 
We do not give much thought to the larger future. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] How much do you estimate that share to 
be? 
  [WEULE] No one knows for sure. I estimate that altogether in 
industry fewer than DM5 billion go for actual research. This is 
where we fundamentally diverge from the Japanese and the 
Americans who give considerably more attention to this sector. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] So then, the problem is of a pecuniary 
nature. Industry and government allocate too little money for 
research. 
  [WEULE] Not really too little, but frequently misdirected. 
There are outstanding scientists occupying positions in the 
Max-Planck or Fraunhofer Societies and in large research 
facilities. The government invests exorbitantly large amounts in 
them, about DM26 billion each year. It is my opinion that the 
resources that federal and state governments allocate to them 
have to be focused more intensively on the interests of 
industry. I dare question whether, absent a clear commitment 
with industry, for example at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research 
Center, DM40 million should be allocated for a hard x-ray source. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] There is no one at all in Karlsruhe who 
questions it. 
  [WEULE] See, the cultural dilemma of faulty communication 
reveals itself again in this case. Everyone in our country 
should be expected to wonder who your customer is, why you are 
doing that. In industry we work hard at such customer 
orientation and I expect the same of a researcher of the 
Max-Planck Society or of a large research facility. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] As the saying goes: who really is 
interested in the work I do? 
  [WEULE] More so: who profits from it? If the researcher sees 
that he is working in a void, I would expect him to reorient 
himself. I am quite willing to admit that industry also has to 
open up to this more earnestly. This is a source of reproach for 
it. In the past, there was a great temptation to misuse 
government funding in many different way. For instance, for 
political influence peddling, for satisfying regional interests, 
for nurturing personal research hobbies. We can no longer afford 
any such use of funding. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Would central coordination modeled on 
Japan's MITI help? 
  [WEULE] I doubt it. It does not square with our way of 
thinking. We need three things in this situation: first, a 
consensus on the common goals of research; second, operational 
networks in which such goals can be tackled; and, third, quality 
assurance for research. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Is not that a bit much all at once? 
  [WEULE] Actually, radical change is already under way. For 
example, in Germany, in the production engineering sector, we 
occupy a prominent position. To safeguard this position, we have 
encouraged Daimler-Benz to get specialists across all 
disciplines thinking about the shape of the future in this field 
so as to bring relevant research to bear on it. In the spring we 
held an initial workshop on this at the federal research 
ministry. This was the first time such deliberations are being 
conducted not in isolation but in coordination wit the Federal 
Ministry for Research and Technology [BMFT] and academia. It is 
a process with a well-defined timetable and precise milestones. 
The industry group will meet in early November for a concluding 
vote. In the spring, at the research minister's, there will then 
be a national workshop on production engineering, at which a 
common guideline for national research is supposed to be 
hammered out and given concrete expression. The crucial question 
then will be: will government, academia and industry keep to it? 
Will selfish interests prevail or will the guideline assume a 
binding character? The next two years will tell the tale.

German Industry and Trade] 
  [Text] Research: Technology Transfer to 
Medium-Size Industry Must be Accelerated. Every Development 
Needs Visions as well as Promoters. 
  Economy and Science Must Adapt to Internationalization 
of Markets 
  HANDELSBLATT, Wednesday 24 Nov 93. The less than 
satisfactory 
growth of the German economy during the past few months has made 
it clear how an even most stable boom can come to an end. 
Despite all the austerity measures and consolidation required at 
this difficult time, we must not neglect to also provide for 
tomorrow. An essential requisite for this is, among others, a 
tight international dovetailing of economic management and 
science: above all in the so-called "high-tech" area. 
  When viewing the status of scientific organizations at the 
threshold to the next millennium from the economic standpoint, 
we must ask ourselves whether we are adequately equipped to deal 
with anticipated developments and problems. We have to recognize 
that flexibility and productivity of scientific effort will be 
adversely affected by overregulation and inadequate budget 
authorization for smaller R.&amp; D. units. 
  A further impediment is the widespread adherence to the 
regionalization (territorial demarcation) principle. The Bonn 
University is beholden to the City of Bonn, the universities of 
North Rhineland - Westphalia are beholden to the provinces, and 
the German universities are beholden to the German Federal 
Republic. Europeanization must not pause while science is 
organizing itself. For a model let us look at the U.S.A., where 
private American universities are internationally oriented. 
Japanese universities and research organizations, for instance, 
are in this way gaining a foothold in Germany. 
<H5>  ICSI: Bridgehead for German Scientists </H5>
  Globalization of the economy as a necessity must also 
include 
international extension of national research organizations and, 
therefore, German participation in the international contest 
between science systems. This means that there is a need for a 
presence of German scientific organizations acting as business 
enterprises abroad, because a target of the international 
contest is always one or another national entity. 
  In order for the changeover from a service-oriented society 
to a science- based society to be correctly understood, it is 
necessary for the "science industry" to follow the overall 
global economy distribution pattern. The developments point 
unequivocally to globalization of institutional structures. 
  It is in these terms that one should look at the 
International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) in Berkeley, 
established by both economic and scientific communities. 
Development has been found to need visions as well as promoters. 
The success of this initiative hinges on the trilateral relation 
between the University of California in Berkeley, the ICSI, and 
the German support association: a consortium of companies 
serving as a bridgehead for German scientists as well as for 
private and public research and development organizations. 
  The consortium formed by Daimler-Benz, Mannesmann, 
Siemens, Krupp, Bertelsmann, and SEL, also the Mathematics and 
Data Processing Society (GMD), and the president of the 
German Patent Office takes all the credit for having opened a 
technological front window to most advanced research and 
development by launching this joint venture with the University 
of California in Berkeley with the establishment of its 
International Computer Science Institute in 1988 and by thus 
successfully integrating German scientists into joint projects 
with top American researchers. 
<H5>  Results of U.S. Research Hardly Made Available to Europeans </H5>
  Technology transfer from the U.S.A. is particularly 
important, because crucial developments in these key 
technologies take place there and yet the results of those 
developments are hardly or not at all available to Europeans. 
This protectionist stance is taken by the U.S. Department of 
Commerce on behalf of industries fearing that an outflow of 
know-how will adversely affect their competitive position 
internationally. 
  The technology transfer through the ICSI is yielding 
impressive results, which German member companies can utilize 
and evaluate at no cost and without restrictions. The outpost in 
Berkeley plays here a double bridging function: in the 
transatlantic German-American axis and in the significance of 
California's Bay Area to the Pacific region. 
  Neither is the technology transfer from California to 
Germany 
meant to be a one-way street but rather, and this is especially 
important in the keen international contest, California is also 
meant to serve as a base for dissemination of German products 
and processes. It is precisely this aspect of German-American 
cooperation within the framework of the "Joint Venture" which is 
promoted by the Governor of California ("... My administration 
recognizes the value of developing global ties at the early 
stages of research, in order to ensure international cooperation 
through the commercial development stages. ... Our 
administration looks forward to playing an active role through 
the implementation of this joint venture" wrote California's 
Governor George Deukmejian on 9 May 1990). 
  The requisite for global competitiveness of the German 
economy is that it not only be represented by a production and 
marketing organization abroad but also be tightly linked, 
through research and development, to the scientific community 
abroad. 
  It is exactly in medium-size enterprises where the ability 
to 
innovate is assuming an increasingly important role. While 
opened up to innovations, however, they must also be in a more 
vigorously manner given the opportunity to utilize newly 
acquired scientific and technical knowledge. Professor Syrbe, 
former president of the Fraunhofer Society, has found 
the distribution of expenditures by an enterprise to be so 
skewed that per 80&percnt; of its outlays today only 5&percnt; 
is allotted 
to research and development. 
<H3>  Japan's Machine Manufacturing Industry Enhances Its 
Competence </H3>
  This lop-sided distribution pattern indicates how necessary 
it is to boost joint projects involving science and economic 
management so as to accelerate research and technology transfer 
to the medium-size industry. For new products and processes are 
being developed predominantly in the area of research-intensive 
technologies and a key role here is being assumed by the 
information technology, a technology which has already 
penetrated all sectors of industry at a breathtaking pace. 
  A glance at Japan reveals that there for instance the 
machine 
manufacturing industry, also structured as a medium-size one, 
consistently invests in enhancement of its R.&amp; D. 
competence. Up 
to 20&percnt; of its investments have gone into R.&amp; D.: 
above all in 
areas of control engineering, robotics, and materials research, 
where the top technologies yield highly innovative and intensely 
worth-creating processes and products. 
  Information science and information technology are crucial 
driving forces in other sectors of industry: one DM worth of 
output in information technology results in about 7-8 DM worth 
of output in other sectors as, for instance, in machine and 
plant construction. Today about one third of Germany's national 
product is built around a microelectronic kernel. 
  New information techniques have meanwhile reached a level of 
development and thus become focally significant for our 
middle-class economy as well. Until now the German medium-size 
industry has been completely bypassed by the much needed 
technology transfer. Cooperation with science is of vital 
importance to precisely this industry, inasmuch as it has only a 
limited own research capacity available. Conversely, science 
depends on confrontation by problems of industrial practice for 
working out competitive solutions. 
  The key results achieved by the Project ICSI in neural 
information technology and high-capacity computer networks have 
become decisive future- outlook factors in the global contest. 
Among the 500 principal enterprises in the U.S.A. there is today 
hardly one not intensely involved with these concerns and not 
assigning inside development teams to deal with them. 
  Establishment of the European Domestic Market and the 
increasing globalization of trade will continue to increase the 
dependence on innovative telecommunication and telecooperation 
systems. It is to be feared that companies which do not have 
this technology at their long-term disposal will not be able to 
hold their ground in the international contest. 
<H5>  Door to Development of Intelligent Technologies </H5>
  We cannot afford to be represented internationally by Goethe 
Institutes only. We must get our foot in the door to development 
of intelligent technologies such as those which the 
International Computer Science Institute is making available to 
us. Let us not forget that it takes less and less time to 
convert the results of research and development into producible 
items.

  [Text] Effort to Implement Technology Transfer Meets All 
Kinds of Obstacles in Practice 
  R.&amp; D. Managers Have Difficulties in Acquiring the 
Results of Outside Research 
  Technology transfer is discussed mostly in highly 
abstract terms. Meanwhile, establishing viable connections 
between enterprises in need of technology and institutions 
engaged in research involves hard work and when contact is not 
made, it is because of conflicting goals. 
  KARRIERE, 26 Nov 93. First the good news: the Federal 
Republic, with its 20,000 industrial research enterprises, 102 
industrial research consortia, over 300 colleges and vocational 
colleges, 16 large-scale research facilities, 66 Max-Planck 
Institutes and research groups, and 47 Fraunhofer Institutes, 
remains as before a leading research post worldwide. German 
basic research is the world's best. 
  The bad news is that much of what the German researchers in 
all these institutes, laboratoria, and colleges develop and 
invent goes to waste. Valuable results get covered with dust in 
libraries without a follow-up with practical research and 
development or product development. Cooperation between state 
research facilities and economic management is very poor. 
  At the same time research-intensive sectors are going 
through 
a deeper than average crisis. Forces which once stimulated 
growth are now becoming road blocks. Paul Krueger, Federal 
Minister of Research, has recognized this and calls for an 
"innovation initiative". His primary point of departure would be 
improving the contacts between science and economic management. 
Previous conferences, says Krueger, did not yield any concrete 
results. 
  Apart from the political dialogue among a handful of top 
managers who for years have kept in touch anyway, the question 
arises as to what possibilities there are for R.&amp; D. 
management 
in enterprises to secure the transfer of know-how from science 
to industrial practice. One obvious solution often resorted to 
in the past is personnel transfer. The training of German 
researchers is everywhere said to be excellent. 
  There is, however, a negative indicator: in 1992 there were 
279,000 experts engaged full-time in R.&amp; D. and thus 17,500 
fewer than in 1989. The trend is further downward. Christoph 
Beckmann, Chair of Technology Management and Marketing professor 
at the Technical College in Darmstadt, can explain this: "More 
and more people are being trained, but the domestic economy 
cannot absorb them." Thus while nominally budgets have 
increased, even more than in proportion to the output, personnel 
has not been enlarged. "Today two thirds of budgets for R.&amp; 
D. 
cover personnel costs." 
  Prof. Hans-Joachim Queisser, an internationally recognized 
physicist at the Max-Planck Institute of Solid-State Research in 
Stuttgart and long-time adviser to the Ministry of Research in 
Bonn, is not any more able to place his science disciples in the 
domestic economy. "Industry rather tries to let its people here 
go. So does Siemens, which has handed over its entire 
superconductor research to the Jena University." 
  So far 30 of the Queisser staff have gone to Japan. "Here 
they do not have a chance, because European industry has given 
up entire research areas. The Japanese meanwhile envy us our 
sprouting talent and come running to drain it away." 
  There would still remain the possibility of short-term 
personnel transfer, perhaps on a project basis. Dr. Roland Vogt 
of the Bremen University, where a model experiment regarding 
stimulation of technology transfer was initiated, had polled 
college placement offices and found very few opportunities of 
short-term transfer to business available to scientific workers 
and college teachers. The appropriate assistance programs 
offered in Bremen and in North Rhineland - Westphalia were found 
to remain almost entirely unutilized. 
  While the direct personnel track is evidently not effective 
enough, there would still remain the possibility of intensifying 
the cooperation with research institutes. According to the data 
supplied by the founding consortium, the national economy has in 
1992 spent about 56.2 billion DM on R.&amp; D. in West Germany. 
This 
sum was split into 50 billion DM for domestic R.&amp; D. and 6.2 
billion DM for outside research. 
  It is obvious to Queisser why R.&amp; D. managers, faced 
with 
heavy personnel costs, do not try harder to farm out their 
research: "An industry which could utilize our research is 
almost nonexistent in Germany. We have no industry which 
produces personal computers, none which produces flat-panel 
displays, and none which produces laser diodes for modern 
compact-disk record players. The task of the Max-Planck 
Institutes is to do basic research. And while these Institutes 
would be partly financed by industry, there are not enough 
possibilities of converting this kind of research into something 
practical: "There are no industrial users in need of it." 
  Dr. Tom Sommerlatte, managing director of "Europe" at the 
Arthur D. Little business consultants sees it otherwise: "The 
Max-Planck Institutes are developing future technologies, but 
have no way to communicate what products these will yield. 
Enterprises then face the results of these developments with 
amazement and not knowing what to do with them." 
  And within an enterprise, continues Sommerlatte, the same 
barrier has to be overcome again: "Indeed, the R.&amp; D. manager 
speaks the language of the Max- Planck Institute so that 
marketing people and technologists can not understand one 
another either." Today most enterprises, moreover, are run very 
much on the cost efficiency track: "Employees therefore are 
concerned more about their job security than about future 
products." 
  Probably the best interaction of domestic and outside 
scientific research has been achieved by managers of the 
chemical industry. Some successes have also been achieved in 
machine manufacture and processing technology. On the whole, 
however, shortage of personnel makes it extremely difficult for 
industry to keep being informed. 
  Prof. Erich Staudt, director of the Institute of Applied 
Innovation Research at the Bochum University, asserts: "The 
R.&amp; 
D. departments lead their own lives almost completely insulated 
from the outside world." 
  "This is particularly true of the R.&amp; D. workers in the 
middle-class economy" adds Queisser: "They cannot even send 
their people to attend lectures. Sessions on the subject of 
transfer, once well attended, are today not being held any more. 
  Says Sommerlatte: "It would be important that our natural 
scientists and technologists develop an understanding of 
industrial management and ask themselves what products the 
results of their research could yield." It is precisely from 
this point where Martin Schaettgen, business manager of the 
"Inno" Ltd in Karlsruhe, takes off. He advises research 
institutions on the possibilities of their better cooperation 
with industrial enterprises. 
  The problem, he agrees, lies essentially with the 
researchers. "It is not easy for R.&amp; D. managers to make the 
contact" suggests the adviser. "In Karlsruhe alone there are at 
least 18 institutions which offer a technology transfer. Very 
few good ones are among them. The national economy is 
consequently confronted by a jumble of most diverse completely 
unstructured information." 
  It is very expensive, says Schaettgen, to have an enterprise 
itself set up such a transfer post of its own and to establish 
contacts via patent data banks. The most serious problem 
Schaettgen sees, however, in the great reluctance of researchers 
to cooperate. 
  Says Schaettgen: "The manner in which a research project is 
managed differs fundamentally from project management in 
industry. The cost and time awareness is entirely different, as 
is also the definition of a good result. To the R.&amp; D. 
manager a 
good result is a product which functions and is soon available 
at an acceptable cost. From the researchers point of view, it is 
a result which he or she can publish. The researcher is 
recognition-oriented, the manager is result-oriented."

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Laperrousaz: "CEA Opens Its Lab Doors to </F>
PMEs"] 
  [Text] Materials, lasers, robotics, microelectronics, 
environment: The CEA [Atomic Energy Commission] range of 
capabilities is vast and varied. And the PMEs [Small and 
Medium-Sized Business(es)] are invited to "do their shopping 
there." 
  How to fettle an octagonally shaped porcelain plate, 
automatically. The problem might appear trivial. But engineers 
of the CEA's robotics unit at Fontenay-aux-Roses (Hauts de 
Seine) did not consider it beneath them to work away at it. And 
at the end of a few months, they proposed a solution to Jammet 
Seignoles, the small Limousin-based company (30 million 
francs[Fr] in annual revenue, 100 employees), which had posed 
the problem. 
  "We dealt with persons who knew very little about ceramics, 
but who knew how to think, and they came up with a method that 
has the merit of being very simple," says Henri Seignoles, CEO 
[chief executive officer] of the company. A prototype, built by 
Cerlim, satisfied the principal condition of the specifications: 
the ability to fettle an octagonally-shaped plate with facets of 
unequal lengths, a task that is beyond the capability of 
present-day machines. 
  Other examples could be cited in which PMEs have found 
within 
the CEA laboratories the capabilities they otherwise lacked. But 
until just recently, it was up to the companies to find a way to 
access this reservoir of know-how. A far from productive method 
of proceeding, in the view of the CEA. 
  "We decided to invert the procedure and to reach out to 
industry ourselves with a view to evaluating its needs," says 
Alain Bugat, director of advanced technologies, the CEA 
department responsible for the dissemination of technologies to 
the industrial sector. A dozen or so engineers from the 
different research centers have been placed on detached service 
with the regional delegations of the ANVAR [National Agency for 
the Development and Commercialization of Research]. 
  This week, on 3 November, in keeping with this policy, the 
CEA is opening 11 of its research centers, including certain 
military laboratories, to industrial firms. Each of these 
centers will offer its know-hows in a specific domain: ceramics 
for the Bruyeres-le-Chatel (Essonne), lasers for Limeil 
(Val-de-Marne), microelectronics for Grenoble (Isere), etc. 
  Enterprises interested in a technology can take advantage of 
this policy in several ways. Through a simple consultation or a 
full-fledged expert evaluation procedure. Two years ago, for 
example, the Trefilerie des Vosges company, specializing in the 
manufacture of rails for miniature trains, sought to acquire a 
Japanese license for an alloy used in the manufacture of 
eyeglasses and jewelry. The company requested a study by a CEA 
laboratory in Saclay (Essonne). It was well that it did: The 
alloy in question was found to be too prone to oxidation. 
  Another example: Inoteb, a small Bretagne-based company, 
specializing in osseous prostheses, called upon the CEA's 
analytic capabilities (gamma radiography, radioactive tracing) 
to track the recolonization of prostheses by bone, in a living 
organism. 
  The CEA's assistance can go further. Sodeva, a PME based in 
Annemasse (Haute-Savoie), requested the aid of the Grenoble 
center in developing an ultrasonic sprayer-drier. 
  "We had the know-how in the technology of power ultrasonics, 
and the CEA had the know-how in spraying-and-drying technology," 
says Dominique Dubruque, the CEO of the small company (four 
persons). The company sold four systems, one of them in the food 
industry field. 
  For Sart, an enterprise with 75 employees and an annual 
revenue of Fr50 million, located in Noisy-le-Grand 
(Seine-Saint-Denis), collaboration with the CEA took the form of 
a joint study that led to the cession of a patent. This PME, 
specializing in the manufacture of gate valves, flap valves, 
flowmeters, etc..., was asked, early on, to develop 
magnetically-closed safety valves, based on a CEA idea (under 
the Tore Supra project). It is now the proprietor of a patent, 
and pays the CEA a royalty on each valve it sells. Its principal 
client is currently the CERN [European Nuclear Research Center], 
which has a requirement for 2,600 valves. And shortly, Sart 
hopes to add the Rhone-Poulenc chemicals company.

<F P=106> [Article by Alain-Gabriel Verdevoye: "Socofix Group </F>
Federates PME's"; introductory paragraph in boldface as 
published] 
  [Text] Socofix is putting on weight and adding a PME 
[small or medium-size business] to its collection. That move 
gives it a foothold in the German automotive market. 
  After a year of discussions punctuated by breakdowns in the 
talks, Gilles Benhamou is finally getting a foothold in Germany. 
It is the first step toward the internationalization of the 
Socofix group, which was established in 1989 by that 40-year-old 
graduate of the Polytechnic School and former official in the 
Ministry of Industry. "We want to achieve a federation at the 
European level of PME's in the electrical engineering field that 
make big profits in niches ignored by the big groups," he 
explains. 
  With its acquisition of Wehrle, a small firm in Tiengen (200 
km from Stuttgart) that is undergoing court-ordered 
reorganization, Socofix is entering the German automotive market 
of Volkswagen, Opel, BMW, and so on. And as it does with its 
French subsidiaries, the group will bend the firm across the 
Rhine to fit the house rules on industrial structure. As a 
result, Wehrle will no longer manufacture electromechanical 
relays, an activity that will be taken over by another of the 
group's companies, Cartier Relays in Cluses (Haute-Saone). That 
transfer of activity will mean the elimination of about 100 jobs 
in Germany (out of a total of 320), but on the other hand, it 
will then be possible to save the 190 jobs at Cartier Relays. In 
exchange, Wehrle will become the development pole for all 
on-board electromechanical components (control units for turn 
signal lights, electric window controls, and time delay relays). 
  "Our strategy is to develop autonomous and geographically 
distinct technological poles with strong identities that will 
obviously benefit from the group's commercial, financial, 
administrative, and research synergies," Benhamou emphasizes. 
Socofix, which has tripled its sales in barely three years, also 
produces antistatic systems, cables, and antennas for car radios 
and car telephones in Alencon (Orne). All industrial activity of 
that kind is now centered in Alencon (160 employees) following 
the transfer there of a unit formerly located in Rouen 
(Seine-Maritime). 
  The fourth development pole, concerned with connectors for 
telephony and information technology, is centered in Rozet 
(Aisne) and has 70 employees. A small additional plant located 
in the Paris region is scheduled to close in the near future.

  The chief pitfall facing Socofix is the fact that 
transferring personnel does not take place without pain. 
Generally speaking, fewer than 10 percent of the employees 
concerned will agree to relocate, with the result that every 
time there is a move, there is a major risk of losing know-how. 
  In a strong position because of its profitability (eight 
percent of net margin in 1992) and the fact that Paribas, Worms, 
and the UAP [Paris Insurance Union] invested in its business 
last June, Socofix is currently negotiating for new acquisitions 
in Spain.

<F P=106> [Article: "Sema Group Buys Swedish SKD"] </F>
  [Text] The French-British Sema Group has just bought a 75 
percent interest in Sweden's third-largest software house, SKD 
Business, for 250 million kronor (about 175 million francs). The 
SKD's activities are mainly in the field of facilities 
management (FM) and system integration. The deal had been under 
discussion for some time. It was felt as early as the end of 
August that the Sema Group would be the only remaining suitor. 
It appears that reasons of state were the only thing holding up 
the transaction, since the SKD was still under the control of 
the Swedish Government, which is involved in a privatization 
process. There was a year of negotiations during which Swedish 
authorities first rejected Cap Gemini Sogeti, whose vague 
impulses in the direction of external growth had a cooling 
effect on the government. Then they turned down the EDS, which 
did not provide sufficient guarantees that it would retain the 
SKD's existing structures. For the final six months, the Sema 
Group was the only company still in the running, and the Swedish 
Ministry of Finance eventually gave its approval. Besides its FM 
activities and its services as a consultant on system 
integration, which account for 57 percent and 29 percent 
respectively of the Swedish firm's turnover (1.126 billion 
kronor [as published; possibly ECU's intended] in 1992, or 7.96 
billion francs), the Sema Group is also taking over the 
information services division (14 percent of turnover). Not to 
mention a customer list that includes such multinationals as ABB 
and Volvo and even the Swedish Government. As far as the 
French-British software house is concerned, a direct consequence 
of this operation is that FM will now account for over 20 
percent of its turnover, compared to 15.5 percent previously. 
Based on the SKD's performance last year, that will increase the 
Sema Group's business by approximately 90 million pounds. Last 
year the Sema Group's turnover was 416 million pounds, or about 
3.88 billion francs. The Swedish market for information 
services, which now becomes the Sema Group's third-largest 
geographic area after Great Britain and France, is dominated 
essentially by outsourcing and system integration. Those two 
sectors account for over half the turnover, which this year is 
estimated at 1.27 billion ECU's (about 8.4 billion francs), 
according to the Ovom market study firm, which is forecasting a 
growth rate of 10 percent until 1996. There will be no turning 
to the market or calling on stockholders to finance this 
transaction, whose "modest" cost is therefore being financed by 
the Sema Group directly. But an unanswered question is the fate 
of the remaining 25 percent of the SKD's stock, one notable 
owner of which is Transpac Scandinavia, an SKD subsidiary in 
which France Telecom has a 40 percent stake. This might be a 
good opportunity for the state-owned firm as part of its joint 
venture with the Sema Group.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Dramatic Cuts at Fokker -- Cost </F>
Price of Airplanes To Be Reduced By 30 Percent In Three Years"] 
  [Excerpts] Aircraft builder Fokker is going to proceed with 
a new and very thorough reorganization. According to Board 
Chairman E. Nederkoorn, the company must cut its costs by 30 
percent over the next three years, so as to become profitable 
again in 1995. In addition to Fokker's own staff, which might 
have to cope with as many as 1,000 layoffs, the suppliers will 
feel the measures most. 
  Due to persistent problems in the aviation industry, Fokker 
is forced to cut production and reduce the price of its 
airplanes. Twelve important foreign suppliers will have to 
assume part of the risk. Fokker's present risk-bearing 
partners, the German DASA (bodies) and the North-Irish Shorts 
(wings), will have to work for less, too. [passage omitted] 
  After this year's reconversion which resulted in 1,480 
forced 
layoffs, Fokker now has 10,000 employees. Two years ago, the 
number of employees was still 13,000. In the company magazine 
"Trimvlak," Nederkoorn says that "new and deep cuts will be 
inevitable, both among workers and at the top." As to how many 
jobs will be lost, the issue will only be decided in February, 
when the commissioners will approve a plan. [passage omitted] 
  Nederkoorn argues that the slump in the aviation industry, 
which started in 1990, is lasting longer than expected. "It is 
unrealistic and dangerous to wait for miracles to happen on the 
market," Nederkoorn says. "The market determines the price, and 
the market can hardly pay our present sales prices." 
  Since last April Fokker has been part of Deutsche Aerospace 
(DASA), which owns 51 percent of the shares. Fokker is having 
most trouble selling its Fokker-50. Only seven orders have been 
placed this year for this turboprop airplane, including the five 
airplanes which will be ordered by the Scandinavian SAS this 
week. Fokker does expect, however, that the Dutch Royal Air 
Force will order four extended turboprops, the Fokker-60 
transportation version, before the end of the current year. 
  Sales of the jet planes Fokker-100 and Fokker-70 -- the 
short 
version launched in June -- are going better. At the end of 
this year, there will be no more unsold Fokker-100's at 
Woensdrecht airport, while earlier this year, some 40 to 50 
airplanes "were eating grass," as Fokker spokesman B. van Veen 
put it. However, at the end of this year, 12 unsold Fokker-50's 
will be waiting there. 
  After its slight 1992 profit, Fokker announced a 150-million 
guilder loss for 1993. Over 90 million guilders are 
attributable to the social scheme for the 1,480 layoffs. 
Nederkoorn believes that 1994 will be "hard." However, the new 
reorganization which has now been announced, should enable the 
company to make "structural" profit from 1995 onwards. 
  Fokker is going to reduce its production from 100 airplanes 
a 
year to 55 or 60. This number is regarded as the strategic 
minimum. The company will still remain the leading manufacturer 
of jet planes with approximately 100 seats. Its market share is 
now 32 percent, but should rise to 45 or 50 percent. In the 
aircraft sector for 70-seaters, Fokker is the only manufacturer.

<F P=106> [Analysis by Harry Carrel, Stuart Mather Gibson III, Julia </F>
Miezejeski, and Kevin Sara: "LM Ericsson: A Strategic 
Analysis".] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Company Overview </H5>
  LM Ericsson is aiming to become a major systems supplier in 
telecommunications. Behind this grand ambition are Ericsson's 
three main areas of business: 
  -- It's AXE public switching systems 
  -- Its cellular business (Ericsson is the world leader in 
cellular, with one of the most innovative systems) 
  -- Its MD110 business network system. 
  The company is hoping this combination will push it from a 
second to a first-tier position in telecommunications. Ericsson 
has a lot going for it, but the company has a long and difficult 
road to travel before it realizes its ambition. The company 
knows that all second-tier players have to try harder in today's 
cut-throat telecom marketplace. Ericsson has been trying 
harder, and has realized some admirable success, but it will 
have to make difficult and uncomfortable decisions in the near 
future, and allocate its resources very shrewdly, if it is going 
to succeed. 
  In public telecommunications, the company has shown 
remarkable resilience, emerging from a recessionary climate in 
Europe and North America with the most impressive year in its 
history: installing 7.1 million local AXE lines and 2.9 million 
trunk lines in 1992. The company commands 13 percent of the 
Western European market, 15 percent of the Eastern European 
market, and 7 percent of the U.S. market (up from 2 percent in 
1990), and has easily defended its 14 percent share of the 
lively Chinese market and its 33 percent share of the Latin 
American market. 
  In mobile communications, Ericsson has managed to maintain 
its 40 percent world market share since the early 1980's, well 
ahead of its closest competitor. The company leads with 58 
percent of the European market, holds third place in North 
America with 20 percent of the market, and commands 40 percent 
of the Latin American market. Ericsson is the only manufacturer 
to have developed systems for all the three international 
standards (U.S.A., Europe and Japan), guaranteeing it universal 
acceptance. Mobile communications order booking in 1992 jumped 
58 percent from 1991, and the company remains at the forefront 
of system and product development. 
  Even Ericsson's PBX [private branch exchange] business, 
which 
has experienced sporadic ups and downs over the years, managed 
to increase sales by 31 percent in 1992, owing largely to 
increased sales activity in China. The company installed 1 
million lines in 1992 and now has a total of 6 million lines 
installed worldwide. 
  The company has successfully rationalized its worldwide 
manufacturing; has restructured its organization, entrusting 
core competencies (technology development and marketing) to its 
regional operations; and has successfully undertaken 
company-wide cost-cutting measures. These factors have all 
contributed to its recent impressive results. The company 
reported a profit of SEK428 million [Swedish kronor] (US$60 
million) in first-quarter 1993 compared with a loss of SEK363 
million (US$51 million) for the same period in 1992, and its 
order backlog was the highest in its history. (The exchange 
rate used throughout this report is SEK7.1 = US$1.) 
  Ericsson has aggressively pursued research and development. 
The company delivered its ISDN [Integrated Services Digital 
Network] and Intelligent Network (IN) products in 1992, 
continues to develop the transport network products (ETNA) that 
it introduced in 1991, and is pushing forward with its 
operations and support systems (TMOS) and ATM-based 
[Asynchronous Transfer Mode] research. However, this commitment 
to R&amp;D has had its cost. The company spent 16 percent of its 
sales on R&amp;D in 1992 in the face of a drop of 46 percent in 
net 
income for the same period. This Herculean effort, however, 
pales beside competitors such as Siemens, whose net R&amp;D 
commitment for the same period (11 percent of its sales) was 
over three times Ericsson's. 
  Ericsson has entered into strategic alliances with 
Televerket 
(the Swedish PTT), General Electric, Hewlett Packard, and Texas 
Instruments. These alliances have provided Ericsson with 
resources that would otherwise be unavailable to it, but this 
too has had its cost. Ericsson does not own any of the 
technology developed in these alliances, and in the increasingly 
interrelated world of telecommunications has found itself 
sleeping with strange bedfellows. For example, Ericsson has a 
joint venture with Toshiba to install and service cellular 
telephony in Japan. Toshiba also has an alliance with Motorola 
(Ericsson's arch-rival in mobile communications) to develop 
DRAMS [dynamic random access memory]. Motorola and Ericsson 
entered into a joint licensing agreement for their GSM [Global 
Systems for Mobile Communications] patents. (Motorola entered 
into similar agreements with Cellnet in the U.K. , Alcatel, 
Siemens, and with Ericsson's French partner, Matra.) Ericsson's 
mobile partner in the U.S.A., General Electric, is developing 
network software for Motorola's IRIDIUM project. Obviously, all 
of this partnering can lead to some sensitive situations. 
  It is not uncommon for telecom players to team together, 
especially in increasingly costly R&amp;D. However, Ericsson does 
not have the capital resources of its competitors to build on 
this teamwork to deploy proprietary technology that could yield 
strong strategic advantages. For Ericsson, all this 
collaboration is only keeping it in the game. The company has 
also "given away" some of its more impressive technology, as 
when it licensed its PBX portable business phone to its 
arch-rival Siemens (and, by extension, to Rolm). No doubt 
Ericsson will come up against its own technology in its 
competitors' hands when it vies for critical contracts in the 
U.S.A. and Mexico (crucial and precarious markets for the 
company). 
  Ericsson is a company known for responding to the 
marketplace, not for dominating it. The company is gambling 
that the merger of public switching, mobile telephony, and 
private networks will place an increased emphasis on networks 
and software applications. In this scenario, hardware becomes 
increasingly less important. This may explain why the company 
has maintained a single product line for so many years. This 
approach to the market requires substantial and sustained 
R&amp;D -- 
something the company cannot afford. 
  Entering joint ventures and sharing R&amp;D costs with 
customers 
is a clever way of dealing with the situation, but it is not the 
policy of a technology innovator and leader. Also, what is to 
deter Ericsson's competitors from doing the same? They 
certainly have the resources. In short, Ericsson's approach has 
its short-term advantages, but it must be questioned as a 
long-term strategy. 
  Ericsson's most recent successes are to a great extent the 
result of the company's historic ability to move into new 
markets quickly, not necessarily because of its technological 
innovation. The company's impressive performance in China is in 
response to a huge new market. The company's success in Eastern 
Europe, particularly in the former East Germany, is again in 
response to a new market. The company's advances in Spain, 
Mexico, and Australia are primarily the result of the expansion 
and revitalization of networks in regions where the company has 
an established presence. In mobile telephony, the company has 
seen increased orders in expanding markets: China, Southeast 
Asia, and Eastern and Western Europe. But Ericsson has always 
been a leader in mobile, and will take its fair share of any 
expanding market. 
  The company's "systems house" approach (whereby Ericsson 
transfers the latest technology from other computer and software 
vendors to PTTs [Post, Telegraph and Telephone Authorities], 
providing customized products for its customers) has already 
begun to bear fruit in the U.S.A. The company has gained 
acceptance with five of the RBOCs [Regional Bell Operating 
Companies] and MCI. Ericsson's sales in the U.S.A. decreased in 
1992 primarily due to severe price pressure -- a difficult pill 
to swallow for a company without the large resources of its 
competitors. Mobile sales have shifted from the U.S.A., which 
had been the company's major market for cellular telephony, to 
Europe over the past three years. Europe now accounts for 43 
percent of Radio Communications sales, while the U.S.A. accounts 
for 29 percent (down from 42 percent two years ago). 
  Ericsson's new attempt to enter the U.S. market is proving 
difficult. The U.S.A. is one of the most demanding markets in 
the world, and is undergoing dramatic changes. Even Siemens, 
with all its muscle, is finding it difficult to get its 
bearings. Ericsson must succeed this time in the U.S.A. if it 
is to fulfill its ambition and move up to the first tier of 
telecom suppliers. It remains to be seen if Ericsson can do it 
alone. The company tacitly acknowledged the difficulty when it 
entered into joint ventures with GE and, recently, Hewlett 
Packard; but these alliances are concentrated in niche markets. 
It is also interesting to note that Ericsson is buying out its 
partners in these ventures (it has increased its holdings in 
both), suggesting that the company views these alliances as 
short term. 
  The company's ace in the hole is its mobile telephony 
operations. Ericsson has effectively parlayed its advantage here 
into public switching, and is trying to do the same with private 
networks with its mobile business phone. In the short term, 
Ericsson can continue to take advantage of the expanding markets 
to push its mobile technology. However, this is not going to 
guarantee Ericsson a place at the table. Ericsson will need a 
strong partner to ultimately succeed in the U.S.A., and if the 
company is to make a stand in public switching and PBX in the 
recently liberalized markets, it will need something more than 
innovative mobile telephony. It will need the financial muscle 
to stand firm against increasing competition and pursue its 
proprietary R&amp;D. It will need resources that we do not 
currently see on the company's balance sheet to develop and 
deploy a global technology embracing mobile, public switching, 
and private networks. We do not suggest that the company's 
recent successes are not representative of long-term growth, but 
they are better viewed as a reward for being a shrewd player in 
the right place at the right time. In the current unsettled 
telecom environment, only companies with a clear vision of the 
future and ample resources will succeed. 
  Ericsson has the vision, and the company is a survivor. We 
do not question its ability to remain a formidable player in 
telecoms, but we do question its ability, within the confines of 
its present resources, to move itself up to the first tier of 
telecom suppliers without help. Until then, the company will 
have to resign itself to enjoying a seat near, but not at, the 
head of the table. Perhaps it was said best back in 1923 by B. 
Wahlqvist, an employee of Ericsson in Spain, who remarked after 
Ericsson lost the Spanish concession to ITT: "...as you see, 
there should be no shortage of work for some time. The 
question, apparently, is how to find the capital to join in the 
competition." 
<H5>  Business Areas </H5>
  Until year-end 1992, Ericsson had six business area (BAs): 
  -- Public Telecommunications 
  -- Radio Communications 
  -- Business Communications 
  -- Cable and Networks 
  -- Components 
  -- Defense Systems 
  In January 1993, these BAs were reduced to five. Cable and 
Networks was split, with cable operations merged into Components 
and networks operations merged into Business Communications to 
form a new business area, Business Networks. Of the six 
business areas operating in 1992, all but two (Components and 
Defense Systems) were directly and exclusively involved in 
telecommunications. 
  In 1992, the four BAs exclusively engaged in 
telecommunications accounted for 94.7 percent of the company's 
sales. This ratio has remained relatively constant for the past 
three years. In 1990, these four BAs accounted for 94.9 percent 
of sales. The company's decision to concentrate on those 
activities directly related to its core business -- 
telecommunications -- made in 1986, when these four BAs 
accounted for only 85 percent of sales, has remained unchanged. 
The recent reduction in the number of BAs to five is a further 
indication of the company's dedication to this strategy; the 
reduction further consolidates the corporate organization within 
the company's core business. 
  To further distinguish it from its competitors, Ericsson is 
for all practical purposes a single-product company centered 
around the AXE public switch. The AXE was introduced 20 years 
ago, and the company has continued to develop new products based 
upon the AXE's core platform. The company's cellular systems 
are also based upon the AXE platform. While this focused 
product line has allowed the company to streamline operations, 
particularly manufacturing (the AXE is modular and is 
manufactured in "mother" plants and then shipped to assembly 
plants around the world for installation), and offers economies 
of scale unavailable to most of its competitors, it also 
presents risks. The failure of any key component, a delay in 
delivering new products based on core technology, or a serious 
manufacturing glitch can have far-reaching implications for the 
company. 
  The two business areas (BAs) not directly related to the 
company's core business (Components and Defense Systems) have 
been retained for strategic purposes. Components is engaged in 
the development of advanced microcircuits and components. Most 
of the development is done in cooperation with U.S.-based Texas 
Instruments. The investment necessary to develop advanced 
microelectronics is beyond Ericsson's resources. Therefore, 
this teaming with TI has guaranteed the company access to the 
necessary customized technology and large-scale production 
facilities critical to its public switching and cellular 
businesses. The Components BA is also constructing a 
manufacturing plant for small-scale production for new products 
during their start-up phase. In 1992, 59 percent of Components 
sales were to other Ericsson business areas. 
  Defense Systems provides radar, systems computers, and 
display equipment, primarily to the Swedish and Norwegian 
Defense Forces. This is a niche market in which the company has 
been involved for many years. In addition, the Defense Systems 
BA is engaged in R&amp;D related to digital mobile telephony, 
high-frequency radio technology, and broadband communications. 
This R&amp;D is "purchased" by other business areas. 
  Public Telecommunications accounted for 36 percent of 
Ericsson's sales and 36 percent of its 1992 profits. Radio 
Communications accounted for 32 percent of the company's sales 
and 39 percent of 1992 profits. The third largest BA, Cable and 
Networks, accounted for 14 percent of 1992 sales and 11 percent 
of profits. Business Communications, the fourth-largest BA, 
accounted for 13 percent of company sales, but just 9 percent of 
profits. Components accounted for 2 percent of sales and 1 
percent of profits. 
  Ericsson traditionally groups Public Telecommunications, 
Radio Communications, Business Communications, and Components 
into the category of "telecommunications systems", which it uses 
in reporting its results. These systems accounted for 85 
percent of the company's profits in 1992. This grouping is 
somewhat misleading, since the company's Cable and Networks BA 
was a serious element in the company's core business, but is not 
included in this category. Ericsson obviously believes it 
should be, as is evidenced by its decision in January 1993 to 
divide this business area among two other BAs that are included 
in "telecommunications systems." When the Cable and Networks BA 
is added to the company's telecommunications systems, these 
systems account for 96 percent of Ericsson's sales and Profits. 
<H5>  Financial Analysis </H5>
  After entering the 1990s with record sales and profits, 
Ericsson has hit a rough patch in the road. Sales remained flat 
from 1990 to 1991, and profits dropped from SEK3,450 million 
(US$486 million) in 1990 to SEK886 million (US$125 million) in 
1991. Sales increased slightly in 1992, but profits declined to 
SEK479 million (US$67 million). Over this same period, 
Ericsson's debt ratio has been increasing and liquidity has been 
deteriorating. 
  While Ericsson could obviously use the help of a strong 
financial partner, especially for tough-to-crack markets like 
the U.S.A., the company's financial position is not 
catastrophic. Order bookings are at record levels, and the 
company, with its streamlined global product line, is well 
positioned to ride any upswing of economic activity in its major 
markets. 
  It should be noted that the Swedish krona lost some 20 
percent of its value against major international currencies when 
it was allowed to float in the fourth quarter of 1992. 
According to Ericsson, the change in exchange rates will have 
little immediate effect on Ericsson's financial position because 
its operations are fully hedged, and because international 
clients are billed in local currencies. The long-term 
consequences of the devaluation will be largely beneficial to 
Ericsson: Sweden, its home market and the site of its 
manufacturing "mother" plants and main R&amp;D facilities, is 
emerging as a low-cost zone, compared to the situations of 
competitors such as Alcatel and Siemens, whose core operations 
are based in "strong" currency countries, i.e., France and 
Germany. 
<H5>  Ericsson's Private Networks Business </H5>
  Ericsson has been shepherding its Business Communications 
business area for some time. In 1985, Business Communications 
represented 31 percent of Ericsson's sales and had an operating 
income of SEK806 million (US$113.5 million). By 1987, Business 
Communications had reduced its work force by 8,000 employees and 
its operating income loss to SEK2 million (US$281,700). Yet it 
still accounted for 29 percent of Ericsson's sales. In 1988, 
the BA restructured, selling 80 percent of its Data Systems 
Division to Nokia and all of its Office Equipment Division to 
Design Function A/S. It also announced that it would shift 
production of its telephone instruments from Sweden to Southeast 
Asia. 
  1988 marked a watershed for Business Communications. While 
it now accounted for only 11 percent of Ericsson's sales (most 
of what it gave up, Mobile Communications took over), it was 
holding its own and showing some encouraging signs of growth. 
The BA's sales jumped 28 percent in 1989. Through 
manufacturing rationalization and clever marketing, it managed 
to maintain 23 percent growth in 1990. It suffered a loss in 
1991 (-23 percent growth) under increased price pressure and a 
weak economic climate, but went on to increase sales by 31 
percent in 1992, despite a continued tough economic environment. 
It appeared that the company had finally found the right 
formula for Business Communications; yet in January 1993, the 
company undertook the most radical restructuring of the BA to 
date. 
  In Northern Business Information's 1991 report on Ericsson, 
we asked if the company would do better to direct its limited 
resources to Public Telecommunications, Radio Communications, 
and Cable and Networks; casting off Business Communications. 
Ericsson obviously disagreed, and has regrouped its resources 
from Business Communications and Cable and Networks into a new 
business area -- Business Networks. The company claims that 
this new BA is a reflection of the corporate-wide restructuring 
that it undertook in 1991. However, the synergies that the 
company expects the restructuring to yield are not readily 
apparent, and we cannot but wonder if the company is 
reorganizing, as it has in the past, in preparation for a 
spin-off of the new BA. 
  Business Networks consists of the Business Communications BA 
plus the networks part of the Cable and Networks BA. Cable was 
spun off from Cable and Networks to the Components BA. The new 
Business Networks BA has seven business units: 
  -- MD110 Communication Systems with 4,500 employees and 
SEK3,399 million (US$478.7 million) in sales (1992); 
  -- Small Business Systems with 1,200 employees and SEK1,010 
million (US$142.3 million) in sales (1992); 
  -- Data Networks with 700 employees and SEK686 million 
(US$96.5 million in sales (1992); 
  -- Business Mobile Data Networks with 300 employees and 
SEK29 
million (US$4.1 million) in sales (1992); 
  -- Fiber Optics with 90 employees and SEK132 million 
(US$18.6 
million) in sales (1992); 
  -- Network Engineering with 2,600 employees and SEK1,382 
million (US$194.6 million) in sales (1992); 
  -- Ericsson Engineering with 4,200 employees and SEK2,865 
million (US$403.5 million) in sales (1992). 
  The MD110 Communication Systems, Small Business Systems, and 
Data Networks business units were part of the former Business 
Communications BA. Business Mobile Data Networks was originally 
a Major Local Company reporting directly to corporate 
headquarters in Stockholm. Business Mobile Networks, located in 
the Netherlands, is responsible for the development, 
manufacture, and sales of Ericsson's new Digital Cordless 
Telephone system, DCT900 (Freeset). Part of Network Engineering 
was transferred from the old Cable and Networks BA and merged 
with the network company Ericsson Business Networks, AB, which 
was originally part of the old Business Communications BA, to 
create the new Network Engineering business unit. Fiber Optics 
consists of the hardware units (opto welding, terminal products, 
and sensor systems) from the original Network Engineering and 
the Optical Network Research Center, Ericsson Sielte is an 
Italian subsidiary (Ericsson Sielte S.p.A.) originally 
associated with Cable and Networks and engaged in traditional 
network operations in Italy and other countries. 
  The new BA has 50 subsidiaries and affiliated companies 
worldwide and is headed by Lars Berg, past head of the Cable and 
Networks BA. Business Networks is intended to target a newly 
defined customer base requiring system solutions that draw upon 
the unique capabilities of the old BA and the synergies made 
possible by the merger. Ericsson believes that the traditional 
network activities of the network sector and the traditional 
business communication activities of the Business Communications 
BA can be combined to provide new kinds of services to a new set 
of customers. 
  The new BA's ability to work with many customers competing 
with traditional telecom operators in a limited market, to 
provide a wide array of technical solutions, to function in a 
decentralized and customer-oriented environment, and to deliver 
unique solutions in short carry-through times will give it an 
advantage over its competitors. However, the competition is 
steep and the market is unsettled, with potential customers 
viewing technology evolution as a reason for caution. Selling a 
solution in this environment will put very serious demands on 
Ericsson. How seriously the company considers the task ahead is 
underscored by its delay in appointing a head to its new Network 
Engineering business unit. This unit will include a special 
function to deal with the identification of new customers and 
markets for the entire BA. The company is looking for the right 
manager, one who will be able to be creative and take a lot of 
pressure. While the BA was formally created as of 1 January 
1993, it is not expected to be completely functional until the 
spring of 1993. 
  Business Communications has performed well. The MD110 is an 
established product that has found strong acceptance with many 
PTTs, including those in Spain, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Mexico, 
and the Netherlands. Of special interest is Telefonica's 
(Spain) virtual private network utilizing the AXE and the MD110. 
Ericsson maintains a strong presence in many parts of the 
world. It increased sales in Germany, the U.K., Italy, and 
Australia last year, even though it faced a very difficult 
economic environment and increased price pressure. It has also 
targeted China as a major market. Since its first major sale of 
MD110 there in 1988, it has managed to keep up the pace, and now 
commands 25 percent of the Chinese market. China is also 
Ericsson's largest market for the MD110 in terms of volume, with 
over 65,000 delivered lines. The company showed great 
cleverness and determination in this all-important market; it 
developed a special version of the MD110, the DRX1, which can be 
used as a public exchange in rural areas while traditional 
public networks are being built. After completion of the public 
networks, the DRX1 can be quickly moved and installed elsewhere. 
  While Ericsson has held sixth place worldwide in PBX sales 
for the past few years, it has shown itself to be a sly player. 
Sales increased sharply last year (31 percent over 1991), 
primarily due to sales of the MD110. Ericsson prides itself on 
its direct customer experience and its ability to provide 
advanced network applications. 
  As the division between PBX and public switching becomes 
increasingly blurred, Ericsson sees an opportunity to parlay its 
public switching presence into PBX sales. It did this in 
Australia by setting up an ISDN network using eight AXE switches 
and selling MD110s for business applications. The company's 
recently announced collaboration with INTEL to develop 
communications platforms allowing telephony, video 
communication, and data transfer in a single "call" accessible 
on a PC further underscores its determination to be a total 
system provider. Of course it is not the only player with this 
ambition, and it does not command the resources of many of its 
competitors, but its global player status guarantees that it 
will remain a competitive threat. 
  Mobile communications is probably the overriding reason for 
Ericsson to stand firm in PBX. The company's undisputed global 
presence and ambitions here permeate not only Business 
Communications' (Business Networks') ambitions, but Ericsson's 
overall global strategy as well. Ericsson is betting that the 
mobile business communications market will take off as the 
mobile residential and mobile public network markets did in the 
1980's. The company premiered its digital cordless telephone, 
the DCT900 (later renamed the Freeset), at the 1991 CeBIT trade 
show. Soon after, it launched the product in Sweden, Brazil, 
Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, New Zealand, and Australia. The 
company also committed itself to a speedy adaptation to the 
European DECT [Digital European Cordless Telecommunications] 
standard, which was finally adopted in July 1992. However, in 
an unusual twist, the company also "gave away" the technology by 
entering into a joint marketing agreement with Siemens, giving 
Siemens worldwide marketing rights to Freeset. 
  Ericsson has established itself as one of the major powers 
in 
mobile communications. It has created and maintained strong 
positions in public cellular, paging, mobile radio, and mobile 
data. The company commands a 40 percent world market share for 
mobile telephone systems, and is a market leader in 
analog-to-digital conversion. More importantly, Ericsson has 
shrewdly merged its switching system with its cellular radio 
systems and is doing the same for the MD110. For example the 
company is participating in the preliminary work on PCS 
(Personal Communications Systems) in the U.S.A., and is a 
leading supplier of PCN (Personal Communication Networks) in the 
U.K. 
  All the pieces are, therefore, in place for an impressive 
global telecom network. Whether Ericsson can realize this on 
its own remains to be seen. The increasing demands on the 
company's R&amp;D budget could force it to seek an alliance with 
Bosch or, more adventurously, with Northern Telecom. Of course, 
any partnering would create its own set of problems. It would 
upset the clean product line in place at Ericsson and the rapid 
response possibly only in a company the size of Ericsson. 
<H5>  Private Network Products </H5>
  The MD110 is the core of Ericsson's private network product 
line. Since being introduced in 1988, the company has installed, 
or placed on order, over 6 million lines in over 50 countries. 
Ericsson's BCS 90 line of business communications systems is 
targeted for small organizations requiring up to 70 extensions. 
The BCS 150 is another system, targeted for small to 
medium-size businesses, that offers voice, data, messaging, and 
information-handling capabilities. In March 1993, the company 
announced interface capabilities between the MD110 and IBM's 
CallPath Services Architecture (CSA), allowing full interface 
between MD110 and IBM computer-based databases through the MD100 
Applicationlink. In late 1992, the company announced similar 
interface capabilities with Tandem's Call Applications Manager 
(CAM) computer-to-switch interface. The company expanded its 
relationship with vendors of network management products through 
an agreement with Hewlett Packard to develop another network 
management system. The company also announced in 1992 a new 
accounts manager package for the ERIPAX X.25 wide area data 
network system. 
  Ericsson is committed to developing the MD110 to the end of 
the decade and beyond. The company regularly releases new 
products and enhancements. In 1991, the company's worldwide 
development organization released its second global product, BC 
6.0, which was developed at the company's design centers in 
California, Sweden, and Australia. 
  Ericsson's global approach to product development has 
reduced 
its costs and, more importantly, allowed it to introduce new 
products in several new markets simultaneously. In 1992, the 
company announced a new release for its business switch, BC 6.3. 
The new release offered several additional services: 
  -- Extension Manager V.3 allows a telephone call to be 
shifted from one extension to another from a personal computer 
attached to the switch. 
  -- VAX Account allows a personal computer to complement a 
larger VAX computer when maintaining accounts. 
  -- VAX Directory allows an operator to see on a computer 
screen who has gone to lunch, is attending a meeting, etc. 
  -- ACD/MIS [Automatic Call Distribution/Management 
Information System] Multisupervisor monitors queues of calls and 
directs them in an economical way. 
  One of the advantages of the Ericsson product line is its 
simplicity. It is a primary platform on which the company is 
committed to developing new features and capabilities within a 
migration strategy, allowing existing customers to upgrade to 
new releases, features, and applications. The company has plans 
for two new generations of products: BC 7 and BC 8. 
  Features planned for the BC 7 generation of products 
(1993-1994) include: 
  -- 2B+D Trunk Interface (ETSI [European Telecommunications 
Standards Institute] ISDN-compatible) as a private or public 
interface; 
  -- Enhanced call center with new ACD functionality; 
  -- Enhanced integral RVA [Recorded Voice Announcement] 
functions, including customer ID; 
  -- Voicemail, RVA integration with host computers, 
application link providing voice banking, etc.; 
  -- Digital POTS [Plain Old Telephone Service]; 
  -- DECT-standard cordless telephone support; 
  -- Widebank N*64K switching providing wideband applications 
such as videoconferencing, LAN [Local Area Network] 
connectivity, and multimedia applications; 
  -- Integral voice compression; 
  -- Premises broadband switching (25 gigabits). 
  Features planned for the BC 8 generation of products 
(194-1995) include: 
  -- Universal network transparency; 
  -- Full ETSI/ISDN for voice, DAT [Digital Audio Tape], and 
virtual networking; 
  -- ETSI/ISDN terminal interface; 
  -- New PC OP9 console and centralization of peripherals; 
  -- TAU 2680 data terminal. 
  The company has targeted vertical markets for the MD110, 
developing application packages for one market and then 
transferring them to other markets. The company's global R&amp;D 
structure facilitates such an approach by allowing each market 
to concentrate on its specific customer requirements, providing 
new products as tested and successful (association selling). 
The vertical markets targeted to date are: 
  -- Educational institutions 
  -- Municipalities 
  -- Banking and building societies 
  -- Utilities 
  -- Airlines 
  -- Financial institutions and services 
  -- Health authorities 
  -- The insurance industry 
  -- Retail marketing 
  -- Public transport 
<H5>  Sales in Private Networks </H5>
  Table 3 shows that private network sales dropped from 
SEK5,106 million (US$719.2 million) in 1989 to SEK4,870 million 
(US$686 million) in 1991, then rose to SEK6,293 million 
(US$886.3 million) in 1992, a CAGR of 7.2 percent. The increase 
in 1992 was primarily due to increased sales of the MD110; over 
half of Business Networks' sales were for the MD110. In 1991, 
Business Networks sales accounted for approximately 10 percent 
of all of Ericsson's external sales. In 1992, the BA accounted 
for 13 percent of the company's external sales. This is an 
impressive accomplishment, especially since Business Networks 
has confronted serious price pressure. 1992 performance was 
also positively affected by the acquisition of majority interest 
in the Austrian company Schrack, and by strong sales in Germany. 
  Business Networks saw its best sales performance in 1992 in 
Germany, the U.K., Italy, and Mexico. China also proved to be a 
fast-growing market. The company now holds a 25 percent market 
share for PBX in China. The largest markets for the MD110 are 
in Europe: Sweden (48 percent), Spain (44 percent), Italy (12 
percent), the Netherlands (17 percent), and the U.K. (6 
percent). The company also has a strong market presence in 
Germany and Eastern Europe.

  [Text] Frankfurt/M -- "Really, we ought to be satisfied," 
muses Dr. Friedrich D. Althoff, general secretary of the League 
of German Electrical Engineers (VDE). "No one can get by any 
more without our technology -- without `vitamin E' (for 
electronics) large sections of the economy would be unfit for 
battle." And in fact German businesses -- from electronic plant 
construction and energy distribution through measurement, 
regulation and communications technology, the automobile 
industry and engineering to medical technology -- are leaders in 
the application of microelectronics. 
  But for that very reason there is no real feeling of 
contentment. "About DM800 billion in sales and the jobs that go 
with it are dependent on the most immediate access to a key 
technology with compnents valued at DM5 billion. In technical 
competition in this area the user requires detailed knowledge 
about what is coming in good time to develop his own system. 
Anyone who obtains the specifications of projected electronics 
components even half a year later than the competition has an 
insuperable handicap." He said that without intimate knowledge 
about the possibilities of the semiconductors the user also 
increasingly loses his power of innovation. 
  That is why Dr. Heinz Stephanblome, president of the VDE/VDI 
Microelektronik company, thinks that the possibility of 
purchasing chips en masse anywhere on the world market is a 
dangerous illusion: "Anyone who has integrated circuits 
developed in the Far East and purchases them -- even if it is 
through the numerous design and production branches -- will one 
day have to obtain help with installation, then finished mill 
bars and finally all their equipment from over there." For with 
increased integration more and more parts of the systems 
themselves are migrating to the chip. 
  Says Althoff, "That is why the user needs proximity and 
confidence in his chip supplier." 
  But Althoff is concerned: "The situation regarding the 
direct 
availability of microelectronics is very grim in Germany and 
indeed all over Europe." The USA (particularly for processors) 
and Japan (for memory) have clearly emerged as the centers for 
mass production of highly integrated chips. Only two European 
manufacturers (Siemens and Thomson) are represented in the top 
group, and even they only manage to maintain their position "by 
enormous expenses and cross-funding." 
  Cooperative efforts, like that between the giants Siemens, 
IBM, and Toshiba, are one answer to the still growing financial 
burdens of chip development. The trio's new generation of memory 
storage (256 megabits) will swallow up a billion marks in 
development costs and two billion marks in production 
investment. But the Europeans still suffer under the handicap 
that they have no access to the mass markets and thus to mass 
production. 
  "In this market it is not only a question of mastering the 
technical principles -- competitiveness is determined by costs," 
explains Althoff. But costs are not least a function of wastage, 
and that in turn depends on practical experience in mass 
production. But that is where Europe's chip factories are 
lagging -- when they entered the microelectronics field they 
were already several generations of circuitry behind and never 
acquired the production knowhow of the Asiatics. 
  The only area in which they are maintaining good positions 
is 
in ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), the 
client-specific circuits with generally low outlay and usually 
not the most current technology. But "the more possibilities the 
mass processor offers, the more the trend will be towards a 
standard chip with specialized software. This will make 
tailor-made circuits less significant." 
  The general secretary of the VDE considers it improbable 
that 
German suppliers can close this gap with the production of the 
specialized software that would then be necessary: "The 
labor-intensive production of software is already partly passing 
to low-wage countries. This trend will intensify." The 
recognition that hardware production, with its 
capital-intensive, highly automated, and technically extremely 
demanding hardware production, would be more appropriate for 
Germany, is now of little use. 
  "Both of them are drifting away at the moment -- and we are 
in a cleft stick. If motor vehicle electronics, traffic control 
and high-resolution television -- chip-hungry technologies par 
excellence -- pass over to Japan in the wake of entertainment 
electronics, telefax and other parts of communications 
technology, then we can all go home." He defines the danger for 
Europeans: "Loss of linkage is a creeping process the results of 
which we will not feel in their full rigor for another 10 or 15 
years. But by then it will be far too late." 
  And there is more: "Losing access to the basic technology of 
microelectronics would mean losing touch with a whole field of 
new technologies which are just beginning to develop," Althoff 
warns. "Anyone who doesn't have microelectronics doesn't have 
the procedures either." 
  Here he is thinking of micromechanics, which 
microelectronics 
production technology uses for the production of tiny pumps or 
transmissions, and also of the new generations of power 
electronics components. "Anyone who wants to build a new, rapid 
locomotive needs power electronics. In international competition 
it can definitely make a difference if the Japanese get the 
technical data and ultimately the structural components ito 
their hands a few months earlier." 
  For example, if micromechanics, with its pioneering 
application area of medical technology, still a strong German 
domain, were to be strongly supported in Germany, that would 
certainly be welcome. But he says, "That will only help for the 
period of development. Afterwards we will again need mastery of 
mass technology -- for instance a pump the size of the head of a 
pin with which you could administer insulin within the body has 
to be produced in great numbers." 
  At the moment Althoff sees the way out of the cleft stick 
only in the political sphere: "We need a stronger technology 
policy, even a kind of industrial policy, if we want to plot a 
course for survival in time." He says that a whole package is 
needed, including tax advantages, help in forming pools in the 
production area and in the organization of sales with the goal 
of large inventories, and the removal of unnecessary obstacles. 
MITI still intervenes in the production cycle with specific 
objectives; American microelectronics obtain many incentives and 
financial resources from the military, their bulk purchaser: "We 
Europeans cannot hold back." 
  He says that the EC is pursuing a more or less unclear 
policy 
in this area, one which makes life more difficult than necessary 
for the microelectronics industry. As an example Althoff cites 
the long-drawn-out normalization process in the new areas of 
communications technology (mobile radio, radio data 
transmission): "If these things had proceeded more 
systematically for European industry we would have been able to 
achieve larger market shares." For Germany in particular he 
wishes for improved acceptance of technology: "Instead of 
stirring up fears and allowing data protection to score 
theoretical triumphs, those in authority would do better to get 
rid of obstacles and over-regulation."

<F P=106> [Article by "C.H.": "Second Chance in Microelectronics"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt -- The electronics industry is showing the 
greatest growth of all branches of industry and by the end of 
the decade will become the largest branch of industry in Europe 
too. Europe has the largest trade deficit in this field. This 
deficit will double by the end of the decade. But Europe also 
has a "second chance" in microelectronics if European 
manufacturers focus on independently supplying custom-designed 
circuits (ASICs [application-specific integrated circuits]). Dr. 
Max Syrbe, a professor and president of the Fraunhofer Society, 
has now called attention to this in a 10-thesis paper. 
  Japan dominates the memory market and America the 
processors. 
Custom- designed circuits offer Europe opportunities for 
independent developments, he says. The strategy of catching up 
in technology in the field of memory devices has failed, Syrbe 
believes. The basic mistake was copying the Japanese way, 
because it was believed that the technology of very-large-scale 
integration for memory chips would be the engine for constant 
technological progress. However, it would be a mistake to 
believe that the future can be ensured with international 
cooperation in every area of demand. 
  Syrbe argues further that the danger of dependence is less 
threatening from mass-produced devices than from 
application-specific chips, in which a major part of the 
functionality of new products lies. Because of this Europe's 
strategy for the future must be the development of 
microelectronic manufacturing geared to the needs of the small 
and medium-sized user industry. 
  The factory designs are also different here. While memory 
factories have to be designed for the best possible mastery of 
standard mass products, short process times and great 
flexibility prevail in ASIC factories. By means of flexible 
manufacturing technology with a high degree of automation the 
Europeans could offset the lead that Japan has in mass devices. 
The level of integration and the packing density of chips are 
not primarily decisive for the success of European products, but 
the cost and properties of the overall system are. 
  Syrbe is asking that now a structure also be found that has 
a 
form of sharing the work and risk with science that is 
advantageous for small and medium-sized companies, "as a 
specifically European way for microelectronics." New CAD tools 
for circuit design must constitute one footing, and new 
manufacturing technologies by means of which small numbers of 
items can also be manufactured economically, the other. 
Minifactories could set themselves up as adequate partners for a 
small and medium-sized user and manufacturer industry. The 
"single-wafer factory" project of Texas Instruments in the USA 
also demonstrates this. 
  He who brings his products more quickly onto the market has 
the competitive advantage. The microchip alone is not decisive 
here, but the product advance achieved by its means. Therefore 
the tight knitting together of semiconductor manufacturers and 
users is the prime necessity here.

  [TEXT] Costs are rising in research and development. Many 
companies fear that know-how will move over to the competition. 
  In-house work or outsourcing -- this is no longer just a 
question in production but also in research and development. For 
costs are rising there as well, because the product and 
innovation cycles are getting shorter and shorter. For example, 
while the costs of research and development in the large 
electronics companies were in 1980 still at about the level of 
net profit, they have since increased by more than a factor of 
two. By allocating research tasks to third parties, the costs 
can be reduced. 
  "The possibilities of outsourcing are, however, only being 
used by a few companies," Michael Eyett, of the renowned 
advisory institute Prognos AG in Basel, observes. Eyett also 
knows the reason for the reticence: Companies are too afraid 
that through outsourcing, the competition will gain possession 
of know-how belonging to the companies themselves. 
  At the same time, investigations carried out by Prognos AG 
show that companies which cooperate with other manufactures in 
research and development are more successful: As a rule, they 
demonstrate a greater share of new products, and obtain an above 
average growth in turnover as well as a higher export quota than 
do companies which are less amenable to cooperation. In 
addition, personnel costs for research and development are 
plainly lower. 
  Still, the decision for or against outsourcing of research 
and development capacities should be well considered. In-house 
research and development does offer the company some advantages: 

  -  Control over research and development remains with the 
company; 
  -  Acquired know-how can be used on an exclusive basis; 
  -  The company preserves its technological independence; 
  -  The success of its own in-house research bestows on the 
company 
a positive image among the public; 
  -  Internal cooperation among the various departments functions 
better. 

    But some disadvantages of in-house R&amp;D activities must 
not be 
concealed: 

  -  High fixed and lead costs accumulate; 
  -  In-house research requires a lot of time; 
  -  And, in addition, there is still always the risk of not 
succeeding technically and economically. 

    Prognos advisor Michael Eyett is not pleading the case that 
each research and development project should be given over to a 
third party. Eyett proposes that those areas which will in the 
future be a part of the core know-how for the company should 
remain in-house. Also, activities in which the company has 
developed technological know-how or which promise synergistic 
effects with available technological know-how should remain with 
the company. 
  Eyett is certain that such observations will be made with 
greater frequency in the future: "The trend towards increasing 
outsourcing of research and development will strengthen in the 
future." 
  The series "Technology at the Beginning of the 21st Century" 
will be continued in coming weeks. Planned for the next edition: 
Digital Television.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Francois Jacquier: "Germany's Giant Daimler </F>
Hurting Badly"] 
  [Text] Profits of Europe's largest industrial group 
have plummeted. Its aeronautics branch is eliminating 10,300 
jobs, and its automotive branch, 14,000. And its electrical 
engineering subsidiary is seeking new alliances. The emphasis is 
now on reduction of costs. 
  "Gross ist wunderbar [Big is wonderful]," Daimler-Benz's CEO 
[chief executive officer] Edzard Reuter responded to those who 
criticized his industrial bulimia. That was in 1989. Reuter had 
just completed a forceful entry into MBB 
[Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm], Germany's big aircraft 
manufacturer. 
  Five years later, the visionary leader of Europe's largest 
industrial group (approximately 349 billion francs [Fr] of 
annual revenue] is in the grip of the worst recession in its 
history. The current economic turnarounds are buffeting the 
German eagle's expansionist ambitions in its sectors of 
predilection -- the automotive (70 percent of its activity), the 
aeronautical (17 percent), and the electrical engineering (11 
percent) -- with crushing force. 
  Dornier, MTU, MBB, Fokker, and Deutsche Airbus -- all 
brought 
together under Daimler's subsidiary, Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) 
-- are reeling from cancellations of orders by airline companies 
and the drastic reduction of military spending across the Rhine. 
Its flagship fighter-aircraft program, the Eurofighter, being 
realized together with England, Italy, and Spain, and already 
seriously downsized, is now also running into serious technical 
difficulties. And its prospects are all of the gloomiest. In 
1993, DASA's orders will total Fr10 billion less than projected, 
and for the second consecutive year, the Munich-based firm will 
post losses. Given the situation, Jurgen Schrempp, the company's 
president, is slashing away at costs. After putting in place an 
initial cost-cutting plan last fall, he has now announced a new 
phase: the elimination of 10,300 jobs and the closing of six 
plants. The goal: savings of Fr5.2 billion annually in this 
sector, deemed strategic for the future of the Daimler group. 
  The restructurings of its aeronautics branch are all the 
more 
necessary since its automobile branch, Daimler-Benz's 
traditional pillar, has also been profoundly hit. A drop of 
around 28 percent in new car registrations combined with the 
cost of launching its new C series, and the turbulences of the 
European market for heavy trucks, have Mercedes also tobogganing 
in the red for 1993. To resume the road to competitiveness, the 
subsidiary's top management estimates that it must reduce 
operating costs by 30 percent within a period of three years. 
This coming year, 14,000 jobs will be eliminated in the 
prestigious automobile manufacturer's plants. Mercedes remains 
tightly knit and is moreover planning to launch its entry into 
the micro-car market -- a cultural revolution that takes on the 
allure of a challenge. 
  Meanwhile, Daimler's profits are melting like snow in a hot 
sun, jeopardizing Edzard Reuter's position. Nor can he count any 
longer on AEG, Daimler's electrical engineering subsidiary, 
which expects to post a loss of Fr1 billion this year. Having 
already divested itself of its domestic appliances business to 
Sweden's Electrolux, AEG is now searching for new alliances.

  [Text] Budapest (DPA) -- The German-American company 
MagyarCom is to have a 30 percent share in the privatization of 
the Hungarian state telephone company MATAV. An agreement to 
this effect was signed in Budapest today by the chairman of the 
managing board of the Deutsche Bundespost Telekom (Bonn), Helmut 
Ricke, and the Vice President of the U.S. telephone company 
Ameritech, Lou Rutigliano. 
  Ricke described the largest privatization so far in the 
telecommunications sphere in Eastern Europe as an important step 
in the country's economic upturn. With German and American 
help, MATV is to be expanded into a leading supplier of 
telecommunication services in Central and Eastern Europe until 
the turn of the century. It was anticipated that the number of 
telephone lines would rise from the current 1.5 million to 3.8 
million by the year 2001. 
  According to Ricke, the concession will run for a 25-year 
period and can be extended by a further 12.5 years. Telekom and 
Ameritech are planning to invest around DM7.3 billion in 
expanding the Hungarian telephone system.

  [Text] Trento. "It is not a large sum. It is only 430 
million lire over four years but the important thing in this 
case is the scientific and technological recognition of our 
laboratory and the project that we have been working on in 
recent years. It means that we were right from the beginning." 
IRST (Institute for Scientific Research and Technology) founder 
and director Luigi Stringa is extremely satisfied, and was 
commenting on the close collaboration agreement with the 
extremely powerful MITI, the Japanese ministry of industry and 
international trade, that is part of the new research program 
into artificial intelligence. 
  IRST is definitely talked about more abroad than it is in 
Italy, and this association with Japanese scientists, who are 
working on a new technological challenge, is proof of the fact. 
The involvement of this Trento-based, nationally-funded 
institute in the most prestigious project in the world shows 
that despite the lack of a research policy and the fact that 
funding is always scarce, it is also possible in Italy to have 
methodologies and goals that will stand up to competition from 
the lavishly equipped and extremely rich American, French, and 
German laboratories. 
  The meeting between Trento and Japan is a very special 
story, 
that has its roots in the last decade. Telling the story is 
like tracing the evolution of artificial intelligence throughout 
the 'eighties. The "fifth generation" was a fundamental step. 
This was the Japanese national program that frightened the 
entire West. The goal of the program, that was coordinated 
directly by the MITI, was to invent and construct intelligent 
computers that were capable of simulating human mental processes 
on an industrial scale. It was 1984 and "artificial 
intelligence" was a magical term on the same level as "expert 
systems." Every problem should have been overcome by their 
realization. Hardware and software, gifted with intelligence, 
would have helped man in every initiative and in taking every 
type of decision. There were many futile and dangerous hopes 
and finally there was delusion. Japanese research has surpassed 
this wave, this particular subject, that dominated the frontier 
discipline, of working on the capacity of the 
logical-algorithmic calculation of a machine to vainly attempt 
to imitate the human brain. The "fifth generation" program 
encountered many difficulties and later its goal was modified 
and given specifications at a lower level. This was far removed 
from the importance it had been given, thanks to which the most 
advanced American and European research centers had obtained 
generous funding to stem the enormous Japanese power. 
Paradoxically, the most concrete result obtained from the 
"fifth generation," was the strengthening of research in the 
countries that compete with Japan. 
  In fact, last year, a disconsolate Kazuhiro Fuchi, director 
of the program, was forced by the scientific community of his 
country, to make the conclusions, that everybody already knew, 
official. Nine years of work and 500 billion in investments led 
to the perfection of well-developed workstations and advanced 
software that is entirely Japanese (something important in a 
great nation that ignores the English language, the language 
used in computer science), but nothing that really gets close to 
an intelligent computer. "It will take a lot more time to reach 
this goal. Ten years is completely insufficient," Fuchi 
bitterly commented. 
  The government, industry, and the academy say that he is 
right, and have proposed a new research program with a 
completely changed perspective, the RWC [no expansion provided]. 
As its name already states, realistic ways are being sought for 
the computer to form part of an ever deepening integration 
between the different technologies, to construct systems that 
are able to interact with the external world. An investment of 
one trillion [currency not specified] is to be made over 10 
years. Japanese industry will closely collaborate with 
universities, an undertaking that partially failed in the 
preceding program, and with the help of the best, and most 
suitable, foreign ability, this time it should succeed. There 
are already prototypes that are close to the goal of the RWC, 
which is to obtain intelligence from the machine's ability to 
adapt to its environment, in accordance with the most advanced 
evolutions of computer science and robotics. 
  Stringa continued: "When we read the specifications of the 
new Japanese program here at the IRST, we said `But this is MAIA 
[Advanced Artificial Intelligence Model],' and we decided to 
reply to the announcement made by MITI with our proposal." The 
evaluation committee immediately gave a positive reply and the 
funding arrived with the agreement. For IRST, as well as the 
great satisfaction that derived from the fact that MITI had only 
accepted another two foreign proposals in addition to that of 
the Trento-based laboratory, there is also the security of being 
able to conduct their research without problems. In fact the 
MAIA project has been going on for some time, and working on the 
internal project and the Japanese project is the same thing, and 
will require the same effort. 
  MAIA is a mobile robot that can do a lot of things, such as 
moving about without being given a precise navigation program, 
recognizing the voices and faces of speakers, understanding 
spoken phrases, and giving voice replies in natural language. 
By concentrating all the know-how of IRST onto the realization 
of MAIA, Stringa has managed to do something that still seemed 
to be impossible in the second half of the eighties, that is to 
make the experts in the various branches of artificial 
intelligence communicate with each other. Today it seems to be 
folly, yet yesterday researchers into vision were little 
interested in the progresses of speech recognition, and even 
less in movement. Moreover the construction of MAIA meant 
perfecting a robot that was able to understand orders and then 
obey them. Every type of knowledge was indispensable to be able 
to build the entire system, then one piece had to be added to 
another integrating the subsystems in the best possible way. 
This implied the total involvement of all the work groups, that 
were all equally important for the success of the project. 
  The road of integration, and that of sensors, have 
demonstrated themselves to be IRST's winning cards, although 
they once left the Italian scientific community perplexed. At 
that time people were only talking about expert systems and 
intelligent computers, and perhaps a robot like MAIA seemed 
useless. However, if each of the subsystems making up the robot 
is examined individually, each one has its own autonomy, and it 
is already possible to imagine a series of different 
applications for it. MAIA recognizes faces and books. It plays 
the role of "electronic librarian" at IRST, and could become a 
security system. A face is like a fingerprint and the 
methodology using histograms that is followed by the system 
cannot be deceived. If the face is recognized mathematically, 
the system opens the armored door, and gives the OK to a banking 
operation. 
  The interaction of man and machine using natural language is 
one of the big myths of artificial intelligence and its 
applications cover all the sectors of computer science. The 
same is true for voice recognition and comprehension of the 
spoken word. The mobile robot, able to move anywhere, is part 
of many research programs, including a European program for its 
use in hospitals, the robot nurse. It is precisely in this 
sector that there will be deeper collaboration between IRST and 
RWC. It is very difficult to make a machine move without the 
intervention of man in an environment that has no particular 
structures (without the factory assembly lines that run along 
rails). The robot must recognize obstacles, go round them 
without colliding, regulate its velocity, and "feel" the nature 
of the ground. We are only talking about movement on wheels. We 
are putting movement on legs aside for the time being. It is 
not very useful and movement on wheels or caterpillar crawlers 
is often more efficient. The robot must be very intelligent to 
be able to understand where it is and react in the right way to 
the environment surrounding it. 
  Autonomous systems based on vision, and the development of 
learning systems for mobile robots, are the subjects that will 
be concentrated on during the four years of collaboration with 
the Japanese scientists. They remind us of the little automaton 
like ET that wandered around the institute experimenting a 
process for memorizing images and reproducing them. After 
having stored the images the machine could remember those 
environments by referring back to the images. It was the first 
prototype. It will be developed further in the future. 
  As well as the research methodology that has made IRST a 
pole 
of great excellence in the panorama of world research, a type of 
self funding that has obliged the researchers at IRST not to get 
lost in pure academic theory has been very useful and has made 
researchers continually face up to projects and schedules. 
After seven years of activity, IRST costs the autonomous 
province of Trento 22 billion [lire] per year. However, the 
figure is reduced to 14 when copyrights and other sources of 
funding are considered. These are those of the major European 
programs, EUREKA [European Research Coordination Agency] and 
ESPRIT [European Strategic Program for Research and Development 
in Information Technoloiges]. If one was to evaluate, and this 
must be done, the research earnings from the international 
activity of a laboratory, and from its participation in EC 
projects, perhaps IRST would have no rivals. University and 
Scientific research Minister Umberto Colombo has recently 
complaint about the low level of university participation in 
these programs. In fact only 61 billion [lire] will go to the 
entire Italian academic community over five years. IRST, alone, 
can boast of 18, almost one third of the total.

<F P=106> [Article by Jens D. Billerbeck: "Japanese Company Does </F>
Research in Oxford; Part of European Research Landscape"] 
  [Text] Oxford, VDI-N, 17 Sep--Japanese firms see in the 
countries of Europe not only lucrative sales markets; they are 
also interested in the ideas of local researchers and 
developers. Technologies for future products are by no means 
being developed only in Japan. An example of this is Sharp 
Laboratories Europe (SLE) in the English university town of 
Oxford. 
  Clive C. Bradley, the managing director of SLE in Oxford, 
came right to the point: "Why does a company like Sharp invest 
in research facilities abroad?" In his answer to the question he 
cited several arguments for such a commitment. For one thing, a 
technology company with international commitments cannot afford 
to do without the productive influences of another scientific 
culture, the creativity of researchers who have other ways of 
looking at things. And for another, research on the spot also 
supports integration into the respective markets. 
  "Moreover," Bradley went on, "we in Europe have easier 
access 
to what goes on here in colleges and universities. And, 
naturally, we also want to avoid friction in international trade 
and to improve our image." 
  Under no circumstances do the approximately 50 SLE employees 
feel that they are an appendage to a central laboratory in 
Japan. They have their own research areas in which each of them 
wants to occupy a technologically leading position. They are 
working on four main areas in Oxford: optoelectronics, image 
processing, information technology -- especially in the fields 
of translation systems and disseminated artificial intelligence 
-- and liquid crystal technology. 
  The laboratory was founded in 1990 and was initially housed 
in rented rooms. Then about 13 million pounds were invested 
until 1992 in the construction and furnishing of its own 
building, which is located in a technology park near Oxford. It 
is anticipated that about 100 scientists and engineers will be 
working here in the finally expanded building. Sharp employs a 
total of 6,500 people worldwide in research and development. Its 
investments in R &amp; D amount to about 660 million pounds a 
year. 
  All SLE research projects are coordinated with Sharp's 
central research and development, but are then developed in 
Europe. The patents that are produced by the projects are also 
first applied for in Europe or England. Bradley: "We think of 
ourselves as part of the European research landscape and want to 
be accepted as such. Our goal is broad collaboration with other 
research facilities -- in so doing, we're trying to be as open 
as we can." Of course, there are already cooperative ventures 
with British universities -- first of all with those in Oxford 
-- but universities on the European continent are also on 
Bradley's wishlist: "We also participate in various European 
research programs." The open admission that they are moving 
toward becoming a European research facility is also expressed 
in the company's personnel policy. The majority of its employees 
come from Europe, some from the United States, and some from 
Japan. Occupied by a European, the post of managing director is 
also part of this policy. He admits that European engineers have 
to in part be paid higher salaries than for comparable positions 
in Japan. But this is compensated for by the already mentioned 
advantages. 
  SLE research projects are conducted in large part in the 
field of basic research. Dr. Robert G.W. Brown, the head of the 
optoelectronics department: "We're working on, for example, 
semiconductor nanostructures to be able to produce new kinds of 
laser diodes with a broad color spectrum. Another team is 
working with optical neuron networks. These make possible 
completely new approaches to image processing since they process 
optical data optically." In his opinion, the work they have been 
doing on blue and ultraviolet lasers for optical storage and 
printing systems has almost reached the production stage. 
  In the image processing sector in Oxford they are in 
particular working on a new technique for the three-dimensional 
electronic representation of images. The new method gets by 
without any additional aids -- stereo eyeglasses, for example -- 
and works like 3-D printing, with which we have been long 
familiar. Another project is the development of a high-quality, 
high-resolution color printing process. 
  Bradley cited a computer-supported translation system as a 
typical example of a development project that is oriented toward 
European market requirements. It should be capable of 
automatically translating texts from one European language into 
another. In the process the programmers have had to solve 
serious problems inherent in the different structures of the 
individual languages. However, a demonstration of the system 
produced no distortion of meaning, not even after a sentence was 
translated from English into German, then into French, and back 
into English. 
  Research projects in the field of liquid crystals constitute 
the fourth pillar in Oxford. For the present they are being used 
in a big way in display units for portable computers. The Oxford 
developers are working here especially with so-called 
ferroelectric LCs, which permit substantially higher switching 
speeds as compared with conventional materials. 
  SLE is one example of the Sharp Company's European 
commitment, but not the only one by far. Kenjiro Tsugawa, the 
head of the information systems department, alluded proudly to 
the 25th anniversary of the head office in Hamburg, which is to 
be celebrated this year. Worldwide, the company has 64,000 
employees and it had a sales volume of about DM19 billion in 
1992. Tsugawa: "We were able to triple our sales volume in 
Europe in the past 10 years. Even in the difficult financial 
year, 1992-1993, we were able to attain a sales volume of DM1.2 
billion." Unlike other firms, they are determined to further 
increase their investments in buildings and equipment as well as 
their expenditures for research development since "these are 
investments in our future."

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Laperrousaz: "A Software To Accelerate </F>
Use of Carbon Fibers"] 
  [Text] With Composic, a bicycle wheel made of 
carbon-epoxy fiber can be designed in five days. Sports 
industries, as well as the automotive and aeronautics 
industries, are interested. 
  To sell to the Japanese its software for computing 
composite-material structures, Framasoft+CSI, a Framatome 
subsidiary, has found a worthy ally: no less than Toray, the 
world's number one in carbon fibers. Toray has been using the 
software, baptized Composic, in-house for the past year for its 
own account, and began marketing it in July 1993. To date, it 
has found three clients: the National Aerospace Laboratory (the 
Japanese NASA) and two manufacturers of golf clubs. 
  These first users operate in the two sectors that consume 
the 
most carbon fibers in Japan. This is, of course, not 
happenstance. But Toray is making no secret of its intent to 
penetrate other sectors, especially the automotive sector. This 
will not be possible unless the sector's design departments, 
whose culture is still strongly influenced by metals, learn to 
work with composites. And the Composic software should help them 
in this regard. 
  "The design of a part made of composite material still takes 
more time and the productivity of the design departments is very 
low," says Toyoki Tanaka, manager of Toray Industries' research 
and engineering laboratories. Actually, the 20 or so engineers 
and technicians comprising this center have substantial computer 
facilities at their disposal: A battery of computers, including 
a Cray, and softwares gleaned from all parts of the world, such 
as Abaqus and Ideas of American origin. But these are difficult 
to use and require a learning period of at least two months. 
<H5>  40 Units Already Sold in Europe </H5>
  The Framasoft+CSI product "is learned" in two weeks. It 
enables the construction of a part, on a computer screen, by 
stacking up to 60 layers of materials, and the advance 
computation of its mechanical behavior. It is much more 
productive than its competitors. For example: The design of a 
bicycle wheel with three carbon-epoxy-fiber spokes takes no more 
than five days versus two to three months heretofore. And "the 
concordance between design computations and test results is very 
good," says Toyoki Tanaka. Composic does have its limitations: 
It does not provide for taking into account the nonlinear 
behavior of materials. Given the interest being shown by Toray, 
however, Framatome+CSI expects to close this gap. 
  The software has already been sold to the extent of 
approximately 40 units in Europe in the aeronautics 
(Aerospatiale), sports (Rossignol), and automotive (BMW, VW, 
Ligier) sectors. It will undoubtedly contribute to the more 
widespread use of carbon fibers by industry, possibly even in 
the automotive sector, but the price of the fibers will also 
have to come down. This angle is also being studied under the 
Toray research program.

in Southeast Asia"; introductory paragraph in boldface as

  [Text] Singapore--This part of the world is becoming 
aware of the effects of industrialization on the environment. 
Budgets are swelling in every country. Water treatment is taking 
the lion's share. 
  The Regional Institute of Environmental Technologies (RIET) 
was inaugurated in Singapore at the end of July with a budget of 
5 million ECU's (32.5 million francs). It is a joint project 
between the European Community and Singapore. The purpose of the 
institution is to provide expertise and serve as a data bank. 
"Establishment of the RIET comes at a crucial time for the 
countries of Southeast Asia, where the effects of 
industrialization have two sides: the growing economic 
importance of this part of the world and the other side of the 
coin, which is the rapid accumulation of problems linked to the 
environment," says Philippe Bergeron, the institute's director. 
Beyond that, the institute is also a response to Singapore's 
ambition to become a model "green city" and a regional center of 
expertise on environmental matters. 
  The island state with 2.8 million inhabitants has already 
positioned itself in that market by establishing the Semes firm, 
an indirect subsidiary of the Ministry of Environment that 
specializes in environmental protection projects in the regional 
market.

<H5>  110 Billion Francs in Year 2000 </H5>
  The fact is that the size of the regional market is far from 
negligible: activities linked to environmental cleanup, waste 
treatment, and air pollution are expected to be worth 66.5 
billion francs in 1995 and over 110 billion francs in the year 
2000 (promising figures even when compared to the European 
market, which is 10 times as large). Air and water pollution are 
expected to increase tenfold over the next 15 years -- a result 
of the 300-percent increase in the number of vehicles and an 
increase of from 150 to 200 percent in industrial activity. 
  Within ASEAN (a free trade agreement among Southeast Asian 
countries), Singapore has had the strictest air and water 
quality standards and solid waste regulations for the past 20 
years. The annual budget for the environment was close to 2.5 
billion francs in 1991. "In the other countries in the area, 
priority is assigned to the supply of drinking water, and 
wastewater treatment has only begun within the past six months 
to a year," says Hubert Broux of Degremont, a subsidiary of the 
Lyonnaise-Dumez firm. 
  In Malaysia, the 1991-1995 plan calls for investing 13 
billion francs in the quality and distribution of water. For its 
part, Thailand has announced a 1.7 billion-franc program for 
building a water treatment plant in Bangkok to combat pollution. 
In both Indonesia and the Philippines, awareness is a more 
recent phenomenon. Indonesia, for example, is spending about 3.5 
billion francs annually to protect its environment. 
  With its six sewage plants, the incineration of 60 percent 
of 
its refuse, controls on the number of vehicles, and the 
relocation of certain polluting industries, Singapore presents 
real opportunities for specialized Western firms. The principal 
areas are the modernization of existing systems using more 
sophisticated technologies, especially to solve the problem of 
odors from wastewater treatment plants; the introduction of a 
telemetering system for controlling air quality; the treatment 
of sludge from the unloading of oil tankers; and waste recycling. 
<H5>  Desalination of Seawater </H5>
  Sidem, a subsidiary of the Serete group, has obtained an 800 
million-franc contract from the Shell Oil Company for supplying 
a seawater desalination plant. Sita, a subsidiary of the Lyons 
Water Company specializing in the collection and treatment of 
waste, has signed several contracts with Singapore hospitals to 
sort, transport, and incinerate hospital waste. 
  Whether expressed or not, those needs in the region are 
considerable. In Selangor, Malaysia, Degremont is helping to 
build the largest drinking water facility in Asia. In Indonesia, 
where France is active as the third-largest lending country with 
aid totaling 800 million francs in 1993, Degremont has won three 
contracts for water treatment plants on Java, Bali, and Lombok. 
For its part, the Lyons Water Company is not present in 
Singapore, where water distribution is a monopoly of the state, 
which has signed supply contracts with Malaysia and, just 
recently, with Sumatra (Indonesia). In Malaysia, on the other 
hand, the French firm operates three concessions for the supply 
of drinking water: in Taipeng (300 million francs), Johore Bahru 
(4.6 billion francs), and Kota Kinabalu (1.8 billion francs). 
Last year the General Water Company won a contract worth about 
10 million francs to build a water ozonization plant in Malaysia. 
  The market is likely to expand even more now that 
privatization programs are about to get underway. Nowadays 
governments are no longer able to finance the distribution and 
treatment of water, so they are turning to private groups. The 
Northwest firm of Great Britain, for example, is about to obtain 
the contract for wastewater in Bangkok.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EC: Parliament Calls For Specific </F>
Research Programme for Aeronautics Sector."; as released by 
Brussels Textline database] 
  [Text] Strasbourg, 16/12/1993 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- By giving 
its position based on the Bofill Abeilhe Report (Socialist, 
Spain) on the European Commission's communication to the 
Aeronautics Industry Council, the Parliament called for 
Community action, notably under the fourth research framework 
programme. It proposed the elaboration (in concert with 
industrialists) of an aeronautical research programme as well as 
the definition of modalities for financing, follow-through and 
control and distribution of results. Industrialists, the States 
and the Union are invited to carry out joint strategic 
reflection in order to give fresh impetus to this industry. The 
EP [European Parliament] considers that it would also be 
necessary to: 
  a) pursue and intensify the aid programme for reconversion 
of 
armaments industries (KONVER) and integrate the major military 
programmes in the appropriate European structures; 
  b) launch training and re-training programmes; 
  c) speed up harmonisation of norms of industrial and 
regulatory industrial techniques, and create a single authority 
to oversee the functioning of the unified air transport market. 
  The EP also calls for competition policy with regard to 
merger or takeover operations to be adjusted to the needs of 
industry on the world market. The Commission must ensure that 
this practice does not entail a monopolistic situation. The EP 
considers that, given the European structure of these 
industries, it is appropriate to speed up the establishment of 
representative staff bodies at European level. The situation of 
the aeronautics industry is not dramatic, said the Rapporteur, 
despite some structural weakness (companies operate in an 
over-national way), the vulnerability due to dependence on an 
often volatile dollar, and the prospect of massive job losses 
(150 000 by the end of the century). Mr Fuchs (France) said on 
behalf of the Socialist Group that the opinion that the criteria 
on merger and concentration control in the aeronautics sector 
should not be (as the European Commission thinks) respect of 
competition but the maintenance of European competitiveness. In 
the future, Mr Fuchs believes, there may be only two or three 
large companies at European level. Markets are too fragmented, 
said Mr. Siso Cruellas (Spain) for the EPP [European People's 
Party], while Mrs. Minardi (France) defended, on behalf of Left 
Unity, the maintenance of national industries. If there is no 
specific R&amp;D programme for the aeronautics industry, it is 
because it benefits from certain aspects of the 4th research and 
development framework programme, said Mr. Bangemann on behalf of 
the European Commission. Furthermore, he does not agree with Mr. 
Fuchs on the need to maintain a public service: privatised 
industry could be more effective than national monopolies. A 
working group is currently studying the means to make it 
possible to compensate for the dollar's volatility (for example, 
through insurance policies taken out by companies). Concerning 
the military aspects of this industry, the Member States are 
reluctant to grant a role to the Community as such in this 
domain, concluded Mr. Bangemann.

<F P=106> [Interview with ENEA President Prof. Nicola Cabibbo by </F>
Francesco Prestipino; place and date not given: "ENEA Has Faith 
in the Future;" first five paragraphs are RICERCA &amp; 
INNOVAZIONE 
introduction] 
  [Text] It has increased its research effort in the sectors 
it covers and, something new, it is working as an "agency" by 
publishing and distributing the results of its activities 
throughout Italy. 
  With over 5,000 employees, nine large research centers, and 
other smaller areas where it is working, ENEA [Agency for New 
Technologies, Energy, and the Environment] is present throughout 
Italy. 
  Amongst its new lines of intervention there are plans for 
the 
transfer and distribution of innovation to production, industry 
and agriculture, the development of components and technologies 
for the utilization of renewable sources of energy and energy 
saving, as well as research and experimentation of innovative 
nuclear reactors that are safer than those of the past. 
  This redefinition of its areas of competence is laying the 
foundations for the ENEA of the year 2000. It will be a 
producer of technological and managerial culture, and be at the 
service, in particular, of the manufacturing world. 
  Nicola Cabibbo, whom we have interviewed, has recently been 
called to direct this research giant. He is a scientist who is 
well known and respected by the international scientific 
community, and has come from the presidency of the INFN [Italian 
National Institute for Nuclear Physics]. 
  [Prestipino] Prof. Cabibbo, the handbook of the new ENEA is 
definitely the 1993-95 three-year program, that was published in 
December 1992 and presents the programs and new objectives of 
the agency in 115 pages. How much of this reflects the 
situation of the old agency and how much describes the new one? 
  [Cabibbo] Let us say immediately that this is a "sliding" 
plan, that has suffered from the time when it was drawn up, and 
allows for changes of direction as it goes along. The 
developments of the coming years will influence the way it is 
followed. 
  [Prestipino] It has been said that the plan is already old 
or that anyway it reflects the ideas of the old agency. 
  [Cabibbo] When I arrived at the ENEA I did not consider 
reviewing the plan because it is a lengthy procedure. Perhaps I 
will participate in the preparation of the next one. Let us not 
forget that it has been approved at ministerial level. 
  I think that it is very important for the agency to focus 
its 
activities better. Its nuclear activity having been 
interrupted, ENEA has found itself without the burden of this 
institutional duty. From this point of view the reform law of 
August 1991 is to be viewed very positively since it gave the 
agency precise goals. Nuclear energy was an enormous job that 
required commitment, involved great responsibility, care for the 
environment, and the development of advanced technologies. 
  Now my idea is to focus and gather the various initiatives 
around major projects, in a context that is easier to understand 
so that the objectives to be pursued are clearer. 
  The structural elements are still there. I mean to say, 
there is still the expertise in the energy field, and the fields 
of related problems, from the rational use of energy, to the 
alternative sources, to nuclear energy and so on. 
  [Prestipino] So is it a plan without an itinerary that is to 
be reviewed as it goes along? 
  [Cabibbo] Certainly. In the environmental field for 
example, a central problem is that of working in harmony with 
the others who are involved in this field. Let us not forget 
that there are about 3,000 researchers scattered around in 
various research centers working on the environment in Italy, 
and that about 800 of them are in ENEA. 
  [Prestipino] Could ENEA have a role to play in this 
harmonization process? 
  [Cabibbo] In the environmental field work is also done for 
projects. It is clear that ENEA will launch its own projects, 
like the one on the "Mediterranean Basin" that was presented at 
the end of September at our marine research center at Santa 
Teresa. 
  Yes, in some ways we put ourselves forward as promoters and 
coordinators, a little like we are for the Antarctic, but we are 
always ready to compare what we are doing with what others are 
doing. 
  Instead, that which ENEA can specifically provide and make 
available to safeguard the environment, on the one hand is 
systems ability, and on the other is technological ability. 
These two riches permit ENEA to take on important roles, at a 
global level, in programs that do not take single aspects into 
consideration, but that consider the environmental problems as a 
whole, since they are necessarily interconnected and often 
require multidisciplinary interventions and collaboration with 
other countries. For example, Spain is very interested in 
collaborating with us, and France, being very active in the 
environmental field, is already doing so. 
  [Prestipino] Amongst the strategies for the renewal of the 
agency, what effect will the new line that you announced have on 
the use of the APE [Array Processor Experiment] super computer? 
  [Cabibbo] The super computer is a central element for the 
transfer of scientific knowledge to major applications, ranging 
from those of the environment such as meteorology and climatic 
changes, to those of great technological interest such as 
metallurgy and combustion processes. ENEA has ordered a large 
parallel computer capable of performing 100 billion operations 
per second, an APE Quadrics, produced by Alenia Spazio under 
license from the INFN. At present it is the most powerful 
parallel computer available in the world and the technology is 
entirely Italian. 
  We have also ordered six small Quadrics that will either be 
used for developing programs or for new types of applications, 
made possible by the availability of the power of a super 
computer that has the size and advantages of a work station. 
  [Prestipino] Will the super computer also be used in the 
energy sector? 
  [Cabibbo] Certainly. For example, one of the problems that 
we are carefully studying in the energy field is that of 
combustion and this requires a combination of experimental 
techniques and numerical simulation. The trend is to consider 
the experimental techniques as the validation of the simulation 
techniques. The latter, in fact, are much richer, and permit a 
more detailed and careful study. ENEA has a very important 
experimental combustion center at Casaccia. We are trying to 
integrate this experimental center, so that it forms part of a 
more complete picture that will involve the use, once the 
Quadrics computer is available, of numerical simulation. This 
will put us in the vanguard. 
  [Prestipino] At this stage of renewal, while the structure 
of the agency is being planned out on a grand scale, what would 
be a burden and what would be helpful? 
  [Cabibbo] Compared to other agencies, ENEA is divided into 
large research centers, such as those at Casaccia and Frascati 
near Rome, Saluggia in Piemonte, Trisaia in Basilicata, 
Brasimone in the Tuscan-Emilian Appenines, Portico in Campania, 
Santa Teresa in Liguria and Bologna. This structure creates, on 
one hand, a managerial and organizational burden, but on the 
other it offers the advantage of being able to put an imposing 
striking force into the field to work on specific problems that 
require the simultaneous use and synergy of various types of 
expertise. This is what ENEA has always done in the past for 
the complex programs for nuclear power stations. 
  A very interesting program that has been recently managed by 
ENEA has been the "Antarctic Project." The agency was able to 
pour its technical-scientific and managerial ability into this 
program. ENEA received merit for having enabled Italy to 
present itself on the international scene in "full dress." A 
modern base was constructed in a short time and the quality of 
the research programs carried out has allowed us to become one 
of the nations of the Antarctic Treaty with full rights, and to 
collaborate, with equal scientific dignity, with the other 
countries that are already present, such as the United States 
and France. But the Antarctic program is a paradigm from 
another point of view in the sense that ENEA does not deal only 
with those aspects that it finds more congenial, such as the 
systems engineering and logistics that require extremely complex 
operations and the use of advanced technologies, but does so in 
close collaboration with other research bodies. The scientific 
program is multidisciplinary, and ENEA, although it is also 
present at this level, has a minor position with respect to the 
CNR [Italian National Research Council] and the universities 
that play the major part. 
  [Prestipino] What direction will the new ENEA take, will it 
turn toward pure research or to a closer collaboration with 
industry? 
  [Cabibbo] It will pass through research, but also through 
its applications. ENEA is able to do valid research and as the 
institutional duties of ENEA also include direct interventions, 
such as those on the environment, we are directing our work 
toward the concrete problems of the country. In order for this 
to be possible and for it to give the results that are wanted, 
the agency must have strong research components. 
  [Prestipino] How is the agency preparing for its new duties? 
How are the personnel and the engineers being retrained? 
  [Cabibbo] Technical abilities are easily transferable, 
particularly when you are working in complex sectors. For 
example, the director of the Antarctic program is a nuclear 
engineer. New expertise is certainly necessary to enter new 
fields, but the possibility of self training is also to be 
valorized. 
  When we think about training we also think about it as a 
further field of service that ENEA could offer the national 
community. 
  [Cabibbo continues] For example, today there is an extensive 
request for training that has arisen from local requirements for 
new expertise, resulting from the necessity to look after 
certain aspects of the safeguarding of the environment and to 
increase energy saving. ENEA has a wealth of expertise to offer 
in these sectors. 
  [Prestipino] In a certain sense the reform law has put ENEA 
on the market, pushing it to find its own funding for autonomous 
survival. How is it doing? 
  [Cabibbo] I would say well. One third of the funding is 
covered by collaboration programs with the ministries and with 
the European Community. It is enough to consider that, in terms 
of funding, international commissions entrusted to ENEA amount 
to about 120 billion per year. 
  [Prestipino] The south of Italy, what lines of intervention 
are planned for this area by ENEA? 
  [Cabibbo] ENEA is moving toward the actuation of the 
agreement on the Mezzogiorno [southern Italy] Program. For 
example we have already taken on 55 of the projected 80 
researchers. At present we are waiting, but in the meantime we 
are working on a new collaboration agreement with the ministry 
of scientific research. 
  We are not so interested in the value of the initiative 
being 
discussed, as we are in its ends, the goals of such a 
collaboration. 
  [Prestipino] Energy. What is ENEA doing at an international 
level to have safe nuclear energy? 
  [Cabibbo] Examining and reviewing current nuclear 
technologies following the referendum is of dramatic importance 
for ENEA. 
  An interesting point is that our European partners, in 
particular Germany, that were reluctant to accept the commitment 
to a new generation of reactors are now more disposed to do so. 
Work is being done on a new project at a European level. ENEA 
intends making its own contribution to this project, the EPR 
(European Pressurized Reactor), because it seems to meet our 
requirements in terms of social acceptability. 
  The safety characteristics of new reactors can no longer be 
expressed in terms of probabilities. The design must be such as 
to guarantee that even the biggest possible accident has no 
consequences, either for the environment, or for the population. 
  The research for these new generation power stations must 
continue to lead to reactors that are intrinsically safe, with 
which, in the worst case, it would be possible to lose the 
reactor itself, but without emissions outside the plant that 
were above the safety level. The construction of these plants, 
already technologically possible, depends on a number of 
factors, these being high costs, social acceptability, and the 
problems of managing them. ENEA's research program is very 
limited with respect to what the agency was doing in the 
'eighties, also because the new reactors require development and 
certification at a European level, if not at a world level. 
This is not a road that we can take alone. 
  [Prestipino] Alternative forms of energy. Other countries 
have moved on to their commercialization. In Italy we are still 
at the research stage. What does ENEA intend to do? 
  [Cabibbo] The renewable sources that ENEA is concerned with 
are wind energy and the energy that can be obtained from 
biomasses, such as garbage. They are already competitive, 
particularly if the social costs (pollution etc.) of the 
traditional sources of energy are taken into account. However, 
with respect to what is technologically possible today, Italy is 
behind as far as the use of energy derived from the wind is 
concerned. 
  It is necessary to provide incentives for the construction 
and use of this type of equipment, as has been done in Denmark 
and the United Kingdom, guaranteeing those that use the 
equipment (usually small producers) that their energy will be 
purchased. ENEA has collaborated with two Italian industries in 
the research and development for the construction of various 
models that are slightly different from those used in the 
northern European countries because of the lower wind speeds 
found in our regions. Denmark and the United Kingdom are 
demonstrating that already today it is possible to produce 
abundant energy from the wind, and to do so at competitive 
prices. 
  The time is also ripe for us to make the jump in quality 
from 
research to industrial application. It is one thing to 
construct a single prototype unit generating energy from the 
wind and it is another to construct a hundred, being able to 
count on the economies of scale. 
  [Prestipino] And solar energy? 
  [Cabibbo] Solar energy is less conventional than wind 
energy. The energy produced by solar power plants has a higher 
cost. It is an interesting technology for certain specialized 
applications, such as isolated houses. However, it still cannot 
make an impact on the energy consumption of the country. 
  [Cabibbo continues] Solar panels that are cheaper than those 
currently available are necessary if their use is to have a 
relevant impact. Once we have gotten over this problem, the 
solution to which could be found in the coming years, (ENEA is 
doing a lot of work in this direction, both at the Portici 
center and in collaboration with other countries) the 
photovoltaic cell will become very desirable, both for 
ecological motives, and from the aesthetic point of view. Let 
us not forget that wind-powered generators have been strongly 
contested in the United Kingdom because, according to some 
environmentalists, the blades of the windmills disfigure the 
countryside. 
  [Prestipino] In conclusion, Prof. Cabibbo, where is ENEA 
going? How will it respond to the many older employees who are 
retiring early? How will the agency be renewed? 
  [Cabibbo] ENEA is still feeling the influence of nuclear 
energy, which required an organizational set-up that is too 
burdensome today. As an agency that dedicates itself to other 
activities it will be necessary to adjust the team. 
  The early retirements would be very positive if it were 
possible to bring young people into the agency. At present we 
can only hire about 10 percent with respect to the number of 
people who are leaving. An ideal turnover figure would be 20/30 
percent. Without hiring young people, the agency is getting 
older. Two thousand people will be leaving and it will be 
necessary to hire at least 600 young people during the next 10 
years.

<F P=106> [UK Press Release from the Office of Public Service and </F>
Science: "Technology Foresight Programme: The Search Is On."] 
  [Text] The Technology Foresight programme tomorrow takes 
another step forward as we invite several thousand top technical 
and market experts to become involved, announced William 
Waldegrave, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister 
for Science. Mr. Waldegrave was speaking at the Chemical 
Industries Association annual dinner in London. 
  Mr. Waldegrave announced that he was writing to over 900 key 
people in industry and the Research base. He said: "These 
people represent the first step in recruiting a pool of several 
thousand top technical and market experts who will together work 
to identify the priority markets and technologies of the future." 
  Those experts identified by a process of co-nomination and 
invited to contribute to this important programme, will be asked 
to participate in workshops and share their views on markets and 
technologies. This process will start in Spring 1994 with final 
reports due to emerge early in 1995. 
  Mr. Waldegrave went on to say: "The main aim of Technology 
Foresight - a key initiative announced in the White Paper 
`Realising our Potential; a strategy for Science, Engineering 
and Technology'- is to increase wealth creation and improve the 
quality of life through a close partnership between scientists, 
industry and government. As a result we hope scientists and 
industrialists will come together to forge new networks and 
contacts, to identify market trends and technological 
opportunities, from which we will all benefit." 
  Mr. Waldegrave concluded: "Full involvement by scientists 
and 
industry will be crucial in making Technology Foresight a 
success." 
<H5>  Notes to Editors </H5>
  1. Co-nomination is the technique being used to identify the 
experts. It has been used successfully in the past to identify 
key, active researchers in particular scientific and technical 
fields. Co-nomination relies on individual experts identifying 
others whom they regard as experts. They are in turn asked for 
their own nominations in an iterative approach. 
  Feedback from the OST [Office of Science and Technology] 
consultative seminars emphasises that equal weight needs to be 
placed on market needs (market pull) and technological 
opportunities (technology push). The co-nomination technique is 
attempting to identify people with knowledge about markets as 
well as technologies. Every effort will also be made to 
identify people working in Small or Medium sized Enterprises 
(SMEs) and encourage them to participate in Technology 
Foresight. If the co-nomination process does not yield enough 
people in these groups we will consider alternative methods to 
ensure that they are adequately represented. 
  The co-nomination process will also encourage respondents to 
identify `maverick' thinkers, as these may be particularly 
useful in the Technology Foresight programme. 
  Participants are asked to categorise their expertise in one 
of 19 areas, some market based, others technology based. The 
final decision on how to divide the work into expert panel 
sectors has yet to be taken by the Foresight steering group. 
  2.The consultation phase of the Foresight programme is 
drawing to a close with the last `Focus on Foresight' seminar 
being held at the University of Birmingham on 23 November 1993. 
  3.Media copies of the questionnaire and further information 
on the co-nomination process and the Technology Foresight 
programme are available from the OPSS press office.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EC: Research Council - Differences </F>
Over Fourth Research Programme"; as released by Brussels 
Textline database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 3 Dec 1993 (AGENCE EUROPE) - The EC 
Research Council, which is to meet in Brussels on Monday 6 
December under the Presidency of Mr. Jean-Maurice Dehousse, 
Minister of Scientific Policy and Scientific and Cultural 
Institutions of Belgium, will mostly be devoted to the 
definition and adoption of the Council's common position on the 
fourth framework programme for actions on research, 
technological development and demonstration for 1994-1998. This 
programme, which was already the subject of an initial 
ministerial discussion in October, has two dimensions which fall 
in the jurisdiction of the European Community (this part will be 
the subject of a Council-EP [European Parliament] joint 
decision) and EURATOM (to be approved by a unanimous decision of 
the Council, according to Article 7 of the EURATOM Treaty). 
  The political consensus (which should make possible the 
final 
adoption of the framework programme before the expiry of the 
current Parliament's mandate) is still faced with a series of 
fundamental differences concerning three points: the global 
amount of expenditure, the breakdown of funds between the 
various lines of action, the role of the Joint Research Centre 
(JRC). Discussions are looking tedious and will probably drag 
into the night. Below are more details regarding the three items. 
  (1) the overall amount of 13.1 billion ECUs proposed by the 
Commission is still considered too high by several delegations, 
including the United Kingdom's. On 18 November the EP proposed a 
600-million-ECU increase in order to include the THERMIE 
[European Technologies for Energy Control] programme. This would 
bring the overall amount to 13.7 billion. A compromise could be 
reached at the level initially proposed by the Commission, by 
"freezing" temporarily part of expenditure, to be released at a 
later phase of execution of the fourth framework programme. This 
procedure already demonstrated its usefulness on the occasion of 
the third framework programme (there was also considerable 
difficulty here concerning funding). 
  (2) the breakdown of funds between the various lines of 
action to be achieved through specific programmes. The EP would 
like to place particular importance on non-nuclear energies, 
socio-economic research, industrial technologies, ECSC [European 
Coal and Steel Community] research as well as on the promotion 
of international cooperation and the diffusion and 
optimalization of research results. Among the national 
delegations, there is a tendency in favour of work on the 
environment and life sciences and technologies, in parallel to a 
certain decline in the primordial interest reserved in the third 
programme on information technologies and communications. 
  (3) the role of the Joint Research Centre (JRC): the Council 
is expected to give its political agreement to the guidelines 
foreseeing that the JRC's institutional activities will be fully 
financed by the framework programme and that the JRC can 
participate in Community actions outside the programme (e.g. 
PHARE [Poland-Hungary--Actions for Economic Reconversion], TACIS 
[Technical Assistance Program for the CIS], etc.) by benefiting 
from Community financing linked with these actions in the 
framework of a competitive approach. Following on what is the 
case with national laboratories, the competitive part should 
enable the JRC to offer its expertise for the participation in 
actions to be implemented according to the "shared financing" 
formula. 
  The Presidency believes that a political agreement on these 
three key problems would enable the Council, as part of the 
joint decision-making procedure with the Parliament, to ratify 
the 1994-1998 framework programme before the EP is dissolved in 
spring and to ensure the continuity of the Community's research 
policy. Minor differences in view remain, however, on other 
points. 
  The Council should, moreover, have no major problems in 
adopting: 
  (a) protocol No 2 of the ITER [International Thermonuclear 
Experimental Reactor] Agreement on cooperation between EURATOM, 
Japan, the Federation of Russia and the United States with 
regard to activities having to do with the detailed project 
(EDA) of the experimental thermonuclear reactor; 
  (b) a Council resolution on the future of test reactors. 
This 
resolution would mark the Community's interest in safeguarding 
an adequate and performing potential of such reactors while 
underlining its concern for the situation of the fuel cycle. The 
Council will also underscore the importance that it attaches in 
health care to the medical applications of test reactors, 
especially for the production of radio-elements indispensable 
for the diagnosis and therapy of certain illnesses, in 
particular cancer.

<F P=106> ["Slightly abridged" speech delivered by Federal Minister of </F>
Research and Technology Dr. Paul Krueger in Itzehoe; date not 
given: "Our Chance Lies in Investing in Our Intelligence and 
Creativity"; first paragraph is MIKROELEKTRONIK introduction] 
  [Text] "Microelectronics is an indispensable key 
technology for major markets. The preservation and expansion of 
microelectronics research and production in Germany is thus 
particularly important, indeed an absolute necessity," stressed 
Research Minister Dr. Paul Krueger at the laying of the 
foundation stone for the Fraunhofer Institute of Silicon 
Technology (ISiT) in Itzehoe. All economic forecasts in the 
major industrialized regions placed information technology at 
the top of the market size and growth rate league over the next 
30 years, he continued. As a country with few raw material 
resources of its own, Germany could maintain its position as one 
of the leading industrialized countries only by virtue of 
advanced technological achievements. "Our chance lies in 
investing in our intelligence and creativity," said Dr. Krueger 
during his speech, which we print below in a slightly abridged 
form. 
<H5>  Our Chances Lie in Research-and-Technology-Led Innovation </H5>
  With the founding of the new Fraunhofer Institute, the 
Federal Government and the Land of Schleswig-Holstein have 
decided on an investment in one of the major areas that will 
safeguard the future of our country: The establishment of the 
new research institute is a contribution to the preservation of 
Germany's status as a center of microelectronics research and 
production. It is an important landmark in the midst of a 
difficult economic situation. 
  Many general economic factors have contributed to the 
economic slump that Germany has experienced in 1993, although 
this slump also reveals structural weaknesses in German economic 
competitiveness. The Federal Cabinet has adopted the Report on 
German Economic Competitiveness, which addresses this issue. 
Companies in Germany have reached the point where they can bear 
no further costs. The economic framework conditions -- and 
regulations in particular -- place them at an international 
disadvantage. Germany is also facing increasing competition 
from suppliers with more favorable cost structures and from 
high-tech supplies of better and better quality from Southeast 
Asia. We must grasp opportunities to improve these framework 
conditions -- such as rendering work schedules more flexible -- 
although our chances of achieving a profound change in our 
locational conditions are limited. As a country with few raw 
material resources of its own, Germany will therefore be able to 
maintain its position as a leading industrialized country only 
by virtue of advanced technological achievements. Our chance 
lies in investing in our intelligence and creativity. Our 
opportunities will come from research-and-technology-led 
innovation. 
<H3>  Preserving Germany's Status as a Center of Microelectronics 
Research and Production </H3>
  The preservation and expansion of microelectronics research 
and production in Germany is particularly important, indeed an 
absolute necessity. Microelectronics is an indispensable key 
technology for major markets. All economic forecasts in the 
major industrialized regions place information technology at the 
top of the market size and growth rate league over the next 30 
years. Although a semiconductor chip often accounts for only a 
few percent of the value of an overall system, it acts as a 
catalyst for development in many areas of technology. In 1990, 
electronic components worth 3.5 billion German marks [DM] 
influenced sales worth DM726 billion in the mechanical 
engineering, electrical engineering, precision mechanics, and 
office equipment/EDP [electronic data processing] sectors. 
  A few days ago, I presented the results of a comprehensive 
Delphi survey on science and technology development trends over 
the coming 30 years. Indeed the survey was carried out by a 
Fraunhofer institute on behalf of the BMFT [Federal Ministry of 
Research and Technology]. It points to dynamic growth prospects 
in microelectronics, although it also reveals that, in the view 
of the experts interviewed, Germany has fallen considerably 
behind Japan and the United States in research and development. 
<H5>  Ground Lost in Research Is a Cause for Concern </H5>
  Ground lost in research is a cause for concern, as it will 
lead to loss of ground in tomorrow's markets. Germany and 
Europe already present competitive weaknesses in 
microelectronics, as we know. German industry currently accounts 
for a mere six percent of the world market in information 
technology goods. Only two-fifths of Western Europe's 
semiconductor chip requirement can at present be produced in 
Europe. 
  However, Germany still has a good chance of acquiring a 
substantial share in the growth of the microelectronics market. 
To this end Germany's strengths -- such as the microsystems 
engineering sector -- should be built on. This in turn means 
that the state, science, and industry must maintain a dialogue 
on common goals and strategies to ensure that the new 
technologies will be developed and put jointly into practice. 
<H5>  ISiT Expands the Microelectronics Research Infrastructure </H5>
  By funding the ISiT, the Federal Research Ministry is 
expanding the public microelectronics research infrastructure. 
The new institute will take its place among the BMFT-funded Max 
Planck Society institutes, the major research facilities, the 
Fraunhofer institutes, and the Blue List establishments. The 
BMFT currently spends nearly 40 percent of its information 
technology budget on funding nonuniversity research facilities. 
Microelectronics research capacities in the new federal laender 
have already received a considerable boost in recent years with 
the founding of new Blue List institutes and seven Fraunhofer 
Society institutes or regional branches. One of the BMFT's 
purposes in funding research facilities is to enhance regional 
research capabilities. 
  As we all know, research does not take place in a vacuum. It 
thrives on a multiplicity of contacts and on the exchange of 
ideas. Links with the local environment are particularly strong, 
as many studies show. The ISiT will have a considerable impact 
on industry in Itzehoe and northern Germany and will, I am 
pleased to say, make a major contribution to growth in this area. 
<H3>  The German User Industry Needs Guaranteed Access to 
Microelectronics </H3>
  The new Fraunhofer Institute forms an integral part of the 
Federal Ministry of Research and Technology's information 
technology funding strategy. I am firmly convinced that the 
ISiT is a viable, pioneering concept. The institute will work 
at the interface between public research facilities and 
corporate research, focusing on technologies that integrate not 
just circuits but whole microsystems with various functions -- 
mechanical, electrical, optical, or chemical -- into silicon. 
  The user industry in Germany needs guaranteed, timely, and 
formality-free access to these microelectronic systems. The 
technical skills required to master the large number of 
difficult technical processes involved in producing these 
application-specific components ought to be preserved in 
Germany. The ISiT provides research capacity primarily for 
firms that cannot embark on long- term research of their own, 
nor wish to do so; primarily small and medium-sized enterprises, 
I imagine. I hope that industry will take up this offer and 
play an active role in shaping the institute's future program. 
<H5>  Great Opportunities for Regional Growth </H5>
  Once the investment phase, funded, in accordance with the 
successful Fraunhofer Society model, by the federal and land 
governments, has been concluded, the ISiT will earn its living 
on the contract research market. The institute's long-term 
future lies in the entrepreneurial responsibility of the 
Fraunhofer Society. The success of the ISiT will contribute to 
the development of a successful microelectronics research scene 
in Germany, which will enable Germany to claim its share in 
future markets. As a country with high labor costs, Germany can 
only safeguard its prosperity if it is at the forefront of 
international technical development. 
  The production of high-technology goods creates great 
opportunities for regional growth, which should be exploited. 
Achieving this goal requires a joint effort in all quarters. It 
is essential that targets and strategies be established on a 
joint basis. An unconventional example of how this can succeed 
has been achieved with the establishment of the ISiT.

<F P=106> [Article by Framboisette.Jassogne: "New Directions for </F>
Community Research"; Subheadline: "Without Awaiting Approval of 
Framework Program, Brussels Commission Set Priorities for Future 
Research Programs Financed by Europe. But Sensitive Issue 
Remains Regarding Aerospace Research Policy That Awaits Clear 
Answers"] 
  [Text] "We are not waiting for approval of the fourth 
research framework program by the Twelve to launch specific 
programs." That was how Antonio Ruberti, European commissioner 
responsible for research policy recently submitted a working 
document on what the future specific research programs should be 
and that will be, in principle, the concrete expression of the 
Community research framework program for 1994-1998. Antonio 
Ruberti does not conceal the fact that the main objective in 
submitting that working document is to speed up the legislative 
process of the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament 
to avoid momentary interruption of the financing of research 
projects in January 1995. That is why, anticipating the 
conclusion of the work of the Twelve and of the Euro-deputies, 
Antonio Ruberti further defined the content of the specific 
programs and sketched out the related budget lines (see box). 
<H5>  Many Unresolved Problems </H5>
  If, from a perspective of the impact of the announcement, 
Antonio Ruberti and his colleagues are scoring a point, in 
reality, all the problems presented some months ago have not 
been resolved. To be sure, the college of commissioners did 
somewhat lower the antagonisms among the various general 
directorates of the Commission. It clarified the respective 
purviews of the services that are parties in this issue. It did 
set up inter-service groups to coordinate approaches and avoid 
duplications. But it did nothing affecting the substance since 
it did not manage to give concrete expression to its idea of 
having horizontal research benefit the largest number while 
supporting well targeted industries, no matter what it says in 
this regard. 
  This applies especially to the aerospace sector that 
functions like a magnifying mirror for the contradictions of the 
member states and the European Commission. In fact, the top 
question that some in Brussels are posing is to know whether 
research projects can reasonably be conceived that can 
contribute to improving the competitiveness of railways, 
shipping and aviation simultaneously while the aerospace 
industry, for instance, needs to face its own technological 
challenges in order to be able to confront its chief rivals. 
  A top European official states: "You see, generic research 
has become a religion, whether with the Commission or the member 
states. So, horizontal research has to be done. But 
simultaneously, the member states are telling us to still 
coordinate specific actions for certain elements of European 
industry without giving the impression that the Community is 
supporting one sector more than another. The problem is that the 
mechanism enabling us to solve this contradiction still has to 
be invented." For an old veteran of the Brussels scene, there is 
no doubt: "Therefore, within the Commission as well as among the 
Twelve, everyone has to agree on what coordination means. By 
planning the work, precisely defining the objectives to be 
pursued, concurrently with the member states and their 
industries, over the short, medium and long term, whether for 
research on behalf of the aerospace, automobile or computer 
industry, then there are prospects of being able henceforth to 
solve this contradiction. All parties also have to know the 
precise level of the total credits allocated for research in 
those three sectors. On the other hand, if coordination means 
drawing up a list of projects, the odds are strong that we will 
have a heck of time in doing away with that ambiguity. And each 
industry or laboratory will continue to try to glean as much 
funding as possible." 
<H5>  Lowering Acoustic and Gaseous Emissions </H5>
  But it is not only on this underlying issue that the working 
document on specific programs has not contributed any answer. 
Others remain pending. For instance, those involving knowledge 
of what Community aerospace research covers in terms of funding 
allocated and specific activities to be performed. What is the 
underlying strategy? Put another way, in which direction is 
Community aerospace research headed? For example, is it going to 
end up as massive financial support for projects focusing on 
problems of management and control of air traffic to the 
detriment of projects aimed at lowering acoustic or gaseous 
emissions or improving propulsion technologies. 
  In its working document the Brussels Commission believes 
that 
the EEC should support ground/on-board communication, especially 
via the use of satellite links supplementing traditional 
resources like radar. The catch is that the real question has 
been skirted. Europeans are lagging quite a bit in this sector 
and they therefore have to opt for U.S. technology -- Global 
Positioning System [GPS]-Global Navigation Satellite System 
[GNSS] -- or for Russian Glonass know-how. But, neither the 
Commission's services nor their officials have found a common 
bond. 
<H5>  Air Traffic Management </H5>
  The General Directorate of Telecommunications and new 
technologies, the DGXIII, that controls all projects developing 
computerized communications in transportation and therefore 
those focused on air traffic management, swears only by the U.S. 
military system while the General Directorate of Transportation, 
the DGVII, the policy and reflection leadership in matters of 
transportation, is steadfastly inclined towards the Russian 
option. 
  By failing to clearly broach some issues, the European 
Commission is simply reflecting the pervasive coolness 
prevailing among the member states and their contradictions. It 
is unwilling to risk suffering a refusal. Hence its current low 
profile. And yet it has made some attempts. Last year, Jacques 
Delors, European Commission president, was prepared to supply 
more resources to research policy to enable the Europeans to 
stay in the technology race. The Twelve said "nyet" at Edinburgh 
in December 1992. Jacques Delors should press forward again with 
his White Book on the growth initiative. But the odds are heavy 
that the Twelve will send him back to his fond analyses. 
<H5>  [Boxed item] </H5>
<H3>  European Commission Proposals Capable of Benefiting The 
Aerospace Industry </H3>
  Computer and communications technologies: 

  -  Total budget: 3.888 billion European Currency Units [ECU] 
(One ECU=FF6.6). 
  -  The Commission proposes earmarking 24.5 percent of the total 
budget for computer communications with 40-52 percent of that 
24.5 percent set aside for computer communications in 
transportation, medical care and administration. 
  -  In the transportation sector, the Commission set two 
priorities: finalize a unified system using computer 
communications instruments to enhance the capability and promote 
use of satellite links to improve air/ground communication. 

    Industrial Technologies: 

  -  Total budget: ECU1.573 billion 
  -  The Commission is proposing that 34-39 percent of the total 
budget be earmarked for design, engineering, production systems, 
33-38 percent for related materials and technologies, 10-12 
percent for advanced propulsion technologies and 12-16 percent 
for standardization and testing. 
  -  In the aerospace sector, the Commission set two priorities: 
work on fluid dynamics and on lowering energy consumption in 
propulsion systems. 

    Environment: 

  -  Total budget: ECU625 million 
  -  The Commission is proposing to earmark 55-56 percent of the 
total budget to the natural environment, to quality of the 
environment, to global change, 20-30 percent to improvement of 
"own" technologies and 10-20 percent to enhancement of earth 
observation know-how. 
  -  In the space sector, the Commission drew up the following 
priorities: assistance for advanced technologies research in the 
sensors sector, EEC participation in the "Vegetation" space 
sensor that will be incorporated into the SPOT satellite system, 
EEC participation in development of AMAS atmospheric sensor, 
financial support for development of a European decentralized 
system for management and access to space data. 

    Transportation: 

  -  Total budget: ECU 280 million 
  -  The Commission is proposing to earmark 18-22 percent of the 
total budget for definition of a European multimodal system and 
78-82 percent to optimization of existing transportation 
systems. Of that 78-82 percent, air transportation should 
appropriate a not insignificant share for itself since it will 
get 16-18 percent of that budget. Ditto for railways, albeit 
somewhat less than the maritime and internal waterways 
navigation that will get 19-21 percent. 

    Third Country Cooperation 

  -  Total budget: ECU790 million 
  -  The Commission is proposing to earmark 47-54 percent of the 
total budget to scientific and technological cooperation in 
Europe with the lion's share (41-47 percent) set aside for 
research and development projects with the East European 
countries and the former republics of the Soviet Union [CIS], 
4.8-5.3 percent with non-European industrialized countries and 
41-47 percent with developing countries.

<F P=106> [Article: "German Industry Threatened with Collapse"] </F>
  [Text] Eleven thousand more jobs will have to be eliminated 
and nine more plants closed if Germany opts out of the 
Eurofighter program. 
  On 12 November the presidents of the Lander of Bavaria, 
Lower 
Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein, and Bade Wurtemberg met in Munich 
with Edzard Reuter, president of the Daimler Benz group, and 
Jurgen Schrempp, president of Deutsche Aerospace [DASA], to 
plead for abandonment or at least postponement of DASA's 
restructuring plan, which is designed to restore the company to 
financial health by 1995, in part by eliminating 16,000 jobs and 
closing six factories. After four hours of debate, the DASA 
executives convinced them that the plan, which will lower the 
group's overhead by 1.5 billion German marks [DM] per year, is 
unavoidable and represents the minimum downsizing needed to save 
the enterprise. 
  Edmund Schoiber (CSU), president of Bavaria, where the 
Neuaubing plant will have to be closed -- and who offered to 
reject the purchase of 8.58 percent of DASA stock held by the 
Land of Bavaria -- was told by the DASA executives that 
financing is not the problem: They have to resolve an overhead 
problem whose solution lies outside the political domain. 
  Gerhard Schroder (SPD), president of Lower Saxony, opined 
that state intervention is justified when necessary to save the 
jobs of highly skilled workers. He went so far as to propose 
taking over the Lemwerder plant from DASA. He is going to urge 
the SPD and the IG Metall syndicate to reconsider their 
opposition to the Eurofighter program. 
  Jurgen Schrempp said in essence that if the program is 
dropped he will have to eliminate 11,000 more jobs and close 
nine factories, perhaps as many as 14. He added that Germany is 
going to have to decide whether it wants an aerospace industry. 
Without subventions for research and exports comparable to those 
provided by the United States and Japan to their aerospace 
industries, the German industry will founder. Schrempp asked the 
Lander presidents to lobby the political parties to get Bonn to 
prepare and implement a comprehensive plan for the aerospace 
sector. 
  Gerhard Schroder promised to lobby for the disbursement of 
an 
additional DM300-400 million for civil aeronautics construction. 
  Theo Waigel, the federal finance minister, for his part 
promised to review German aerospace policy, and in particular to 
study how the industry could be given indirect assistance and 
how the reduction in space program appropriations might be 
suspended. 
  DASA employees are very militant, especially at the 
Lemwerder 
plant, which according to DASA executives is losing DM35 million 
per year. But Hans-Joachim Beckmann, spokesman for the plant 
council, said that closing it will cost DM168 million 
(transferral to Hamburg and Manching of plant equipment needed 
for the alteration of Transall and Airbus aircraft). Employees 
say DASA management may have decided to close the plant in the 
hope of obtaining state aid. But workers also seem to have 
realized that disorderly agitation of the kind seen in recent 
weeks does not advance their cause; henceforth, they say, they 
will act resolutely but with cooler heads.

<F P=106> [Interview with Claude Desama, president of the European </F>
Parliament commission on energy, research, and technology, by 
Framboisette Jassogne; place and date not given: "Desama Favors 
European Aeronautical Research"] 
  [Text] 
  [Jassogne] You are in the process of examining the European 
Commission proposal for the fourth Community research framework 
program. What is your objective? 
  [Desama] In the field of European research policy, the 
European Parliament plays a strategic role, as it does in 
budgetary affairs. The Parliament is more and more influential, 
thanks to the new codecision procedure established by the 
Maastricht Treaty. Thus our objective is to wield as much clout 
as we can on decisions, to exert real influence on the European 
Commission, and be able to apply either carrot or stick in our 
constant battles with the Council of Ministers. The carrot means 
optimizing our negotiating capacities; the stick means pounding 
our fist on the table when necessary and not being intimidated 
by confrontation. 
  [Jassogne] The European Commission proposes to earmark 
appropriations for generic technologies while reaffirming its 
commitment to support projects that target specific sectors such 
as aeronautics or the automotive industry. Isn't this 
inconsistent? 
  [Desama] No, because the menu of programs can be designed 
both to support generic technologies -- technologies that may 
have ramifications in multiple sectors -- and to stimulate 
specific sectors where industrial competitiveness basically 
depends on technological prowess. This is the case in the data 
processing industry, taken in the broadest sense. It's also true 
in the aeronautics industry, another area where technology is 
the name of the game. It's true in the space sector too, with 
respect to launchers. And increasingly in the automotive 
industry, which has to operate efficiently to compete against 
the Japanese, even though its technology may be more advanced. 
In addition, it will have to apply itself to the enormous 
environmental problems it is going to face. 
  [Jassogne] But on close inspection of the Commission 
document, one doesn't find these targeted pillars... 
  [Desama] It's true that the vertical axes are not very 
clearly identified. But the document is pitched at the level of 
a general framework for the research program. The place where 
you find that sort of emphasis is at the level of specific 
programs. I won't try to hide the fact, as we see it, that this 
type of emphasis can only be put into the research program to 
the extent that an industrial policy exists downstream. It 
serves no purpose to do research in critical areas if the effort 
is not supported by industrial policies: The Japanese and 
Americans will just pluck the fruits of our technology for their 
own benefit. For the moment, there is no industrial policy. 
After much contention, the idea was rejected at the Edinburgh 
Summit in December 1992. So we're just going to have to see what 
the Belgian presidency is going to do. I think it has the 
capacity to give impetus to the European growth initiative, to 
give a shot in the arm to the losers of the Edinburgh battle. If 
Belgium gives substance to this initiative and to the impulses 
in these sectors, I think it will be able to set in motion the 
beginnings of an eventual Community industrial policy. 
  [Jassogne] How much priority does the Parliament want 
research to have? 
  [Desama] Our objective is still to meet the goal set at the 
Milan Summit in 1985, i.e. 6 percent of the total Community 
budget: enough for research to be the third largest item in the 
Community budget, after agriculture and structural funds. We're 
currently spending between 4 and 4.5 percent. If we adopt the 
European Commission proposal for the fourth framework program, 
we will be able to maintain the present level of research. Even 
that may be difficult to achieve, due to current conditions and 
budgetary problems. 
  We support the Commission proposal. I sense that the member 
states, with perhaps one or two exceptions, are moving in the 
same direction. But there are some hesitations on the part of 
Germany and the United Kingdom. Even France is less than totally 
enthusiastic. Still, it may well be that the positions of France 
and the United Kingdom are only negotiating ploys. Germany is 
the more worrisome and more dismal case. In the past it was 
always the driving force. Today, the Germans are in a phase of 
retreat in this domain. This means the battle in the coming 
weeks is going to be tough. But the Parliament has one important 
weapon: co-decision. Because of it, the decision can't be made 
without us and against us. And I don't think any of the member 
states is going to decide to eviscerate the fourth framework 
program, since their own laboratories and industries also depend 
on it. At any rate, if all goes well we should be able under the 
Belgian presidency to reach political agreement on the fourth 
framework program. 
  [Jassogne] What about research in aeronautics? 
  [Desama] It's not out of the question that a line of 
"aeronautical research" might emerge. Of course, it will not 
appear as such in the framework program, but in the form of a 
specific program -- why not? Under the rubric of "industrial 
technologies," for example. I'm all in favor, so long as it's 
paired with the beginnings of an industrial policy. Otherwise 
it's just casting pearls before swine.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean de Galard: "1994 Defense Budget </F>
Examined"--first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE 
INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] The budget bill just approved by the National 
Assembly provides among other things for the 1994 delivery of 12 
Mirage 2000 D and 10 Mirage F1CT. But only three Mirage 2000 DA 
will be delivered, instead of the six planned. 
  Following two tame and unmemorable debates, the National 
Assembly on 10 November 1993 passed the 1994 defense budget 
presented and defended by Defense Minster Francois Leotard. The 
Socialist and Communist deputies voted against. As will be 
recalled, the military equipment budget authorized new spending 
of 94.9 billion French francs [Fr], 7.8 percent less than the 
initial 1993 budget, but with the addition of Fr5.5 billion 
carried forward into 1994 and transfers amounting to Fr2.6 
billion, the grand total comes to Fr103 billion. This is shown 
in the attached table [see below] extracted from the report 
presented on behalf of the Finance Commission by UDF [French 
Democratic Union] deputy Arthur Paecht, one of its members. 
  At Fr103 billion, it amounts to a 5.7 percent increase over 
the appropriations actually made available in 1993, taking into 
account the cancellation of some credits during the year (9 
billion) and the carryforward of others into 1993 (3.5 billion). 
The rapporteur made two important observations about the defense 
package: 


    -  The Fr103 billion includes nonrenewable appropriations. 
As a result, there may be some risk that the budgetary reference 
point used for programming purposes will still be only Fr94.9 
billion; 
  -  Comparisons between 1994 and 1993 are virtually impossible, 
owing to uncertainties affecting the two budgets: on the one 
hand, carryforwards, cancellations, and external operations in 
1993; on the other, carryforwards, transfers, and external 
operations in 1994 -- and all with the assumption there will be 
no freezes or canceled appropriations during this fiscal 
year. 

    A category-by-category analysis of this budget leads to the 
following observations: 
  Space: At Fr4,147 million, the appropriation for space 
programs (budget + carryforwards) is up 13.8 percent, with the 
increase inuring mainly to the benefit of the Helios optical 
reconnaissance and observation satellite, the first of which is 
scheduled for launch in 1994. In addition, the Syracuse II 
(telecommunications satellite) program will benefit from the 
decision to launch a fourth satellite. Research on radar 
(Osiris) and electromagnetic (Zenon) observation satellites will 
continue. 
  Nuclear: The total Fr22.9 billion in appropriations 
requested 
for the nuclear deterrent force (research, development, and 
fabrication) represents an 8.8 percent reduction, due to 
completion of the Mirage 2000N program and the stretching-out of 
the M5 ballistic missile program. The [new-generation] 
nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine program (SNLE NG) 
will continue as before. The "Triomphant" is expected to enter 
into service in 1996, the "Temeraire" in 1998, and the 
"Vigilant" in 2001. 
  The segment of the minister's speech devoted to resumption 
of 
nuclear testing raised a number of eyebrows. We will quote from 
it at length: 
  "...As for resumption of testing, the question is not 
whether 
we must do so but when: This will be determined solely in terms 
of the need to protect our vital interests and our independence. 
Thus it is not the moratorium which is at issue, but rather its 
perpetuity... Many speakers have called for resumption of 
testing in order to acquire simulation capability. The necessity 
of this, for France and for other countries as well, is 
incontestable." 
  Air Force: It can expect an overall equipment budget of 
Fr24.3 billion (up 3.7 percent). The Rafale Air Force program is 
being stretched out by six months (the consequences of this 
delay are analyzed on page 10 of this issue). 
  As planned, 12 Mirage 2000 D and 10 Mirage F1CT will be 
delivered in 1994. However, only three Mirage 2000 DA will be 
delivered rather than the six planned. 
  The SCCOA (System for Command and Control of Air Operations) 
program will be stretched out by several months. The program to 
purchase Tucano training aircraft from Brazil is scaled back 
slightly (18 aircraft instead of the 20 planned). 
  The other programs, including the Mirage 2000-5, will 
proceed 
as previously scheduled. 
  Army: Its equipment budget comes to Fr23.9 billion (up six 
percent). A total of 44 Leclerc tanks will be ordered instead of 
the 66 planned, and (as planned) 34 of them are scheduled for 
delivery. 
  The other programs (light armored vehicle, Eryx and 
long-range AC3G antitank missiles, multiple rocket-launchers) 
are retained. The "Tigre" and NH-90 helicopter programs will 
proceed as scheduled. 
  Navy: Its equipment appropriations -- Fr24.5 billion -- are 
up 4.4 percent over the total available in 1993. The 
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier was delayed six months in 1993 
as a result of canceled appropriations. It is now scheduled to 
go into service in mid-1999. The Rafale Navy program is also 
pushed back six months. The state will order only two Rafale 
Navy aircraft in 1994 instead of the four planned. Five 
Atlantique 2 aircraft will be delivered in 1994. 
  Other programs will proceed as previously scheduled, 
including the NH-90 transport helicopter, a cooperative venture 
between the Army and three European partner countries (Germany, 
Netherlands, Italy). The special rapporteur expressed the hope 
that the total cost of this program, still in the development 
phase, can be determined very precisely along with its financing 
modalities. 
  Gendarmerie: Its budget is Fr2.2 billion.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Telecommunications: Mannesmann Keeps </F>
Up the Offensive"; as released by Brussels Euroscope EIS 
Database] 
  [Text] The Mannesmann Group is keeping up its attack on 
the German telecommunications market, already fully liberalised 
ahead of the 1998 European deadline for opening up voice 
telephony markets. Having already won the licence to run a 
private cellular phone network in Germany, which went commercial 
in June 1992, Mannesmann has just announced a strategic alliance 
in the company telecommunications field with number one German 
bank the Deutsche Bank, and RWE [Rheinisch-Westfaelisches 
Elektrizitaetswerk], the leading German energy producer. 
  Having posted net losses of 467 million German marks for the 
first half of 1993, brought on by disastrous results in all 
sectors, Mannesmann has everything to gain by strengthening its 
activities in "a new market with growth prospects". In August, 
the German giant's D2 mobile phone network already boasted 
300,000 users, and could pass break-even point next year if it 
reaches a total of 400,000 subscribers. 
  A joint company, to be held 50&percnt; by Mannesmann, with 
Deutsche 
Bank and RWE Energie each taking a 25&percnt; stake, is likely 
to be 
set up early in January 1994 to tap the market for private 
company telecommunications networks. The new venture will 
establish a system for the German and the wider European market, 
comprising voice telephony, and image and date transmission, 
within a closed network of subscribers. This kind of service 
would allow, for example, figures to be automatically read off 
calculators, electronic mail and also financial data to be sent. 
Germany's deregulated market, likely to represent a turnover 
running into billions of German marks, is only awaiting approval 
from the European Commission's competition authorities before it 
takes off in 1994. 
  Mannesmann has already announced its intention to apply, 
through subsidiary Mannesmann Eurokom GmbH, for Germany's first 
licence for data transmission for mobile radio-telephones. 
Licenses will be required until full deregulation in 1998, and 
the group is expected to ally itself with powerful and 
experienced partners to corner this particular market. The 
consortium will again include Deutsche Bank and the 
communication network experts from RWE Energie, but also energy 
firm Schwaben AG [Aktiengesellschaft], the Swedish data 
radio-telephony experts Telia International, and the French 
diversified utility company Generale des Eaux. Potential 
customers in this huge market are not only the obviously mobile 
transport firms, bus and taxi operators, and security and 
surveillance services, but also banks and commercial enterprises 
of all kinds.

<F P=106> [Article by F.J.: "Thomson Merging Alsys and IGL Technology"] </F>
  [Text] Since the acquisition two years ago of Alsys, one of 
the leaders in the Ada language field, there were expectations 
that Thomson-CSF would put in order its organizational chart for 
software activities. The first move has been made with the 
announcement of a merger between Alsys (French branch) and IGL 
Technology; the latter is a Syseca affiliate dedicated to 
software (product sales and consulting) and a long-time 
exclusive distributor of IDE tools (including the famous STP, 
Software Through Pictures), as well as being now involved in 
marketing Centerline and McCabe products. 
  The industrial group has made numerous software acquisitions 
in the past four years or so. In 1989, it started off in style 
with Atherton (and its Software Backplane structure), definitely 
purchased in the spring of 1991. In September of the same year, 
Alsys became part of the group, organizationally linked to 
Syseca, but it was clear that as a result of its international 
status, the Ada specialist would quickly become the group's 
spearhead in the marketing of software products outside France. 
This was confirmed the following year with the merger of Alsys 
and Telesoft, ranked third on the Ada market. Today, Alsys has 
an annual turnover of 227 million francs. This result is 
comparable, on the software market, to those achieved by CGI 
with Pacbase.

<F P=106> [Unsigned article: "Cisi and Soleri-Cigel Form a </F>
GIE"] 
  [Text] In response to the facilities management promise of 
the AS/400, Cisi and Soleri-Cigel have decided to form an equal 
share association within a GIE (Economic Interest Group). The 
French market, currently worth 260 MFF, is expected to double in 
the next three years. The distinguishing characteristic of FM 
AS/400 is the global nature of the demand (operation, 
maintenance and development, integration of software programs); 
hence the need for pooling know-how. Cisi will contribute its 
operational skills to the GIE. Boasting a turnover of 260 MFF in 
Facilities Management (out of a total of 1.52 billion FF), the 
SSII, which is also working with Bull on large systems 
facilities management, had decided to tackle the opportunities 
of the FM AS/400 market two years ago. It already has a few 
contracts to its credit (Bayard Presse, Cholet...). 
Soleri-Cigel, one of the foremost French AS/400 agents, can for 
its part claim expertise in development and integration of 
software programs specific to IBM minicomputers. Its sales from 
these products go as high as 120 MFF, out of a total turnover 
figure of 355 MFF.

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "Messier-Bugatti and SEP to Do </F>
Brakes Together"; Subheadline: "Merger of French Carbon-Carbon 
Disk and Brake Manufacturers May Result in 1994 in Joint Entity 
Capable Eventually of Generating Nearly FF1 Billion in Activity"] 
  [Text] Possibly, in a few months, the merger of 
Messier-Bugatti and European Propulsion Corporation [SEP], both 
subsidiaries of the French engine manufacturing group SNECMA, 
will become a definite reality in brakes for aerospace. 
  Last week, in fact, Jean Sollier, SEP's CEO, confirmed "the 
perfect agreement" prevailing on this issue with Gerard Renon, 
SNECMA's CEO. He, in turn, had recently stated that it was a 
"natural" idea to merge the brake (Messier-Bugatti) and brake 
disks (SEP) manufacturers. 
  It also "makes sense" to Jean Sollier "to ally the aircraft 
brakes manufacturer and the supplier of carbon-carbon disks." 
According to him, such activities presently account for nearly 
FF700 million at Messier-Bugatti (that controls between one 
quarter and one fifth of the carbon brakes market in aerospace) 
and for about FF170 million at SEP for aircraft and automobile 
brake disks. 
  Still, nothing has yet been done for this regrouping. As 
SEP's president says: "The industrial project still needs to be 
built, the formula for association spelled out, participations 
regulated, etc." He emphasized that "if the merger is to occur, 
it will obviously be in 1994!" 
  For, as he puts it: "This merger will allow the new team to 
win market shares. The prospects are good." And over a few years 
the activity could engender more than FF1 billion in turnover, 
considering that the two teams already are well established in 
civilian and military aircraft brakes, with the Airbus and the 
Mirage 2000. 
  It is Jean Sollier's view that the joint team could also 
launch into brakes for trucks and the railway. SEP has already 
made a stab in this direction, for example, with Formula-1 
carbon brake disks and those for top-of-the-line cars (Venturi 
and Bugatti) and trials on high-speed trains. But real 
development would come from equipping trucks, busses and rail 
coaches, and even future generations of the Very High-Speed 
Train [TGV]. 
  But if the merger of brake and disk activities between 
Messier-Bugatti and SEP is successful (in several months), Jean 
Sollier will already have won the wager made in 1990 to 
diversify SEP's consolidated activity upwards of FF1 billion in 
1995. It represents a gambit that already saw the opening move 
made last year with the buy-back from GEC-Alsthom of its (50 
percent) share in Carbone Industrie that will realize a turnover 
of more than FF230 million in 1993.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Electronics: Bull To Invest Heavily </F>
in `Facilities Management'"; as released by Brussels Euroscope 
EIS Database] 
  [Text] The troubled French public electronics group, Bull, 
which is shortly to receive 8.6 billion FF [French francs] in 
fresh funding from the State, is ready to invest a "significant" 
amount in computer services, including the creation of a 
European company consolidating its interests in management of 
business computer systems, known as "facilities management". 
Bull will have a 51&percnt; stake in this European company, 
known as 
Athesa International and headed by the former Director of 
EDS-GFI [the French subsidiary of the world's top software 
house], Jacques Tordjman, while the other 49&percnt; will be 
distributed among three as yet unnamed other French companies. 
  Discussions with potential partners should be completed 
before the end of January, according to Mr Tordjman, who added 
that the ideal combination would be two manufacturing firms and 
one bank. While declining to specify the amount of initial 
capital this holding company would possess, he indicated that it 
would be "significant" enough to allow the purchase of business 
computer systems. 
  Athesa International will begin operating in 1994, with a 
total turnover of about 1.2 billion FF, and will take over 
Bull's internal computer concerns (which employ over 300 persons 
and alone represents a contract of from 500 million to one 
billion French franc, according to Mr Tordjman. Athesa will also 
absorb the 400 million FF initial turnover of its only 
subsidiary, Athesa France, which is held in equal parts by Bull 
and Cisi [International Company for Data Processing Services] 
and is responsible for managing CEA's [Atomic Energy Agency] 
computer systems. 
  Other subsidiaries are expected to be established in other 
European countries, probably starting in England, where 
facilities management is the most highly developed. Bull will 
seek to create companies jointly with local partners. 
  Mr Tordjman also announced that Athesa would create a New 
Technologies Institute to retrain computer operations staff 
taken on by Athesa with the acquisition of a client's business 
computer systems. Such transfers are often perceived as threats 
by the employees concerned.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Nuovo Pignone Talks Focus on Italian </F>
Majority"] 
  [Text] Rome, 28 Dec (ANSA) -- Local representatives headed 
by Florence Mayor Giorgio Morales came away from today's 
Industry Ministry summit on the U.S. buy-out of Florentine 
turbine-maker Nuovo Pignone with a pledge that the government 
will ask the publicly-owned fuels group ENI [National 
Hydrocarbons Agency] for greater assurances over a majority of 
its former subsidiary's stock staying in Italian hands. 
  Morales told reporters after the meeting that the government 
"agreed with us" that greater assurances should be offered 
concerning the 10.75 percent of Nuovo Pignone stock that will be 
sold on the stock market via a public purchase offer (ppa). 
  He said he expected these assurances to be forthcoming at a 
further meeting at the premier's office on Thursday between the 
government and trade unions. 
  In the partial privatisation deal agreed last week, General 
Electric heads two other U.S. companies -- Ingersoll Rand and 
Dresser -- taking over 49 percent of the Florence firm; ENI 
maintains 20.25 percent, and a consortium of Italian banks are 
parcelling out a further 20 percent, leaving 10.75 percent for 
the ppa. 
  The continued presence of the Italian banks was the other 
point on which Morales said local bodies and the firm still want 
assurance -- despite Industry Minister Paolo Savona and Treasury 
Minister Piero Barucci's optimism that "the banks may stay even 
longer" than the four-year duration of the business plan GE has 
lined up, since the plan is "so strong". 
  Morales said he spoke for Nuovo Pignone's management and 
workers in asking for "written guarantees" that the banks' 20 
percent will not leave the country at some future stage. 
  He also revealed that an article in the ENI-GE accord 
envisages five percent of Nuovo Pignone stock being offered to 
the company's employees, in the wake of the coming ppa. 
  As for the merits of the business plan itself, Morales 
restricted himself to reporting that "the government and ENI 
believe that this plan will ensure company growth, employment 
and technological research". 
  Official sources at the premier's office later denied 
Morales' assertion that government-union talks on Nuovo Pignone 
will take place on Thursday at the premier's office. 
  The unions -- who seemed certain that the encounter had on 
the other hand been set -- meanwhile echoed Morales in calling 
for changes to the ENI-GE accord to ensure an Italian majority 
emerges after the ppa, and to ward off "the possibility of 
direct competitors like Dresser and Ingersoll beefing up their 
share in four years' time, when the Italian banks may leave the 
field." 
  The Tuscan regional commissioner for labour, Enno 
Ghiandelli, 
revealed this evening that Industry Minister Paolo Savona had 
issued invitations for the Thursday meeting, which will again be 
held at the industry ministry in Rome and not at the premier's 
office.

<F P=106> [Article by Vera Viola: "Companies: Goodbye Research. </F>
Funds Remain Unused"] 
  [Text] Crisis reigns in applied research laboratories. 
The difficult economic situation has forced companies to cut 
back on expenditure and revise investment plans. Likewise R&amp;D 
programs: Applications for funding submitted to the IMI [Italian 
Institute for Financing Real and Personal Property] (pursuant to 
Law No. 46 of 1982) over the past 10 months have almost halved 
compared to 1992. That is not all: Around 30 firms have even 
withdrawn projects submitted some time ago, and which were 
finally approaching their funding goal. 
  Research therefore is undergoing a crisis. Although the last 
budget law provided for an allocation of 150 billion lire for 
1994, 250 billion for 1995, and 300 billion for 1996, to 
supplement the IMI fund which had not received any contributions 
since 1988, companies are now tightening their belts. The 393 
requests for funding totaling 2.6 trillion lire submitted in 
1992, have dropped to only 203 projects for a total of 1.25 
trillion in 1993 (October figures). The drop mostly involves 
independent programs, those performed by large and State-owned 
corporations: 194 in 1992 and 77 in 1993. Even the EUREKA 
[European Research Coordination Agency] internation research 
projects have fallen from 34 to 15. 
  "I believe this decline to be a natural consequence of the 
present economic situation," remarked Giuseppe Colona, head of 
the applied research division at IMI, "and I do not think it is 
a result of lack of resources or other basic problems. For over 
a year now, after the sudden rise in interest rates in 1992, 
firms have had to tackle serious financial problems and 
therefore revise all investment plans." He added: "An analysis 
of the projects presented over the past year has also shown that 
the amount requested for each one has risen slightly. This 
means that preference is being given to more useful research 
rather than marginal topics." 
  Therefore, which experiments which have been abandoned and 
which are being continued? "It would be highly risky for firms 
to abandon research that is closely linked to production needs, 
since this could automatically exclude them from the market," 
explained Gianni Cozzi, industrial innovation research director 
at IEFE-Bocconi. "I feel that the cutbacks refer to 
nonstrategic research. I also believe that the drop in funding 
applications is related to privatization of some State-owned 
firms which made large use of the rotating fund in the past." 
  If the current economic situation is indicated as being the 
main cause for abandoning research, responsibility should also 
be shared with the lengthy funding mechanism. On average, a 
funding application takes three years to be fully approved by 
the IMI and the Ministry of Research as required by law. This 
is sufficient for an innovative project to become dated. 
  "Firms are losing interest in funding granted by the IMI," 
said Roberto Ciarlone, in charge of industrial policy at 
Confindustria [Italian Manufacturers' Federation], "slow 
procedures and the lack of resources which have plagued the fund 
for years are no incentive. This is in addition to the fact that 
entrepreneurs are required to provide substantial financial 
guarantees, albeit not a legal requirement, and impossible for 
small firms." 
  In the meantime, urged by Confindustria, the IMI, and 
universities, the Ministry for Scientific Research has 
reexamined the old project to amend Law No. 46. "We have 
planned a long series of amendments," explained Scientific 
Research Minister Umberto Colombo, "to streamline the law and 
toughen up the controls it contents. We will allocate funding 
after only eight months' reviewal, but we want the research 
funded to be truly applicable to production and markets." 
  The first amendments, aimed at speeding up procedures, have 
been adopted through a circular from the ministry that is now 
awaiting the go-ahead from CIPE [Interdepartmental Committee for 
Economic Planning]. However, a bill has already been prepared 
for a more extensive reform: systems for monitoring and 
controlling the work of the companies financed, regulation of 
the government's rights over national research programs, and 
procedures adapted to small production units.

<F P=106> [Article by Virginie Robert: "Who Will Buy Bull?"; first </F>
paragraph is 01 INFORMATIQUE introduction] 
  [Text] The state is giving Bull capital of 11 billion 
French francs [Fr] and a new head, Jean-Marie Descarpentries. 
His mission: to turn Bull into a profitmaking company like any 
other and, in the long term, to privatize it. 
  A carte blanche, an Fr11 billion stash, and the job of 
readying Bull for privatization are the means and mission 
industry minister Gerard Longuet has assigned to Jean-Marie 
Descarpentries, Bernard Pache's successor as the head of Bull. 
Despite the high financial stakes (Fr7 billion from the state, 
Fr1.6 billion from France Telecom, and Fr2.5 billion from a loan 
granted early this year), neither the entrepreneur nor the 
politician has unveiled a strategic plan. They have also failed 
to sketch out a profile of Bull's indispensible partner. 
  Despite the new CEO's reluctance to present a plan of 
action, 
Jean-Pierre Muller, president of Bull's user club Cube, thinks 
"things are starting to pick up speed." Muller is happy with the 
inverted pyramid model cited by Jean-Marie Descarpentries, 
because "it puts the customer first." The challenge now is to 
preserve a customer base attractive enough to lure potential 
investors into participating in a private-sector-handled 
(not-yet-scheduled) privatization. The most palpable hypothesis, 
given the reticence of IBM, is that a big Japanese group 
prepared to invest in a beachhead in Europe will come forward. 
NEC, a top international company with long-standing ties to 
Bull, seems the most likely rescuer. In addition, the Japanese 
manufacturer needs to expand its geographical territory in 
personal computing, notably in the United States. 
  Before it can be freed from state tutelage, Bull must post 
profits again. To make the manufacturer "a profitable company 
like any other, responsible to its market," Jean-Marie 
Descarpentries must act quickly, persuade NEC and IBM to inject 
fresh capital, and attract new customers and partners while 
cutting costs. What price will the manufacturer pay for a return 
to profits, once its debts of Fr9.5 billion are cleared? 
Claiming that he does not want to touch "Bull's core", 
Jean-Marie Descarpentries has left the question of the 
manufacturer's future scope totally up in the air. The new CEO 
has enumerated five business the group must preserve: company 
servers, personal computing, open architectures, systems 
integration, and all customer services. Jean-Marie 
Descarpentries envisions a structural change for Bull, to make 
it "a clearly-organized, lean, decentralized company, in which 
decisionmakers will have the authority they need." He wants to 
move quickly to implement the company's thinking about a 
specialized business-based and not geographically-based 
organization. On the other hand, Descarpentries has not a word 
to say about Bull's manufacturing base, which in France now 
consists entirely of the Angers factory. He is just as silent 
about the United States, where Bull has lost a pile of money in 
the past. For the immediate term, the debate centers around the 
future of Zenith Data Systems and of Bull's service strategy. 
ZDS, which Bull acquired for 500 million dollars in 1989, 
remains the manufacturer's greatest lossmaker. Following a 
restructuring of its industrial base and a partnership agreement 
with Packard-Bell, ZDS CEO Jacques Noels says "We will have a 
good idea of the impact of the steps taken" by mid-1994. As for 
services, Bull, which has still not scored any major successes 
in France, got into FM late and has had no luck persuading 
France Telecom to team up with it. Yet the idea of an FM 
partnership between the two is making headway in the Ministry of 
Industry, where officials are working on [finding] areas, 
particularly in services and multimedia, where the two French 
technology hubs overlap. 
<H5>  Boxed Material: Luc Fayard's Opinion </H5>
  Here the state goes again, toying with its favorite 
plaything, Bull. While grousing about "the last time", the 
government is kicking another almost Fr9 billion into the pot. 
It is presenting a new CEO with no strategy as the nth archangel 
of a miraculous rescue mission, and inventing a new sort of 
"good riddance" privatization. This has been going on for 20 
years. What a mess -- and what a shame! For the French firm has 
many assets it could use to pull through, provided it was given 
the means to follow its head. It is time to decide. Should Bull 
shift its focus back to high-added-value technical products such 
as its Unix (with IBM) and GCOS (with NEC) systems, even if that 
means selling off its personal computer business (Zenith Data 
Systems)? Or should it expand into services and systems 
integration? Whether alone or with a partner, Bull must finally 
be allowed to act. 
<H5>  Boxed Material: A Commando Fighter </H5>
  First came the era of technician or strategist bosses, then 
the reign of manufacturer Bernard Pache. Now a commando fighter 
has taken over the helm at Bull. Jean-Marie Descarpentries has 
built up his image as a "come-hell-or-high-water" type through 
takeovers and mergers (Carnaud-Metal Box), but also as a result 
of his views on what motivates people. 
  The 56-year-old polytechnical school graduate, who also has 
a 
Harvard degree, has thought out and refined those ideas while 
working for Shell, McKinsey, Belgium's Glaverbel, and -- until 
recently -- the logistics and transport group Novalliance. While 
working as the director of Carnaud-Metal Box (CMB), he adopted 
the Swedish manager Jan Carlzon's ideas on the "inverted 
pyramid", which makes the customer the basis for company 
decisions. 
<H5>  Bull's Assets </H5>
  -- Its installed customer base and distribution channels. 
  -- Close long-standing ties with Japan's NEC, which supplies 
Bull with its GCOS 8 big systems line. NEC's investment in CMB 
in 1992 enabled Bull to reorganize its businesses in the United 
States. 
  -- Its alliance with Cisi in FM, which offsets Bull's late 
start in that niche. 
  -- DCM, its architecture for non-homogenous environments. 
  -- The international service contracts it has won, notably 
in 
the United Kingdom, Poland, and the United States. 
  -- The efforts Bull has made since 1991 to cut structural 
costs, which have resulted in staff reductions and a 
reorganization of its industrial base. 
  -- The PC agreement with Packard-Bell, which opens the doors 
to large-scale distribution for ZDS in the United States, and 
gives it the critical mass to buy components. 
  -- A RISC line that will be relayed by the PowerPC, the 
future generation of microprocessors. 
  -- Recent successes in the United States (including the 
Desktop IV contract and a $62-million contract recently 
concluded with the American federal government to reengineer big 
system applications). 
<H5>  Boxed Material: Bull's Handicaps </H5>
  -- State tutelage, which has slowed decisionmaking. This was 
especially true when NEC acquired a capital stake in Bull or 
during RISC negotiations with IBM and HP. The discussions 
between Bernard Pache and the government over the last few 
months heightened the wait-and-see attitude of customers. 
  -- Internal fiefdoms, watered-down decisionmaking within the 
company, and a lack of money, particularly among sales forces, 
for implementing strategies. -A deplorable financial structure, 
aggravated by heavy interest expenses on a Fr9.5 billion debt 
(reduced in 1992). Losses over the last three years of nearly 
Fr15 billion, and sales that have declined for the last two 
years. 
  -- A Unix strategy that depends on IBM's. The French 
manufacturer has still not come out with any 
multiprocessor-based computers. 
  -- A tardy and unsuccessful foray into personal computing, 
which led to the costly acquisition of ZDS. Bull's integration 
of the American PC manufacturer, which it undertook at the same 
time as an overhaul of its distribution channels, was 
time-consuming and caused significant development delays.

<F P=106> [Article by Hafid Mahmoudi: "Transpac Tailors Offerings To </F>
Compete on European Market"] 
  [Text] Confined to a small band in the spectrum of France 
Telecom comunications offerings, being pressured to accommodate 
higher data flow-rates, and taking hits from the competition, 
Transpac is abandoning its X.25 label and plunging into the 
market: a strategy that means changes in pricing, products, and 
contracts. 
  "The upcoming reduction in tariffs that goes into effect on 
1 
January 1994 is the biggest since 1987," says Charles de 
Cognets, head of central marketing and communication for 
Transpac. Overall, the telecommunications operator is announcing 
a reduction that is equivalent to seven percent in constant 
[French] francs [Fr]. But that's not the only news from 
Transpac. The menu of services offered is also in for major 
changes. And client-tailored contracts are gaining ground over 
services to the general public -- a change that reflects 
Transpac's eagerness to shed the X.25 label still clinging to 
its offerings with a view to becoming the leading supplier of 
European data-sharing networks. 
<H5>  Tariffs Reduced </H5>
  Good news for Transpac customers: Bills will go down next 
year. According to the firm, tariffs will decline 4.84 percent. 
The figure is an average that takes into account discounts on 
service charges, rate per kilobyte, and cost per minute for use 
of virtual circuits. Monthly service charges at speeds from 
4,800 bits per second [bps] to 256 kilobits per second [kbps] 
are all revised downward from 1993. High transfer rates of 384 
to 1,920 kilobits per second [Kbps] will make their debut in the 
tariff charts. This palette of options and high-speed data 
transfer rates is modeled on the one employed by the Transfix 
service. By the way, the overall rate reduction cannot fail to 
have a direct effect on the rates Transfix charges. But Transpac 
is going a step further than its elder sibling, lowering rates 
for 9,600-bps leased lines at a time when Transfix's tariff for 
the same grade of service is unchanged. The discount is all the 
more impressive when one considers that 9,600-bps service, along 
with 19.2 Kbps, accounts for most of the direct accesses to 
Transpac. 
  On the other hand, users who must access Transpac indirectly 
will get less benefit from the declining service charges. The 
cost per minute on-line via RTC [public switched telephone 
network] is unchanged. Telex access costs are going up slightly, 
though the rate for Numeris (channel B) is falling. 
  Another descending indicator is unit price per kilobyte, 
which is dropping from 5.7 to 5.4 centimes. Per-minute on-line 
rates are also going down. This reduction is being implemented 
by simplifying the rate structure from six categories to three. 
Setting the 2,400-bps CVC (Switched Virtual Circuit) service 
rate equal to that charged for low-capacity links (300 and 1,200 
bps) is not going to increase the profitability of the former. 
At the next higher level, the cost of CVC service at 19.2 kbps 
is being aligned with the reduced rate for 4,800 and 9,600-bps 
service. 
  Finally, the cost of the highest-speed service (48 Kbps) is 
unchanged. The realignment is most advantageous for CVFs 
(Dedicated Virtual Circuits), with an 11 percent rate reduction. 
Users of interactive applications will benefit from this change, 
though it is offset by an augmentation in the price of CVPs 
(permanent virtual circuits) between two direct access points. 
  Transpac is also introducing new services, including 
synchronous direct access at 14.4 kbps. In a bid for greater 
market share, it is adding LVUs (single virtual lines) to its 
catalogue of offerings. These are 9,600 bps to 1,920 Kbps 
virtual circuits linking two sites, with billing based on volume 
calculated in either of two methods. 
<H5>  Channel D </H5>
  Under the first method, unit rate declines as total volume 
rises. As monthly consumption increases from Fr1,000 to 
Fr24,000, the rate per kilobyte decreases in six steps from 20 
to 65 percent. Moreover, if the two linked sites are in the same 
interchange zone, price per kilobyte is cut another 50 percent. 
Better still, the off-peak hours discount is also applied to the 
volume of data transferred over LVUs. 
  Under the second, increasingly large monthly consumption 
ceilings are attached to each LVU based on the data transfer 
rate. There is no added charge for traffic above these ceilings. 
According to Charles de Cognets, "LVUs give our clients the 
security of stable, predictable outlays." All this has to be 
seen as a response to the aggressive rate structure of Transfix, 
which today is Transpac's only real competitor. In practical 
terms, LVU is designed for high-volume applications such as 
provision of [wide area network or WAN] connectivity between 
separate data processing sites or local area networks [LANs]. 
Another advantage: LVU starts with a 9,600-bps transfer rate 
that amply meets the needs for this type of application but also 
offers a range of speeds as high as two megabits per second 
[Mbps]. In addition, the former LVR (rapid virtual link) 
service, which catered only to the demand for medium and high 
flow rates -- without much success, it must be conceded -- is 
being removed from the services catalogue. Regarding WAN 
link-ups, we will conclude by noting that henceforth an IP 
[Internet Protocol] hook-up on Ethernet will be incorporated 
into the rate. The SNA [Systems Network Architecture] option 
will follow later. 
  In a similar vein, Transpac plans to discontinue its 300-bps 
asynchronous service as of 31 December 1994. The firm also plans 
gradually to increase cost of service at the next higher rung. 
Thus connections at 1,200 and 2,400 bps will cost more starting 
next year. In this way the operator hopes to encourage 
low-volume users to migrate toward Numeris's "Channel D" service. 
  One might legitimately ask whether this decision does not 
signal an unaknowledged intent to move away from all analog 
media and focus exclusively on digital. Reinforcing this 
perception, Transpac is lowering the monthly connection charge 
for Channel D from Fr400 to Fr380. At the same time, the price 
per kilobyte is inching down from 6 to 5.4 centimes, and cost of 
the adapter unit is being reduced from Fr250 to Fr200. "The 
2,400-bps ports will be the last to turn toward Numeris, because 
their volume of usage is so low," explains Charles de Cognets. 
"Actually it is 4,800-bps ports, the most commonly used, that 
probably account for most migration to Channel D. But turnover 
for the latter will still be less than that for direct 
connections." 
  The product has yet to seduce more than a relatively small 
number of clients. According to Transpac, 600 "Channel D" links 
are in operation today, and all the switching units are 
VN3-level. Looking ahead to 1994, the enormous contract signed 
with La Francaise de Jeux for 13,800 connections probably will 
account for 60 percent of installed capacity. However, the 
operator claims another big account is to join the ranks of 
Channel D users between now and late 1994. When first launched, 
it will be recalled, the service was oriented toward PMEs [small 
and medium sized enterprises] with between 10 and 500 employees, 
70 percent of them Numeris users. But it seems that this type of 
consumer has not yet acquired the Channel D habit. 
<H5>  Split-Speed </H5>
  Failure to understand the existing market partly explains 
this inertia. Let us recall that as of 1993 the profitable usage 
threshold is between 10 and 15 megabytes of traffic per month. 
But what most inhibits Channel D's growth is the profusion of 
alternative solutions -- private networks based on leased lines 
or VSAT [variable aperture satellite terminals]. More and more 
medium-sized enterprises, armed with their data traffic charts 
and overhead analyses, are calling on Transpac to provide 
service tailored to their own specifications, leaving public 
rates and comparison charts to the ordinary consumer. This 
"enterprise network" service, as Transpac calls it, is based on 
a specially tailored contract, in which billing depends partly 
on actual connection costs and utilization charges are invoiced 
as a pre-agreed lump sum. This practice encourages existing 
customers to remain loyal to the company, at least pending the 
advent of serious competition. 
  Assured of a stable domestic market for at least the next 
few 
years, Transpac is happily prospecting for new clients in the 
European market. "We find it easy to make contacts abroad, 
because we enjoy the technological cachet associated with France 
Telecom group," notes Charles de Cognets. This export-oriented 
strategy shows Transpac's ambition to become the biggest 
European data transmission operator. There are however, a few 
obstacles to be overcome, namely Infonet (international 
consortium of X.25 operators) and Info AG (a subsidiary of 
Germany's telecommunications operator). 
  As for the first obstacle, Transpac and Infonet will need to 
divide up the market in order not to step on each other's toes 
in Europe. With regard to the second, everything depends on 
Deutsche Telekom's acquiring an ownership share in France 
Telecom (president Marcel Roulet is hoping for 10 percent). 
  Whatever happens on the international scene, a page has been 
turned. And Transpac has already traded in its French X.25 
mantle for a multiservice, European livery.

<F P=106> [Article by B. d'Armagnac: "An American Ally for France </F>
Telecom and Deutsche Telekom"] 
  [Text] International competition is forcing the two 
operators to seek out alliances. A Franco-German alliance 
presupposes changes in the European laws regulating competition. 
Parallel discussions with AT&amp;T reportedly are under way... 
  France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are discussing a 
possible 
strengthening of their strategic alliance. Charles Rozmaryn, 
France Telecom's general manager, told 01 INFORMATIQUE that 
relations with Germany are "the keystone of international growth 
strategy" for the French communications operator. But to 
intensify their cooperation and conclude alliances, France 
Telecom and Deutsche Telekom must overcome several juridical 
obstacles. First of all, their charters must be reformed, with 
employee status and entitlements promising to present 
particularly thorny problems on both sides of the Rhine. Next, 
they will have to lobby to ensure their rapprochement is not 
blocked by current European legislation governing competition. 
Recently, top-level executives of France Telecom and Deutsche 
Telekom have held meetings at the European Commission with 
Commission President Jacques Delors. "The basic problem is to 
re-examine the framework of competition in the Community, which 
needs to be modernized," says a high-ranking official in 
Brussels, adding that "Europe needs large groups, of the sort 
that eventually could develop from partnerships between big 
enterprises such as these two [telecommunications] operators." 
Jacques Delors's activities in this area already represent the 
first informal steps toward rethinking that framework. 
  The Franco-German duo also needs support outside Europe. In 
late 1991 the two partners created a joint subsidiary, Eunetcom, 
for LAN [local area network] outsourcing. But if Eunetcom is to 
offer services on a truly planetwide scale, it needs allies. 
Hence the rumors of discussions with AT&amp;T. "Everyone is 
talking 
to everyone else. As we have already said, we're looking for a 
partner in the United States and another one in Southeast Asia. 
The BT-MCI alliance simply means there is one less partner for 
Eunetcom," Rozmaryn concludes.

<F P=106> [Article by B. d'Armagnac: "Why France Telecom Must Change"] </F>
  [Text] With deregulation coming to the telecommunications 
market, France Telecom needs to amend its charter and find 
partners that carry weight in the global market. It must 
strengthen ties with Deutsche Telekom. The strategy: new 
commercial and tariff policies, and diversification into 
computer services. 
  Is France Telecom doomed to suffer the fate of the 
dinosaurs? 
Will the telecommunications operator be able to evolve enough to 
survive in an environment of turbulent competition? Everywhere 
in the telecommunications industry, rumors are flying of 
colossal alliances between public operators, cable operators, 
and computer builders. Last June, Brussels gave a further push 
to change in the European communications landscape. Beginning in 
1998, all telecommunications services will be open to 
competition from companies anywhere in the Community. Still 
basking in the comfort of its virtually untouched monopoly of 
the domestic market, France Telecom has a big job ahead of it. 
It must throw off the yoke of its status as a 
government-controlled corporation, which is a handicap in 
concluding international alliances and adapting to changing 
markets. It must also improve responsiveness to demands of a 
clientele that recognizes its technical prowess but grumbles 
about its tariffs and marketing approach. Finally, it has yet to 
prove its strategy of investing in computer services is 
pertinent and profitable. The challenges are tremendous --but so 
is the explosive expansion of the market. 
<H5>  Open to Competition </H5>
  "It is always more difficult to try to change when all the 
indicators are positive." Charles Rozmaryn, general manager of 
France Telecom, points out that the French operator is in fact 
doing very well just now. In 1992, the French telecommunications 
market was 180 billion French francs [Fr], plus more than Fr40 
billion in investments. France Telecom was responsible for more 
than 98.5 percent of turnover in services, according to Marc 
Dandelot, consultant to the government and author of a report on 
the sector prepared for the minister of industry. But this 
position of strength in the domestic market is changing. Several 
years ago, the French mobile telephone market was opened up with 
the entry of SFR, a subsidiary of Generale des Eaux [General 
Water Company]. 
  In the local area network [LAN] market, competitors such as 
BT [British Telecoms], Unisource, Cable &amp; Wireless, and IBM 
are 
trying to carve out positions. 
  France Telecom also has a long way to go at the 
international 
level. Overseas sales accounted for 15 percent of turnover in 
1992 (total turnover was Fr121.5 billion, with 168,000 employees 
and net profits of Fr3 billion). The approximately Fr5 billion 
invested outside of France was devoted mostly to purchase of 
market shares in foreign countries, often in conjunction with 
privatization processes. Narrowly focused partnerships have also 
been concluded with the Americans. For example, the French 
operator is collaborating with US West in promoting Minitel 
[home terminal of the French telecommunications system], and 
with Bell South in France's cellular market. But major accords 
remain to be concluded. In coping with tumultuous change, its 
first challenge is to revamp its own charter. An initial step 
was taken in July 1990 with legislation that gave it 
administrative autonomy vis-a-vis the state. But the degree of 
autonomy it currently enjoys is sometimes very problematic, as 
demonstrated by the amount of money it was obliged to inject 
into the capital of CEA-Industrie and Bull, in which it now 
holds a 17.7 percent share. The pace of change was accelerated 
last June when the European Community fixed 1 January 1998 as 
the date for inaugurating free competition on the voice 
telephony market, which is responsible for 80 percent of France 
Telecom's turnover. This is why the government plans next spring 
to submit legislation to Parliament revising the operator's 
charter, turning it into a limited-liability company with the 
state as majority shareholder. Changing the status of employees 
will be an especially sensitive affair. The sizable mobilization 
in connection with the 12 October strike was a powerful reminder 
of that. 
  At the same time as France Telecom is reforming its charter 
and implementing the necessary rate restructuring, it must also 
find supports and the partners needed for growth in overseas 
markets. Deutsche Telekom is currently the keystone of this 
international push. "Since the creation of Eucom in 1987 as a 
vehicle for providing value-added services, the presidents of 
our two enterprises, Marcel Roulet and Helmut Ricke, have met 
together periodically. Their frequent meetings have generated a 
feeling of real confidence," says Udo Huck, president of the 
French subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom. In addition to Eucom, the 
two operators in late 1991 launched Eunetcom (which specializes 
in LAN outsourcing). A joint subsidiary, Eunetcom has just 
recently begun to take shape with the naming in September of 
Claude Olier as general manager. According to Huck, the two 
parent companies have several good reasons for pursuing their 
collaboration. First of all, BT, Europe's other major operator, 
has found an important partner in MCI (United States). Second, 
AT&amp;T -- by reason of its ambitions and its dual hats, as both 
operator and integrator --looms as a "dangerous partner." 
Finally, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom are about the same 
size, though the German firm is slightly larger. "This means our 
strategic partnership doesn't run the risk that one partner or 
the other will become dominant," notes the head of Deutsche 
Telekom in France, adding that their respective spheres of 
expertise and the distribution of their physical assets on the 
ground are fairly complementary. This proximity of perspectives 
gives the two partners grounds for cherishing high hopes for 
their Eunetcom subsidiary. In the field of outsourcing 
enterprise networks, a market estimated at between US$3-4 
billion, "we are getting in on the ground floor of a field where 
competition for contracts is very fierce," explains general 
manager Claude Olier. The company hopes ultimately to carve out 
a 10 to 15 percent market share, concentrating initially on 
France and Germany, its natural markets. A contract with IBM was 
inked in October, and a second big international client is 
expected to sign with Eunetcom in the near future. In addition 
to Eunetcom, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are discussing 
a strengthening of their alliance in the context of the charter 
restructurings to which both are committed. Marc Dandelot is an 
enthusiastic advocate of these closer ties. "Interlocked 
shareholding between the operators is necessary, both to cement 
their strategic alliance over the longer term and to augment its 
credibility at the international level -- not only in the eyes 
of clients, but also with other partners whose cooperation 
doubtless will be indispensable if we're to achieve the status 
of a full-service, Europe-wide operator," concludes Michel 
Hirsch, director of France Telecom's international division. 
  France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are thus counting on 
each 
other to make their transformations successful. But given the 
obstacles at the legislative level, problems connected with 
employee status, and a speeded-up calendar for market 
deregulation, they cannot afford to slacken in their efforts. 
<H3>  Interview with Charles Rozmaryn, general manager of France 
Telecom, by B. d'Armagnac. </H3>
<H5>  "Strengthen Strategic Alliance with Deutsche Telekom" </H5>
  [d'Armagnac] With the market increasingly open, who are your 
main rivals? 
  [Rozmaryn] When a big call for bids goes out, the contest is 
between BT-MCI, AT&amp;T, Sita, Deutsche Telekom, and us. 
International presence is a decisive factor. France Telecom's 
European implantation, including Transpac, makes us a credible 
contender. The contracts won by France Telecom group with 
Europcar and IBM prove that. 
  [d'Armagnac] In France, how will the new entrants change the 
market? 
  [Rozmaryn] At both the domestic and international level, 
there are going to be new players in the market. Inevitably, 
these will be large companies, because large investments are 
required, and clients need to be dealing with credible 
interlocutors. 
  [d'Armagnac] How important are your ties with Deutsche 
Telekom? 
  [Rozmaryn] They are the keystone of our international growth 
strategy. When we created Eunetcom, that was the only sector 
where the regulations governing competition permitted us to 
collaborate. The subsidiary was created in late 1991, in 
response to a situation which has changed a great deal since 
then with the decision in Brussels last June to move ahead with 
European liberalization. The competitive landscape is different 
now. Thus we and our German colleagues are in the process of 
re-evaluating the situation as a whole, to strengthen our 
strategic alliance and broaden considerably the range of 
activities we will pursue jointly. 
  [d'Armagnac] What is France Telecom's strategy in computer 
services? 
  [Rozmaryn] France Telecom must be active in this sector, 
because clients increasingly are demanding full-service 
providers. So we must be able to work with clients at the level 
of enterprise applications, and this explains our need for 
link-ups with service companies. The SSIIs [computer systems and 
services firms] have access to loci of decision-making and 
specification-setting that are useful to us. Especially 
overseas, which is France Telecom's principal target. This for 
example is what's behind the idea of the partnership with Sema 
Group. Finally, we have our own computer services company, 
Telesystemes. FTLIS, our services division, needs to grow, 
especially in overseas markets. Sema Group's takeover of SKD, 
the Swedish SSII, is a typical example of the kind of 
partnership we are seeking. 
  [d'Armagnac] What kind of synergies can there be with Bull, 
particularly in services? 
  [Rozmaryn] We have acquired an ownership interest in Bull 
for 
both historical and financial reasons; our participation is not 
that of a shareholder truly integrated into the enterprise's 
overall strategy. [end box]

<F P=106> [Article by P.R.: "Cap Sesa Seeking to Double its Market </F>
Shares"] 
  [Text] The slowdown in the industrial data processing 
market should affect the modernization and equipment plans to a 
lesser extent. This is one arena where Cap Sesa Industrie seeks 
to boost its presence. 
  "Industry is the sector of the economy that dispensed most 
of 
all with software and services last year," says Gerard Mezin, 
director-general of Cap Sesa Industrie. In the light of this 
finding, his company (Fr1 billion business volume) -- which 
chalked up 3.5 percent of its software and service sales for 6.5 
percent of the business volume of the SSI [data processing 
services and engineering companies] in this sector in 1992 -- 
intends to double its shares of the market by the 1996 horizon 
without any foreign growth. 
  The pie that is to be shared here as a matter of fact looks 
quite appetizing. According to Pierre Audoin Conseil, the 
industrial enterprises last year devoted 92 billion to their 
data processing systems, including 29 billion for software and 
services. A study specially conducted by Cap Sesa shows that the 
big accounts, that always sustained the growth of the services 
market (in 1992, ten industrial groups accounted for 35 percent 
of the software and services expenditures) have a tendency to 
slow their investments down; on the other hand, medium-sized 
enterprises will pick up the slack and will help push 
expenditures up. 
  "The difficult economic situation in which many of the big 
accounts find themselves obviously has an unfavorable impact on 
their investments in software and services," emphasized Gerard 
Mezin. Moreover, there are currently wide disparities between 
the sectors that should recover with the passage of time. Some 
of them, such as metallurgy, agribusiness and food, and capital 
goods are posting expenditure ratios between data processing and 
business volume that are still rather meager when compared to 
the industry average. Cap Sesa, in turn, has just signed two 
important contracts, representing a total of more than Fr80 
billion in the field of computer-aided manufacturing management 
and commercial management. 
  "In 1996, the industrial enterprises will consume 30 percent 
of FM and 30 percent hardware. Big projects will be increasingly 
built up on the basis of these products," predicts Gerard Mezin. 
These two market segments should advance, respectively, at a 
rate of 23 percent and 12 percent per year, as against 9.3 
percent for systems integration, a preferred arena of 
competition between data processing services and engineering 
companies, on the one hand, and data processing equipment 
makers, on the other hand.

<F P=106> [Article by P.R.: "Bull Reduces Its Capital"] </F>
  [Text] Bull's stockholders are to decide in December on a 
capital reduction. Its present capital is 3.96 billion francs 
[Fr]. The operation will reduce the nominal value of the stock, 
pending a capital contribution of Fr8.6 billion by the state, 
that is to be effected in two transfers of funds, one at the end 
of this year and the other during 1994. Technically, its capital 
will first be reduced by Fr3.5 billion in two stages. The first 
stage will consist of a consolidation: Ten Fr20 shares will 
become one Fr200 share. In the second stage, the value of this 
share will be divided by 10, reducing it to Fr20. This 
reduction, combined with the withdrawal of Fr3.4 billion from 
the "issues, mergers, and contributions" reserve account, will 
lower Bull's (still) negative balance brought forward, from 
Fr9.44 billion to Fr2.44 billion. Bull's capital stock is owned 
to the extent of 72 percent by the state, 16 percent by France 
Telecom, 5.6 percent by IBM, 4.4 percent by NEC, and 1.7 percent 
by the public. Over the past nine months, Bull's revenue has 
declined by 8.6 percent (Fr18.24 billion).

<F P=106> [Article by Virginie Robert: "Bull Testing Descarpentries's </F>
Style"] 
  [Text] Jean-Marie Descarpentries, Bull's new CEO [chief 
executive officer], has given himself 30 days to get his 
bearings. He has allowed himself six months before taking 
action, and between 18 and 24 months to straighten out the 
enterprise. Jean-Marie Decarpentries, a raider in the view of 
those employees who have met him, has won over clients and 
collaborators, impressed by his charisma, almost despite 
themselves. "He is the president who perhaps can save Bull," 
says Jean-Pierre Muller, president of the Cube, the club of Bull 
users. 
  Jean-Marie Descarpentries's has set out decisively on the 
road toward his goal, which is: To recover operational 
equilibrium by the end of 1994 instead of in 1995 as had been 
planned by his predecessor, Bernard Pache. To this end, he has 
organized two think-tank committees, one of them dedicated to 
persons and jobs, and the other to the profitability of 
activities. "The sectors that are unprofitable, I shall 
liquidate," he has warned. Bull's new CEO has chosen his model: 
Hewlett-Packard, which has one of the industry's best 
productivity-per-employee ratios, and is one of the sector's 
only manufacturers to be making money. A plan of action is 
expected to be submitted to the group's executive committee by 
the end of the month. The committee could revise the plan at 
that session. The plan will call for a strengthening of ties 
with the company's shareholder NEC. Jean-Marie Descarpentries 
visited Japan this week. The object of the maneuver: Augment the 
synergy between the two manufacturers, share the production of 
components, and increase the compatibility of the operating 
softwares of big mainframe systems. Cooperation may also be 
under consideration in the field of portables, inasmuch as NEC, 
as a supplier of screens and microcomputers, is seeking to 
emerge from its domestic market. For the moment, Bull will 
settle its debts, which are to reduced from 9.4 billion francs 
[Fr] to Fr2.4 billion, through a compression of its capital. 
This operation will be ratified by a general meeting of its 
stockholders, scheduled for mid-December. The credit for this 
operation goes to Bernard Pache, who planned it... Jean-Marie 
Descarpentries, who has been given the task of imparting new 
sheen to Bull's tarnished image, stands to gain from the 
heritage left to him by his predecessor. After rendering an 
elaborate homage to Bernard Pache, Descarpentries asserted that 
he has no intention of changing his decisions.

<F P=106> [Article by P.R.: "Bull Undergoing General Reorganization"] </F>
  [Text] Bull is casting its skin. At least from the 
organizational standpoint. The group's new structure is built 
around a new management committee that has been baptized the 
"Bull Executive Board." It consists of 11 members, including 
Jean-Marie Descarpentries, the new CEO [chief executive officer] 
since the eviction of Bernard Pache last October. This Executive 
Board has in turn formed an operations council -- the Bull 
Operating Council --consisting of approximately 100 members. The 
group's operations units are also reorganized. The Bull group 
will now consist of seven major divisions, each financially 
autonomous. These units will concern themselves with the 
company's products (servers, open systems and softwares, 
microcomputer systems), its services (integration of systems, 
maintenance, and multivendor services), and its industrial 
activities. 
  Through this reorganization, Bull clearly hopes to recover 
financial equilibrium in 1994, thanks also to the support that 
will be generated by its forthcoming recapitalization of 8.6 
billion francs. 
  And thanks also to implementation of its staff-reduction and 
assets-divestment plans. The first to be affected by these plans 
will be its artificial intelligence activities and its in-house 
printing activities.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Mammals Rescue Plants"] </F>
  [Text] Creating plants resistant to a large spectrum of 
viral infections rather than to a single virus is exactly what 
Finnish and Estonian researchers are trying to achieve. Their 
idea is to create transgenic plants incorporating 2'-5' 
oligoadenylate synthetase, a protein produced by mammals in 
response to viral infections. 
  When activated by double-stranded RNA [ribonucleic acid] -- 
the most frequently found replicative form of viral RNA, this 
enzyme acts as a catalyst in the polymerization of ATP 
[adenosine triphosphate] into 2'-5' oligo-adenylates. In turn, 
these oligonucleotides go on to activate the endoribonuclease, 
RNase L. 
  Mart Saarma (Biotechnology Institute of Helsinki) and his 
colleagues have transformed potato plants, via Agrobacterium 
tumefaciens, with the c-DNA [complementary deoxyribonucleic 
acid] of the rat's 2-5' oligo-adenylate synthetase gene. These 
plants, planted on small parcels of farmland, were innoculated 
with potato virus X (PVX). In three of the clones tested, no 
viral particles were detected. The virus was detected in the 
tubercules and leaves of the other clones, but in two cases, in 
concentrations below those found in non-transformed control 
plants and in transgenic plants expressing the capside protein 
of PVX. These results would suggest that a mammal protein can 
protect potato plants from infection by PVX. Is this protection 
equally effective against other RNA viruses? And is it, as in 
the case of mammals, general and non-specific? These are 
questions currently being addressed by the researchers. 
  For more information, contact Mart Saarma, Biotechnology 
Institute, PO Box 45, Karvaamokuja 3A, 00014 Helsinki 
University, Finland.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Casamayou: "Business Between France </F>
and Poland Is Picking Up Again"] 
  [Text] The two countries have just stepped up trade in the 
aviation and defense fields. 
  Ever since the disappearance of the Warsaw Pact, Poland has 
been trying to revive its military connections with the Western 
countries, particularly with France. New prospects are opening 
up for French manufacturers today in view of Poland's desire to 
join NATO. This revival of bonds has already been expressed by 
partnerships between military units, such as, between the 2nd 
Fighter Squadron based on Dijon and the 1st Polish Air Defense 
Regiment stationed at Minsk-Mazowiecki; there have also been 
trips by high-ranking military authorities or industrialists. 
Now it is the turn of a delegation of equipment makers from 
GIFAS [French Aerospace Industries Group] to visit the country 
presided over by Lech Walesa. 
  Although the French military budget is declining with barely 
10&percnt; earmarked for equipment, the needs of the Polish Army 
are 
very great. The participation of Polish military personnel in UN 
missions, side by side with Western forces, enabled them to 
measure the weakness of their Soviet-produced materiel in terms 
of modernity and interoperability. This calls for a major effort 
since they very much want to join NATO. 
  Due to lack of sufficient funds, it is clear that there will 
be no direct purchasing of defense materiel. Unable to purchase 
Mirage 2000 aircraft as they said they would like to, the Air 
Force people are content with modernizing their MiG-21 and 
MiG-23 aircraft (300 units) and possibly their MiG-29 planes. 
French producers, such as Thomson-CSF, Sagem [Company for 
General Applications of Electricity and Mechanics], or Dassault 
Electronique are particularly well-placed, even in the area of 
modernizing their armored vehicles, which is also on the agenda. 
  In the armament field, there are good opportunities in the 
Polish Navy which wants to improve the antiaircraft defenses of 
its vessels by adding antiaircraft missile systems. Besides, the 
Navy people want to replace their old SS-N-2 "Styx" anti-ship 
missiles with "Exocet" and to procure anti-mine and 
anti-submarine sonars both for their mine chasers and their 
helicopters (Thomson airborne sonar). Lastly, in developing 
their own antiaircraft system based on a T-72 tank chassis 
christened the "Loara" (meaning Loire!), they are looking for 
missiles of the Roland or Crotale type and they are negotiating 
for a license with France. This system, equipped with a fire 
control and electrooptical radar (to be defined), comes in two 
versions: one with two 35-mm Oerlikon cannons and another with 
eight antiaircraft missiles. 
  Above and beyond some immediate purchases, Poland's main 
concern has to do with the future of its armament industry which 
occupied something like 300,000 workers before the Pact 
crumbled. This was an industry some of whose production centers 
were working exclusively for the USSR, such as, for example, a 
portion of the Mielek plant that annually turned out more than 
500 An-28 [aircraft] for export. Today, it is being restructured 
with something like 50&percnt; personnel cuts. But in this entire 
industry, the Polish Government intends to preserve the aviation 
sector. A group organized under the consortium PZL (Panstwowe 
Zaklady Lotnicze) consists of 19 establishments specializing in 
the license-based construction of light aircraft (trainers and 
liaison aircraft), helicopters, and engines employing something 
like 50,000 persons. 
  Along these lines, the Poles are looking for partnerships 
with Western manufacturers to improve their products, to find 
commercial outlets, or to get into subcontracting work. Here, we 
might mention the "Dromader" crop-duster built in cooperation 
with Rockwell and Pratt &amp; Whitney, or the central section of 
the 
wing of the ATR-72 made by PZL-Swidnik (see box) in the wake of 
compensation agreements that followed the purchase of eight 
ATR-42 by LOT [Polish Airlines]. They are also looking for new 
engines to boost the performances of their aircraft: Larzac (in 
competition with Viper) for their Iryda trainer, or the Ariel 
turbine for their new SW-4 helicopter. Finally, in the 
electronics field, agreements have also been signed between 
Thomson-CSF and the builder of Radwar radars for the production 
of IFF identification systems. 
<H5>  Box </H5>
  French-Polish Cooperation: Example of PZL-Swidnik 
  Located 160 km southwest of Warsaw, PZL-Swidnik is the 
Polish 
establishment that has been specializing in the development and 
production of helicopters since 1953. More than 7,000 craft have 
come off its assembly lines, primarily the Mi-2. Ever since the 
big upheaval in 1989, the firm became a "company of the State 
Treasury," that is to say, an enterprise equivalent to one of 
our national companies capable of engaging in commerce according 
to international rules. Its personnel force was cut from 8,000 
to 5,000, although management officials "would love to reduce 
the personnel force even more." Right now, its model assortment 
still consists of the venerable Mi-2 which PZL-Swidnik is 
rebuilding and upgrading with Allison turbines under the name of 
"Kania," as well as the new "Sokol," which has had some export 
success (see No. 1445), a ground-attack version of which is 
being developed with the help of South Africa; then there is 
also the SW-4 light helicopter which is undergoing development 
and whose power plant could be farmed out to Turbomeca. 
  Like all of Poland's industries, the Lublin Firm is 
struggling with a slack demand. This year, it will produce 
barely about 30 craft. Hence, the desire to supplement 
helicopter production with other activities, especially 
aeronautical subcontracting or diversified products. Among these 
new products, the PW-5 glider designed by the Warsaw Technology 
University has turned out to be a winner. There are also less 
prestigious products, such as baby carriages, machinery for 
agribusiness, and vehicle trailers, more than 2,000 of which are 
sold in France. 
  "France turned out to be the most receptive in our search 
for 
cooperative undertakings," confided Pavel Restak, the company's 
new marketing manager. The first step was taken with the 
agreement covering the manufacture of 290 elements of the 
central box of the wing cell for the ATR-72, a first copy of 
which has just been shipped to France. For the Polish 
enterprise, this turned into a learning experience and the 
application of new procedures, above all in terms of surface 
treatment, quality control, as well as an in-depth 
transformation of manufacturing processes. 
  For the French, this means orders for equipment (especially 
a 
three-axle milling tool capable of machining 10-m long parts), 
plus plant modernizing agreements. In a more general fashion, 
Aerospatiale signed a technical cooperation agreement and 105 
Polish technicians have already gone through six-month training 
courses at the Eurocopter plant in Marignane. PZL-Swidnik 
managers, who believe that this kind of exchange is "profitable 
and very beneficial," are thus in the process of transforming 
the old arsenal into a modern enterprise equipped with a 
500-person research office, and above all, a commercial division 
that is already staffed by 60 workers.

in China"] 
  [Text] Worried about the breakthrough made by Boeing on the 
Chinese market this year while the Europeans are marking time, 
Airbus Industrie decided to increase its commercial manpower in 
Beijing. It increased its personnel on station by five, 
considering opening a spare parts warehouse and an aeronautical 
engineering training center. "Our objective is to step up 
cooperation with Chinese industry," emphasized Jean Pierson, 
administrator and manager of the consortium, adding: "We have to

  [Text] Rome (ANSA), 7 Dec -- Electric Porter, a vehicle 
that combines Piaggio's 20-year experience in this specific 
sector of mobility and transport, is making its debut at the 
Bologna motor show. Developed in collaboration with the 
Micro-Vett company of Imola, Electric Porter has been presented 
in the four or six-seater minibus version, a transport van with 
a 500-kg load capacity, and a pick-up garbage truck with a 
400-kg load capacity. All the versions have a compact and 
silent M100 electric engine developed by Mico-Vett, which has a 
10 kw capacity practically without any need for maintenance. 
The management of the engine unit is handled by a high 
frequency electronic control unit that is highly reliable and 
silent and that permits the vehicle to provide a more than 
appreciable performance in urban traffic. In order to maximize 
its acceleration and range the maximum speed has been contained 
at 55 km per hour. In addition to the normal braking system, 
Porter Elettrico has an electric braking system which, in 
addition to slowing down the vehicle, transforms part of the 
kinetic energy that develops when braking into electric energy 
that goes to automatically recharge the batteries. Particular 
emphasis has been placed on the range of the vehicle. It is 
exempt from car ownership tax and its insurance rate has been 
reduced by 50 percent, therefore it costs only 50 lire per 
kilometer. The on-the-road selling price for the minibus version 
of Electric Porter is 35,280,000 lire. Sales will begin in 
January from Piaggio's sales network.

Italy and Japan in Pole Position"] 
  [Text] Pisa. By the end of the century motor vehicles will 
have to pay more attention to the environment. Partly because 
legislation in individual countries will become more stringent. 
Partly because the environment is acquiring more importance in 
the priorities of consumers. Companies in the sector are 
already getting their weapons ready: The "clean" engine will 
become an extra card to play on the table of world competition. 
And as Mazda Motor Corporation Senior Managing Director 
Michinori Yamanouchi states: "Running the risk of not meeting 
this appointment could lead to being excluded from the market." 
  According to many, the revolution will not occur in the 
immediate future: It will take a few years before the market 
starts discriminating automobiles or scooters because of their 
excessive polluting emissions. However, those in the sector who 
met over the past few days at the third "Small Engine Technology 
Conference", held in Pisa to commemorate the 650th anniversary 
of the university, but primarily because of its vicinity to 
Piaggio headquarters, assure that they have no doubts: With the 
demographic explosion and the growing industrialization of 
developing countries, the 550 million vehicles currently in 
circulation on the planet are destined to become 2.5 billion 50 
years from now. 
  Piaggio European Vehicles President Alberto Agnelli, who 
opened the conference, stated: "We all have the task of 
satisfying consumer demands: understanding their needs but also 
making a contribution to the quality of life by performing 
research for safety, reliability, and primarily for the ecology 
of vehicles." And in this area Piaggio -- which is aware of the 
growing importance that two-wheeled transport will have in urban 
areas -- is about to wage a bet. "We are already well ahead in 
the design of a new vehicle: the `bimodal' vehicle," explained 
Piaggio VE Director General Matteo Roberto Pagliano, "that 
combines both an electric and a combustion engine." Briefly, 
the pilot will be able to use the electric engine in town but 
will also be able to change over to tradition gasoline outside 
the urban area. 
  The major issue is the cost, both production and sales 
costs. 
"At the moment," said Yamanouchi, " consumers do not seem ready 
to pay more for a `green' vehicle. But once this was also the 
case for safety features such as the ABS [anti-block system]. 
And then things changed. Therefore a change in direction is 
easily foreseeable even on the environmental front." Mazda 
invests approximately 1.5 trillion lire in research and 
development and 40 percent of its 5,000 researchers are working 
for the environment. 
  Piaggio has other cards up its sleeve however. "By the end 
of 
1994," explained Luca Masut, technical director and the 
Pontedera-based company, "we will present a new range of 
products which, without any considerable increase in costs, will 
be capable of reducing emissions by more than 50 percent thanks 
to combustion and post-treatment systems that have already been 
patented or for which a patent has been requested." 
  On this front, international regulations are still very 
divergent: The strictness of the Clean Air Act in the United 
States can be compared only to Japanese regulations. However, 
according to forecasts, the European Union will also begin to 
align itself by 1996. "In some fields such as small marine 
engines," said Lawrence Toriello from Mercury, a division of the 
Brunswick group, "excessive legislation has created some 
problems. In my opinion industries should be involved in the 
legislative process to be able to move with more flexibility in 
the design phase." In reality, while the rest of the world 
stands with the limited petroleum resources sword of Damocles 
hanging over their heads, there are those that also hope for 
more cooperation among industries. "It would be nice," 
confessed Yamanouchi, "but I do not think this will be possible. 
Competition is competition. Even when it means meeting the 
needs of the Planet Earth."

<F P=106> [Article by Luc Augier: "Minis Set Out to Conquer the </F>
World"; first paragraph is SCIENCE ET VIE introduction] 
  [Text] Mercedes's experimental Vision A model is a bid to 
optimize the Twingo and pave the way for the electric vehicle of 
2000. 
  The small car prototypes of Mercedes and BMW stole the 
Frankfurt Show. But the vehicles were not created with the 
economic recession in mind, nor to exploit a market segment that 
generates more volume than profit margins. Upcoming 
administrative deadlines simply leave the automakers with no 
other strategic choice if they want to continue selling their 
traditional top-of-the-line models. 
  The Clean Air Act stipulates that, beginning 1 January, 
1998, 
two percent of all cars sold in California be "zero emission" 
vehicles -- in other words, electric cars. And electric cars 
mean small cars confined by their limited range to the city. 
Besides zero emission, there will be an ultra-low-emission 
category which European standards will adopt in 2000. Small 
motors will make it easier to meet stepped-up restrictions on 
the carbon oxide, unburned hydrocarbon, and nitrogen oxide 
content of exhaust. Indeed, over equal distances, small engines 
emit smaller quantities of gas than bigger ones. This reduction 
in the cubic capacity of engines is another argument in favor of 
small cars. Finally, by 2005 the EC would like to mandate 
average fuel consumption for each automaker's line of 5 liters 
or less per 100 km. "Pushing down" the average will require both 
small cars and diesel engines, which consume 25 percent less 
fuel for the same use as gas engines. Consumption is defined as 
the mathematical average, dubbed Euromix, of three standardized 
measures: consumption at a steady speed of 90 km/h, at a 
constant speed of 120 km/h, and for a typical city run. The 
current European average, all makes combined, is 7.05 liters/100 
km. Renault and Peugeot SA (6.54 and 6.37 l/100 km respectively) 
do not have as far to go as BMW or Mercedes (9.18 and 8.65 l/100 
km) to meet the 2005 requirements. Moreover, Mercedes's greater 
use of diesel engines gives it an advantage over BMW. 
  Of the two prototypes presented, Mercedes's Vision A is 
obviously the more innovative in terms of design. A comparison 
with Renault's Twingo highlights the distance between an ideal, 
but realistic, project, and an admittedly unusual car whose 
commercial viability will depend on coming to terms with 
industrial and commercial realities. 
  Both models favor a minivan shape, wheels that have been 
moved out to the four corners of the body, and the simplest 
possible overhangs for the best tradeoff between footprint and 
spaciousness. 
  Both offer an attractive rear-seat adjustment feature: The 
back seat on the Twingo can be moved forward or backward 17 cm, 
compared to 10 cm on the Vision A, depending on whether more 
trunk or back room is needed. The seat folds up or can be half 
removed in both models, transforming them from sedans into a 
small station wagons. The Mercedes's wheel base is a little 
shorter (-3.7 cm), as is its total body length (-8.3 cm), yet it 
still offers a more spacious interior similar to that of the new 
Class C! To achieve this roominess, Mercedes is innovating by 
shifting a front engine under the passengers' feet, as on some 
Japanese commercial vehicles and minivans (Toyota Previa and 
Nissan Serena). 
  That is what makes the Vision A so clever: a rigorously flat 
floor supported by two straight, parallel sills is "sandwiched" 
between occupants and the car's mechanical components. The 
60-degree-angle engines, the gearbox, and the fuel tank are 
below; the interior is above. The immediate consequence is that 
the Vision A is very high -- 15 cm higher than the Twingo! Those 
who have already driven four-wheel drives in the city have had 
the chance to appreciate this "above-the-crowd" lookout, which 
has its charms. The Vision A's added height optimizes its 
functionality, albeit at the expense of aerodynamics, which can 
be sacrificed in a car designed to travel at generally low 
speeds. Nonetheless, at 120 km/h, Mercedes claims its car 
consumes 5.2 l/100 km, against 7.0 l/100 for the Twingo, despite 
the latter's smaller front surface. Here again, however, a 
distinction must be made between the ideal and reality. The only 
thing the two cars' gas engines have in common is their cubic 
capacity (1.2 liters) and power (55 hp). In contrast, the Vision 
A's three-cylinder is experimental, while Twingo's engine was 
simply borrowed from Renault's components bank -- it is taken 
from the 1960's R8 Major -- and adapted to reflect today's 
tastes at least cost. 
  In addition, the sandwich structure of the Mercedes model 
offers a substantial safety advantage. In case of a head-on 
collision, the engine snaps off from its anchor points and 
slides under the floor, where it cannot force its way up into 
the interior. The nose can then function fully as an energy 
absorber, buckling or changing shape as planned. Side impacts 
affect the very tough sills -- which are underneath the 
occupants -- instead of the doors. Here again, there is much 
less risk of components jutting into the interior. 
  The Vision A's final trump is a volume that makes it easier 
to lay out mechanical components. Every millimeter of space 
under the Twingo's hood has been used; its structure could not 
accomodate a diesel engine and there is no place for a 
conventional automatic tranmission. In contrast, the Vision A's 
electric model has room to house the nickel sodium chloride 
battery that supplies the 54-hp induction engine (120 km/h peak 
speed and 150 km of autonomy in the city), the electronic 
control module, and the bulky cooling equipment in a 
well-protected area. It is even possible to envision the use of 
a hybrid propulsion system, including thermal turbine, buffer 
battery, and electric motor. Moreover, thermal versions (gas or 
diesel fuel combined with a continuous variation transmission) 
of the Vision A still have some room left to stow baggage under 
the floor. 
  For now, the least realistic features of the Vision A are 
its 
structure and its aluminum body. Mercedes estimates a weight 
gain of 70 kg over conventional steel structures. The entire 
prototype weighs 75 kg less than a Twingo, despite more 
elaborate equipment that includes airbags, power (electrical) 
steering, ABS (antislip brake control system), air-conditioning, 
and an on-board navigational system. Unlike its rival Audi, 
which has promised to bring out series aluminum cars in the near 
future, Mercedes admits that the industrial use of aluminum is 
not feasible. That being the case, the fuel consumption profile 
of a marketable Vision A would be less spectacular than the 3.8 
l per 100 km claimed for the direct-injection turbo diesel 
prototype. Nonetheless, the "small" Mercedes offered for sale 
around 1996 cannot differ too substantially from the Vision A 
without losing luster. For reasons of prestige, the automaker 
must apply its innovations, without trying to compete with the 
55,000 French franc [Fr] Twingo. However, the Fr123,000 sticker 
price of the Clio Baccara proves that, even for small cars, 
there is a demand for top-of-the-line models.

<F P=106> [Article by Peter Rodgers: "Three Into One"] </F>
  [Text] In 1990 France's national research agency, the 
CNRS, decided to reorganize its supercomputing strategy. The 
result is a new Institute for Development and Resources in 
High-Performance Computing (IDRIS), which replaces three 
previous centres -- CCVR [Vector Computation Center for 
Research] and CIRCE [Interregional Electronic Computing Center] 
in Paris, and the Strasbourg Computing Centre. IDRIS was 
officially opened at the old CIRCE site at the University of 
Paris-Sud last month. 
  With the development of the RENATER high-speed computer 
network, it made sense to have just one supercomputing centre, 
according to Victor Alessandrini, professor of theoretical 
physics at University of Paris-Sud and director of IDRIS. 
RENATER offers 35 megabit/s connections in some regions and two 
megabit/s elsewhere. "The mission from the CNRS", says 
Alessandrini, "was to develop a centre of excellence and to 
promote world-class high-performance computing and numerical 
simulation in all areas of science in France." IDRIS will also 
be the focus of French involvement in European and international 
collaborations in high-performance computing and networking. 
  IDRIS's most powerful machine is a Cray C98 with eight 
processors. The C98 has a peak speed of eight gigaflops (8 x 10 
in the ninth power floating point operations per second) and is 
routinely achieving three gigaflops - making it the most 
powerful vector supercomputer available to academics in Europe. 
The Cray has about 1500 users at present and some 40-50 percent 
of its time goes on climate change modelling, oceanography and 
other environmental research. Other subjects include quantum 
chromodynamics, fluid dynamics, quantum chemistry, molecular 
dynamics simulations of materials and plasma physics. 
  IDRIS plans to buy a massively parallel computer next year 
with a peak performance around 20 gigaflops and hopes to have 
teraflop performance (10 in the twelfth power flops) available 
in about three years. The centre has about 70 staff, including 
50 specialists in the use of high-performance computers. Some 
15 staff are working on the user interface; another 15 are 
working on scientific applications and will interact closely 
with users of the machine. There are also five staff porting 
existing computer codes to massively parallel machines. Other 
high-performance computers available to French university 
scientists include a Connection Machine at the University of 
Paris with a peak speed of 16 gigaflops, and an IBM 3090 in 
Montpellier.

<F P=106> [Article by Franco Foresta Martin: "Supercomputing To </F>
Understand the Phenomena of the Planet."] 
  [Text] Parallel computing will be the basis of the new and 
invigorated vocations of research that ENEA [National Agency for 
New Technologies, Energy and the Environment] President Nicola 
Cabibbo intends to promote in the agency that came under his 
guidance a few months ago. "Climatology, remote sensing, 
environmental analysis, and energy processes are some of the 
ENEA fields of interest that will benefit from the sharp 
improvement in quality that will come from the introduction of 
parallel computing methods," announced Cabibbo. 
  A theoretical physicist of international prestige, who has 
been distinguished more than once by the Swedish Academy of 
Sciences for his contributions to the so-called "standard model" 
of physics, Cabibbo has been president of the National Institute 
for Nuclear Physics (INFN) for eight years. It was there that he 
started the APE (Array Processor Experiment) project for a 
supercomputer capable of performing billions of operations per 
second. 
  Cabibbo remembers that: "At the beginning of the eighties 
our 
group working on quantistic cromodynamics, the theory that 
describes the behavior of quarks, was engaged on a numerical 
simulation project to deduce the values of some physical 
quantities. Such an expensive high-performance supercomputer 
was needed that we thought of building it ourselves. We decided 
not to go along the same path as the big producers like Cray, 
that push the speed of the single components to a maximum, and 
preferred to build a machine in which a large number of 
computing units worked in parallel. In this way it was possible 
to obtain high performance using standard technologies, and 
therefore at a more economic cost." 
<H5>  Basic Physics </H5>
  That was how, in 1984, the first APE machine capable of 
performing one billion operations per second, started. Its 
versatility, also outside the field of basic physics, was 
immediately recognized for all processes relating to industrial 
production and in general to forecasting analyses. 
  The project developed and in 1989 a second generation 
machine 
was built, the APE 100-Quadrix, characterized by eight computing 
units capable of performing 100 billion operations per second. 
In comparison, the best personal computers on our desks that 
have a single computing unit can carry out between one and 10 
million operations per second. At this point the APE project 
passed from the INFN laboratories to those of Alenia Spazio, 
which had acquired the license and intended to market the 
machine in the international field. However the INFN continued 
to work on the third generation: APE 1000. 
  With Cabibbo as president of the ENEA the potentialities of 
the supercomputer were immediately acquired by the agency which, 
in its increased capacity (law of August 1991), is engaged in 
research and applications in the sectors of new technologies, 
energy and the environment. "The ENEA has purchased an APE 100 
that will be installed in the Casaccia laboratories by next 
summer and will be used both in traditional and frontier 
research." 
<H5>  Climatic Plan </H5>
  Climatic simulations, aimed at interpreting the possible 
early signs of global overheating (the greenhouse effect) and 
forecasting the effects on the environment, presuppose an 
intense use of the APE, also in view of the unification of all 
the authorities to form a national climatic plan. Another ENEA 
initiative that is based on the advantages offered by 
supercomputing is the Mediterranean Basin Project (PBM) to 
construct and manage an ecological system made up of telematic 
computer networks and monitors, databases, and mathematical 
models of the sea and the atmosphere. The final goal is 
monitoring the environment, preventive and civil defense 
services, and the safety of commercial and civilian traffic. 
  In particular, parallel computing will be used within the 
scope of this program for the elaboration of climatic and 
weather forecasts and for the elaboration of images obtained 
both using traditional surveying instruments and the SAR 
(synthetic aperture radar) technology. 
  ENEA's more mature lines of research will also be relaunched 
thanks to the supercomputer. "There is still a lot to study 
about the phenomena of combustion if we want to improve 
efficiency and limit the production of pollutants. And also in 
this case we have started a research line to simulate the 
processes using parallel computing. Without forgetting the 
possibilities offered by the cycles of nuclear fission that are 
alternatives to uranium, such as those of thorium proposed by 
the Bowman group of Los Alamos, with whom the ENEA has already 
started to cooperate," concludes Cabibbo.

<F P=106> [Article by Philippe Guichardaz: "Crisis Spares Military </F>
Data Processing Systems"] 
  [Text] Budget restrictions do not seem to be hitting the 
data processing sector of the French Defense Establishment 
(other than materiel, of course). But French suppliers must 
regroup and team up with other Europeans to be competitive on 
the international armament markets, especially in dealing with 
the Americans. 
  The Western countries, including France, have been reducing 
their military expenditures ever since the end of the Cold War. 
But these rather melancholy cuts do not nip at all of the 
components of the defense budget in a uniform manner. Some 
weapon programs are being scaled back or even dropped; on the 
other hand, the data processing sector of the Defense 
Establishment seems to be going full speed ahead in the 
technical, operational, and logistic sense, it seems. 
  "The enemy has vanished now that the Soviet Bloc has broken 
up. Now there is a big question mark dangling over weapons 
systems that were designed to counter that threat. On the other 
hand, the ability to master, process, and transmit information 
becomes vital for a modern army, based on mobility and 
efficiency, particularly in a tight budget context," noted 
Pierre Audoin, president and general manager of Pierre Audoin 
Conseil Consultants. In other words, it is better to have a few 
well-equipped ships that can respond to a missile attack in a 
matter of seconds with the help of highly-perfected data 
processing and command-control systems, rather than to have a 
big, but underequipped fleet. 
  "The Falkland War and then the Gulf War took place in highly 
heterogeneous environments where it is sometimes a rather 
delicate matter to tell friend from foe. Besides, you have to 
know how to handle the logistics of an army that moves in 
distant theaters of operation, such as, for example, supplying 
them with spare parts for aircraft. That explains the tendency 
toward the development of big command and logistics systems," 
commented Francois Dufaux, director-general of the Sema Group, a 
French-British service company which has a strong presence in 
command-control systems, particularly for the navy. 
<H5>  Software -- The Very Heart of Systems </H5>
  Software is from now on in the very heart of new weapons 
systems. Any organization of ground forces, naval forces, or air 
forces is based on it. The complete data processing system used 
in the Leclerc tank (data preparation and processing) accounted 
for between 10 and 15 percent of its total cost; in the old 
days, a tank had very little in the way of data processing 
equipment. A central command system accounts for between five 
and six percent of the price tag on a frigate. This, by the way, 
is the field where Sema Group in 1989 was able to get its hands 
on a Fr400 million contract with the Royal Navy; this was one of 
the biggest contracts ever awarded in Europe in the field of 
data processing engineering. The command systems used in the 
Royal Navy's frigates were based on more than 280 distributed 
processors and on a storage capacity of more than 1,500 
megaoctets. Business deals like this one, spreading out over 
several years, make it possible to look far ahead quite calmly 
at a time when civilian contracts are shrinking in terms of 
number and duration. 
  Still, the French data processing market for the Defense 
Establishment would not exceed Fr4-5 billion per year, excluding 
materiel. But it is difficult to identify it since it is rooted 
in the much more vast area of defense electronics. This market 
is mostly dominated by four companies: the Sema Group, whose 
Defense Establishment activities grew from 18 percent to 23.3 
percent of its business volume between 1991 and 1992; Syseca, an 
affiliate of the Thomson Group, which makes 600 million in the 
defense data processing field out of a total business volume of 
Fr1.6 billion; Matra Cap Systemes, sprung from last February's 
merger of Cap Sesa Defense and Matra MS2i, which should do about 
Fr950 million worth of business this year; finally, there is 
Dassault Electronique. 
  In the opinion of Michel Cochy de Moncan, who heads Defense 
and Aeronautical Activities at Syseca, with a business volume 
that has been growing between six and seven percent per year for 
the past three years, "the French data processing market for the 
Defense Department is certainly not tremendous, but it has some 
nice days ahead of it, because the complexity of weapons systems 
and the volume of data to be processed keep growing constantly." 
Yves Veret, president and general manager of Matra Cap Systemes, 
believes that "the French cruise missile program entails a 
rather considerable increase in the on-board data volume, 
especially as regards cartography." As to possible simulation of 
nuclear tests rather than physical shots on computers, that is a 
matter of great concern to suppliers such as the Sema Group. The 
lack of growth on certain civilian markets for service companies 
is thus not paralleled in military matters. "As a matter of 
fact, we diversified our systems integration markets, 
particularly in regard to the military sector; that enabled us 
to withstand the crisis much better," commented Francois Dufaux. 
Moreover, being a sensitive sector, the French market here 
benefits from protection against the American competition. 
  But the Defense Establishment no longer is the manna from 
heaven, as it was six or seven years ago. "The military people 
are watching their expenditures very closely and they stir up 
competition to bring prices down," remarked Yves Veret. 
  Fortunately, the drop in profit margins was partly made up 
by 
productivity gains resulting from the development of software 
(see box). Nationwide, competition is represented by certain 
data processing services and engineering companies that are 
attracted by the growth of data processing for the Defense 
Establishment. And the four leading companies, represented 
rather unevenly among the three services, are fighting among 
each other by tackling the markets on which they are weakest. 
<H5>  European Cooperation Undertakings Multiplying </H5>
  "The policy of overspecialization and excessive 
compartmentalization of resources is dangerous for French 
industry while customers demand a broad assortment," notes 
Michel Cochy de Moncan. "Two or three operators would be plenty 
on the French market," suggested Yves Heret [sic]. An effort at 
concentration thus seems inevitable. As a matter of fact, it has 
already begun and it is now expressed by the fact that big 
"military system makers" -- such as Thomson or Matra, which 
needed know-how in systems integration -- are getting together 
with data processing services and engineering companies, such as 
Syseca and Cap Sesa Defense. Likewise, Sema Group created a 
joint venture with British Aerospace and recently teamed up with 
Thomson for a combined bidding effort in Korea. 
  This strategy is designed to cope with rise in R&amp;D 
costs but 
also to develop a capacity for responding to bidding invitations 
on the European level. "Like the future French-Italian-British 
frigate, the consortiums are going to multiply in Europe, either 
temporarily or permanently. Multinational programs are bound to 
grow in view of the cost of certain programs and the budget 
restrictions now in force in all countries of the European 
Union," predicts Francois Dufaux. This feeling is shared in 
Syseca, which is participating in the French-Italian program for 
the development of a missile of the Patriot type, side by side 
with trans-Alpine manufacturers. 
  These European cooperation undertakings will also enable 
enterprises in the Old World to refrain from fighting like 
isolated units on the international markets against the 
redoubtable firms from the other side of the Atlantic. The 
latter, as a matter of fact, can come out with lower prices than 
their European counterparts on account of the size of their 
domestic market that allows them to spread the costs over large 
series, while the Europeans are restricted to their domestic 
markets. 
<H5>  [Box] </H5>
<H5>  Multipurpose Hardware (or Almost So) </H5>
  To meet the competition, data processing services and 
engineering companies in the Defense Establishment are pursuing 
a policy of reusing software both in the military/civilian sense 
and in the civilian/military sense, because these two areas 
overlap increasingly. That makes it possible to capitalize on 
the knowledge that was acquired and to safe R&amp;D funds. 
  In the software engineering field, the Concerto Shop, 
developed jointly by CNET [National Center for 
Telecommunications Studies] and the Sema Group for technical and 
scientific data processing, was used for the purpose of 
developing the command-control system of the Royal Navy's 
frigates and was picked up by the French Navy for training 
simulators on the "Le Triomphant" nuclear submarine. Looking at 
satellite image processing, Matra Cap Systemes is reusing 
military developments for Spot, the civilian Earth observation 
satellite. Finally, for crisis management systems, it is 
possible to reuse the basic "military" building blocks in 
complex civilian systems employed for crisis management in areas 
tied to pollution and the environment.

<F P=106> [Interview with Alberto Meomartini, managing director of the </F>
Italian national gas corporation, by Fabio Pavesi; place and 
date not given: "Methane Candidates Itself as the Sourcer for 
the Year 2000" -- first six paragraphs are L'IMPRESA AMBIENTE 
introduction] 
  [Text] Since there are abundant resources of natural gas 
and it is a versatile fuel, it is now in first place in the 
Italian energy portfolio. Nearly 50 billion cubic meters are 
consumed and this covers 25 percent of the national energy 
requirement. It holds a place of honor after petroleum, that 
has been won over 20 years of continual progress. The demand 
has in fact increased to its present level from 13 billion cubic 
meters in 1970. 
  Further leaps ahead are foreseen for the immediate future. 
According to forecasts made by SNAM [National Gas Pipeline 
Company], at the turn of the century about 75 billion cubic 
meters should be available to meet the domestic requirement. 
  The growth in the use of this source of energy has been 
determined by its characteristics of flexibility and high 
efficiency. It should not be forgotten that the environmental 
variable, which has become ever more important, has been one of 
the factors that has contributed to both the success and the 
multiplicity of uses of natural gas. In fact the combustion of 
methane liberates neither sulfur dioxide nor particles and 
assists in reducing (for the same amount of energy used) the 
emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile 
organic compounds. Although three quarters of the consumption of 
methane in Italy is destined to civil and industrial use, the 10 
years from 1980 to 1990 have seen the use of methane for the 
generation of electricity triplicate, and this is the sector 
where the environmental advantages of the fuel should open up 
further new opportunities for development. 
  The opportunities for the future use of methane in the road 
transport sector should also be stressed. Last July Fiat and 
SNAM signed an agreement for the perfection of an engine that is 
exclusively powered by methane. 
  The agreement, which provides for an initial funding of 10 
billion lire, assigns the definition of the logistic and 
organizational aspects of the operation to the corporation that 
forms part of the ENI [National Hydrocarbons Corporation] group. 
The medium-term goal of the operation is that a quota of 
vehicles for personal and public transport should have methane 
engines. 
  In short, there are many initiatives underway that will lead 
to a further increase in the demand for gas. 
  L'IMPRESA AMBIENTE discussed these subjects with SNAM 
Managing Director Alberto Meomartini. 
  [Pavesi] Let us start with the methane automobile. The 
largest national producer of automobiles, and the public 
corporation that essentially manages methane throughout Italy, 
have formed an alliance to create a revolutionary engine. Is 
the gasoline era coming to an end? 
  [Meomartini] No, without a doubt. There is no risk that 
gasoline will become obsolete, neither at present nor in the 
future. It would be better to say that from now on 
methane-powered vehicles will no longer be confined to the 
realms of utopia. This is the real meaning of the agreement 
that we have stipulated with Fiat. It is the signal that there 
are spaces in elected areas, in this case urban traffic, where 
the use of methane could provide an excellent concrete answer to 
environmental problems. In fact, the combustion of methane 
means increased efficiency and therefore energy saving and 
contained levels of polluting emissions, such as in the case of 
carbon monoxide, or no emission, as for sulfur dioxide and 
particles. 
  [Pavesi] Is this valid for all road vehicles? 
  [Meomartini] Theoretically, yes. However, it is necessary 
to go ahead gradually. It is clear that for automobiles and 
private transport in general, there are some rigid elements that 
are not easy to overcome, such as refueling, and autonomy over a 
distance. The agreement with Fiat focuses on public transport, 
starting with taxis and company fleets as far as automobiles are 
concerned, and also buses, of course. Iveco already produces 
buses that are exclusively powered by methane. We do not think 
that it is as important to talk about large numbers today as it 
is to talk of the high symbolic value that is behind this 
initiative. And even if we should quantify the phenomena, let 
us not forget that public transport has noteworthy incidence on 
the global level of pollution within the city. 
  [Pavesi] I suppose that the costs of these prototypes are 
not competitive. 
  [Meomartini] The cost of the vehicles will initially be 
higher. If however we look into all the dynamics of 
costs-benefits we discover that this is a half truth. On the 
other side of the balance we must put the high energy efficiency 
of the methane engine and the low cost of this fuel, as well as, 
obviously, the lower costs for the environment, that we should 
all be taking into account at last. They are all positive 
variables within the complete management plan. At Ravenna, 
where five methane-powered buses are already circulating, the 
verdicts of the administration and the population on this first 
experiment are more than flattering. 
  [Pavesi] Are you working on anything else? 
  [Meomartini] A series of contacts with the public 
administrations are underway. We are thinking of an agreement 
between Iveco and SNAM and the Emilia Romagna Region on a 
significant substitution, within a specified time, of the entire 
fleet of buses in circulation. The biggest mistake in this case 
as in other cases is to think that public opinion is the only 
retarding force against the introduction of innovative products 
onto the market, such as methane-powered vehicles. 
  Results are only obtained by starting with a constant 
comparison in which the public sector party, who is the real 
manager of the initiative, is not left alone. 
  [Pavesi] Let us come to the traditional uses of methane. How 
much has the environment contributed to the increase in 
consumption of this energy source? 
  [Meomartini] If, by the environment, we do not only mean 
minor pollution, but also the saving of resources, I would say 
that this variable has had a very important influence on the 
development of its uses. In the past natural gas was often 
considered and used only as a substitute for other fossil 
sources. In the course of the years, research has produced a 
great improvement in efficiency and energy output. 
  And this is a plus that has been appreciated more and more. 
If we add to this a combustion process that produces levels of 
pollution that are lower than those of other energy sources, the 
circle is completed. 
  [Pavesi] What form will the scene take in the year 2000? 
How will natural gas compare with other energy sources? 
  [Meomartini] Italy has reserves of over 300 billion cubic 
meters and produces between 16 and 17 billion cubic meters a 
year, which forms the basis, this quantity not having varied for 
many years. We are counting on being able to increase the flow 
of gas coming from abroad, that today accounts for about 70 
percent of the total requirement. This, thanks to an increase 
in the availability of gas from Algeria following the 
installation of a second gas pipeline across the Mediterranean 
that will allow an increase in the supply from the present 13-14 
billion cubic meters to 19 billion cubic meters in 1995, which 
becomes 23 billion when the gas purchased directly by ENEL 
[Italian Natini] The development of the consumption of natural 
gas is a worldwide characteristic. However, we cannot imagine 
that our projects can grow without limits. The entire energy 
market must have its own equilibrium, represented by balanced 
relationships between the various sources. Methane is to be 
used where it is economical and technologically more convenient. 
  In this balanced view, the greatest obstacle is that of 
fiscal politics, which through the multiplication of levies, 
weighs heavily and therefore penalizes. Another problem that 
arises during the laying of gas pipelines is that of the 
environmental norms. We are still not formally subject to an 
evaluation of the environmental impact. Despite this, the 
network of norms in our country is particularly complicated and 
bureaucratic, so much so that sometimes it really slows work 
down. It is a pity, because we in SNAM have a great and 
consolidated tradition of environmental conservation. It is 
enough to think of the gas pipeline for importation across 
countries such as Austria, the Netherlands, Germany and 
Switzerland, that as far as environmental severity is concerned 
are definitely second to none.

  [Excerpts] Rome, (ANSA) 10 Dec -- Obtaining an energy 
source that is an alternative to traditional sources, that is 
renewable and inexhaustible such as the sun, and clean. These 
are the three objectives of a research project for the 
production of hydrogen from microorganisms funded by the 
Japanese Ministry of Trade and Industry (MITI), with the 
participation of Eniricerche as the only "foreign" partner. 
Rather than being clean, the energy that it is hoped to develop 
under the project for the production of biosolar hydrogen can be 
defined as being a "cleaner." The fundamental steps of the plan 
(which is being managed by the semigovernment Japanese agency 
NEDO) include the recycling of refluent water and solid waste 
that become raw materials before the process. In addition, the 
choice of hydrogen as the fuel to be produced using 
microorganisms is part of a more wide-ranging MITI initiative 
for safeguarding the environment. The ministry's program is to 
obtain, by means of a series of coordinated measures, a 
reduction in carbon dioxide emissions which are considered to be 
one of the major causes of pollution on earth (greenhouse 
effect), at international level. Hydrogen produces water, not 
carbon dioxide, when it burns. 
  Eniricerche is taking part in the project as a member of 
RITE 
(Research Institute for Innovative Technology for the Earth) 
which manages the consortium. The other partners are all 
Japanese and include: IHI, Kubota, Tokyo Gas, Fuji Electric, 
Kajima, and NIBH (National Institute of Bioscience and Human 
Technology). Indirect and marginal participation comes from the 
University College of London, and Tokyo Agricultural University. 
Each partner is carrying out part of the project in its own 
laboratories. Eniricerche's studies focus on genetic 
engineering to improve the efficiency of hydrogen production by 
photosynthetic organisms. (passage omitted).

<F P=106> [Interview with Yves Petroff, director of the European </F>
Synchrotron Radiation Facility, by unidentified questioner: "The 
Best Source in the World" -- date and place not given] 
  [Text] [SCIENCES ET AVENIR] The synchrotron is working, the 
very first experiments are taking shape; what is your 
appreciation of the qualities of the ESRF [European Synchrotron 
Radiation Facility]? 
  [Petroff] Our machine will be the best synchrotron radiation 
source in the world for several years to come. A machine of 
equivalent efficiency will only be available in another three 
years' time in the United States (in Argonne, with a 7-GeV 
[giga-electron Volt] synchrotron) and in four years' time in 
Japan (the 8-GeV Spring Height facility). Current tests show 
that we have exceeded our aims in terms of beam quality: 
duration (27 hours instead of the forecast eight), intensity 
and brilliance, stability, and availability. The ESRF 
represents a real leap forward for European research workers. 
We are going through a very exciting period offering new 
prospects in physics and new fields of exploration. 
  [SCIENCES ET AVENIR] What are your forthcoming deadlines? 
  [Petroff] We are now installing the first of the 30 
high-performance synchrotron light lines, fed by undulators and 
wigglers which make the electrons oscillate and make it possible 
to multiply the brilliance of the beam by up to 1,000 times. We 
will open eight lines in September 1994, 10 lines a year later. 
They will on the whole be used by the scientific communities of 
the 12 countries which built the ESRF. To date, decisions have 
been made on 23 lines out of a possible 29 or 30, although some 
have been frozen for a year due to an eight percent budget cut. 
Other light lines will be installed on curvature magnets and 
purchased by organizations or countries which will have 
two-thirds of the beam time, the other third being reserved for 
the use of the ESRF. Five have already been allocated and are 
being installed (Italy, Switzerland/Norway, two for France, and 
another Italian line for an original nuclear physics 
experiment). There are therefore a dozen remaining. In all, we 
will have between 45 and 47 lines. 
  [SCIENCES ET AVENIR] Who will come to work at the ESRF? 
  [Petroff] There are many potential users; Europe is strong 
in 
this field. The first users will be the ESRF's researchers, who 
will be in charge of specialized-light lines. Of course they 
will play host to teams, but they will also have their own 
research subjects. You will not get good people if they can not 
carry out their own work. You do not develop a new piece of 
equipment, a detector, unless you yourself have an idea for an 
experiment in mind. This is the only way to avoid stagnation. 
Working at full capacity, the installation will be able to host 
around 220 research workers per week (the average duration of an 
experiment). We hope to have the machine working for 6,000 
hours per year, in other words round the clock for over eight 
months. Between 2,000 and 2,500 researchers will be able to 
share this time, which will be allocated by program committees 
mostly made up of scientists from outside the facility on the 
basis of the scientific interest of the experiments proposed, 
but avoiding too great a distortion between the country's share 
of the funding and the time allocated. 
  [SCIENCES ET AVENIR] To what scientific advances can we look 
forward? 
  [Petroff] The quality of the source is such that it makes it 
possible to envisage experiments which have been impossible 
until now. We have been able to focus the optical beam down to 
an area measuring a few square microns. We are now able to 
reproduce in the laboratory pressures of 2 million atmospheres, 
which are found at the center of the Earth or on some planets. 
However, this means working on volumes of a few cubic 
microns...hence the optical beam of a few square microns. Our 
aim is thus to tackle experiments where the material to be 
studied is of a very small size. This is often the case of 
protein crystals, of which the study by diffraction will be one 
of the ESRF's major tasks for the coming years. We have also 
been able to show that if a monochromatic beam from one of the 
ESRF's undulators is passed through a hole three microns in 
diameter, it becomes extremely coherent, featuring properties 
similar to those of a laser with a wavelength in the visible 
spectrum. This opens up new possibilities for research into 
phase transitions in alloys, surfaces, and liquids.

<F P=106> [Article by Franco Foresta Martin: "The Elettra Rays that </F>
Reveal Matter"] 
  [Text] Trieste. Elettra's light cannot be held back. A 
ray squirts outside the experimental area and gets lost on the 
dome of the elegant building. Even we can see the 
violet-colored reflections of the radiation produced 
specifically to study the microscopic details of matter, both 
organic and inorganic. We are on the Carso, in the area where 
the Elettra light machine (synchrotron light in technical terms) 
began operating a few days ago. 
  From the outside it looks like a doughnut squatting on 
lime-impregnated soil, whose round shape fits in with the beauty 
of the surroundings. 
  Inside complexity triumphs: 10 million pieces, both 
mechanical and electronic, to generate and pilot a swarm of 100 
billion electrons from which the magic radiation originates. 
  "When we turned on the machine the first time, we were not 
at 
all sure that it would work," admitted Albin Wrulich, an 
Austrian scientist who took over the direction of the project 
following the premature death of Prof. Mario Puglisi. "Then 
with great joy we saw that everything was working as it should 
and that we had even beaten all records." Elettra, in fact, is 
one of the three new synchrotron light machines in the world 
(the other two are in Berkeley and Grenoble) and all three have 
reached the finishing post almost simultaneously. The goal is 
to launch a scientific competition that should revolutionize the 
world of applied research. 
  The Synchrotron Trieste company has an exceptional 
president, 
Nobel Laureate Carlo Rubbia: "Now we have a strategic tool that 
is extremely important for scientific, industrial, and economic 
development. A machine developed using particular technical 
innovations that will enable us to observe organic and inorganic 
matter in detail." 
  The Elettra structure consists of a particle accelerator. An 
80-meter long electron cannon (LINAC [linear accelerator] fires 
its shots inside a ring with a 260-meter circumference. Here 
the electrons are accelerated by radio frequency cavities and 
forced to run along a circular trajectory by powerful magnets. 
When passing through the curved magnets and inverters the 
electrons radiate synchrotron light which is radiation with a 
very wide spectrum: from infrared to X ray. 
  "The radiation," explained Elettra Scientific Division 
Director Prof. Renzo Rosei, "is channeled into a series of lines 
that are tangential to the ring and brought to experimental 
areas where it is focused on the samples to be analyzed. The 
most appropriate wavelength for each type of research is 
selected. There are eight light lines available but there are 
plans to bring this number to 22." 
  By observing the wavelengths that correspond to the 
dimensions of the atoms and molecules, the most inaccessible 
structures of matter are revealed. 
  "The machine cost 300 billion lire, the same as two football 
fields," said Synchrotron Managing Director Giuseppe Viani. 
"Now the company is stipulating contracts with public and 
private organizations." 
<H5>  It Can Be Precious In Many Sectors </H5>
<H5>  Live Chemistry </H5>
  This is how the functions of the first light line activated 
alongside the Elettra synchrotron can be summarized. The 
scientific name of the line is "super bait." It is based on the 
principal of photoemission discovered by Nobel Laureate Siegban. 
The X ray produced by Elettra, which focuses on a sample to be 
analyzed, has the capacity to extract electrons from the various 
chemical elements that make up the sample. An analysis of the 
electrons leads to a determination of the single elements at 
play as well are their reciprocal interactions. It promises to 
have applications in the field of catalytic processes, 
corrosion, and other chemical reactions. 
<H5>  Semiconductors </H5>
  This is what is expected of the other two Elettra light 
lines 
called Vuv Photoemission and Esca. They are also based on the 
principle of extracting electrons from samples by means of 
incident X rays. The first piece of equipment, managed in 
collaboration with the CNR [National Research Council] will be 
used to design semiconductor joints and high temperature 
superconductors. The second, in collaboration with ENI 
[National Hydrocarbons Corporation], will be used to understand 
how a diamond is made. Another photoemission light line 
dedicated to gases will be used to perform a detailed study on 
the process leading to the destruction of ozone. 
<H5>  Chemotherapies </H5>
  These are one of the many applications that could emerge 
from 
the Elettra "diffractometry" light line. There are three: 
diffractometry, scattering, and aloisa. In this case the 
incident radiation is used to perform a kind of radiography of 
biological and pharmacological materials. But acquiring an 
in-depth understanding of how specific proteins and crystals 
function, it is hoped to develop pharmaceuticals that act 
selectively by depositing themselves only on sick tissues and 
avoiding other healthy organs, and bombarding using highly toxic 
chemical substances. 
<H5>  Mammography </H5>
  It is an eloquent name for a light line that has still not 
been activated but whose opening is slated for 1994. It has 
been seen that synchrotron light is one of the most effective 
methods for the early diagnosis of breast cancer. The 
wavelength of the light will be varied according to the 
dimensions of the organ under examination, thereby permitting 
50-micron tumor granules to be seen. The radiation will be 10 
times less than that absorbed using traditional equipment. The 
light line will probably be assigned to a health authority in 
the area and will be positioned on the outskirts of the Elettra 
area.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Netherlands Speeds Up Introduction </F>
of Euro-ISDN"] 
  [Text] By the end of 1994, ISDN [Integrated Services 
Digital Network] will be available for 95 percent of Netherlands 
business consumers. Prompted by the business community's high 
demand for ISDN applications, PTT Telecom is reducing the 
initially planned introduction period by nearly six months. 
  At the opening of EURIE '93, the European ISDN 
telecommunications event, held from 14 to 16 December and 
involving 17 countries, PTT Telecom announced that it is 
particularly companies with subsidiaries throughout the country 
that are requesting the fastest possible introduction of 
nationwide ISDN. 
  Since June 1993, European-standard-based ISDN has been 
available in 30 Netherlands urban areas with three-digit area 
codes. As of July 1994, it will also be available in 20 areas 
with five-digit area codes. These are the areas where demand 
for ISDN is highest. ISDN will be introduced in phases in the 
rest of the country. By the end of 1994, 95 percent of the 
country should be covered, while 100-percent coverage is 
expected by late 1995. 
<H5>  Projects </H5>
  To promote the development of ISDN, the PTT is nurturing 
various projects by allowing access to its know-how and 
resources. One of these projects involves the development of a 
radio news database by regional broadcasting stations, which 
will allow the exchange of news items with high audio quality. 
  The Netherlands Standardization Institute has started a 
pilot 
project aimed at giving its customers access to a database via 
the ISDN network. This will enable the exchange of 
standardization documents in a much faster and more efficient 
and inexpensive way. 
  The third project involves the Foundation for ISDN 
Integration.

  [Text] After the Targeted Telecommunications Project 
(PFTLC) the CNR [National Research Council] is examining the 
possibility of launching the Targeted Project for Personalized 
Communications (PFCP). The prefeasibility study, which bears the 
date 14 May 1993, traces a map of the demand and supply of 
personalized goods and services corresponding to specific needs. 
  In the sector of telecommunications services, the trend 
toward personalization is seen primarily in certain areas, such 
as the possibility of choosing from a multitude of terminals 
with ever increasing multimedia features for example. 
  Among these, the possibility of accessing a wide variety of 
network services: associating a number with a person (personal 
number), meaning that the user can maintain his own 
communication address whatever the terminal; mobility, meaning 
the possibility of communicating with people in movement; the 
possibility of performing activities (work, education, medical 
checkups etc.) even in a location that is far from the 
headquarters where the activities are based, even in one's own 
residence; personalized diffusion services (for example 
personalized television). 
  The PFCP is part of this framework and, even though it is 
directed toward developments in the area of telecommunications, 
calls for an interdisciplinary committment in all the sectors of 
computer science and engineering, including computer, 
electronic, and electromagnetic technologies. 
  The development of the project calls for synergies with 
other 
future targeted projects such as those on Materials and Devices 
for Solid State Electronics [MADESS II], Photonics, and 
Electromagnetic Compatibility. 
  The areas included in the new finalized project are 
multimedia treatment; human factors, software architecture for 
services, methods for the creation of services, the safety and 
protection of communications, circuit and electromagnetic 
technologies, radio access, propagation in certain frequency 
bands, environmental impact, and interconnecting networks. 
  Within this framework the prefeasibility study provides for 
both basic and applied research leading to six possible 
subprojects: fixed and mobile terminals, network 
infrastructures, wireless access networks, wireless local 
networks, management and planning methods, and field tesing. 
  This project will therefore be characterized by its specific 
research objectives, both because of the scientific implications 
and because of the prospects for industrial applications in the 
medium to long term. 
  The project is organized to make provision for wide-ranging 
interdisciplinary research topics. This will permit a wider 
group of research know-how from the CNR institutes, university 
departments, and industrial reseach laboratories to be involved. 
  A fact to be emphasized is the all the industrial and 
nonindustrial bodies interested in developing the PFCP are also 
the potential users of the results. As for the sharing out of 
human resources from public and private bodies, the 
prefeasibility study also provides for the quotas to be 40 and 
60 percent respectively. The PFCP project is expected to last 
five years. 
  On the basis of these evaluations, the project should call 
for an investment of 120 billion lire by the CNR, a figure that 
could vary depending on the possibile costs and the quota to be 
covered by the participating organizations. 
  As for the possible industrial spin-offs, the PFCP can 
provide all national industries in the entire information sector 
(telecommunications, computers, and microelectronics) with a 
decisive and important opporutnity to make their products 
competitive in the future. Moreover, it could become eligible 
for subsidies from the EC within the framework of European 
research projects that will be the subject of the Fourth 
Framework Program in the field of information and communications 
technologies. This would give our research world more chances 
of acquiring an important role in future projects funded by the 
European Community.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prof. Aldo Roveri, director of the National </F>
Research Council's Targeted Telecommunications Project, by 
RICERCA &amp; INNOVAZIONE; date and place not given] 
  [Text] 
  [RICERCA &amp; INNOVAZIONE] Professor Roveri, the Targeted 
Telecommunications Project is nearing completion. What were its 
principal objectives and what results have been achieved? 
  [Roveri] The principal objective was that of enabling the 
national manufacturing industry and services sector to dispose 
of new technologies necessary for the development of broadband 
communications and consequently of competing in this sector at 
international level, by taking into account the development of 
the country and the strategic choices at European level. 
  Second, to promote the training, in a highly innovative 
environment, of highly qualified technical personnel by having 
researchers from various fields and disciplines participate in a 
wide-ranging program. The results achieved on both fronts have 
been satisfactory. 
  [RICERCA &amp; INNOVAZIONE] In your opinion what are the 
advantages of passing from N-ISDN (narrowband-integratd services 
digital network) to B-ISDN (broadband-integrated services 
digital network)? 
  [Roveri] Broadband ISDN definitely has more potential 
compared to Narrowband ISDN: switching communications for 
high-speed video and data links (over 100 Mbit/sec), data 
communications without connections to connect local area 
networks (LAN) and high-speed workstations, multimedia voice, 
image, and data communications, and point-multipoint calls in 
interactive and distributed communications services. As for 
the ATM (asynchronous tranfer mode), it will be possible to use 
this both as an interface for access to B-ISDN and in the 
internal network section. ATM is the final result of 10 years 
of studies into new ways of transferring information, with 
B-ISDN viewed as a universal transport structure that is 
independent of any particular type of communication offered. 
  [RICERCA &amp; INNOVAZIONE] Professor Roveri, which are the 
new 
horizons in the world of telecommunications? 
  [Roveri] The 1990's will surely be characterized by an 
accentuated internationalization of political, economic, and 
social relations that will lead to an increase in user needs. 
  The producers will try to conquer new markets by offering 
goods and services of increasingly higher quality but at ever 
more competitive prices. I think that the future of 
telecommunications is directed toward the creation of a 
"personalized," reality that meets the needs of the single 
person rather than the mass. 
  A sharp rise in the demand for mobile sevices can be 
foreseen, services that guarantee that "ubiquity" that permits 
the user to maintain his own personalization whatever the 
terminal. This means that the user-terminal relationship, which 
is still intrinsic in the current land radio mobile service, 
will be broken. 
  The supply of such services requires a closer interaction 
between fixed network infrastructures and primarily with the 
intelligent network: One can imagine a scene where all the 
terminals will be mobile, without wires, and connected via radio 
to an antenna positioned nearby, which in turn is in contact via 
optical fibers with a telecommunications center where the 
signals will be processed. 
  [RICERCA &amp; INNOVAZIONE] What therefore, are the new 
research 
needs of this sector? 
  [Roveri] The hypothesis of a CNR [National Research Council] 
Targeted Project for Personalized Communications comes under the 
framework of a series of specific research programs currently 
being defined. 
  The study of the research topics on personalized 
communications can permit, at a national level, an important 
participation in research acitivities at international level. 
  In particular, at European level, these topics will form an 
important objective in the EC's Fourth Framwork Program, which 
is currently being drawn up. This indicates that even within 
the framework of strategies directed toward ensuring national 
industry a competitive role in the sector, the country will draw 
obvious advantages from undertaking a research project that 
focuses on personalized communications. 
  But at the same time it highlights the need for a decision 
to 
be made as soon as possible.

<F P=106> [Unsigned article: "Telecommunications Regulation in France </F>
and Europe"] 
  [Text] Through the Ministry of Posts, Telegraph and 
Telephone, France is one of the countries that is most advanced 
in the field of telecommunications in Europe. 
  The Forum on Law and Business is organizing a seminar with a 
triple objective: reviewing the stages of deregulation of 
telecommunications in Europe; anticipating its effect on the 
different segments of the market; and presenting the attitude of 
the operators concerned. The important thing here in particular 
will be to measure the real impact of opening the field up to 
competition. The British example shows what this means: After 
ten years of deregulation, BT still holds 90 percent of the 
telecommunications market on the other side of the English 
Channel, perhaps with a quasi-monopoly over local 
communications. A radical change in the regulatory setup is, of 
course, necessary so as to open telecommunications services up 
to the private sector; in the light of this, one particular 
effective opening is determined by the existence of authorities 
charged with daily monitoring compliance on the part of the 
competition. Along with Bruno Lasserre, director of the 
Directorate of General Regulation, Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications, Maev Sullivan, of Mercury Communication, the 
BT challenger, an official from the Brussels Commission, and 
Joachim Scherer, a professor at Frankfurt University, will share 
their experiences.

<F P=106> [Article by Maciej Kociecki, director, Office of Additional </F>
Services at Polish Telecommunications Ltd (S.A. = Ltd)] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Characteristics of POLPAK Network </H5>
  The public teleinformation network "POLPAK" has been built 
with equipment of the French firm ALCATEL CIT and is entirely 
compatible with the international CCITT X.25, X.75, X.28, X.32 
standards. 
  The POLPAK network consists of 18 exchange offices located 
in 
Poland's principal cities (Warsaw, Katowice, Krakow, Lublin, 
Wroclaw, Poznan, Szczecin, Gdansk, Olsztyn, Bialystok, Biala 
Podlaska, Rzeszow, Nowy Sacz, Bielsko, Lodz, Jelenia Gora, 
Zielona Gora, Koszalin). The total capacity of this network is 
1200 ports. Its management center is located in Warsaw. At this 
time the network has 4 analog direct (X.75) links to the U.S.A. 
France, Germany, Great Britain respectively and more than 40 
tandem links to practically the whole world. Sequential 
connections are made in the coordinating channel. Subscribers to 
the POLPAK network can be connected to it directly through a 
permanent line or remotely through a switched telephone or telex 
network. In the case of synchronous direct links (X.25) the 
transmission speed is up to 9600 bit/s and in the case of 
asynchronous ones (X.28) the transmission speed is 600 bit/s, 
1200 bit/s, or 2400 bit/s. Remote subscribers can in the case of 
synchronous transmission (X.32) count on a speed of 2400 bit/s, 
in the case of asynchronous transmission the speed also being 
2400 bit/s. 
  The transmission speed along international links is now 9600 
bit/s, but plans for transmission at a speed of 64 kbit/s have 
already been purchased. The throughput capacity of the exchange 
offices is 1400 packets per second. 
  Basic technical parameters of the POLPAK network: standard 
packet length - 128 symbols standard frequency of packet receipt 
confirmation - every second packet maximum number of closed 
groups of users a subscriber can belong to - 3 large selection 
of network facilities access by authorization only to 
subscribers with necessary identifiers. 
  As has already been indicated, the POLPAK network covers the 
entire country and, through international links with packet 
networks in other countries, facilitates data transmission to 
and from practically all subscribers to these networks 
worldwide. Unlike other telecommunication services, moreover, 
the rate for switched virtual connections within the "POLPAK" 
network does not depend on the distance between subscribers. The 
bill for calls depends on the time of day: It is much smaller 
for calls made during night hours and non-business days. 
Therefore data transmission is cheaper over a packet network 
than over leased or telephone lines, especially when the 
distances are longer. The advantages of the "POLPAK" network are: 
  - certainty of error-free data transmission 
  - possibility of transmitting data of various lengths and at 
various speeds 
  - possibility of protecting data against unauthorized access 
from outside 
  - availability of network facilities such as closed groups 
of 
users 
  - blockage of incoming and outgoing calls 
  - possibility of reverse charging 
  - automatic readdressation of calls 
  - transmission of brief messages (alarms) 
  - access to network for mobile subscribers 
  - negotiation of transmission parameters 
  If very high reliability is required, a subscriber can 
become 
a multiple one. Such a subscriber is connected to at 
least two POLPAK exchange offices. When there is trouble in one 
of them, the subscriber can continue making and taking calls. 
Using the POLPAK network, the subscriber can thus communicate 
with any other subscribers at any time. 
<H5>  Outlook for Development of "POLPAK" Network </H5>
  Development of the POLPAK packet switching network will be 
oriented toward its technical characteristics and availability 
of services. Improvement of technical characteristics and 
better coverage of Poland's territory will be achieved in 
several steps. The first step will be installation of new 
exchange offices in cities such as Bydgoszcz, Radom, Kielce, and 
Czestochowa. In other cities requiring it (like Warsaw, Gdansk, 
or Katowice) growing into larger clusters, there will be 
installed X.25 concentrators. The second step will be raising 
the speed of digital interoffice or intranetwork transmission 
between the POLPAK's principal exchange offices to 64 kb/s. 
  Toward the end of 1995 there will be started up a digital 
skeleton (tandem) network with 2 Mbit/s capability covering 
Poland's principal cities and operating by the Frame Relay 
protocol. It is to be kept in mind however that, from the user's 
point of view, access to the network at the 9.6 kb/s level will 
for X.25 subscribers still remain the principal bottle 
neck for a rather long time, because of the characteristics 
of the existing access network, even though channels with 64 
kb/s capacity will be made available to users wherever a city 
network is in good technical condition. One way to avoid 
problems of the access network will be the planned hand-over by 
the Polish Telecommunications Ltd of their VSAT terminals. The 
user of such a terminal will be able not only to reach the 
POLPAK network, and a maximum speed of 64 kb/s to wit, but also 
to build private networks with the aid VSAT facilities. 
  The only services now provided by the POLPAK network are

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Nanocomposites With Improved </F>
Mechanical Properties"] 
  [Text] A project to develop nanocomposite ceramics with 
improved mechanical properties is being led by a research group 
at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, under 
European funding. 
  Nanocomposite structures consist of inclusions of an inert 
phase, such as 5 volume percent of 10 nanometer particles of 
silicon carbide, in a conventional ceramic matrix such as 
alumina or silicon nitride. The improvement in strength 
obtained can be dramatic the researchers say. For example, 
alumina can be strengthened from 300 megapascal to 1500 
megapascal, and its toughness, hardness, creep resistance and 
Weibull modulus are also increased. 
  The objective of the proposed work is to establish a more 
systematic understanding of nanocomposite structures in terms of 
mechanisms and processing paths so that full advantage can be 
taken of the property enhancements. 
  Other partners in the programme are the University of 
Limerick in Ireland, the University de Valenciennes et du 
Hainaut-Cambresis in France, and the Centre de Recherche de 
l'Industrie Belge de la Ceramique in Belgium. The project will 
last for three years.

  [Text] The Fiat Research Center (CRF) database on plastic 
and metallic materials will be made available to all those who 
are interested in these topics. The new service was made 
possible thanks to the collaboration of the CFR, and the 
Supercomputing Center of Piedmont, a consortium established by 
the Piedmont regional government, the Turin provincial and 
municipal authorities, the Polytechnic, the Industrialists 
Union, Federpiemonte, and CSI of Piedmont, which works for the 
diffusion and use of computing systems and methods for the 
certification and qualification of projects and products. 
  Users can access the database via modem or via data 
transmission networks such as Internew, Decnet, and Itapac X25. 
The catalog on metals of industrial interest contains 2,000 
files with information on: materials, thermal treatments, how 
tests have been performed. The files on plastic materials (over 
5,000), produced by the leading 100 companies in the world 
provide the mechanical, chemical-physical, thermal and electric 
features of the plastics listed. 
  The two tools are directed primarily to the 10,000 small and 
medium-sized Italian industries that are interested in these 
fields including designers, components companies, and research 
institutes to whom they offer information that will be 
constantly updated, that will state how materials respond to 
tests, and that compare the performance of various materials. 
For example, tests on metallic materials have been developed to 
provide, in addition to features of yield and hardness, the 
stress resistance properties that are necessary for designers 
and those testing mechanical instruments and structures 
submitted to variable dynamic loads. The CRF databases will 
soon be translated into English.

  [Text] Four extremely advanced Russian jet engines are on 
the benches of the Proel laboratories in Florence. They are 
being studied to learn the secrets of this Russian technology, 
and integrate it with that of Proel (Alenia-Finmeccanica), 
thereby leading to the creation of an all-Italian propulsion 
system. 
  The Russian engines, produced by the Fakel company, are of 
the electroionic plasma type. The molecules of a gas (xenon), 
are ionized inside them and brought to a high temperature. They 
leave at high velocity, generating the thrust. These engines 
have an extremely high efficiency and this makes them ideal for 
use with telecommunications satellites, both to keep them in 
their correct positions in orbit and also for making changes to 
the orbit. Chemical rockets are used at present. These require 
heavy tanks filled with hydrazine. The electrical propulsors on 
the other hand are small, light, and consume very little. This 
means that their use reduces the weight of the satellites by 20 
percent. 
  The Russians have been using these propulsors for 20 years. 
However, because the construction technology was not very 
refined, they had the handicap of a limited life. Now that they 
have arrived in the West, they will be revised to obtain better 
results. Proel, which has already acquired precious experience 
with the similar technology of the electronic gun for the 
Tethered satellite and with the development of neutralizers for 
the German ionic engine Rit, is now developing a project for a 
completely Italian engine to be used on future satellites. 
  Company president Marco Gerevini stated that: " We have 
received a contract from the ASI [Italian Space Agency], valued 
at 8.5 billion lire, to perfect this new technology within 28 
months." 
  Designer Gianfranco Cirri added that: "About 20 billion lire 
will then be needed to build a prototype to fly. All the parts 
for this could come from Proel."

<F P=106> [Article by Giovanni Caprara: "Green Light for the Made in </F>
Italy Launcher"] 
  [Text] The program for an Italian launcher for small 
scientific, commercial, and military satellites weighing between 
500 and 1,000 kilograms is valid when the international market 
for launchers, in which the Italian carrier could play a 
positive role, is taken into consideration too. This briefly is 
the direction that has come from the commission that was 
nominated by Research Minister Umberto Colombo at the beginning 
of August to settle the confusion that had arisen around this 
question after the ASI [Italian Space Agency] had launched a 
program with this goal. 
  The commission, which is presided over by Sergio Ristuccia, 
a 
magistrate from the Corte dei Conti [State Audit Court] and 
comprises Francesco Carassa, former ESA [European Space Agency] 
board president, Gianfilippo Cuneo, an expert in industrial 
strategy, and Alessandro Minuto Rizzo, plenipotentiary foreign 
minister, has terminated its enquiry and delivered its findings 
to Minister Colombo. 
  The ASI had planned a program with a double project. One 
being the San Marco Scout, managed by Prof. Luigi Broglio and 
funded with 90 billion lire, with the goal of developing the 
American Scout launcher of Loral (the former LTV) that has been 
used up to the present time at the San Marco platform in Kenya. 
The other has been assigned to BPD-Spazio of the Gilardini-Fiat 
group with an initial funding of 120 billion lire. This 
provides for the construction of the Vega rocket (an advanced 
generation European carrier) and is centered on the development 
of the elements that have come from the experience gained from 
the auxiliary rockets produced for the Ariane carrier. A 
prototype of the new Zefiro engine (that is part of the Vega) 
was flown in Sardinia in 1992 and a second model was subjected 
to successful ground tests last May. 
  The conclusions of the commission express a negative 
evaluation of the plan that was supported by Broglio, because it 
would finish with Italian money paying for the improvement of an 
American launcher that would remain such, whilst the advantages 
for Italy would be few, if not inexistent. 
  However the commission judged the development of an 
industrial project favorable because it would permit the growth 
of a technology from which strategic economic and market 
advantages could be gained. This would provide a know-how that 
would also make our country competitive in the emerging sector 
of space transportation of small satellites. 
  The commission had to evaluate whether or not the Italian 
initiative was valid on both an internal and international 
level, so as to supply the Ministry of Research, which must 
choose how to direct the Italian space effort, with objective 
information. Now that the commission has supplied the 
preliminary information, the current situation makes it 
necessary to make a rapid decision, because a delay would 
provoke the annulment of the evaluations expressed. As a matter 
of fact the market for small launchers is developing rapidly and 
as well as various projects put forward by countries like Spain 
and Brazil that are far from the goal, there are others in the 
United States (such as those of the OSC [Orbital Sciences] and 
Lockheed) that have just arrived on the launching ramp, or that 
will arrive in 1994 and 1995. India is also testing its 
launcher and Japan has had one for years and is now developing 
one (the M-5) that is even more powerful. The French have also 
decided to do something, even if up to now they have not made 
any precise plans. We have lost two precious years. Another 
almost unproductive year would be fatal, as we would arrive too 
late on a market that had already been conquered by others. 
  As far as the cost (estimated at about 400 billion lire) is 
concerned, it is evident that the best solution would be to 
involve foreign partners that would assure a reduction of the 
investment adapting it to the tightness of current budgets and 
also providing an increased force on the market. However, such 
adhesions need to be organized quickly so as to protect the 
primary role of the Italian space industry that must be involved 
in its entirety. 
  Within the strategies that have already been indicated by 
Minister Colombo, the effort for the construction of a launcher 
could consolidate the potential that has already been expressed 
with success in the sector (by Ariane and IRIS [Italian Research 
Interim Stage]). This would guarantee acquiring a transport 
system for which there is already a certain amount of 
competition since it would have commercial spin-offs in the 
short term that cannot be ignored. It is precisely this aspect 
that would serve to balance the nature of the initiatives that 
have been supported up to now by the ASI, including 
telecommunications and scientific satellites, and the manned 
Columbus laboratory.

  [Text] There is no specific EC funding program for 
aeronautical research and the aeronautical industries have been 
far from privileged in the Fourth Framework Program for 
research. This is the underlying theme of a series of meetings 
that Germany and Italy are conducting with the European 
Commissions. As a result of these meetings, a letter has been 
sent from the European Aerospace Industry Council to the vice 
presidents of the European Commissions. This issue of AIR PRESS 
refers to the aforementioned letter. 
<H5>  A Text that is Worse than the Last </H5>
  In particular, it has been pointed out that despite the fact 
that the aeronautical sector is of strategic importance, the 
Fourth Framework Program has continued to privilege computer 
science, telecommunications, and information systems. Our AIA 
(Association of Aerospace Industries) has also underlined this 
fact in memoranda that have been delivered, after meetings in 
Brussels, to Vice Presidents Antonio Ruberti and Vanni 
D'Archirafi, to the plenipotentiary minister and deputy 
permanent representative Rocco Antonio Cangelosi, to Ambassador 
Enzo Perlot, who is Italy's permanent representative to the 
European Community. These three sectors absorb 36 percent of 
the ECU10.9 billion in funding budgeted under the so-called 
"first action." ECU1.8 billion have been set aside for 
industrial technologies listed in descending order of priority. 
However, while it is true that under this item there is a 
section dedicated to advanced propulsion technologies that could 
also have some aeronautical interest, there also seems to be 
very little space dedicated to activities and research that are 
not closely tied to propulsion. It would be very fragmentary 
for the aeronautical industries to carry out research programs 
that were dedicated solely to propulsion, as emerges now from 
the original test produced by the Commission. 
  The Fourth Framework Program could also involve the 
aeronautical sector, although it does not do so specifically. 
Not only is there no section entitled "Aerospace," but as the 
AIA pointed out during their meetings in Brussels, as far as 
they are concerned the text of the fourth program is even worse 
than that of the Third Framework Program. This must be 
considered within the context that Europe is spending almost two 
percent of its gross internal product on research, whilst the 
United States and Japan are spending three percent. 
  What, basically, is being asked for? Approval of structural 
community funding is being requested to maintain and develop 
capacities, both in the high technology areas and for the "dual 
use" technologies and production methods. This is not all. 
These funds could also contribute to the improvement and 
reinforcement of the structure of the aeronautical industry, 
supporting such initiatives as the definitive integration of the 
EC reconversion program (Konver) with funding during the coming 
years. At the same time, the provisions that have been made to 
improve the technological level and to create adequate 
infrastructures and training, should not be forgotten. 
  Increased collaboration between the national aerospace 
research bodies of the nations forming the European Community 
was called for at Aerodays, the meeting held in conjunction with 
the EC conference on aeronautical research held in Naples at the 
beginning of October. The structural funds should also provide 
an incentive for this increased collaboration. The goal should 
be a single European body aiming to exploit aeronautical 
research, a sort of "European NASA" that could work alongside, 
or even become part of, the European Space Agency without 
excluding a possible unification that would also involve the 
technical certification bodies and the air traffic control 
authorities. The European certification norms (JAR), were 
mentioned during the meetings and in the Brussels memorandum, as 
a good example of coordinated EC action and as a hopeful symbol 
for further movement toward a single European authority that 
would avoid the useless duplication of costs for construction 
companies. 
  Industries that are above a national level are nothing new. 
For example Italy is involved in the Tornado, ATR, and EFA 
[European Fighter Aircraft] programs. These have provided an 
experience that has been consolidated and can serve as an 
intermediate step to programs that will promote EC technologies. 
The nucleus of industrial restructuring and of research at a 
European level, could be based on these, making it easier to 
breech the gap between basic research and development 
activities. All this should be regarded as a response to the 
technological challenges of the near future that will come 
primarily from across the Atlantic. 
<H5>  And Us? </H5>
  From Europe to Italy. How does Italian industry present 
itself in this context, and what possibilities does it have in 
Europe at this time when it is fighting for its own survival? 
Still on the subject of the Brussels meetings, it is to be 
noted that, no plans have yet been put forward for the revision 
of the funding mechanism for research. On the contrary, for 
example, such revision has already been started in France, where 
there has been a noteworthy increase in the funding for research. 
  The problem of the exportation of military materials, that 
is 
serious for Italy, could be resolved by the EEC. The effective 
results of the automatisms of Law No. 185 of 1990, which 
regulates the exportation of defense products, seem to have been 
greater than were intended by the legislator, and have placed 
Italy in a position of net disadvantage when compared with other 
democratic countries, starting with those of Europe. Here is an 
opportunity to adopt export restrictions based on decisions that 
have not been taken nationally, but at a community level, with 
reference to Article 113 of the Treaty of Rome. Furthermore, 
the extension of the regulations that the EEC is applying to the 
exportation of "dual use" materials, to all defense products, 
would give Italian industry the same support that the other 
European nations have.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Francois Bigay, Eurocopter president </F>
and general manager, by Jean-Pierre Casamayou and Christel 
Tardif; place and date not given: "We Are Conducting 
Negotiations on the Equivalent of 100 Cougars."] 
  [Text] 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] Does the rapid-fire signing of two 
contracts 
dealing with 20 Cougar Mk I for Turkey and 17 Cougar Mk II for 
the Netherlands mean that the military market is beginning to 
pick up again? 
  [Bigay] With the help of these two contracts, we will 
probably regain our share of the market during the years prior 
to the Gulf War in 1993. But we cannot draw any conclusions from 
that as to the total volume of the military market. 
  What we can see is that there was first of all a partial 
reorientation of the market toward very heavy attack 
helicopters, like the Apache. This happened rather 
paradoxically, at that, since the frontal threat in the center 
of Europe has disappeared and because this is currently 
reflected by the switch from highly specialized helicopters 
toward more multirole helicopters. That is the way the 
development trend is going in Germany between the PAH-2 and the 
UHU, which is the German version of the Tigre. A certain number 
of countries have procured very heavy and highly sophisticated 
helicopters for themselves and they will probably have trouble 
getting their money's worth out of them. Our response to that 
market obviously is the Tigre. Unfortunately, the latter is 
currently not available on the market and we have not been able 
to participate in the competitions. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] Are you afraid of American competition on 
these markets? 
  [Bigay] It is obvious that the cut in the United States 
defense budget persuaded American builders to increase their 
export share in an effort to hold on to those sectors in which 
they were strong; the export business has not been one of their 
priorities so far. The first expression of this American 
aggressiveness was the involvement of authorities at a very high 
level, much more so than was ever done in the past. 
  France, more so than other countries in Europe, took some 
time to react to that. Today, the various persons in charge in 
our respective countries realize that being technically and 
financially good was no longer enough to walk away with the big 
contracts. From here on in, you have to be able to come up with 
financing plans equivalent to those of our competitors and, 
above all, you have to show that France has a strong political 
interest in getting the contract signed. 
  French officials are now fully aware that if we stand 
together and if we dedicate ourselves to our industry in a 
sector where it is competitive and strong, then the chances of 
an even fight and victory in the end is within reach. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] You were talking about the French 
Government. 
But what is the position of the German Government? 
  [Bigay] The two contracts we just got involve Cougars which 
are exported under French law. We have had the unfailing support 
of our chief shareholder, that is, Aerospatiale, and it is 
entirely normal that we should have the support of the French 
authorities. Of course, we have been having a certain amount of 
trouble from the German authorities regarding everything that 
has to do with armament export policy. But we have so far not 
suffered too much as a result of that, of course, to the extent 
that we do not have any deal in the final stage that would 
involve equipment exported under a German license. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] You are involved in other negotiations 
in a 
certain number of other countries. What kind of volume do they 
represent? 
  [Bigay] As for realistic business deals, we are currently 
conducting negotiations on the equivalent of the 100 Cougars. 
And then, of course, there is the British competition over the 
supply of 91 attack helicopters, a challenge we took up with a 
particular version of the Tigre. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] On that score, you received the British 
Defense Minister at Marignane. Did you submit your proposal to 
him? 
  [Bigay] Eurocopter responded to the British bidding 
invitation with a model of the Tigre that is very close to the 
French antitank version and the German UHU version. As we told 
Minister Malcom Rifkind, the broad outlines of our proposal also 
point to involvement of British industry (through British 
Aerospace) covering the entire service life of the complete 
Tigre program. By the way, British industry is already 
associated with the Tigre program in a very significant fashion 
since it is participating in the design of the MTR 390 motor and 
the Trigat missile. In addition to responsibility for specific 
equipment to be used in the British version, we entrusted it 
with the straightforward production of the aft portion of the 
fuselage and the armament fins. 
  The end of this century is a unique opportunity for putting 
in place common and interoperable military resources in Europe. 
The current competition is an opportunity for Great Britain to 
get back in since it withdrew from the NH-90 when Sikorsky took 
out a partnership in Westland. Besides, if it were possible to 
arrive at interoperability between the German, French, and 
British armies, the costs of the program, especially in the 
matter of logistics (basic and advanced training, maintenance, 
etc.) would be greatly reduced. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What are the strong points of Tigre as 
compared to its competitors? 
  [Bigay] Generally speaking, looking at our real competitors, 
Tigre features a technology that is between 20 and 25 years 
younger. All you have to do is to go back 25 years to realize 
that the technical evolution is quite considerable here. We are 
getting equivalent and even higher performances from a lighter 
helicopter as far as antitank weapons systems are concerned. 
  As for the industry aspect, we went for a long-term policy 
with real partnerships, not a short-term solution that, for 
example, would be based on licensing. We should view the 
European alliances in the form of a partnership and not in the 
subcontracting format. We tried to get the best combined effort 
and we think that this association with British Aerospace is one 
of the best we could put together to the extent that we 
supplement each other. We have competence in helicopters, 
British Aerospace is competent in handling big orders, in 
managing systems, and in the processing of important business 
deals in logistic terms with the Ministry of Defense. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] The British specifications mention 
industrial 
production in 1998, whereas the Tigre program looks to 1999... 
  [Bigay] Mr. Francois Leotard answered that question and 
assured us that the Tigre program would be continued without 
delay and that France was prepared to go for industrial 
production by the date necessary to meet the British demand. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What about the Netherlands' project to 
procure 
attack helicopters? 
  [Bigay] The competition has not been started as yet. When it 
does start, Eurocopter will pick up the challenge. In the more 
or less well-informed press, I read that they were about to buy 
75 Apaches on sale. All I can say on that score right now is 
that we were not consulted. I think nevertheless that the 
purchase of 75 helicopters will require real and proper 
consultation. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] Do you think that the NH-90 program 
which was 
recently attacked in a parliamentary report is threatened? 
  [Bigay] The '94 budget provides the sums of money necessary 
to develop the NH-90 program as planned. I do not think that it 
is threatened, nor could it be threatened by the new planning 
law. One must not forget that this program involves seven 
different armies and that we are now in a period where no 
European country has the means for developing its own product, a 
time when cooperative efforts are necessary to share the burden 
of financing new products and, thereafter, to share the 
ownership costs. I am confident that if the program were to be 
examined once again, we would arrive at the same conclusions as 
those that led to its launching. Perhaps, we may nevertheless 
have to improve certain points in the decision-making procedure. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What results do you estimate for 1993? 
  [Bigay] The '93 and '94 results were held down by the lack 
of 
orders in '92 and at the start of this year. The business we 
picked up in '93 will add up to a business volume in '95 and 
'96. I estimate that our total business volume will once again 
drop 10&percnt; when compared to '92; the operating result will 
not be 
as good as anticipated, but it will be balanced and the final 
result will probably be negative. This is because of the trouble 
we are going to run into with our civilian operator customers 
who are suffering tremendously as a result of this crisis. Out 
of our 30 French operators just a couple of years ago, only half 
are still operational today. But if we were to implement 
stricter payment terms, then we would be left with only a few. 
That, unfortunately, also applies to our foreign clients. 
  Nevertheless, regardless of the result, it will not have any 
serious impact on the company in medium-range terms. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] Are you going to continue to cut jobs? 
Is the 
establishment in La Courneuve threatened? 
  [Bigay] In 1994, we will have to tackle the situation by 
temporary measures without touching our organizational 
structure. If we should have to cut our personnel force once 
again significantly at Eurocopter France, then the existence of 
the two establishments would be in doubt. But that is no longer 
the case today. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] DASA [Deutsche Aerospace AG] is being 
restructured. Are these measures going to affect Eurocopter 
Deutschland? 
  [Bigay] Eurocopter Deutschland is managed independently of 
DASA. As for Airbus production, which was assigned to us, we 
have a commitment on the part of DASA stipulating that this 
production effort will continue to be handled through ECD 
[Eurocopter Germany] until Tigre and NH-90 start coming off the 
assembly line. 
  [AIR &amp; COSMOS] What about your cooperation with the 
Russians? 
  [Bigay] The difficulty with our Russian friends does not 
spring from any lack of new ideas. They have what it takes to 
build all kinds of helicopters. The difficulty resides in 
putting together a viable industrial structure, that is to say, 
financing their investments on the basis of series-production 
and customer service. As of today, we cannot see any significant 
development with our partners. Their technological capacity and 
their imagination when it comes to getting into a program cannot 
be doubted. They will have cleared a decisive hurdle the moment 
they are capable of organizing an industrial helicopter company 
with a complete economic cycle. 
  I cannot see any sense in multiplying our alliances with the 
Russians today. 
<H5>  17 Cougar Helicopters for the Netherlands </H5>
  They finally dropped the other shoe. The Dutch Air Force 
(RNLAF) or, more precisely, the future Mobile Brigade of the 
Netherlands will be equipped with AS 532 U2 Cougar MkII 
helicopters as of 1996. The contract is worth about 1.4 billion 
francs [Fr] and calls for the delivery of 17 craft; it was 
signed this Friday, 29 Oct 93, by Ton Frinking, secretary of 
state for defense of the Netherlands, and Jean-Francois Bigay, 
president of Eurocopter. The deliveries will be spread out from 
January 1996 until the middle of 1997. 
  This contract includes a big industrial cooperation program 
accounting for 120&percnt; of the sales figure. These 
compensations 
will be spread out over 12 years and will, in particular, relate 
to the involvement of Dutch industry in the manufacture of 
Cougar, in the development of elements intended for the Tigre, 
EC 120, and EC 135 programs, but also a boost in Dutch 
participation in the NH-90 program (currently handled to the 
extent of 26.9&percnt; by Agusta, 24&percnt; by ECD, 
42.4&percnt; by ECF 
[Eurocopter France], and 6.7&percnt; by Fokker). Beyond these 
helicopter activities, the program also calls for technology 
transfers, subcontracting, and miscellaneous aeronautical 
purchases, plus related high-tech activities (cars, shipping, 
chemistry, etc.).

Researchers Force Supercomputer Breakthrough"] 
  [Text] Seven researchers, most of whom are from Flanders, 
may have achieved a breakthrough in the application of 
non-linear optics. They have found organic molecules which are 
able to cling onto light frequencies and which can convert red 
light into blue light. The molecules, derived from the retina, 
could become carriers for nonlinear photon transfer, opening up 
major new perspectives for information processing. 
  Photons, the basic carriers of light, are infinitely faster 
than the electrons that are now massively used in the world of 
information technology. The change from electrons to photons 
could usher in the new fifth generation of supercomputers. It 
could also give a whole new impetus to the artificial 
intelligence and robotics sector. 
  Andre Persoons, professor of the biological chemistry 
laboratory at the Catholic University of Leuven, announced the 
breakthrough in a speech. Yesterday's scientific journal 
SCIENCE published the paper written by Persoons and his research 
team on new organic photon-carrier materials. Persoons' 
coauthors on the paper were Koen Clays, E. Hendrickx, M. Triest, 
T. Verbiest, C. Dehu, and J.L. Bredas. 
  The research at Leuven University is carried out in 
association with Philips. Many large companies are currently 
doing research into nonlinear optics, with the realization that 
this could be the major breakthrough into the next generation of 
computers. It would represent not only a massive increase in 
data transfer speed, but also the elimination of heat 
generation. In addition to Philips, other companies such as ICI 
[Imperial Chemical Industries], Eastman Kodak, AKZO [General 
Potassium and Salt Company], Ciba- Geigy, Hoechst, IBM, Enichem, 
and Hitachi have all increased their research budgets for 
nonlinear optics. 
  Mr. Persoons claims that the discovery that certain proteins 
from the retina (bacteriorhodopsin, abbreviation bR) have this 
very special reaction to light, may represent a breakthrough in 
the application of nonlinear optics. The current mineral 
semiconductors that are used as electron carriers are very 
complex and expensive to manufacture, since the crystal 
structure of the mineral has to be physically altered. 
  The use of an organic material as carrier, in this case for 
photons, would also substantially reduce the cost to manufacture 
such elements. The chemistry is such that it is simple to 
manufacture large amounts of this organic material, such as the 
retina-based protein bR, for example, by producing analogues of 
the molecule.

<F P=106> [Article by "JB": "Holographic Grating for Environmental </F>
Analysis and Laser Work. Optoelectronic Devices Can Become 
Smaller and Less Expensive/Resolution of 0.3 Nanometer"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--Holographic gratings are optical 
microstructures that can be used in numerous ways in optical 
measuring systems and in laser equipment. The Berlin Institute 
for Optics GmbH [Limited Liability Company] (Rudower Chaussee 5, 
12484 Berlin) has developed new kinds of holographic gratings 
that can be used in spectrometers for environmental analysis and 
for optimization of the application of high-power lasers. 
  As Dr. Christel Budzinski reports, optical microstructures 
like holographic gratings can be fabricated by processes that 
come from microelectronics. They include photolithography and 
dry etching. Holographic gratings can help to reduce the size of 
optoelectronic devices. The cost of these devices can also be 
lowered by the use of gratings. 
  Spectrometers in the field of environmental analysis are an 
application possibility. Incident light is split up spectrally 
and analyzed in spectrometers. These instruments have to be 
especially lightweight and compact if they are used in 
satellites for remote sensing, for determination of the state of 
terrestrial vegetation, for example. 
  A grating from Berlin specially developed for this purpose 
can help here. The spectrometer required operates in the 
spectral region of 650 to 800 nanometers. An image of a strip of 
the earth's surface (swath) is formed by means of a lens in the 
entrance slit and is then directed to the grating, where the 
spectrum is split into individual colors. The spectrum is then 
picked up by a photodetector array (CCD) and can be analyzed. 
  Atmospheric gases and changes in them as well as the state 
of 
vegetation can be detected in this way by estimating the red 
shift of chlorophyll margins. The holographic grating is the 
chief component. It defines the precision of the measurements. 
The spectral resolution, that is, the precision with which 
individual wavelengths can be differentiated, is especially 
decisive. 
  The resolution comes to 0.3 nanometer for the grating 
developed for the remote-sensing spectrometer. This also enables 
the spatial resolution of measured values in a modified 
spectrometer. Thus, the values for a swath can be associated 
with individual elements of the earth's surface, and this 
enhances the strength of the evidence of environmental analysis. 
  Laser technology is an additional application possibility 
for 
holographic gratings. CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  lasers above all have 
recently taken on importance in medicine and in the working of 
materials. This type of laser is very efficient and can be 
handled with precision. 
  This precision is closely associated with the diameter of 
the 
laser spot. The smaller the diameter of the beam, the higher the 
energy density and the more finely detailed the work that can be 
done. Now holographic gratings can help to reduce the laser 
spot's size. However, conventional gratings fabricated by 
photolithography do not have especially high stress tolerance. 
  The gratings are ruined even at lower laser outputs. That is 
why the scientists in Berlin have fabricated holographic 
gratings by means of a molding process and with copper as the 
substrate. These gratings have substantially higher stress 
tolerance and thus can contribute to higher precision when 
working with high-power lasers.

  [Text] Sensors: Sense and Comprehension 
<H3>  Intelligent Systems Revolutionize Automotive, Environmental, 
and Medical Engineering </H3>
  Hans-Hermann Braess has a bold vision. The research director 
at the BMW (Bayerische Motoren Werke) hopes "to duplicate man's 
unbelievable sensory abilities with technical sensors." 
  The further notion that components needed for such sensors 
"should not cost more than a few marks," seems to make him 
definitely a dreamer. Yet his vision is already close to 
becoming a reality. 
  With the aid of microelectronics, sensor technology has been 
thrust into an entirely new dimension. Today tiny sensors can 
already touch, taste, see, and hear. They measure position, 
pressure, angular speed, and humidity, or aid in analysis of 
chemical concentrations. These midgets are, moreover, much 
cheaper than conventional measuring sensors. While a 
conventional sensor recording the electrical conductivity of 
liquids costs about 400 DM, its microelectronic descendant can 
already be purchased for down to 10 DM. 
  This rapid price reduction has been made possible by known 
silicon processing techniques. Just as in the production of 
microelectronic chips, several hundreds of sensors can be 
simultaneously mounted on one wafer: a disk of the size of a 
beer cap. 
  Most progress microsensor engineering has made in the 
automobile industry. Already in the middle nineteen seventies 
Mercedes-Benz and BMW began making the automobile more 
intelligent by use of sensors. Neither antilock braking system 
nor electronic transmission control and also air bags would be 
conceivable without microsensors. For their de luxe limousines, 
moreover, Mercedes-Benz and BMW have also advanced the 
development of sympathetic shock absorbing systems so far that 
they are ready for the production line. Aided by a small 
acceleration sensor, the computer in the vehicle recognizes the 
road condition as well as the operating mode and then, within 
milliseconds, adjusts the drive characteristic accordingly. 
  This is only the beginning. Automobile developers envision 
in 
the future a rainfall sensor controlling the speed of windshield 
wipers. When a child suddenly appears on the road, electronic 
microoptics will respond faster than the driver. Soon a 
miniradar could take over navigation through a fog. "Till now 
intelligence was vested in the driver only," explains 
Hans-Hermann Braess, "but today one tries to impart intelligence 
to the automobile and to thus relieve the driver of his burden." 
<H5>  High Tech </H5>
  Whether in vehicle design, process control, or environmental 
and medical engineering, the demand for bargain measuring 
sensors is increasing in leaps and bounds. While the total 
market volume of sensors worldwide already amounted to 30.6 
billion DM in 1990, projections by the VDI/VDE Technology Center 
for Information Engineering Ltd in Teltow near Berlin (VDI: 
Verein Deutscher Ingenieure = Society of German Engineers, VDE: 
Verein Deutscher Elektrotechniker = Society of German Electrical 
Engineers) indicate an increase of the volume to 65.1 billion DM 
by the year 2000. 
  This growth is attributable most of all to microsensors. 
Their share ad valorem will climb from 10.2 billion DM to 43.4 
billion DM. Whole armies of measuring "fleas" will conquer all 
areas of engineered life activities. 
  "So far the German sensor manufacturers hold a good position 
in this dynamic field" deems Walter Wiche at the Federal 
Ministry of Research and Technology (BMFT). A new assistance 
program has been unveiled by the BMFT offering financial support 
above all to small innovation-minded enterprises. 
  The pioneers in sensor technology can very well use this 
financial shot in the arm. It takes about four years for an idea 
to be converted into a marketable product. "For this one needs a 
long breath" knows Johannes Herrnsdorf, who five years ago 
together with Hans-Joachim Lilienhof has established the H.&amp; 
L. 
Planar Technology Ltd in the Dortmund Technology Park. Only now 
are these two entrepreneurs able to build up their market with 
miniaturized temperature, magnetic field, and angle sensors. 
Business director Herrnsdorf of the H.&amp; L. Planar is 
optimistic: 
"Next year we will finally find ourselves in the profit zone." 
  Yet innovations in microsensors are still advanced mostly by 
the large manufacturing firms, above all by Bosch, by both Dasa 
and AEG (General Electric Corporation) subsidiaries of 
Daimler-Benz, and by Siemens. The project developers are already 
working on second-generation sensors which will combine 
perception and comprehension, with sensors and signal processors 
integrated on one chip. Simultaneous fabrication of sensors and 
electronics is still in the experimental stage. "The 
semiconductor people become extremely anxious when etching is to 
be done on their contamination-free premises" complains Helmut 
Seidel, manager of microsensor engineering at Dasa in Munich. 
  For this reason Temic Telefunken Microelectronics Ltd, a 
joint enterprise of both Daimler-Benz subsidiaries AEG and Dasa 
established for consolidation of all microsystem activities of 
the parent corporation, is constructing its own manufacturing 
facility in its Swabian Nabern plant. Two years from now 
intelligent sensors, especially acceleration sensors, are to be 
produced in quantities up to millions of units. 
  The function they perform is based on the fundamental law 
pertaining to the moment of inertia of a body. On a silicon chip 
is etched out an almost entirely separate tiny square wafer 
which only three thin and narrow bridges connect to the 
remaining part of the structure. The position of this wafer 
changes during acceleration and during braking. Those thin 
bridges then bend so that their electrical resistance changes. 
The electronics compute that resistance and, when necessary, 
release the air bag. 
  In this way such a microsensor will in future vehicle models 
replace the present three-to-five conventional accelerometers, 
with the additional advantage that it tests itself every time 
the engine is started. 
  The Mannesmann Kienzle Ltd in Villingen-Schwenningen is 
already installing such sensors in one mass-produced device: an 
accident-data recorder used for retaining the circumstances of 
an accident. The innocent drivers can thus be readily exonerated 
and the drivers at fault need not be afraid of the others 
testifying as key witnesses. So long as it is not legally 
mandated, they may refuse to surrender their cassettes with 
relevant data.

O.5-Micron Technology"] 
  [Text] In June this year, as part of the JESSI [Joint 
European Submicron Silicon Initiative] industrial project, 
Philips, Siemens, SGS-Thomson, Matra MHS, GEC Plessey, Mietec 
[Microelectronics Technologies], and ES2 [European Silicon 
Structures] agreed to offer their clients, as of late 1993, 
common design rules for the development of their 0.5-micron CMOS 
[complementary metal-oxide semiconductors] integrated circuits 
[IC]. (Footnote 1) (The objective of the JESSI program is to 
make European semiconductor technology credible enough to win a 
respectable market share on the international scene, and above 
all to facilitate innovation in all electronics-based systems 
designed in Europe.) 
  Practical applications are now possible. Users can start 
designing 0.5-micron IC's thanks to the libraries made available 
by a number of suppliers, with so-called "relaxed" rules, so 
that an IC designed by one of them can be easily distributed 
later by another one, possibly as a second source. It is worth 
reminding that until recently, in Europe, the most advanced 
custom-made IC's were based on 0.7-micron technology. Small 
production runs of 0.5-micron custom IC's will be possible from 
April 1994, with large ones becoming possible in April 1995. 
  This "alliance at the top" is one of the consequences of the 
current good cooperation climate among the JESSI industrial 
partners, thanks to the action of JESSI President Heinz W. 
Hagmeister (the former president of Philips' IC division) and 
JESSI Vice President Guy Dumas (Matra MHS' former president). 
  This alliance confirms that what "pays" in any 
government-initiated endeavor is a long-term policy with clearly 
identified objectives. Now that JESSI has reached its mature 
stage, results will soon follow, the most significant ones being 
expected in computer-assisted design and 0.35-micron technology: 
There is today a high likelihood that the goal of a transfer to 
industry of a 0.35- micron CMOS technology that is mostly free 
of non-European components will be achieved. The European 
semiconductor industry could thus be able to offer ASIC's 
[application-specific integrated circuits] based on a 
0.35-micron technology before the end of 1996, that is, before 
the JESSI program terminates. 
<H5>  IC's as of April 1994 </H5>
  The fact that there is design rule compatibility for 
0.5-micron IC's among suppliers does not mean that the 
technologies of the participating companies are identical, apart 
from those of SGS-Thomson, Philips, and Mietec (Philips has been 
developing its technology at SGS-Thomson's Crolles [France] 
plant and Mietec is manufacturing IC's in Belgium under license 
from SGS-Thomson). For instance, SGS-Thomson's 0.5-micron, 
3.3-volt technology is characterized by double-gate transistors 
which make it as fast as the 0.7-micron, 5-volt technology. And 
the company's stacked via technology with tungsten-filled holes 
makes for increasing integration density. 
  Starting dates for the distribution of the IC's will be 
slightly different depending on the company: The 0.5-micron 
technology is being tested by SGS-Thomson-Philips, Siemens, and 
Matra MHS, while qualification -- and therefore the release of 
the final version of the 0.5-micron library cells -- is 
scheduled for early 1994. As for ES2, GEC Plessey, and Mietec, 
they will be ready a few months later. 
  ES2, for example, will finalize its compatible design rules 
during the first quarter of 1994, and will market its 0.5-micron 
library in time for customers to start designing in the second 
quarter of 1994. At the same time, ES2 will conduct the 
qualification phase of its 0.5-micron technology -- directly 
derived from the JESSI program -- until late 1994 or early 1995, 
when the first operational 0.5-micron IC's will start coming out 
of the Rousset plant.

  [Text] A Fraunhofer team headed by Dr. Andreas Weber and 
working at the Fraunhofer Institute of Coating and Surface 
Technology's Hamburg laboratory is the first in the world to 
succeed in precipitating pure, golden-colored titanium nitride 
coatings from an organic titanium compound at low temperatures. 
  Titanium nitride is the hard material most widely used to 
coat tools such as drills and milling cutters to enhance their 
mechanical resistance. It will also perform a significant role 
in future memory chip generations, where it will form the 
barrier preventing the semiconductor material, silicon, from 
diffusing into the metallic strip conductors. 
  The Fraunhofer researchers had a number of tricks up their 
sleeves: They used tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium as a 
volatile metal compound, which they fed into an ECR (electron 
cyclotron resonance) plasma together with nitrogen or ammonia. 
An ECR plasma is a particular form of excited gas state in 
which a magnetic field and an alternating electrical field are 
used to project and accelerate electrons onto spiral paths, a 
highly efficient method of activating gas molecules by inducing 
collision with electrons. 
<H5>  Golden Coatings at Boiling Temperature </H5>
  The researchers in Hamburg manipulate the gases in this 
plasma in such a way that pure crystalline titanium nitride 
layers with ideal material properties can be precipitated at a 
temperature as low as 100 degrees Celsius; this cannot be 
accomplished below 500 degrees Celsius in conventional 
processes. The test parameters are set in such a way that the 
breakdown of the organic metal compound can be piloted to keep 
the layers free of the carbon impurities that would otherwise 
usually contaminate them. 
  The project was financed by the Federal Ministry of Research 
and Technology and managed by the VDI-TZ [Association of German 
Engineers Technology Center] in Duesseldorf. The low 
precipitation temperature makes the process attractive primarily 
for microelectronics applications and for coating 
temperature-sensitive substrates such as plastic. About 50 
research teams worldwide have been working for around 10 years 
on precipitating this valuable substance from volatile organic 
metal compounds.

Surface-Mounted Component Devices"] 
  [Text] The French subcontractor SRPI is the first company 
in Europe to acquire a Fuji FIPIII surface mounting machine 
which can produce surface mounted components [SMC's] at a 0.3-mm 
pitch. 
  To keep pace with the growing integration of electronic 
components (larger packages with increasingly numerous 
connections at an increasingly fine pitch), SRPI, a 
subcontracting company based at Redon [northeast France], has 
recently invested "several millions of French francs [Fr]" in a 
surface mounting line for fine-pitch SMC's. The main element in 
this line is the Fuji FIPIII machine, which is capable of 
assembling everything from chips using the 1005-format (1 x 0.5 
mm) to QFP's [quad flat packs] at 0.3-mm pitches with 0.025-mm 
precision and TAB [tape automated bonded] and SMC connectors. 
SRPI is the first company in Europe to acquire this machine, 
and the second in the world (after an American GSM [Global 
System for Mobile Communications] terminal manufacturer). 
  With this investment, the French subcontractor is betting on 
the future. Few companies outsourcing work are currently 
looking for subcontractors capable of assembling SMC's at 0.3-mm 
pitch (SRPI has some requests for component assembly at 0.4 mm 
and 0.5 mm), but the natural trend toward increased 
miniaturization and complexity of electronic products means that 
this ability is a strategic advantage. 
  SRPI should generate revenues of over Fr120 million this 
year 
(including its non-electronics activities) and is predicting 
growth in the region of 15 percent in 1994. 
  Between November 1992 and February 1994, the company will 
have invested some Fr10 million in its industrial production 
facilities.

  [Text] Dresden--After lengthy negotiations the contracts 
for founding the Zentrum Mikroelektronik Dresden GmbH (ZMD) in 
Dresden were signed on 27 May 1993. As early as last October it 
was agreed that ZMD was to be removed from the parent company 
Mikroelektronic and Technologiegesellschaft (MTG) and taken over 
by the holding companies of the Commerzbank AG, Frankfurt/M., 
and the Dresdner Bank AG, Frankfurt/M., each taking half. The 
privatization is under committee supervision. 
  For Saxony's economic minister, Kajo Schommer (CDU), this 
sale marks an important technological policy goal for the Land: 
"Saxony will remain a standard in microelectronics in the 
production of user-specific circuits." In Saxony about 100,000 
jobs depend directly or indirectly on microelectronics, Schommer 
said. East Germany's other two significant microelectronics 
firms in Erfurt and Frankfurt/O. have already been privatized by 
their trusteeship. 
  The support for this project is considerable: According to 
statements of the trustees, Siemens AG will provide knowhow and 
personnel in areas of technology, production techniques, 
marketing and sales for three years. There is a fairly good 
chance that ZMD could develop as a supplier for Siemens, not 
least through licenses which Siemens will make available. 
  The Free State will provide the liquidator for MTG with DM40 
million for research and development for ZMD and an additional 
DM10 million until 1996 for the purchase of property and 
buildings. The trusteeship will support the undertaking for the 
next three years with opening financing in the amount of DM135 
million. Schommer thought that it would be clear in 1995 that 
faith in ZMD had been justified. 
  There is still quite a bit to be done: Last year ZMD 
achieved 
sales of DM7 million. According to the designated president of 
ZMD management, Kurt Garbrecht, this year sales should amount to 
DM15 million, but this is not yet guaranteed. For 1994 he said 
that the objective would be sales of DM50 million and in 1995 
DM100 million. Costs should be covered by production by 1996. 
Garbrecht, who most recently was leader of the internal 
microelectronics division at Siemens, estimated financial needs 
up until 1995 (loss coverage and investments) at approximately 
DM130 million. MTG liquidator Wilhelm A. Schaaf confirmed that 
with the support of the trusteeship, the Land of Saxony and the 
EC there is complete financing for ZMD. He said that the ZMD 
plan was firm.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Article: "Fully Automated Recycling of Picture </F>
Tubes--Two Pilot Plants Recycle Sorted Glass"] 
  [Text] A new, fully automated recycling process is to 
prevent TV and computer picture tubes from being deposited in 
hazardous waste dumps. Hetzel &amp; Co Elektronik-Recycling 
  GmbH and the equipment technology division of Siemens AG 
presented two pilot plants in Nuernberg which dismantle both 
black-and-white and color picture tubes into completely sorted 
glass. According to Hetzel CEO Juergen Wolf, ten million picture 
tubes per year are being discarded in Germany. 
  According to the company the program-controlled facility 
uses 
a thermal process to separate the lead-containing conical glass 
and the strontium-containing front glass. Test agreements exist 
already with the glass industry to reuse the recycled products 
for picture tube molding. Black-and-white tubes which consist of 
uniform glass are cut open with diamond saws in the pilot 
facility which makes it easier to remove the luminescent coating 
in a washing installation. 
  According to the company, there are also plans for recycling 
the washed out rare earth elements which currently still go to a 
waste dump. At present, the two mobile facilities recycle 240 
color tubes and 150 black-and-white tubes per day . According to 
Wolf, this throughput can be increased quite easily. The unit 
price for recycling a tube is currently DM8, for a complete 
computer monitor it is DM35 to DM45.

<H5>  Microelectronics: Custom-Made Suit for Chips </H5>
  By offering semiconductor specialty products, Europe will 
now 
improve its position on the world market. The European 
microelectronics industry is not getting off its crawling start. 
While Japanese and Taiwanese manufacturers are further enhancing 
the top position the Far East holds in memory chips and American 
electronics giants such as the Intel Corporation are reaping 
billions in profits with their microprocessors, the barometer 
readings for this industry on the old continent have again 
fallen to the the bottom. "Europe has only half-heartedly 
responded to the drastic reconstruction process taking place in 
the semiconductor industry worldwide" soberly states Hans 
Weinerth, former manager of Philips and today chief of Sican 
GmbH (GmbH = Ltd) in Hannover which produces special custom-made 
chips. 
  "Whoever wants to catch up here must not nibble at but take 
a 
whack at it" believes Jens Uwe Fuhrmann of the German Machine 
and Plant Construction Society (VDMA). Yet the European chip 
industry has suffered for years from a frightening lack of 
motivation. Only Siemens, jointly with the IBM Deutschland GmbH 
(German IBM Ltd), still bearably holds on to the mass market for 
memory chips. The twosome recently delivered their first 64 Mbit 
chips to selected customers. 
  The European Research Initiative JESSI (Joint European 
Submicron Silicon), although established for the purpose of 
developing this particular chip as closely as possible alongside 
the Japanese, has since changed its orientation. "Memory 
technology was virtually stricken from the European agenda" 
admits Heinz Hagmeister, just recently appointed JESSI chairman. 
  A general breakdown of the domestic microelectronics 
industry, however, Hagmeister refuses to concede: "We are still 
holding some trump cards." It is slowly dawning on the JESSI 
board members in charge that the billions of research money 
squandered in laboratories on unmarketable projects actually 
help countries like Japan, Korea, and the U.S.A. to remain 
leaders in electronics. 
  The situation is, indeed, becoming more and more critical. 
The European chip users are becoming more and more dependent on 
non-European chip producers. "Japan has assumed the leading role 
all the way from making semiconductor materials through 
fabrication of chips to manufacture of electronic products" 
complains Michael Pero, director of Microelectronics in the 
Technology-Strategy and Innovation Projects (TES) division of 
the Daimler-Benz AG (AG = Corporation). 
  There is absolutely no shortage of new places where to 
start. 
Professional market watchers are raising Europe's expectations 
in this field by their discovery of a demand for microelectronic 
components called ASIC's (Amorphous-Silicon Integrated Circuits) 
designed to meet user's special requirements. 
  These components can be used in washing machines, mobile 
telephones, machine tools, automobiles, and in practically all 
electronic circuits, each component as a rule in only a very 
specific kind of electronic device. They often replace an entire 
series of mass-produced chips and thus remain each suitable for 
only a particular device targeted for miniaturization. They 
furthermore perform their specific task most often faster and 
more reliably than an electronic circuit built with 
mass-produced chips. 
  "The success of European products hinges neither on the 
degree of integration nor on the storage density of chips" 
acknowledges Max Syrbe, since a few weeks ago president of the 
Fraunhofer Society. Extremely fine structures striven for in 
mass-produced chips are not needed in an ASIC. Inasmuch as only 
the functions needed for performance of its specific task are 
built into it, an ASIC is by far not as crowded as a 64 Mbit 
chip. 
  The chances are good that, by pursuing the ASIC line, 
Europe's semiconductor industry will again catch up with the 
leading manufactures of semiconductor devices and especially so 
since the Fraunhofer Institute of Silicon Technology has focused 
its attention on precisely this particular concept. A 
comfortable new Institute building is currently being 
constructed in Itzehoe with Europe's largest contamination-free 
space for research and development. Two thousand square meters 
of floor area will be made available to the Institute's 
researchers and collaborating experts from industry. Relocation 
from the present site in Berlin is scheduled to take place in 
the second half of 1995. The Institute will provide the 
technical prerequisites for a quantum jump in ASIC development. 
The equipment on hand for this purpose is designed to produce 
chip structures of sizes smaller than half a micrometer. This 
will lead to an actual manufacture of ASIC's and thus to further 
progress in the miniaturization of devices. 
  According to Weinerth, chief of Sican, there are still 
openings for entry into competition with other semiconductor 
manufacturers for share of the world market. "Our ambition must 
not be to gain a few percentage points on the world market with 
standard products", admonishes the former JESSI man, "but rather 
to offer specialty products." 
  Despite the favorable position for a good start, marketable 
products are still scarce. Exceptions include the world's 
highest-speed silicon chip developed at the Ruhr University in 
Bochum. The know-how for this device has been acquired by the 
Daimler-Benz Corporation. Then the Institute of Discrete 
Mathematics (IDM) at the Bonn University has developed layouts 
for new chips which the IBM Deutschland (German IBM) GmbH now 
uses. But on the whole, says IDM chief Bernhard Korte, the 
European semiconductor industry is fast asleep. 
  The greatest weakness lies in transmitting the know-how from 
the laboratory to the industry. A man who wants to correct this 
is Prof. Dieter Seitzer in Nuremberg. His efforts should benefit 
most of all middle-class consumers. This incumbent Chair of 
Engineering Electronics professor at the Erlangen-Nuremberg 
University, who is also director of the Fraunhofer Institute of 
Integrated Circuits, knows what the trouble is with the group of 
people he will confront: "Researchers and potential users are 
still too timid to communicate with one another properly." 
  The agile professor visualizes covering West Europe with a 
hundred competence centers which will assist every prospective 
user in the design of ASIC's. The laboratory facilities of the 
Fraunhofer Institute in Erlangen are today almost ready to 
handle telephone orders. Meanwhile, however, the JESSI project 
is still in its infancy. Besides the Erlangen Institute, only 
the Braunschweig Institute of Applied Microelectronic has a 
so-called chip shop available for custom design of ASIC's. 
  Seitzer is not the only one promoting such services. The 
Thuringia Microelectronics Application Center (MAZeT)Ltd, in 
which the city of Erfurt and also the Weinerth-Sican enterprise 
and the Jena Optics Ltd participate, offers assistance not only 
in ASIC development but also in almost all areas of 
microelectronics. Because of this capability, the Center 
occupies a unique position in Germany, having competence in 
advance microelectronics also at its disposal.

<F P=106> [Article by Ulf J. Froitzheim: "Revolution of the Dwarves"] </F>
  [Text] Seen with the naked eye, the crumbs look like fly 
specks. But Wolfgang Ehrfeld is holding real treasures in his 
hands: Ultrasmall microturbines, which do not reveal their true 
shape until placed under a high-resolution microscope. Such 
microsystems, assures the managing director of the Institute for 
Microtechnology Mainz (IMM), are once again radically changing 
the industrial world: "Even today we still have no concept of 
most applications." 
  What until recently still smacked of science fiction--tiny 
robots which independently repair machines, carry off 
calcification in blood vessels or self-navigating vehicles 
equipped with microsensors--are slowly but surely becoming 
reality in the laboratories from Mainz to Madison, Wisconsin, 
from Tuebingen to Tokyo. Microcomponents are already being used 
in fiberoptics networks and medical equipment, as well as in 
everyday articles such as ink jet printers and air bags. 
  German companies and researchers are involved at the 
forefront of this promising future technology and are even 
leading in some subareas. Professor Anton Heuberger at the 
Fraunhofer Institute in Berlin and Daimler researcher Walter 
Kroy in Munich are two of the most famous pioneers in silicon 
microtechnology. The newer and more flexible Liga [lithography, 
electroforming, casting] process, with which tiny parts can also 
be made from metal, ceramics or synthetics, was developed by IMM 
head Wolfgang Ehrfeld in the 1980s at the Karlsruhe Nuclear 
Research Center (KfK). And Dortmund Microparts GmbH--a joint 
venture of the Steag, Krupp/Hoesch, Huels, Rheinmetall and VEW 
groups--is considered worldwide to be the only company which has 
mastered large-series manufacture of micromechanical systems. 
The team around managing director Reiner Wechsung can produce 
120,000 microscopic little gearwheels in one operation. "In 
basic research and first products we are probably ahead of the 
United States and Japan." Rainer Guenzler of the Institute for 
Micro-and Information Technology (Imit) of the Hahn-Schickard 
Society in Villingen confirms the European lead but with the 
reservation: "In patents the Japanese are unequivocally ahead." 
Guenzler should know: His institute, supported by the land of 
Baden-Wuerttemberg, helps medium-sized mechanical engineering 
manufacturers introduce microtechnology and therefore 
painstakingly keeps track of pertinent activities at home and 
abroad. 
  But Imit cannot supply a reliable analysis of the future 
world market in microtechnology. Even professional market 
watchers are stumbling about in the fog. The Market Intelligence 
Research Corp. (Mirc) in Mountain View in Silicon Valley 
predicted last fall that worldwide turnover in microsystems and 
microstructures would surpass the three-billion-dollar mark as 
early as 1995; last spring Mirc corrected the sum to 2.9 
billion--and the year to 1998. 
  Battelle Memorial Institute also reports contradictory data: 
While its Frankfurt branch, now closed, at the end of last year 
predicted a market volume of 20 billion German marks [DM] for 
the year 2000, Battelle Europe now anticipates only sales of 
eight billion dollars in this market by the turn of the century. 
  On the other hand, should the daring assumptions be correct 
on which the Federal Ministry [for Research and Technology, 
BMFT] supports the draft of its second subsidy program for 
microsystem technology (period: 1994-1999), the anticipated 
world market could be much greater: Microcomponents are to 
represent a full four percent of the sales price for cars in the 
construction year of 2000. Even in the worst economy that would 
be more than DM 20 billion. In Europe alone microsystems worth 
DM 3.6 billion would then be built into telecommunications 
facilities. In this context the BMFT does not even mention the 
application field of medical and pharmacological technology, 
regarded as particularly promising. 
  The prophets only agree on one point: that an additional 
technological race between Europe, Japan and the United States 
is coming--its outcome still open. 
  All three sides are ready to invest. In the United States 
the 
research authority ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) has 
taken up the subject. ARPA manager Kaigham J. Gabriel, himself a 
former microengineer, is allowed to spend 24 million dollars in 
seed capital over three years. 
  In Japan, micromachine development is focused on the 
Micromachine Center (MCC) in Tokyo, in which such illustrious 
companies as Fanuc, Hitachi, Kawasaki, Matsushita, Mitsubishi, 
Seiko or Toshiba are participating. In 1991 the Ministry for 
Industry and Trade, MITI, granted 25 billion yen (DM 387 
million) to a 10-year program aimed at the concrete task of 
joint construction of a millimeter-large, automatic blood vessel 
scrubber. 
  Such a joint leitmotif is missing in the German program for 
microsystems technology, whose first part runs out at the end of 
the year. Over the past three years the bureaucrats in Bonn 
dissipated their energies on no fewer than 31 (Japan: five) 
joint projects with 224 partial projects, whose DM 148 million 
budget was split equally between industrial companies and 
research establishments. Even the whole dozen of the Fraunhofer 
institutes involved conduct largely uncoordinated research. For 
example, only four belong to the pan-European microtechnology 
elite group Nexus, which is run by Heuberger's Fraunhofer 
Institute for Silicon Technology (Isit) in Berlin. 
  While the BMFT is now preparing to kick off the second round 
of subsidies with the prospective sum of DM 400 million, Liga 
inventor Wolfgang Ehrfeld prefers to fight his own fight. As 
founder of the IMM subsidized by the Rhineland-Palatinate, the 
ex-KfK employee wants to show how efficient German research can 
be. 
  "I wish for more competition in research and development," 
Ehrfeld taunts the solicitous ministerial technocrats, "because 
that is the only way to mobilize the reserves which lead to 
innovation." 
  The ambitious professor, helped by the economics minister of 
Rhineland-Palatinate, Rainer Bruederle, has thus within two 
years built a fully equipped think tank from the ground 
up--mainly filled with second-hand, like-new equipment. Since 
then the IMM has grown to 100 employees, already finances 25 
percent of itself through industrial contracts and, in addition 
to MicroParts, is regarded as the most important address in Liga 
technology. The Mainz team is not satisfied with applications in 
the branches of telecommunications, medicine, pharmacology and 
automobiles, but in addition devotes itself to improving 
production technology and the associated equipment development. 
  Together with the Lothar Spaeth company Jenoptik in Jena, 
the 
IMM developed a precision scanner for deep lithographic 
production of tiny molds needed for mass production of Liga 
microparts. Since there is no comparable equipment on the world 
market, inquiries and orders have already come in from Europe, 
the United States and the Far East. 
  Old and established entrepreneurs often shy away from that 
much high-tech, even if the innovations would soon have 
immediate impact on their business. In mechanical engineering, 
the BMFT estimates, 60 percent of the companies will be forced 
to use microsystems components. But only five percent of the 
companies would develop such products themselves. 
  So the employees at Imit in Villingen, which as a supplier 
of 
R&amp;D is to pave the way to the future for the traditional 
Black 
Forest precision mechanics companies, will also have to do a 
great deal of persuading. Sighs Rainer Guenzler: "It is not easy 
to convince the head of a small company that he should invest in 
new things precisely during the recession." 
<H5>  Flexible Alternatives </H5>
  Various methods are available in order to produce 
microscopically small components. The conventional methods, for 
instance etching of fine structures, are derived from silicon 
processing. The advantage: benefiting from years of experience 
in semiconductor manufacture. 
  But that does not compensate for the serious disadvantage, 
namely fixation on the material silicon. The Liga 
technique--Liga stands for the three principal process steps of 
lithography, galvanizing, casting--developed by Wolfgang Ehrfeld 
at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center (KfK) in the 1980s is 
now revealing itself as a highly promising and flexible 
alternative. Ehrfeld: "We can produce components from gold, 
copper, synthetics or ceramics." 
  The principle is simple. Through a mask a 
radiation-sensitive 
synthetic is irradiated with X-rays. A solvent etches out the 
affected surfaces, and the hollows are filled in a galvanic 
process with nickel. After removing the residual synthetic, the 
metal structure serves as a mold for the production of the 
actual parts. 
  In this manner Ehrfeld produces new kinds of fiberglass 
plugs 
from the synthetic PMMA, a mass product which costs only 
pfennigs although it has a dimensional tolerance of less than 
one-thousands of a millimeter. 
  These are not the only such applications to make the Liga 
process famous beyond the science. While the method has so far 
been kept under lock and key up by the KfK, Ehrfeld with his 
institute is deliberately taking a different tack: "If we want 
to have any chance at all versus the established silicon 
methods, we must open up the Liga process to all who are 
interested." 
  That is precisely what the busy research entrepreneur is 
doing. He organized an international network of Liga users, 
which he is busily continuing to expand. By now, more than 30 
groups are likely to be working with this method worldwide. To 
be sure, this leads to the German share of the Liga cake 
becoming smaller. That is the intention for Ehrfeld: "That is 
the only way the method can become established and plant 
builders and other suppliers can become interested in it." 
  The market resulting form it, according to Ehrfeld, "more 
than compensates for the lost monopoly."

<F P=106> [Article by Bettina Weberling: "Grenades in the Blood </F>
Vessels"] 
  [Excerpts] They are so small that they can wander through 
arteries, veins and the smallest pipes. Like worms--supplied 
with a long umbilical cord--the tiny machines crawl through the 
human body or through motors, cutting or grating here and 
widening there. 
  Micromachines such as these, which take over the maintenance 
work in bodies or in machinery or independently carry out 
environmental monitoring, are still utopian. But tiny individual 
parts for these micromachines are already being developed. 
[passages omitted] 
  Until now this field has been dominated by rigid endoscopes, 
through which even simple, mechanically remote-controlled tools 
can fit such as scissors, knives or hooks with which to catch 
stones, for example. Such systems are offered by the 
medium-sized companies Karl Storz GmbH and Co. in Tuttlingen and 
Richard Wolf GmbH in Knittlingen, among others, each of which 
has a world market share of about 30 percent. 
  But the next generation, with which small surgical tools can 
find even better application, is already announcing itself: 
semiflexible endoscopes, such as from Fujinon (Europe) GmbH in 
Duesseldorf. 
  Unlike rigid tubes, the semiflexible endoscopes can be aimed 
more precisely at the target in the body. Jochen Cramer, sales 
director for Europe at Fujinon, estimates the existing world 
market for such systems at DM 70 million, of which market leader 
Olympus Optical Co. Ltd. in Tokyo has assured itself of 85 
percent. 
  Such flexible endoscopes are also attractive when looking 
for 
damage in engines and drives. While conventional diagnosis of 
heavy truck engines takes almost 10 hours because the engine has 
to be disassembled into individual parts, with the endoscope the 
analysis is done in a little over 30 minutes. As in the medical 
field, the goal for the microtechnology developers is the 
independent mini-machine, which undertakes externally controlled 
repair work either by itself or with a joystick. 
  Before using it in the human body, however, the researchers 
must still solve the energy question. While most micromachines 
that pass through veins, those which so far have been presented 
as prototypes, need power as an energy source, Wolfgang Menz, 
head of the Institute for Microstructure Technology at the 
Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center (KfK) is concentrating on the 
fluidics, that is to say gases or fluids under pressure. "If we 
use carbon dioxide or a physiological table salt solution, that 
is harmless to the human," according to Menz. 
  Over the next few years he wants to develop an intelligent 
endoscope subsidized by the Federal Ministry for Research and 
Technology: A tiny robot which moves like a submarine in the 
body's passages. It is equipped with a video camera which 
transmits live pictures on the surgical video screen. The 
operator who controls the submarine can manipulate various tools 
when needed: A router removes deposits that could lead to heart 
attacks on the walls of the blood vessels, a rotating knife 
removes diseased tissue and a needle guided by the robot hand 
sews up the fresh wound. 
  Among the first users of this technology could be Raimund 
Erbel, head of cardiology at the University Clinic in Essen, who 
has specialized in prevention of heart attacks. In theory 
Erbel's micromachine is already perfect: a miniaturized, 
rotating ultrasound head which scans the interior walls of the 
heart and coronary vessels. The pictures from a person's inside 
allow for much more precise conclusions regarding the danger of 
heart attacks. "Right now we can only detect deposits once the 
vessels are already up to 40 percent closed," says Erbel. "With 
the ultrasound head we can see them even at five percent." 
  Furthermore, the type of deposit can be seen. This 
determines 
the choice of tool: a diamond-equipped router, which 
mechanically eliminates the obstruction, or a laser which 
vaporizes them. The tissue waste left behind by the miniature 
drill is considered critical by many experts, but Erbel regards 
it as harmless. The tiny pieces of calcium and fat, according to 
the heart specialist, cannot endanger the patient. 
  But it will be years before Erbel has to deliver proof of 
this. Microsystems cannot be used in the human body until after 
extensive tests. This gives Menz, the researcher in Karlsruhe, 
time to, as he hopes, develop equipment that works even more 
targeted and less brutally than a router. 
  "After all, it has the effect of a hand grenade tossed into 
the arteries," he says with vivid criticism of the vein drill. 
For that reason Menz is concentrating on intelligent diagnostic 
capsules which can be swallowed and on their way through the 
body search for cancer, for example. Such a submarine could 
then, according to the scientist's ideas, be immediately loaded 
with the appropriate medicines for combating the degenerated 
cells.

  [Text] Foturan is hard to the touch. The silicate glass 
withstands temperatures up to 550 degrees Celsius as well as 
attacks by aggressive chemicals. "Also, Foturan can be optimally 
combined with other materials into hybrid structures," muses 
Burkhard Speit, head of product development for the optical 
business sector at Schott Glassworks in Mainz, in whose 
laboratories the special glass was developed. 
  Originally, Foturan was to be used by Siemens AG for the 
construction of flat screens. But the Munich electronics group 
halted the development of flat tubes--and Schott had to look for 
other users for his wonderglass. They were soon found: Sensors 
for high-temperature application, for example, are being made 
based on Foturan. The Schott strategists now hope also to 
establish their silicate glass as a material for microsystem 
technology. 
  Foturan can--partly irradiated with ultraviolet light and 
then etched--be made into tiny mold parts. It is also suitable 
for the manufacture of perforated boards. The people in Mainz 
have already managed up to 800 holes per square centimeter. "We 
see application possibilities for example in mountings for 
optical waveguide fibers." 
  In the development of new materials for microscopically 
small 
components, the experience from the world of macrosystems can 
only be conditionally applied. "Often the mechanical properties 
of materials for components in the microfield are totally 
different from construction with normal sizes," according to 
Professor Erwin Sommer, head of the Fraunhofer Institute for 
Material Mechanics (IWM) in Freiburg. 
  Right now, materials experts in industry and at research 
institutes are primarily occupied with optimization of already 
available materials, such as certain synthetics or ceramics, for 
their use in the microsystem field. By means of filmy-thin 
coatings, improvements in the process technology or--much 
simpler--the correct combination of various materials, 
"completely satisfactory solutions can be achieved" (Sommer) for 
the microsystems planned at this time. 
  The development of totally new, to some extent tailor-made 
materials, is still not pursued with any force, at least for the 
moment. The reason for this is simple. Schott researcher Speit 
says: "We want to push ahead with the use of microtechnology 
systems; we do not want to wait five years for the development 
of a totally new material." 
  At this time experts see the broadest application field in 
medicine--and at the same time the adjustment of the working 
material is the most difficult here. "We can only make use of a 
palette of 20 materials, whose biocompatibility has been 
attested to by the Federal Health Ministry," explains Bernd 
Amecke, a microsystem expert at the pharmacological group of 
Boehringer Ingelheim. When modifying them in order to optimize 
them for certain microsystems he must apply for a new permit in 
order to use them in human beings. And that takes time. 
  Obstacles of this kind can only briefly hold up the 
materials 
designers, however. That is because materials technology is 
likely to play a dominant role as early as with the second or 
third microtechnology generation, the concepts of which are 
already being drafted in the industrial research departments. 
  Here the researchers will penetrate down to the molecular 
structure of the materials. At the Max Planck Institute for 
Polymer Research in Mainz people are combining molecules which 
independently merge into new materials with the desired 
properties. The head of the institute, professor Gerhard Wegener 
says: "It is as if bricks were to combine to form a wall on 
command." 
  At the Institute for New Materials (INM) in Saarbruecken one 
has also specialized in molecular puzzles. Here, for example, 
glasses and ceramics for use in microsystems are being 
optimized, by deliberately contaminating them with tiny foreign 
particles. The particles are so small that a quadrillion of them 
can fit on a pinhead. 
  The result of this molecular material composition is 
so-called smart materials, intelligent materials, which under 
varying pressure conditions can change their stability. "The 
trend in microsystem technology in the next few years is 
unequivocally heading toward increasingly intelligent 
materials," confirms INM employee Herbert Krug and confidently 
promises: "Technically we have already mastered it."

<H5>  German Strategies </H5>
  The "Quarter-Micron" project, the Siemens-IBM-Toshiba 
alliance for joint technological development of 0.25 &mgr;m 
structures, is yielding the first experimental chips. 
  John Abernathey invited us to a photo opportunity. The 
"Quarter-Micron" project leaders from the participating Siemens, 
IBM, and Toshiba enterprises are in a good mood. They have 
accomplished a lot indeed in this one year since the contract 
had been signed. "We are entirely on schedule" says Hans 
Schuster-Woldan of Siemens. Since January he is heading one of 
the most diverse teams of workers from all three firms in East 
Fishkill, about 100 km north of New York. "The first 
experimental chips produced by the quarter-micron technology are 
already available" he announces proudly. 
  In order to prevent further runaway of costs for development 
of ever more finely structured chips, these three large DRAM 
producers from the competing camps of Europe, U.S.A., and Japan 
decided last year to such an unprecedented alliance. They are 
sponsors of the joint project designed to develop a technology 
of producing fine chip structures. The is to develop processes 
which will yield 0.25 &mgr;m wide structures. As the first 
product 
they want to come out, by the middle nineties, with a 256 Mbit 
DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory): a semiconductor memory with 
optional access to all 256 million memory cells. 
  If this project succeeds, it will be owing to Siemens alone 
that Europe has regained ground in microelectronics. This is by 
far the only enterprise which devises such clever strategies. 
All other microelectronic firms still just swim behind the 
technological leader. 
  Instead of all joining forces, each enterprise in Germany -- 
industry and institutes alike -- tries to keep its head above 
water with with its individual solution. 
  What looked so promising in 1990, when the fathers of the 
JESSI EUREKA program found a new home and new task for the 
Fraunhofer Institute of Silicon Technology (ISiT) in Itzehoe, 
has in the meantime turned into dust. The Institute was supposed 
to explore new processes for structurization of microchips by 
x-ray lithography. Soon, however, did the Research Minister cut 
off the funds for this because the "large industry has abandoned 
x-ray lithography." The ISiT chief Prof. Dr. Anton Heuberger 
notes today: "Since the European firms had largely stopped 
manufacturing memory chips, there was no prime user of this 
technology to be found in Europe. We therefore had discontinue 
our efforts." 
  This assessment is, of course,not quite correct in view of 
the activities at Siemens. Rather, photolithography was also 
applicable to much smaller structures than had been assumed at 
that time. The Japanese tried it already then on KrF excimer 
lasers. And for this reason, evidently, the large industry let 
x-ray lithography go. 
  A new concept made it nevertheless possible to begin 
construction of the ISiT in Itzehoe, after both Federal and 
State governments released the funds. Meanwhile very large-scale 
integration was been abandoned and somewhat smaller integration 
is being targeted: Only system integration, hybrid technology, 
and ASIC's (Amorphous-Silicon Integrate Circuits) for the 
medium-size industry are now considered.

<F P=106> [Article by Rolf Schwarze and Heike Wiegand, professional </F>
journalists, Eschwege, under the rubric "Research and 
Technology": "Medicine/Ambitious Esprit Project: Nerves Made of 
Silicon. Artificial Limbs Will Be Controlled by Nerve Impulses"; 
first paragraph is an introduction] 
  [Text] Wednesday, 10 Nov 93 (HANDELSBLATT)--Scientists at 
Centro Nacional de Microelectronica (CNM) in Barcelona are 
working on the development of a new chip that, implanted in the 
human body, can receive nerve impulses and forward them to 
various parts of the body. Nerves destroyed (in an accident) 
could be replaced by them in the future. Artificial arms and 
legs could be controlled by nerve impulses for the first time by 
means of this chip. 
  The idea for this originated already around two and a half 
years ago. But the man-machine communication had to be feasible, 
they realized at the CNM laboratory. An ambitious research 
project that the European Community is generously subsidizing 
within the Esprit program has sprung from the idea in the 
meantime. Together with five other laboratories in Germany, 
Italy and Switzerland, CNM's scientists are working on the 
development of a new microchip that could open up new pathways 
for medicine. 
  However, Centro Nacional de Microelectronica is taking the 
main share of the "Intelligent Neuronal Interface" project. "We 
are still at the very beginning," Rosa Villa, who as a physician 
is watching over the CNM project, says, curbing overhasty 
expectations. The goal is the development of a chip that, 
implanted between the split nerve ends, is to act as a 
communication bridge between the nervous system and outside 
information processing system. 
  A prototype has already been designed in the meantime: a 
silicon chip one square millimeter small that is like a 
miniature sieve. The microperforation was achieved by neutron 
bombardment, explains Jordi Aguil&oacute;, head of CNM's design 
department. "The only effective method by which the chip's 
circuits are not damaged." 
  The development of a biocompatible material for the chip 
case 
has been likewise difficult. But this problem has also been 
solved by now. The chip's biocompatibility has by now been 
tested with success in experiments on animals, Rosa Villa 
attests. The chip was implanted in rats. The next phase of the 
research can begin. The nerve chip is to act as the receiver of 
rat-nerve signals that are interpreted by a computer. Additional 
findings for further development of the chip are hoped from this. 
  Similarly to TV relay stations that amplify the signals for 
reception at more distant points, the chip already permits 
signal transmission from the brain to nerve intersection points. 
Rosa Villa explains the future capabilities that follow from 
this: "The chip could replace destroyed nerves and be used in 
order to control artificial limbs." 
  If the latter sounds improbable, it is not in the opinion of 
the CNM researchers. After all, it is theoretically possible to 
decode signals from the brain at severed nerves, Jordi 
Aguil&oacute; explains. "Thus it must also be possible to forward 
these brain signals through the chip to an artificial arm or 
leg." 
  Rosa Villa: Unlike conventional pacemakers that can only 
transmit commands, the chip will be interactive. "A miniature 
electronic brain that is compatible with the human nervous 
system can receive neural signals, process them and transmit 
them to various parts of the body or to artificial limbs." 
  There is still a way to go before this point. "This is a 
long-range research project whose end cannot be foreseen yet 
today." Rosa Villa also knows that it will be a few years before 
this chip can be implanted in the first patient. "It will not be 
feasible before the year 2000."

  [Text] Three multinational pharmaceutical companies, Ciba- 
Geigy, Sandoz, and Hoechst, have already scheduled experiments 
at Elettra. Elettra is a super microscope that uses synchrotron 
light and began operating in Trieste on 4 October. According to 
the three companies, in the future 80 percent of the research 
into the structure of new pharmaceuticals will be performed 
using this extremely powerful insturment. 
  Elettra, the most powerful super microscope in Europe, took 
6 
years to build and to date has cost 300 billion lire. Inside 
Elettra electron beams are brought an energy of 1.5 Giga 
electron volts by a linear particle accelerator and are then 
injected into an accumulator ring containing curved magnet and 
other devices that cause them to loose energy under the form of 
synchrotorn light. 
  This intense radiation is then directed into channels 
leading 
to experimental laboratories where the researchers work. The 
light produced acts like an extremely powerful microscope that 
is capable of observing matter, both organic and inorganic, in 
great detail. "It is unique in the world because of the 
particular `brilliance' of its light beam," said the physicist 
and Elettra Scientific Committee President Giorgio Maritondo, 
"this light is capable of investigating the chemical bonds of 
the molecules contained in any given substance." Elettra can be 
used in the field of biology to examine the distribution of 
toxic elements in cerebral cell systems. 
  The "light" will not be used for pharmaceutical research 
alone. Many other sectors will benefit from Elettra: Its 50 
"light lines" will enable unique experiments to be performed, 
both basic and applied research, in the field of computer 
science for the production of integrated circuits; in the 
mechanical field for the manufacture of microcomponents, and in 
the chemical sector for the study of new materials.

<F P=106> [Article by Markus Klingenstein: "MCA Experiment Went Off </F>
According to Plan -- Fuel Rods in Test Reactor Heated to Melting 
Point: Comparison With Harrisburg Accident"] 
  [Text] The MCA [maximum credible accident] experiment that 
the French CEN [Center for the Study of Nuclear Power] research 
center in Cadarache has postponed time after time for several 
months went off according to plan on Thursday, as far as the 
experts have been able to judge to date. This experiment, which 
has been strongly criticized by environmentalists, involved 
turning off the cooling water supply to a small portion of the 
Phebus research reactor, thus for the first time simulating a 
"maximum credible accident" (MCA) in a nuclear power station. 
The fuel in the 80- cemtimeter long and 12-cm thick tube was 
heated to the point where it began to melt. The scientists 
compared their experiment with the accident in which the Three 
Mile Island nuclear power station in Harrisburg narrowly escaped 
a catastrophe in 1979. 
  This time, however, the faulty portion was 5,000 times 
smaller than in a conventional power station, and the 
surrounding reactor continued operating quite normally. The 
researchers at the French Institute of Nuclear Safety and 
Protection (ISPN), who had overall responsibility for the 
planning of this international project, are convinced that they 
would have been able to stop the experiment at any time in an 
emergency. However, German engineer Peter von der Hardt, the 
European Union's representative in Cadarache, maintains that 
safety precautions were so strict that no radioactive material 
could have escaped in any circumstances. 
  The Phebus experiment began on schedule shortly after 1000 
on 
Thursday morning with the preheating of the reactor. The whole 
procedure was transmitted live to the nearby press center, where 
scientists gave a commentary. A screen showed how the 
surroundings of a core immersed in a water tank began to glow 
blue -- the sign of radioactive radiation being generated in the 
reactor. While the major portion remained at the normal 
operating temperature of several hundred degrees Celsius, the 
lack of cooling in the actual inner test core ensured that its 
temperature continued to rise slowly. After one hour and a 
half, at 800 degrees Celsius, the fuel rods began to crack 
inside. Another two hours later, the housing was so hot that it 
reacted chemically with its surroundings, with the result that 
the temperature of the test object rose sharply from 1,400 to 
2,200 degrees in the space of a few minutes. A measuring tube 
inside it burst, and the gas collection tank radioactivity meter 
registered the first fission products, thus ringing in the hot 
phase. In the subsequent hour, the temperature approached the 
fuel melting point. At 1500, sufficient molten fuel had 
accumulated, and the experiment was brought to an end. Von der 
Hardt confirmed, however, that it was not yet known for sure 
whether the results of the MCA experiment were applicable to 
existing nuclear power stations.

<F P=106> [Article: "French-Belgian Demon at Catholic University of </F>
Louvain"] 
  [Text] Louvain-la-Neuve--It is French-Belgian, it was made 
to travel, and it has been mischievously christened Demon. 
Despite its name, this equipment, which should shed new light on 
the mechanisms of the reactions produced by the collision of 
heavy ions, was officially inaugurated at the Nuclear Physics 
Institute (IPN) of the Catholic University of Louvain-la-Neuve 
on 28 October. 
  The ceremony was attended by several dozen physicists and 
engineers, among them Claude Detraz, director of the Institute 
of Nuclear Physics and Particle Physics (IN2P3) of France's CNRS 
[National Scientific Research Center], and individuals 
responsible for designing and developing the detector: Mr. 
Youssef, Mr. Masri, and Francis Hanappe, who are researchers at 
Belgium's National Scientific Research Fund (FNRS); and Guy 
Bizard and Bernard Heusch of the CNRS. 
  Designed to be easily disassembled and moved, Demon (Modular 
Neutron Detector) was financed equally by the IN2P3/CNRS and the 
FNRS (20 million Belgian francs each) and built at four 
laboratories: the nuclear physics laboratories at the Free 
University of Brussels and the University of Louvain-la-Neuve, 
the Corpuscular Physics Laboratory (LPC) in Caen, and the 
Nuclear Research Center (CRN) in Strasbourg. The result is that 
following a preliminary series of measurements scheduled for 
December with Cyclone (the IPN's cyclotron), Demon will be 
transferred to GANIL (Large National Heavy Ion Accelerator) in 
Caen in 1994 and then to Vivitron in Strasbourg in 1995. 
  Demon's designers emphasize that it constitutes 
"technological progress" chiefly because of the amount of 
electronics and informatics it contains. In other words, it 
could not have been built a few years ago. Demon also benefited 
from work in the same field that was done by Charles Ring on the 
Eurogam detector (used by Vivitron). 
  What are the limits to the existence of nuclei--that is, 
what 
is the maximum number of nucleons possible in a nucleus, what 
are the respective proportions of neutrons and protons beyond 
which or below which a nucleus is no longer stable, and to what 
extent can one perturb a nucleus (by causing it to absorb 
energy) before it explodes (the phenomenon of 
multifragmentation)? 
  Demon should help provide answers to some of those 
questions, 
which still constitute an unsolved problem in nuclear physics. 
  Bernard Tamain of the LPC in Caen explains that in Louvain 
(where Cyclone delivers beams of 10 MeV per nucleon of energy) 
and in Strasbourg, the new apparatus, with its 96 detectors 
(including liquid scintillator plus photomultiplier) mounted on 
a spherical frame measuring four meters in 
diameter,&lt;sup&gt; 1&lt;/sup&gt;  will be "a chronometer making it possible 
to measure the fast fission of nuclei, the lifetime of a very 
hot nucleus, and those `reflex' times of nuclear matter that 
govern the fusion mechanisms." Its capabilities: times on the 
order of 100th of a billionth of a billionth of a second. 
  In Caen, where the energy supplied to GANIL can reach 100 
MeV 
per nucleon, the new equipment will be able to track the hottest 
nuclei up to temperatures of 100 billion degrees. 
  But Demon will also be used as a microscope for studying the 
most "exotic" light nuclei (those presenting a large excess of 
neutrons compared to the corresponding ordinary nuclei) that it 
is possible to produce today, examples being lithium-11 and 
carbon-19. Lastly, the new installation will make it possible to 
measure neutron sizes down to one-billionth of a micrometer. 
  It will therefore be possible to begin neutron detection--a 
difficult task compared to the detection of charged 
particles--within a few weeks using the equipment in question, 
which is unique in Europe. 
<H5>  Hot Nuclei and Exotic Nuclei </H5>
  When perturbed by another nucleus, a target nucleus 
distributes the energy imparted to it among its components, the 
nucleons. If the excitation energy reaches a certain threshold 
and threatens its existence, the nucleus--which is then called 
"hot"--"cools" itself by the emission of protons and neutrons 
(the phenomenon of evaporation) or by fission into two or more 
fragments (known as multifragmentation). 
  Studying the emission of neutrons enables one to learn about 
the excitation energy achieved by the nuclei, their 
de-excitation processes, and their lifetime (the time it takes 
them to return to stability). The hotter the nucleus, the 
stronger and faster the emissions. 
  Heavy ion accelerators can also produce light nuclei which, 
unlike stable "ordinary" nuclei (in which the number of neutrons 
is close to that of protons), have too many neutrons. Examples 
are &lt;sup&gt; 11&lt;/sup&gt; Li (three protons, eight neutrons) and &lt;sup&gt; 19&lt;/sup&gt; 
C (six protons, 13 neutrons). In an "exotic" 
nucleus of that kind, neutrons will be randomly distributed in a 
"halo," making the nucleus very unstable. The nucleus will 
return to stability by emitting its least firmly bound neutrons. 
  Detecting two neutrons simultaneously and measuring their 
speed (their "time of flight") and their angle of emission 
provides information on the limits to the existence of nuclear 
matter. 
Footnotes 
  1. Twenty-four of those detectors, perfected by the CRN in 
Strasbourg in cooperation with Philips-France (in 
Brive-la-Gaillarde), are equipped with a Charged Particle 
Rejection System (Syrep) that also includes a scintillator 
combined with a photomultiplier.

<F P=106> [Article: "Revolutionary Nuclear Reactor Proposed by CERN </F>
Director"] 
  [Text] Geneva--Nuclear generating plants powered 
by an inexhaustible energy source that is also virtually 
risk-free and poses no military proliferation threat: This is 
the revolutionary project unveiled on 24 November in Geneva to 
some 500 physicists from all over the world by Professor Carlo 
Rubbia, director of the European Particle Physics Laboratory 
(CERN). 
  Speaking in CERN's crowded amphitheater, the Nobel 
Prize-winning physicist explained that ecological concerns had 
motivated his conception of this project, which builds on 
earlier work and consists essentially of an "energy amplifier" 
driven by a heat-producing particle accelerator. In other words, 
the project consists of "extracting energy from heavy nuclei 
with the help of nuclear cascades induced by an accelerator." 
One might even go so far as to envision an "upsurge in global 
demand for nuclear energy to replace fossil fuels" such as 
hydrocarbons that engender so-called "greenhouse gases" and 
contribute to warming of the earth's atmosphere. 
  According to Mr. Rubbia, the particle amplifier, which would 
use thorium (abundantly available) rather than uranium as fuel, 
represents a safer solution because the reactor would be 
"subcritical" and there would be no danger of chain reaction. 
  Mr. Rubbia noted the general public's misgivings about 
traditional nuclear reactors in light of accidents such as Three 
Mile Island and Chernobyl and the need to bury highly 
radioactive waste products for very long periods of time. Use of 
thorium in this way would offer the advantages of "being simple, 
safe, cleaner, not posing any important technological hurdles, 
nonproliferating, and inexhaustible," Professor Rubbia said. 
Small plants would produce virtually no plutonium, and "no one 
could make a bomb with it." But Professor Rubbia concluded on a 
warning note: The project is still at the stage of "virtual 
reality, and experimental verification will be required," along 
with very complex calculations, before the idea is implemented. 
  According to CERN spokesman Neil Calder, Mr. Rubbia has 
computer-tested his theory and plans to begin experimental work 
on it next year at CERN. Most of the physicists reacted 
positively to the proposal, Mr. Calder said. 
  In his presentation, the Nobel Prize-winner said his work 
was 
based on research done in the 1950s by W. Lewis (Canada) and 
more recently by Professor C. Bowman's team at Los Alamos (New 
Mexico). At the end of December, Mr. Rubbia will step down as 
director of CERN, which he has headed for the last 5 years, and 
will be replaced by Christopher Llewellyn Smith. He will then 
devote himself entirely to his energy project.

<F P=106> [Article by Staffan Dahllof: "Nordic Superconductor in Two </F>
Years"--first two paragraphs are NY TEKNIK introduction] 
  [Text] In two years seven centimeters of Danish 
superconducting wire will have grown to 100 meters of usable 
electric cable. A Nordic industrial project is aimed at 
resistance-free electricity transmission in 1995. 
  "It looks promising," said Ove Albertsson of ABB Corporate 
Research. 
  The 7-centimeter long superconducting fragment is found at 
the research center of the NKT (Nordic Cable and Wire) company 
in Copenhagen. The wire handles a current density of 70,000 
amperes (A) per square centimeter, 70 times more than an 
ordinary copper cable. 
  According to the creators this is a world record. There are 
longer superconducting cables in Japan, it is true, but there 
the current density is only 10 times greater than it is in 
traditional electric cables. 
  Sometime in 1995 NKT promises to demonstrate 100 meters of 
superconducting cable that can transmit 50,000 A/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; 
without loss. 
  "We will see various application possibilities emerge in 
time, but direct current transmission over short distances may 
be one of the first applications," said project leader Torsten 
Freltoft. 
  The joint development project is backed by not only NKT but 
also ABB, Norsk Hydro, Chalmers Institute of Technology and the 
technical institutes in Copenhagen, Tammerfors and Trondheim. 
  Ove Albertsson of ABB's research division said that 
nitrogen-cooled superconductors can be used in many electric 
power contexts. 
  "It will probably involve more than simply replacing copper 
cables. Superconductors will also give us entirely new 
properties. But we will not know what these may be until we have 
the cables." 
  "ABB's official position has been that Japanese and American 
companies are in the lead. But I have become increasingly 
convinced that NKT is in the top echelon. Their work looks 
promising," he said. 
  The development of ceramic superconductors accelerated in 
the 
mid-1980s. They came to be called high-temperature conductors 
where high means warmer than absolute zero and preferably over 
-196&deg;C., the limit for using liquid nitrogen as a cooling 
medium. Although a number of different alloys have proved to be 
superconductive the industrial breakthrough has been a long time 
coming. 
  The alloy that the Nordic cable developers are working with 
consists of bismuth, lead, strontium, calcium and copper oxide. 
The production process is called the powder in tube method. 
Powder is packed into a silver tube with a diameter of 5-7 mm. 
The tube is stretched to a thread and rolled out to a 0.1-mm 
thick band that is then sintered in an oven. 
  "Now and then there are reports of new usable alloys in the 
literature. We test them too, but we expect to continue working 
with the method and the material we have now," Freltoft said. 
  The Nordic industrial project, based in Copenhagen, has a 
budget of around 40 million kronor, half of which is supplied by 
industry. The Nordic industrial fund contributes 15 percent. The 
rest is financed with various national grants.

<F P=106> [Article by Sarah Griffiths, based on Datapro International </F>
Telecommunications report: "Portugal: The Commercial and 
Regulatory Environment"] 
  [Text] Although regarded as having one of the least 
developed telecommunications infrastructures within the European 
Community, Portugal has made great advances in the sphere of 
telecommunications over the last four or five years and has 
achieved a telephone main line density of 32 percent -- a figure 
which, nevertheless, falls well below the Western European 
average. 
  Portugal's first telecommunications service was a private 
network which started in 1877, and later developed into the 
Anglo Portuguese Telephone Company (established in 1887) 
operating a local telephone service in Oporto and Lisbon. This 
company subsequently became the public company, Telefones de 
Lisboa e Porto (TLP), in 1968 -- still with the same regional 
coverage. The Portuguese PTT was responsible for serving the 
domestic telecommunications needs of the remaining regions of 
the country -- this too became a public company in 1970. 
Intercontinental connections (including telex, satellite, and 
submarine cable links) are handled by Marconi Communicaoes 
Globais (until recently known as Companhia Portuguesa Radio 
Marconi, or CPRM, and currently in the process of changing its 
name), which has been in operation since 1922. 
  During 1992, Portugal suffered alongside most of the rest of 
Europe from the general recession with GDP growth estimated to 
be less than 1.8 percent for the year (compared with 2.5 percent 
for 1991). Portugal's population of just over 10.5 million 
enjoys one of the lowest levels of unemployment in Europe, 
standing at around 4.7 percent in early 1993. Inflation has 
also been falling gradually over the last few years -- 8.9 
percent at the end of 1992 and still falling. 
  Politically, Portugal has had a somewhat chequered history 
until Mr. Anibal Cavaco Silva (together with his Social 
Democratic party, the PSD) achieved his first general election 
victory in 1987 -- followed by two subsequent re-election 
victories. The next general election is due in 1995. Since 
joining the European Community in 1986, although still one of 
the lesser developed member states, Portugal has made 
considerable progress propped up by a ready flow of EC 
development grants. 
  According to ITU [International Telecommunications Union] 
statistics for 1991, Portugal's record for investment in 
telecommunications proportional to GDP is well out in front of 
the rest of Europe (both East and West) at around 2.2 percent of 
GDP. The European average is roughly 1.8 percent of GDP. This 
illustrates Portugal's commitment to modernizing and developing 
its telecommunications infrastructure -- as quickly as possible 
-- in order to be able to cope with the increasingly competitive 
global telecoms market. 
<H5>  Regulation of Telecommunications </H5>
  Major regulatory changes started to take place during the 
early 1980's. Although under Law No. 188/81, issued in 1981, 
the State still retained monopoly control over public post and 
telecommunications services, it did liberalize the terminal 
equipment market and acknowledged the need to make further 
reforms. The law also created the Instituto das Comunicaoes de 
Portugal (ICP) as an advisory body to the government, but the 
ICP did not become the official regulatory body until 1989. 
  Mr. Fernando Mendes, the president of the ICP (the 
Portuguese 
telecommunications regulatory body), in his paper presented at 
the ITU's Asia Telecom conference in Singapore in May 1993, 
outlined the developments that have taken place in recent years 
towards establishing an efficiently regulated telecommunications 
industry. As a initial start in 1986, the Commission for the 
Communications Institutional and Technological Development Study 
(CEDITC) was set up to reassess the communications industry and 
liberalization of services -- a process which involved 
discussions with the public operators, trade unions, user 
groups, and industry representatives. The main recommendations 
included: 
  -- The separation of postal and telecommunications services 
  -- The creation of a financial holding company for the 
postal 
and telecommunications services within the CTT [Postal and 
Telegraph Services of Portugal], as well as for the public 
telecommunications operators, TLP and the former CPRM, with the 
eventual aim of removing the cross-subsidization of postal 
services 
  -- The gradual liberalization of basic services 
  -- The strengthening of the ICP's role as regulator 
  -- The move towards flexible tariffs for non basic services 
and cost-related tariffs for basic services. 
  The Commission's recommendations were incorporated into the 
government's program as of August 1987. 
  The development of Portuguese telecommunications legislation 
(i.e., the CEDITC report and the Basic Telecommunications Law) 
has been just one step ahead of the European Commission's 
directives. This has made implementation that much more 
straightforward and given support to the government's program 
for telecommunications. The Basic Telecommunications Law, which 
was approved by Parliament in September 1989, relates to 
telecommunication network infrastructures and differentiates 
between private and public. 
  -- Private telecommunications networks are owned by and for 
the exclusive use of the organization -- e.g., for the armed 
forces and railways, and private radio networks. The government 
is responsible for authorizing such networks. 
  -- Public telecommunications falls into two categories: a) 
networks for public use (i.e., the fixed telephone and telex 
services, and a switched data transmission service), and b) 
complementary networks and services, as well as mobile networks 
(i.e., mobile cellular, paging, videotex, e-Mail, EDI 
[Electronic Document Interchange], and trunked radio network 
services), and value-added services (i.e., services which add 
value to the basic or complementary services, such as audiotex, 
public fax, voice mail services). 
  The Telecommunications Law established that, in the case of 
public telecommunications, networks for public use were to be 
operated on a monopoly basis, whilst complementary and 
value-added services were to be gradually liberalized. 
  Towards the end of 1990, Laws No. 329/90 and No. 346/90 were 
passed covering the regulation and conditions necessary for the 
liberalization of these services. Value-added services may be 
provided by any authorized operator, subject to certain 
conditions regarding security, tariff levels, and information 
content. Complementary services have been separated into mobile 
and fixed services: mobile service provision is subject to 
public tender and under government control, whilst fixed 
services may be offered once a license has been granted. 
Certain further conditions also prevail, such as the fact that 
both fixed and mobile service operators may not transfer their 
license to another operator within three years of setting up 
operations. Nor may a licensed operator take more than a 10 
percent holding in any other operator providing a similar 
service. 
  During 1992, a number of laws have been passed affecting the 
telecommunications sector and these include: 
  -- Law 88/92 (May 1992) established CN-Comunicaoes 
Nacionais, 
SGPS, SA as the holding company for all state holdings in the 
communications sector (i.e., Telecom Portugal, TLP, Marconi 
Comunicaoes Globais, and TDP -- Teledifusora de Portugal), as 
well as postal operators. 
  -- Law 98/92 (May 1992) changed the status of the PTT, 
CTT-Correios de Portugal (or CTT) making it a state-owned public 
limited company. 
  -- Law 186/92 (August 1992) set up a Higher Committee for 
Telecommunications to advise the government regarding 
coordination of the different telecommunications systems in the 
country. 
  -- Law 207/92 (October 1992) set up a new pricing scheme for 
services provided by the public telecommunications operators. 
  -- Law 277/92 (December 1992) established the regulations 
under which Telecom Portugal SA was to exist after separation 
from the CTT. 
  With the introduction of competition, both private companies 
and the three existing public telecommunications operators in 
various collaborative ventures have applied for licenses to 
operate. Altogether, as of May 1993, licenses had been granted 
to two GSM [Global System for Mobile Communications] operators, 
four paging operators, and two fixed data network operators. 
Still under consideration were licenses for two trunked radio 
networks, as well as authorization for around 13 value-added 
services (e.g., video-conferencing, telex, videotex). As of 
September 1993, there had been little further development. 
However, as a result of a public tender, Radiomovil was awarded 
a license to operate a trunked radio network in mid-1993. A 
second operator's license should be awarded towards the end of 
1993. 
  For some time, Portugal has been the only EC country not to 
have introduced some form of tariff rebalancing. The public 
operators have now begun to lower the price of long-distance 
calls and increase the price of local and regional calls, 
thereby bringing Portugal more into line with the rest of 
Europe. Marconi Comunicaoes Globais embarked on rebalancing its 
tariffs in 1992, with Telecom Portugal following suit in 1993. 
  Administration of the Portuguese telecommunications 
environment is the responsibility of the Instituto das 
Comunicaoes de Portugal (ICP -- with full authority finally 
being granted in November 1989 (as a result of Law No. 283/89 
being passed in the preceding August). The government nominates 
the three members of the ICP's Board of Directors, who serve for 
three years, with possible renomination at the end of this 
period. 
  The ICP advises the government on the determination of 
policy 
and legislation, as well as having a series of more specific 
regulatory duties, which include: 
  -- Standardization and type approvals 
  -- Radio electronic spectrum management, planning, and 
supervision 
  -- Setting of tariffs 
  -- Monitoring the operating conditions and quality of the 
basic telecommunications services (i.e., telephone, telex, and 
data transmission service) 
  -- Allocation of licenses to operators of complementary and 
value-added networks and services 
  -- International representation of Portugal in international 
telecommunications organizations, such as ITU, CEPT [European 
Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Offices], OECD, and 
the EC. 
  With offices in Oporto, the Azores, and Madeira, the ICP 
employs 270 people -- half of whom come from the CTT and are 
involved in management of the radio spectrum. The annual budget 
of around US$20 million is generated almost entirely from 
spectrum tariffs. 
<H5>  The PTT Today </H5>
  There are three operators of public telecommunications 
services in Portugal: 
  -- Telecom Portugal 
  -- Telefones de Lisboa e Porto (TLP) 
  -- Marconi Comunicaoes Globais (until recently, Companhia 
Portuguesa Radio Marconi, or CPRM). 
  Since the 1980's there has been a considerable rejuggling 
within the Portuguese telecommunications sector. Figures 1 and 
2 illustrate the changes that have been achieved over the past 
decade. 
<H5>  Telecom Portugal </H5>
  The Portuguese PTT, CTT-Correios de Portugal, ceased being a 
government department in 1970. In accordance with the Basic 
Telecommunications Law (passed in 1989), the CTT's 
telecommunications sector adopted the name Telecom Portugal SA 
in March 1990 and formed an autonomous company. By mid-1991, 
Telecom Portugal was responsible for its own budget and the 
determination of strategies. In December 1992, Telecom Portugal 
finally became a fully-fledged public limited company. 
Telecom Portugal's remit is to provide the fixed telephone and 
telex services for the whole of Portugal, with the exception of 
the cities of Oporto and Lisbon. In addition, the operator 
handles traffic to Europe and the Mediterranean region. 
<H5>  Figure 1. Portugal's Telecommunications Sector, as of 1980 </H5>
  The Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communications 
oversees the Secretary of State for Communications who in turn 
oversees both CTT and TLP. The Ministry of Finances administers 
IPE, who in turn administers CPRM [Portuguese Radio Marconi 
Company]. 
  (Source: "Regulation of Portuguese Communications", Paper 
presented by Mr. Fernando Mendes at the ITU's Asia Telecom '93 
conference, held in May 1993.) 
  Financial results to the end of 1992, published by the CTT- 
Correios de Portugal, include the figures for both postal 
(Correios de Portugal) and telecommunication (Telecom Portugal) 
service providers. Income from operations totaled 232.2 billion 
escudos [Esc] for 1992 (compared with Esc205.0 billion in 1991). 
Income from telecommunications services totaled Esc144.6 
billion (Esc123.7 billion in 1991). 
  Telecom Portugal currently employs around 11,000 staff, but 
there are plans to cut staff numbers by around 18 percent by the 
end of 1994. 
<H5>  Telefones de Lisboa e Porto (TLP) </H5>
  Originally starting its operational activities in 1887 as 
the 
Anglo Portuguese Telephone Company (APT) under a franchise 
contract, Telefones de Lisboa e Porto (TLP) holds the monopoly 
over the fixed telephone service within the Oporto and Lisbon 
regions. Although TLP provides service coverage to barely 3 
percent of the territory, this includes provision of services to 
the most densely populated areas and the major business centers. 
TLP is a 100 percent publicly owned company. 
  -- TLP's net profit for 1992 totaled Esc1,279.9 million 
(down 
from Esc1,472.4 million in 1991), with cashflow reaching Esc28.6 
billion (an increase of 7 percent over 1991). Income from 
operations jumped by 14 percent to Esc17.6 billion. 
  -- The number of employees fell by 2.5 percent during 1992 
to 
total 10,343. This brought the ratio of employees to main lines 
to just over seven employees to 1,000 main lines. 
  Over the past few years, TLP's investment in the 
infrastructure has been considerable. During 1992, investment 
in telecommunications made up around 84 percent (Esc42,235 
million) of the total Esc50,275 million -- 33 percent of which 
went on switching and 41 percent on outside plant. 
  Like the other public operators, TLP is also concerned with 
strengthening its involvement in the domestic telecommunications 
market, and with the advent of competition it sees investment in 
these competing operators as a strategic move. One such 
investment is TLP's 50 percent holding in TELEPAC, which totaled 
Esc2 billion -- 77 percent of the operator's total financial 
investment of Esc2.6 billion for 1992. 
  Altogether, TLP holds stakes in 19 companies -- including a 
number of joint-venture companies with one or both of the other 
operators -- representing an overall investment of Esc6.3 
billion. Figure 2 shows the structure of TLP.

  The Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communications 
oversees the Secretary of State for Communications. Reporting 
directly to the Secretary of State for Communications are CN- 
Comunicacoes Nacionais (Financial Holding for Communications) 
and Instituto das Comunicacoes de Portugal. CN-Comunicacoes 
Nacionais oversees: Post, Telecom Portugal, TLP, CPRM and TDP. 
Post, Telecom Portugal, TLP and CPRM are Reserved Areas (Post, 
Fixed Telephone and Telex). 
  Instituto das Comunicacoes de Portugal oversees three 
Competition Areas: a) Public Competition (Complementary), 
comprising TMN [Telecomunicacoes Moveis Nacionais], TLM, 
TELEPAC, SEVATEL, CTT-Azores and CTT-Madeira; b) Private 
Competition (Complementary), comprising Telecel, Telechamada, 
Finacom, Contactel and Comnexo; and c) Private Competition 
(Value- Added Services), comprising Televoz, Audiomedia, Mor 
Audio Tel, On Street Marketing, STVA, Interinfo, Telebanco, 
INMTEL, Teleworld. 
  Instituto das Comunicacoes de Portugal is also overseeing 
(along with CN-Comunicacoes Nacionais) the reserved areas of 
Post, Fixed Telephone and Telex. (Source: "Regulation of 
Portuguese Communications", Paper presented by Mr. Fernando 
Mendes at the ITU's Asia Telecom '93 conference, held in May,

<H5>  Marconi Comunicaoes Globais </H5>
  Starting operations under a franchise contract in 1922, 
Marconi Comunicaoes Globais (until recently known as Companhia 
Portuguesa Radio Marconi, or CPRM, and currently in the process 
of changing its name) was originally set up to provide reliable 
communications with offshore islands (i.e., the Azores and 
Madeira) and Portuguese colonies and interests in Africa and the 
Far East. The state has a controlling share of 51 percent in 
Marconi Comunicaoes Globais. 
  Marconi Comunicaoes Globais is responsible for telex and 
intercontinental communications, provided via satellite and 
submarine cable networks which it has developed in partnership 
with other international telecommunications operators. During 
the 1990's, the company has become more diversified in its range 
of services and has started to offer mobile communications, 
value-added services, and business communications. 
  -- During 1992, Marconi Comunicaoes Globais generated income 
of Esc42,561 million (Esc41,010 million in 1991) and net profits 
of Esc3,671 million (Esc7,565 million in 1991). Cashflow stood 
at Esc8,160 million -- down from Esc11,327 million in 1991. 
Investments totaled Esc9,991 million, compared with Esc16,024 
million in 1991. 
  -- For the first quarter of 1993, Marconi Comunicaoes 
Globais 
showed an increase in net profit (Esc1 billion) of 5 percent on 
the 1992 first quarter results. Turnover for the period was 
Esc10.4 billion. Of this figure, the telephone service 
contributed Esc8.2 billion (up 8 percent on 1992) -- notable 
given that the tariff rates were 21 percent lower during the 
1993 first quarter than in 1992. Investment of Esc625 million 
was also carried out during the 1993 first quarter, with the 
majority channeled into the development of the global 
telecommunications network. 
  -- For the first six months of 1993, the company reported 
profits of Esc2 billion (up 11 percent on 1992) and cashflow of 
Esc4.5 billion (up 12 percent on 1992). 
  During 1992, the demand for international telephony services 
increased by 14 percent, whilst mobile, data, and 
videoconferencing services showed increases of over 25 percent. 
This growth was due largely to the increase in the network 
capacity, as well as the introduction of new services for large 
business customers (e.g., VPN [Virtual Private Network] 
networks, ATM [Asynchronous Transfer Mode] switching, high-speed 
transmission, and frame relay services). A further result of 
the tariff cuts during 1992, was a significant growth (16.9 
percent) in intercontinental traffic. 
  In addition to the joint-venture companies formed with the 
other public telecommunications operators, Marconi Comunicaoes 
Globais has major holdings in a number of telecoms-related 
companies: 
  -- Contactel -- (51 percent) Portugal's second paging 
operator 
  -- Marconi SVA -- (90 percent) provider of value-added 
services 
  -- Telesotto-Sociedade de Videotex, SA (45 percent) 
  -- Marconi-Sprint, Lda (51 percent) -- Set up in mid-1991, 
this is US Sprint's first venture into the Portuguese market and 
offers international voice and data services 
  -- SUBTEL-Sociedade Portuguesa de Cabos Submarinos 
Telefonicos, Lda (50 percent) 
  Marconi Comunicaoes Globais is a global communications 
company with operations in more than a dozen countries. With 
headquarters in Lisbon, Marconi Comunicaoes Globais has six 
international offices in Brussels (Belgium), Washington DC 
(U.S.A.), Sao Paulo (Brazil), Macau, Angola, and Maputo 
(Mozambique). Marconi Comunicaoes Globais' major international 
joint-venture companies include: 
  -- Mobitel -- (49.5 percent) a company formed with a number 
of local partners in Brazil, offering paging services. The 
license was awarded at the start of 1992 and the service was 
launched in September 1993. 
  -- Guine Telecom -- (51 percent) the operator of the 
national 
telephone network -- also the operator of a land mobile service 
(launched in 1991) with national coverage in Guinea Bissao. 
  -- CST (Companhia Santomense de Telecommunicacoes), SARL 
[Limited liability corporation] -- (51 percent) national 
telephone network operator in Sao Tome and Principe. 
  -- CTM (Companhia de Telecomunicacoes de Macau), SARL -- (28 
percent) national telephone network operator in Macau. 
  -- TELEDATA de Mocambique, Lda -- (50 percent) provider of 
services including videotex and electronic mail in Mozambique. 
  -- Matrix -- provider of paging services in the Philippines, 
Malaysia, and Thailand. 
<H5>  The Onset of Competition and Joint Ventures </H5>
  The 1990's have demanded that the three public 
telecommunications operators become more prepared for 
competition from private operators for customers. In 
particular, the opening to competition of the markets for 
digital cellular telephony, paging, data communications, and 
value-added services has resulted in the three public 
telecommunications operators combining forces in a number of 
complementary service areas to form independent, autonomous 
operations units -- such as TMN. Much of this reorganization is 
taking place through the holding company, CN -- Comunicaoes 
Nacionais. Further reorganization is planned, in particular the 
TELEPAC consortium is expected to incorporate all data services 
including videotex, as well as value-added services (e.g., those 
currently offered by Servatel and Marconi-SVA). 
  -- Telecomunicacoes Moveis Nacionais (TMN) -- jointly owned 
by all three public service operators and licensed to operate 
Portugal's mobile cellular telephone service. 
  -- TELEPAC-Services de Telecomunicacoes SA -- jointly owned 
by TLP and Telecom Portugal and established during the course of 
1992. It brings together the public data transmission and 
videotex services formerly provided by the two operators. 
  -- Telemensagem -- jointly owned by Telecom Portugal (49 
percent) and TLP (51 percent) and is licensed to operate the 
existing public paging service. 
  -- SEVATEL -- a provider of electronic mail (MHS 400) and 
electronic data interchange services. Both TLP (49 percent) and 
Telecom Portugal (51 percent) are shareholders. 
  -- TEXTRAM -- a value-added services provider, specifically 
offering videotex databases for road transport operators. Both 
TLP (20 percent) and Telecom Portugal (20 percent) are 
shareholders. 
<H5>  The Telephone Network </H5>
  While most of Portugal's European neighbors have been 
concentrating on building networks fit for the 1990's, Portugal 
still has a fair way to go before catching up. At 32 lines per 
100 population, Portugal has one of the lowest telephone line 
penetration levels in Western Europe -- although the level for 
urban areas is somewhat higher. 
<H5>  Telecom Portugal </H5>
  In terms of network coverage, Telecom Portugal is the major 
operator of public telecommunications services in Portugal, with 
a network covering around 97 percent of the country and service 
two-thirds of the population. 
  Due to the increase in demand for telecommunications, 
Telecom 
Portugal's installation of telephones has increased from 20,000 
telephones each year at the beginning of the 1980's to 263,000 
telephones in 1992. This has also reduced the numbers waiting 
for telephone connections by 35 percent to 91,400 at the end of 
1992 (141,700 at the end of 1991). 
  As a result, within Telecom Portugal's area of operation, 
the 
number of telephones has grown by 16 percent and telephone 
density has almost doubled in the last four years to reach 25 
telephones per 100 population in 1992 -- compared with 13 
telephones per 100 population in 1988. 
  As well as expanding the network, Telecom Portugal has been 
intent on modernization and, in particular, digitalization of 
the network. Table 1 gives an overview of Telecom Portugal's 
network infrastructure.

<H5>  Telefones de Lisboa e Porto (TLP) </H5>
  TLP's network covers approximately 2,955 square kilometers 
and serves around 3.7 million of the country's population based 
in the Greater Lisbon (within 30 km of the center) and Greater 
Oporto (within 20 km of the center) regions. With only 3 
percent of the country, TLP nevertheless serves a strategic 
market -- namely, 37 percent of the population and 60 percent of 
the country's purchasing power; 80 percent of the country's 
major businesses, including head offices; and Portugal's 
political hub, TLP makes the claim that more than half of 
Portugal's telephone traffic originates from TLP's customers. 
  During 1992, 235,000 lines were installed under the local 
switching program and by the end of 1992, around 51 percent of 
TLP's network was based on digital technology. TLP has also 
been introducing digital transit switching equipment and aims to 
have achieved almost 100 percent digitalization by 1995. 
  The volume of traffic has been increasing rapidly over the 
trunk network, and to cater for this demand TLP has been 
installing fiber-optic cable and digital channels. All urban 
area exchanges are now connected by fiber-optic cable. 
Introduction of fiber-optic cabling in the local network is to 
be started during 1993. Table 2 gives a statistical overview of 
TLP's basic network infrastructure. 
  In terms of the fixed telephone service, TLP connected 
137,000 telephone lines during 1992. The telephone density 
within the TLP's coverage area has increased considerably over 
the last few years, and since 1990 the figure has jumped from 34 
to 40 per 100 population at the end of 1992. 
  At the same time, great efforts have been made to reduce the 
waiting time for connection, and at the end of 1992 this was 
down to less than four months --compared with over ten months in 
1989. With a density of 2.9 public call boxes per 1,000 
population, TLP is introducing cardphones (currently accounting 
for around 25 percent of the total) and call boxes which accept 
ATM payment cards (around 16 percent at end of 1992). The TLP 
has also managed to achieve 89 percent of repairs to call boxes 
carried out within one day of being reported. 
  TLP is planning to introduce SDH [synchronous digital 
hierarchy] transmission technology. With the intention of 
launching two pilot networks in Oporto and Lisbon, TLP was 
asking for equipment suppliers during 1992. At the same time, 
the installation of two Metropolitan Area Networks (in Oporto 
and Lisbon) was planned, which would allow provision of data, 
voice, and image transmission at between 2 and 34M bps [million 
bits per second] -- the project went out to international tender 
during 1992.

<H5>  Marconi Communiacoes Globais </H5>
  As the international communications carrier, Marconi 
Communiacoes Globais' network infrastructure is mainly submarine 
cable and satellite-based. As well as having several satellite 
earth stations and its own radio communications network covering 
Portugal, the Azores, and Madeira, Marconi Communiacoes Globais 
participates directly in over 20 submarine cables around the 
world. 
  During 1991/92, Marconi Communiacoes Globais extended its 
international network infrastructure through its participation 
in several major international ventures and agreements: 
  -- Construction and maintenance contracts for the SAT-2 
(South Africa-Madeira-Canary Islands), TAT-11 (U.S.A., Europe), 
and COLUMBUS II (Caribbean, Madeira, Europe) submarine cable 
systems in 1991, as well as contracts for the TAT 12 and TAT 13 
systems in 1992. The Eurafrica submarine cable system was 
commercially launched in August 1992. 
  -- Inauguration of several satellite earth stations 
including 
Sintra VI (for long-distance traffic) and Sintra VII and VIII 
(for business communications and broadcasting). 
  Marconi Communicaoes Globais is an active participant in 
international satellite organizations INTELSAT, INMARSAT, and 
EUTELSAT. 
<H5>  Data Communications </H5>
  The PSTN [public switched-telephone network] supports 
transmission rates of 1,200 bps [bits per second] asynchronous 
full duplex and up to 2,400 bps asynchronous half duplex. 
  Portugal's X.25 packet-switched network, TELEPAC, started on 
an experimental basis in 1984 and opened to public service in 
1985. Formerly known as Transdata, the TELEPAC network is 
operated by the TELEPAC consortium (established in 1992), which 
is a joint venture between Telecom Portugal and TLP -- each 
responsible for operations in their respective geographical 
areas. Both public operators currently own an equal share, but 
it is probable that a third party may also eventually take a 
share. As well as data transmission services, TELEPAC also 
offers videotex services (launched in 1989) and private circuits 
on a non-exclusive basis. 
  The TELEPAC network is based around three main centers: 
Oporto, Coimbra, and Lisbon. Lisbon also has an international 
transit code. The network conforms to ITU-T (formerly CCITT 
[Consultative Committee of International Telephone and 
Telegraph]) recommendations X.3, X.25, X.28, and X.75 protocols. 
Access lines are available at speeds of up 19.2k (19,200] bps, 
64k [64,000] bps, and 2M bps (in most central locations). 
Towards the end of 1992, the TELEPAC network served an 
estimated subscriber base of around 10,000 for data transmission 
and videotex services. There are possibly plans to introduce 
frame relay technology into the network. 
  Equipment for the network infrastructure has been supplied 
by 
various companies including Northern Telecom and Nokia (through 
it's local distributor, Omnitecnica). 
<H5>  Mobile Communications </H5>
  Portugal's first mobile cellular telephone network was set 
up 
in 1988 when the then CTT awarded Siemens a contract to install 
the infrastructure for a C-450 mobile radio system, called 
Telemovel. Since Telemovel was launched, there has been a change 
in the operation of public mobile communications with the 
creation of Telecomunicacoes Moveis Nacionais (TMN). TMN is a 
joint-venture company involving all three public 
telecommunications operators, and operates mobile services 
throughout Portugal -- including the Telemovel cellular service. 
  More recently, there has been the award of two GSM operating 
licenses. The demand for the GSM service has been dramatic and 
within the first four months of operation there were more 
subscribers than the old analog Telemovel system had attracted 
in more than four years. 
  TMN was awarded the first GSM operating license and launched 
its GSM service in October 1992. It is now looking to expand 
its network infrastructure and in July 1993, awarded Motorola 
ECID a contract to supply equipment for this expansion. TMN is 
currently concentrating on coverage of the main commercial 
centers, i.e., Lisbon and Oporto, for which Motorola is 
providing sectored base stations. Coverage of Lisbon was due to 
be completed during Summer 1993. Infrastructure equipment 
(i.e., base station controllers, base transceiver stations, and 
an operations and maintenance center) have already been supplied 
by Motorola for TMN's service in the Algarve and Alentejo 
regions. 
  In August 1991, the Portuguese government awarded the 
U.S.-backed consortium, Telecel Comunicacoes Pessoais SA, the 
license to operate a private GSM mobile telephone network in 
Portugal. Telecel had been up against six other consortia in 
the selection process and was strongly criticized at the time 
for its unrealistically high investment and subscriber 
projections. At the same time, it also caused anxiety in the 
rest of Europe, that the chosen operator should be heavily 
influenced by its non-European backer, Pacific Telesis, which 
has a 23 percent stake. Telecel is a Portuguese company formed 
by two major Portuguese financial groups, Espirito Santa and 
Amorim. In addition to PacTel, the other shareholders are 
Centrel, Efacec, and LCC. 
  Telecel's nationwide GSM network was officially inaugurated 
in October 1992. At this initial stage, the network offered 
coverage to around 80 percent of the population and permitted 
the use of both transportable mobiles and hand-held telephones. 
By 1996, the system should serve around 150,000 subscribers and 
cover 85 percent of the territory. 
  Ericsson won the contract worth US$150 million to supply the 
network, which is based on three switching nodes, three 
operation and maintenance centers, a network management center, 
and more than 100 base stations. 
<H5>  Paging </H5>
  In 1990, with backing from Telecom Portugal and TLP, a new 
company, Telemensagem, launched Portugal's first public paging 
service, Telebip. The initial coverage area was Lisbon, Oporto, 
and part of the Algarve region. By the end of 1991, there were 
some 6,200 subscribers. 
  Portugal's paging market has since been opened up to 
competition from other operators, and as a result there are now 
a total of four paging operators, including Telemensagem. 
  In October 1991, the Contactel consortium, in which Marconi 
Communiacoes Globais has a 51 percent holding, took part in the 
tender for a nationwide paging license in Portugal, and in April 
1992 the consortium was awarded a license to operate the Contact 
service. Other partners in Contactel are Telefonica (Spain) and 
Matrix (Australia). 
  The Ericsson subsidiaries, Sociedade Ericsson de Portugal 
and 
Ericsson Magnetic, won the contract worth US$4.1 million to 
install the infrastructure for Portugal's first privately 
operated paging system. There are three phases of installation: 
The first phase (completed early 1993) covered installation of 
30 base stations and covered the metropolitan areas of Lisbon 
and Oporto, as well as some rural regions. The other two paging 
operators are Sinacom and Telechamada -- both have been in 
operation since 1992. 
<H5>  Text Services </H5>
  Portugal's telex network, divided into eight zones, covers 
the major cities of Lisbon, Coimbra, Braga, Faro, and Aviero, as 
well as the islands of Madeira and the Azores. The telex links 
to Madeira are over submarine cable and those to the Azores are 
via satellite. 
  The use of facsimile services has grown rapidly in Portugal 
over the last few years -- at the expense of the telex service. 
Over 1992, there was a 33 percent growth in use. Telecom 
Portugal and TLP jointly operate the Corfac public facsimile 
service with offices located in the major cities. 
  One of Marconi Comunicaoes Globais' associate companies, 
Marconi SVA, launched commercial operations of an e-mail service 
-- Email 400 -- in Portugal in July 1992. 
<H5>  ISDN [Integrated Services Digital Network] </H5>
  Telecom Portugal's pre-ISDN service, Diginet, offers small 
and medium-sized businesses access to the public switched 
network through 2M bps digital links. 
  Telecom Portugal has been operating ISDN services to private 
companies on an experimental basis until the start of 1993. 
Both basic rate (2B+D) and primary rate (30B+D) access have 
been available. A commercial launch of ISDN was planned for 
Summer 1993. 
  TLP carried out a series of pilot trials in Lisbon and 
Oporto 
during 1991, with basic and primary rate accesses to a 
restricted number of customers to test new signaling protocols. 
TLP launched basic and primary rate access ISDN during 1992. 
  Both Telecom Portugal and TLP are committed to the 
introduction of Euro-ISDN and this was reaffirmed at a meeting 
of the 26 European operators in Bruges, Belgium, in June 1993. 
The meeting was to finalize details regarding the launch of the 
European digital network, which is due in December 1993. 
<H5>  The Future </H5>
  Portugal's immediate aims are to bring the telephone density 
level up to the European average as quickly as possible, as well 
as working towards removing the cross- subsidy that currently 
exists between the telecommunication and the postal services 
sectors. At the same time, increased competition within the 
various telecommunications market sectors is the way ahead and 
will be encouraged. It is envisaged that there will be a 
reluctance on the part of the public service operators to the 
changes that are likely to occur -- particularly when the result 
will inevitably be an erosion of their market share. 
  Portugal is, nevertheless, moving in the same direction as 
the rest of Europe -- albeit somewhat more slowly than most EC 
countries. In June 1993, the members states of the EC agreed to 
allow competition in domestic and international telephony 
markets throughout the region by 1 January 1998. Having one of 
the less developed telecommunications networks in the EC -- 
along with Ireland, Spain, and Greece -- Portugal has been 
granted an extra five years to modernize the network 
infrastructure before having to comply with the EC directive. 
  The move towards privatization of the operators is being 
undertaken in a controlled manner. With one single holding 
company for all three public telecommunications operators, the 
idea is to coordinate the gradual introduction of private 
capital into all of them -- rather than throw the market open to 
competition. It is hoped that this will avoid the problem of 
the most profitable sectors being eagerly skimmed off to leave 
the state holding the remaining sectors. Although no timescale 
has yet been set, there is speculation that the privatization 
process will be set in motion during 1994.
