<F P=106> [Anatoliy Martsynovskyy report: "The Black Surprise of </F>
Chernobyl"] 
  [Text] A few days ago, chairman of the Supreme Council 
"Chernobyl" Commission Volodymyr Yavorivskyy convened a news 
conference: Journalists met with Russian geochemist Valeriy 
Kopeykin. Over seven and a half years, the scientist has 
studied the geochemical consequences of the Chernobyl 
catastrophe. The following was stated. 
  The initial optimistic predictions on possible processes of 
dissolution of the nuclear fallout after the accident turned out 
to be erroneous, because they did not take into account the laws 
of the geochemical migration of elements, including 
radionuclides. Already in 1987, strontium-90 was revealed in 
the cooler pond; in the summer of 1989, plutonium was found in 
subsurface waters in the area of the red woods, where 
radioactive waste was buried. At present, seven and a half 
years after the accident, there appeared a new and the most 
dangerous radioactive nuclide -- americium-241. 
  It is a derivative element of plutonium-241 (which, by the 
time of the catastrophe, was produced at the fourth power unit 
of the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Plant [AES] in quantities 
greater than those of plutonium-238, 239, and 240 by a factor of 
55). From the medical point of view, americium is much more 
dangerous than plutonium-239, and its half-life period is 433 
years. From the geochemical point of view, it must be a good 
water migrant. By, approximately, the year 2060, the 
alpha-activity of americium-241 will become twice that of 
plutonium. 
  Thus, a question has arisen of introducing changes into 
corresponding "Chernobyl" laws of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, 
of expanding the estrangement zone, and of taking necessary 
comprehensive measures for creating barriers that would prevent 
a further spread of dangerous radioactive elements, first and 
foremost, americium-241. 
  "We felt that Chernobyl would not `calm down' and that there 
would be `surprises,'" said Volodymyr Yavorivskyy. "Here is the 
first one." 
  Yavorivskyy called upon scientists of the world to 
cooperate: 
If somebody wants to conduct analyses on his own and see for 
himself the scope of the tragedy, let him arrive; he will be 
given such an opportunity. The Supreme Council decision on 
continuing the operation of the Chernobyl AES was criticized. 
  Meanwhile, the situation at the Chernobyl AES continues to 
deteriorate. The five-centimeter thick layer of soil around the 
plant is contaminated. The third-turn channels (that is to say, 
the fifth and the sixth power units) are constantly 
contaminated, and so is the cooler pond. According to Professor 
Kopeykin, subsurface water contamination is increasing. Due to 
the stoppage, as a result of the accident, of the numerous 
drainage systems, the level of subsurface waters has risen by 
between two and four meters, and this also causes the danger of 
spreading the radionuclides. 
  The news conference also discussed other Chernobyl-related 
questions. Volodymyr Yavorivskyy stated, in particular, that 
the Cabinet of Ministers plans to grant benefits only to 
first-category victims [of the Chernobyl catastrophe]. At the 
same time, it was pointed out that much capital goes on 
unnecessary studies and on excessively large personnel of 
scientists who work in the Chernobyl system (incidentally, 
outside the zone). Deputy Procurator General Olha Kolinska 
encouraged the audience by her decisive mood regarding the 
struggle against mass abuses in the zone.

<F P=106> [Report by O. Novak: "Chernobyl Threatens With New </F>
Punishments"] 
  [Text] I remember warnings voiced in 1986, following the 
accident on the fourth block of the Chernobyl nuclear power 
plant. Scientists predicted that its consequences will be felt 
long after the catastrophe. However, these opinions were 
withheld from the press by censors, and any forecasts that did 
not match the official standpoint were deemed as a provocation 
and panicking. Further events proved that official declarations 
were a pack of lies that caused suffering to many innocent 
people. This is why today, everything that concerns the 
Chernobyl accident is not being rejected without looking into it 
with maximum attention. This is not being done for the sake of 
scaring anybody, but for the sake of protecting the health and 
lives of the living and future generations. 
  These opinions belong to Volodymyr Yavorivskyy, Ukrainian 
Supreme Soviet Chernobyl Committee chairman and were expressed 
at a news conference devoted to the revelation by Russian Doctor 
of Geology V. Kopeykin. The latter spent seven years conducting 
tests at the contaminated zone around Chernobyl. Speaking at 
the news conference, Professor Kopeykin, in particular pointed 
out that enhanced activity of certain radionuclides have been 
observed since the accident. In his opinion, previous forecasts 
regarding the dissolution of the radioactive fallout were 
erroneous. Thus, it was believed that plutonium would be 
discovered there within 10 to 14 years after the accident, but 
it appeared in 1987, in subterranean waters in the vicinity of 
the "red forest" where nuclear waste was buried. By the way, 
even then, official sources did not reveal the whole truth, and 
there were claims that only 3 percent of the plutonium had been 
emitted into the environment. According to V. Kopeykin, the 
content of the hazardous component was no less than 30 percent. 
Professor Kopeykin believes that those forecasts did not take 
into account the laws of the geochemical migration of 
radionuclides. According to his calculations, the area 
contaminated with plutonium is about 100 square kilometers. 
Other hazardous elements, including americium-241 and 
icyrium-241 [as published], whose period of disintegration 
reaches hundreds of years, were found in the area too. These 
elements are particularly dangerous to the human liver. The 
mentioned radionuclides were discovered not only in subterranean 
waters, but also in cuts of pines, birches, and apple-trees 
growing in the zone. 
  It is surprising that the scientist's research has received 
no attention from the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. The 
Academy disregarded the official invitation and did not send its 
representatives to the news conference. 
  Concluding the conference, Volodymyr Yavorivskyy emphasized 
that problems connected with overcoming the aftermath of the 
Chernobyl accident must be resolved jointly by Ukraine, Russia, 
Belarus, and the entire European community.

  [Text] Ukraine has no money to install the automatic 
radioactive atmospheric pollution monitoring station that was a 
gift to the nuclear power station in Rovne from President Lech 
Walesa. 
  [Correspondent Olga Iwaniak] The station was to have served 
the permanent monitoring of pollution arising from the work of 
this power station, which is situated something over 100 kms 
from the border with Poland. Meanwhile, the equipment, which is 
worth $10,000, is standing idle in the power station warehouse 
since the power station has got drastically poorer in recent 
times, has no money for indispensible maintenance and wage 
payments for employees, and so still less for the construction 
of cement foundations on which the station could be planted. 
The management fears that construction of the station without 
the appropriate security measures at a distance of four kms from 
the power station, even under guard, will be an attraction for 
thieves and that the equipment will dissapear overnight, within 
a day. 
  There are five great nuclear power stations in Ukraine, up 
to 
800 kms from our border, every one of which is going through 
similar financial difficulties. Their state of security is 
unsatisfactory, their personnel are demoralized by low wages. 
There are ever more frequent thefts from the fissile materials 
stores. Despite these threats, the exploitation of nuclear 
energy is a necessity for Ukraine -- it provides around 40 
percent of the electric energy indispensible for the functioning 
of the state -- whereas it will be necessary to pay in dollars 
for energy sources imported from Russia from January.

<F P=106> [Statement by Greenpeace in Russia: "`Treasures' of the </F>
Baltic"] 
  [Text] The main military bases to have become sources 
of pollution of the Baltic are situated in Chernyakhovka and 
Tartu, where strategic bombers are located, and also the bases 
of submarines and ships capable of carrying nuclear weapons. 
These are Kotlin (Kronshtadt), Oraniyenbaum, Ventspils, 
Liyepaya, Klaipeda, Paldiyeski, Tallinn, Baltiysk and 
Kaliningrad. 
  Among the best-known incidents in the Baltic are the dumping 
of chemical weapons which occurred from 1951 through the start 
of the 1980's and the accident that occurred on a Soviet 
submarine in September 1981, when several explosions were 
recorded and the submarine itself, which was carrying nuclear 
weapons, was towed to a base in Kaliningrad. A similar incident 
occurred on 27 October 1981, when a Soviet Whiskey-class 
submarine carrying nuclear weapons ran aground in the area of 
the Karlskrona Swedish military base. On 25 October 1976 Finnish 
seismological stations registered an earthquake in the area of 
the Soviet naval base in Paldiyeski. Approximately 20 persons 
were hospitalized, and, according to certain information, a 
series of explosions at storehouses of the base, which were 
accompanied by a leak of toxic substances into the Baltic, had 
been taken to be an earthquake. Releases of radioactive 
substances from the nuclear power station at Sosnovyy Bor have 
been recorded on several occasions also.... 
  ...In addition, leaks of toxic waste from the military 
plants 
in Kaliningrad and Riga and also from enterprises mining 
urano-phosphate in Sillamae have occurred repeatedly. 
<H5>  Dumping of Chemical Weapons </H5>
  The dumping of chemical weapons and military-produced 
chemical waste in the Baltic began in 1951. In accordance with 
an order of Marshal of the Soviet Union R. Malinovskiy dated 16 
December 1949, an inspection was conducted at dumps where 
captured arms of the German, Italian, Romanian, and Japanese 
armies were stored: mainly aerial bombs, artillery shells, 
antipersonnel mines, and canister war gas. The inspection was 
completed by the start of October 1950, and several tens of 
thousands of weapons not conforming to safety standards were 
discovered. A decision was made a month later to dump the 
munitions in the sea. Three regions were selected, in accordance 
with Marshal R. Malinovskiy's proposal, for the burials: areas 
of the White and Barents Seas and also the Baltic. 
  One of the biggest dumps was located at Arkhangelsk Oblast's 
Obozerskaya Station. A large part of the 
munitions--antipersonnel mines and artillery shells--was shipped 
out and dropped in the White Sea. But approximately 200 tonnes 
of munitions, mainly 50-100 kg aerial bombs containing sarin, 
mustard gas, and lewisite from 1938-1939 manufacture were 
transported to the ports of Liyepaya and Klaipeda for dumping in 
the Baltic. Some of the munitions of 1941-1943 manufacture 
stored at dumps at Leonidovka Station near Stalingrad (now 
Volgograd) were sent to the port of Tallinn. The trains were 
accompanied by students of the Saratov School for Chemical 
Defense Forces. One of them, Colonel (retired) Nikolay Masterov, 
said: 
  "We shipped the munitions out from May 1951 through November 
1955. At the port of Tallinn we transferred the aerial bombs 
from the trains onto barges of the local maritime shipping 
company chartered by the Ministry of Defense. As far as I know, 
the munitions were dumped straight into the waters of the port, 
and some were taken to the area of Saarema Island. The seamen 
told me that some bombs were shot up at close range to help them 
sink." 
  According to the information of witnesses and participants 
in 
the chemical weapons sinking operations, burials were carried 
out in 1961-1968, 1972-1973, and 1979 also. According to Captain 
1st Rank V. Nikitin, former deputy commander of Kronshtadt Naval 
Base for rear support, the sinking of the captured munitions had 
been completed by the start of the 1970's. According to his 
information, 235 points in the Baltic and the Gulf of Finland 
where the burials were performed had been plotted on military 
maps. At the same time, on the other hand, a considerable number 
of burial places were not plotted on maps. A. Filippovskiy, a 
reserve lieutenant captain, who served on transport vessel 324 
registered with the Ventspils Naval Base in 1969-1972, said that 
in half the cases the ship did not reach the point assigned in 
the order, dumping its cargo at the first point in the sea which 
it came to, frequently off the coast. 
  Aside from captured munitions, the dumping of Soviet 
chemical 
weapons which had outlived their service life into the Barents 
and White Seas, the Sea of Kars, and the Baltic began at the 
start of the 1970's. Ascertaining the precise quantity of 
weapons dumped is impossible since all the information on this 
is still under "top-secret" classification. But according to a 
naval officer who requested that his name not be mentioned, 
approximately 90 freight cars carrying chemical munitions for 
dumping arrived at the base in Paldiyeski in the period from May 
through July 1975 alone. 
  Russia's official position on this issue was expressed by 
Lieutenant General Anatoliy Kuntsevich, deputy commander of 
Russia's chemical forces. He said in an interview: 
  "We have never denied that in the 1950's the Soviet Union in 
conjunction with Great Britain and some other West European 
countries buried chemical weapons in the Baltic. But I know of 
not a single instance of the burial of chemical weapons since 
this time." 
  Gen. A. Kuntsevich declined to comment on the witnesses' 
testimony. He observed, it is true, that the burial places are 
not monitored and that no one knows the present condition of the 
sunken munitions or their preservation and safety for the 
environment. 
<H5>  Dumping of Radioactive Substances </H5>
  The Soviet authorities denied the whole time that they were 
to blame for the contamination of the Baltic by radioactive 
substances. Nonetheless, according to witnesses' testimony, at 
least two nuclear warheads were sunk in the sea in the period 
since 1964. One of them was lost in March 1976 during a patrol 
flight over the sea from a MiG-21 fighter registered with the 
air base in Tartu. 
  In August 1973 there was an accident on a Golf 2-class 
submarine registered with the Kaliningrad Base, as a result of 
which it was decided to jettison propellant in order to maintain 
buoyancy. As a result of a mistake by the crew, one of the six 
torpedoes sank into the sea. 
  Viktor Gerasimenko, who worked from 1984 through 1988 at the 
nuclear power station at Sosnovyy Bor, maintains that water in 
the station's sumps following the cooling of reactors frequently 
flowed into the reservoirs flowing into the Baltic. 
<H5>  Dumping of Toxic Waste </H5>
  Aside from the dumping from submarines and surface ships of 
the navy which occurred repeatedly as a result of accidents, the 
warship-maintenance plant in Kaliningrad and the plant 
manufacturing rocket engines in Riga also dump highly toxic 
waste in the Baltic. It is practically impossible to establish 
the precise amounts of the discharges since civilian control 
inspections and employees of sanitary supervision offices are 
not admitted to the military enterprises. The results of 
inspections by military control services are under a 
"top-secret" stamp. 
  Aleksandr Kocheyev, who until 1990 was an engineer at the 
Riga Rocket Engines Plant, said that the plant's waste is 
usually dumped in the River Daugava without any preliminary 
purification, from where it subsequently ends up in the Baltic. 
  Two accidents accompanied by a leak of waste into the sea 
occurred in 1992. Two phosphate containers were lost from a 
dry-cargo ship registered to the Tallinn Seaport and en route to 
Finland. During loading at the port of Riga of a consignment of 
copper intended for Sweden part of the cargo sank into the 
maritime bay in July of that same year. During the control 
inspection it was ascertained that the copper had been heavily 
contaminated by radionuclides.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Brice Lalonde Recommends Creation </F>
of Environment Council for GATT"] 
  [Text] Charged by Edouard Balladur with a "study and 
proposal assignment," related to the Uruguay Round negotiations, 
on "the relationship between trade and the environment," the 
chairman of the Generation Ecologie [Ecological Generation] 
party Brice Lalonde submitted a report to the prime minister on 
Thursday, December 9 entitled "Injecting an Ecological Aspect 
Into the Rules of International Trade." 
  In this document, the Generation Ecologie chairman first 
states that GATT "does not intend making environmental 
protection its watchword, but is instead interested in it 
because it might upset trade. This negative approach ... is not 
acceptable. GATT must recognize that it is a legitimate cause 
to want to protect the environment and to examine how trade can 
harm or contribute to this protection." 
  In this context, Brice Lalonde recommends that "an 
environmental council be created" for GATT, "or for its 
successor, the world trade organization." With a view to 
creating this new council, his report proposes that "whatever 
the outcome of the Uruguay Round on 15 December," negotiators 
should "remain at the negotiating table to ensure that the 
signatory states take a decision (or make a statement) 
concerning the launch of a working program for the environment." 
He continued: "This decision or declaration must be made when 
the agreement is officially signed in Marrakesh in April. It 
should therefore be ready, together with its working program, by 
this date." 
  The former environment minister defined a 10-point working 
program built on the following principles: Begin studies into 
the environmental impact of the trade agreements; codify the 
environmental protection measures which affect trade; draw up 
procedures for the establishment or acceptance of standards; 
define the ecological limits of fair competition; authorize 
preferential agreements that favor ecology; and organize, when 
the environment is threatened, the legal examination and 
settlement of disputes within a strengthened institution. 
  When he presented his report to the press, Brice Lalonde 
made 
it clear that the prime minister had agreed with the idea of 
creating an environment council.

<F P=106> [Article signed KV: "European CO2/Energy Tax Is Total </F>
Misfire -- EC To Ratify Rio Climate Convention Later This Year"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The EC member states will ratify the Rio 
Convention on climate change before the end of this year. They 
undertake to stabilize the emission of greenhouse gases, but 
fail to call for a CO2/energy tax as a tool to reach that goal. 
The EC environment ministers did agree, however, that in five 
years' time no more than half of the packaging waste should end 
up on the garbage dump. By then at least one-quarter of the 
garbage should be recycled. 
  The "UN Framework Agreement on Climate Change" was solemnly 
signed in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. The signing parties 
committed themselves to stabilize the emission of gases causing 
the greenhouse effect. On a previous occasion, the EC member 
states had already agreed to stabilize this emission on the 1990 
level by the year 2000. Several countries, including Belgium, 
had committed themselves to reduce the CO2 emission by the turn 
of the century. In a common statement, six member states (the 
Benelux countries, Germany, Denmark, and Italy) had opted for 
the implementation of a CO2/energy tax as a tool to meet their 
commitments. They had linked the ratification of the Rio 
Convention to a go-ahead for the European environment tax. 
  Yesterday, this linkage was dropped after all. It was merely 
agreed that a whole range of additional tools must be created, 
and that the talks on the Commission's proposal regarding the 
implementation of a European CO2/energy tax must be concluded by 
the end of 1994. At present, some 40 countries have ratified 
the Rio climate convention. The treaty will become effective as 
soon as 50 countries have ratified it. 
  The EC environment ministers also reached an agreement on 
the 
management of packaging waste. Five years after the directive 
has come into effect, the member states must valorize at least 
50 and at the most 65 percent of their packaging waste. Between 
25 and 40 percent of the latter must be recycled. Countries 
such as the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark might aim at 
higher recycling criteria, providing they do not disturb the 
single market and do not jeopardize the directive's 
implementation in other EC member states. So Germany is no 
longer entitled to merely dump its waste in neighboring 
countries. The waste directive must now return to the European 
Parliament for a second reading, and must then be resubmitted to 
the ministers for approval.

<F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, Dec 21 (AFP) -- Sweden and Austria 
reported a breakthrough here Tuesday in their negotiations to 
join the European Community along with Norway and Finland on 
January 1, 1995. 
  They said the four countries had won the right to maintain 
high environmental and health standards which exceed the E.C.'s 
harmonised single market rules. 
  Swedish European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel said: 
"This 
is a major breakthrough." 
  The term was also used by Austrian Foreign Minister Alois 
Mock to describe the enlargement negotiations which must be 
finalised by March 1 next year if the four applicants are to 
join the E.C. as scheduled by the 1995 target date. 
  Tuesday's negotiations between E.C. foreign ministers and 
their counterparts from the four applicant countries did not 
touch on agricultural subsidies -- the most controversial 
unresolved issue. 
  Norway, Finland and Austria are all insisting on retaining 
their high levels of protection for fragile Alpine, Arctic and 
sub-Arctic farms, which are far higher than the maximum levels 
permitted by the E.C. 
  But Mock said he believed this problem could be overcome by 
the target date of March 1. 
  E.C. officials said the candidate countries had been given a 
four-year period -- until 1999 -- to maintain their high 
environmental standards after joining the E.C. 
  Over that period the E.C. will try to raise its own 
standards 
to match those of the newcomers. 
  The decision applies to such issues as automobile emissions, 
lead-free petrol, product health labels, waste disposal and 
restrictions on toxic substances. 
  The E.C. had earlier objected that excessively strict 
"green" 
regulations could hinder the free flow of products around the 
enlarged community. 
  But the four countries all replied that their electorates 
would not tolerate a lowering of environmental standards as the 
price of joining the E.C. 
  Pressed on whether Sweden and the other three countries 
might 
have to lower their standards after 1999, the Swedish minister 
said: "There is no reason whatsoever to believe that there will 
be any lowering of standards." 
  In another concession, the E.C. also gave Swedes an 
exemption 
from a community health law that bans wet snuff or "snus" -- a 
tobacco derivative. 
  And Sweden will be allowed to continue selling snus to 
Norwegians. 
  Dinkelspiel called this a "Christmas present" from E.C. 
negotiators, which overcame emotional Swedish resistance to any 
ban on wet snuff. 
  Sweden will also be allowed to maintain a state monopoly on 
retail selling of alcohol, but not on liquor imports or 
wholesaling. 
  The monopoly, an attempt to limit alcohol use, contravenes 
E.C. free trade regulations. 
  Diplomats said the four candidate countries had 
unconditionally accepted most of the E.C.'s Maastricht union 
treaty, which came into force on November 1. 
  It provides for common foreign and security policies, 
economic integration leading to a single currency, and 
cooperation in immigration and justice affairs. 
  However, there was no final accord on the single currency 
issue because of a Spanish threat on Monday to hold up the 
enlargement negotiations on the grounds that the four candidate 
countries, being relatively wealthy, would upset the economic 
balance in the E.C. 
  Spanish European Affairs Minister Carlos Westendorp had said 
enlargement would make it more difficult for Spain to qualify 
for a single currency bloc by 1999. 
  But Mock said this was just an "internal problem" of the 
E.C. 
  And Dinkelspiel warned that the four candidate countries 
would not accept any special rules to reduce their influence in 
the process to decide when the single currency bloc would be 
established and which countries were eligible to join.

<F P=106> [Article by Katarina Koivisto: "Finland Should Take Care of </F>
Its Own Nuclear Waste"] 
  [Text] 

  -  In the future, Finland should take care of the nuclear 
waste that is produced in this country. The Ministry of Trade 
and Industry will look into what changes are needed in 
legislation and prior administrative decisions to guarantee 
this. As large a part of basic energy needs as possible should 
be supplied by natural gas plus solutions involving new 
technology based on peat, wood, and other domestic energy 
sources. It may be necessary for the state to participate in 
finding another supply source for gas. The permit procedure in 
connection with importing electricity will be retained to enable 
the state to supervise the safety and environmental 
acceptability of the imported energy. 
  These three points are new features in the energy policy 
statement the government sent to the parliament on Wednesday [24 
November]. The statement clearly reveals a more positive view of 
natural gas, but it points out that it will not be possible to 
import Norwegian gas to Finland before the beginning of the next 
decade at the earliest. 
  "Nothing new has happened," said Marketing Director Harry 
Anton of Neste. "We are in constant contact with both the Swedes 
and the Norwegians, but there is still no one in Sweden who 
plans to start importing Norwegian gas. A pipeline through 
Sweden is needed to get the Norwegian gas to Finland." 
  Nevertheless, Anton sees the statement as a positive signal 
from the government and hopes it will also be regarded in this 
light in Sweden. The negotiations with Norway are becoming more 
urgent in view of the fact that the Norwegians must eventually 
decide where they are going to build supply pipelines for their 
gas. On the other hand, the Meripori coal power plant and the 
combined power plant that will probably be built in Skoldvik 
will provide new electricity production capacity, giving Finland 
a little more time in the natural gas negotiations, Anton 
pointed out. 
<H5>  Electricity Needs Increase </H5>
  The government's energy policy statement assumes that 
electricity consumption will increase at an annual rate of 2 
percent during the next 10 years. This means that Finland will 
need 2,000 MW in new production capacity by 2005 and 3,500 MW by 
2010. The need is based on the fact that, in addition to 
increased consumption, old capacity will be phased out. 
  Imported electricity is one alternative in the energy policy 
statement, but the government assumes that it will be imported 
only from countries that observe international environmental 
agreements and safety regulations. 
  In practice, such a decision could eliminate the importation 
of electricity from Russia and the Sosnoviy Bor nuclear power 
plant outside St. Petersburg. However, Finland has an import 
agreement with Russia that will be in effect until 1999, and 
production director Anders Palmgren of Imatran Voima [Finnish 
power-generating company] says it would not be easy to break the 
agreement. Determining who is complying with international 
safety regulations can be difficult, he indicated. 
<H5>  Nuclear Waste Alternative </H5>
  Finland also has an agreement in effect with the Russian 
authorities with regard to nuclear waste from Lovisa, and 
Palmgren sees no reason to break the agreement. Theoretically, 
nuclear waste from Lovisa can be shipped back to Russia as long 
as the power plant is in operation, Palmgren said, but the 
commercial terms are renegotiated every five years. The current 
commercial agreement will be in force for another four years, 
and Palmgren did not think it should be broken. 
  "It is true that we have the alternative of taking care of 
our waste ourselves, we have had that all along," said Palmgren. 
"But the money we now pay to have our waste taken care of and 
processed in Tchelyabinsk also helps the Russians finance the 
cleanup of the area, which suffered heavy radioactive 
contamination in the 1950's." 
  Palmgren thought the government had yielded to outside 
political pressure in formulating its statement and pointed out 
that it would certainly be possible to provide final underground 
storage for the waste from Lovisa in Finland, but that it would 
be a barbaric way to dispose of it. In this case usable fuel 
would also be buried while long, medium, and short-lived waste 
would all be mixed together. 
  Therefore Palmgren feels it is better to send it to Russia 
now that it is also possible for both Imatran Voima and 
Finland's Radiation Safety Center to check that the waste is 
handled properly. 
<H5>  Old Formula </H5>
  In other respects Wednesday's statement repeats the 
government's old formula for the economic management of 
Finland's energy. One element is energy taxes to make energy use 
efficient and achieve the environmental goals that have been 
set, another is a revised program to cut energy use and sector 
agreements on energy-saving measures in industry. 
  The government also wants to increase the use of bioenergy 
and other domestic energy. To promote this goal, increased 
support will be given to research in new technologies applicable 
to gasification plants, among other things. It will become 
easier for small-scale power plants to enter the electricity 
network and the possibility of increased electricity production 
in connection with the cellulose industry will be studied. 
  The government is also stressing the development of energy 
technology and will subsidize export efforts in this area. In 
addition, the electricity market will be deregulated and there 
will be increased competition. Previous emission goals will 
remain in effect in the energy sector, sulfur dioxide emission 
must be cut 80 percent in relation to the 1980 level, nitrogen 
dioxide emission 30 percent, and carbon dioxide emission will be 
checked at the end of the 1990's. 
<H5>  Industry Dissatisfied </H5>
  Industry's Energy Association feels the government's energy 
policy line is still based on empty phrases just as it was after 
the negative decision on nuclear power. The association's 
president, Pentti Sierila, says the government's energy 
statement is not in line with the good goals that are presented 
at the beginning of the statement. 
  "The energy policy line that has now been presented is based 
on hopes and comprehensive state subsidies in the belief that 
energy needs can be satisfied through the increased production 
of bioenergy and by implementing the purchase of natural gas 
from Norway," Sierila said in a comment on the statement. 
  He is surprised that the government does not say anything 
about the price of energy. He feels the structure and level of 
energy taxes should be reconsidered. 
  "The line that has now been presented will inevitably 
increase the use of fossil fuel and thus make it impossible to 
achieve the environmental emission goals Finland has committed 
itself to internationally," Sierila said. 
<H5>  Greenpeace Approves </H5>
  The environmental organization Greenpeace is pleased with 
Finland's decision to stop exporting nuclear waste to Russia. 
Imatran Voima has shipped highly radioactive nuclear waste from 
Lovisa east of the Urals 11 times. 
  Greenpeace has launched highly visible campaigns against the 
shipment and processing of nuclear waste in various parts of the 
world. Protests have been organized in such countries as 
Finland, Sweden, Russia, Germany, and England.

  [Text] Paris, Dec 10 (AFP) -- The French Atomic Energy 
Commission (CEA) announced late Thursday [9 December] that 
France had carried out 192 nuclear tests, saying that previous 
reports of 161 tests were a mistake. 
  The announcement came in response to calls from 
environmentalists Greenpeace to "lift the secrecy" surrounding 
the number of French tests. 
  Greenpeace had said it was astonished that official and 
parliamentary figures on the exact number had varied. 
  But the CEA admitted that the figure of 161 it had published 
in a report had been a "material error" and that the correct 
figure was 192 as stated in April by CEA director general 
Philippe Rouvillois. 
  It said late Thursday that the number of French tests up to 
a 
moratorium imposed in April 1992 "was indeed 192." 
  The United States this week reported that it had not 
revealed 
some 204 tests.

<F P=106> [Alexandre Varin report: "France and Great Britain Accused </F>
of Polluting the North Sea"] 
  [Text] Eight European countries bordering the North Sea, 
plus Switzerland (via the Rhine River) expressed concern on 7 
and 8 December in Copenhagen on that sea's poor state of health 
due to pollution of oil, nitrogenous by-products, nontreated 
sewage, radioactive waste, and the release of sulfur and heavy 
metals into the atmosphere. 
  But only four of them (Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, and 
Sweden) were represented by both their ministers of environment 
and agriculture. Pleading the GATT negotiations, Germany and 
France sent higher civil servants, just like Finland and 
Switzerland. According to Greenpeace and the World Fund for 
Nature, this shows that "there is no real European political 
will to protect the North Sea." 
  However, the report drawn up by a working group is crushing: 
1.7 million tons of nitrogenous substances (ammonia, nitrates) 
are dumped into the sea every year, 900,000 tons of which come 
from agricultural activities. This leads to a rarefaction of 
oxygen in the marine environment. The efforts made since the 
conference held in The Hague in 1990 have not improved the 
situation and the states that border the sea almost unanimously 
admit that it will not be possible to reduce by half the dumping 
of nitrogen and phosphates by 1995, as expected. 
  All the more, as Danish Environment Minister Svend Auken 
pointed out, since "industrialized countries like France, Great 
Britain, and Norway continue to dump nontreated sewage water 
from the cities into the sea." "Those countries," he added, 
"lack the courage to impose sacrifices on their citizens in 
order to pay the costs of filtering stations." Mr. Auken 
emphasized that "Denmark has spent ECU1 billion in taxpayer 
money to clean waters carrying sewage." 
  Taking place before the major 1995 conference that also is 
to 
be held in Copenhagen, this intervening meeting discussed 
various types of pollution, whose scope was not known, including 
the smoke from ship stacks or the dumping of oil during illegal 
degasification of ships, not to mention the leaks and other 
incidents in the 4,000 [oil] wells and the 140 offshore oil and 
gas rigs in the North Sea. 
  "Even more outrageous and more dangerous is the release of 
radioactive waste from the Sellafield nuclear recycling plant" 
(northwest England), reported Greenpeace during the meeting. 
The British delegation, which included the agriculture 
minister, has not reacted to the protest, which was supported by 
Denmark, which has requested that an end be put to the release 
of such waste. Great Britain is the only country that has not 
published data on the reduction of pollutants in the North Sea.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "France Signs the Convention of </F>
London on Ban of Immersion of Nuclear Waste"] 
  [Text] France has decided to sign the international 
Convention of London on the "total and definitive" ban on 
immersion of nuclear waste, Environment Minister Michel Barnier 
disclosed on Monday, 20 December. France thus joins the 37 
states, including the United States and Japan, which decided to 
sign [the Convention] last month during a meeting in London. 
  Although France has not dumped any radioactive waste in the 
sea since 1969, it abstained from signing, together with 
Belgium, China, the United Kingdom, and Russia. France only 
sought a simple renewal of the 1983 moratorium, so that it would 
retain the right to reassess the problem "in 15 years in light 
of the scientific knowledge at that time." 
  However, the majority vote on 12 November was accompanied by 
a clause: The countries abstaining from voting and the 29 
nations not present in London would have 100 days to vote for or 
against [the convention], otherwise they would be excluded from 
the convention. "In compliance with Prime Minister Balladur's 
willingness to conduct an energy policy respecting the 
environment," says Michel Barnier's message, but also due to the 
lobbying of the ecological movements, the French Government, 
which could have saved itself the trouble of a controversy by 
signing the convention last month, has thus come into line with 
the resolution adopted in London.

<F P=106> [Article by Jochen Wagner: "Crafty Accounting in Toepfer's </F>
Budget -- Little Future for New Environment Projects"] 
  [Text] The Federal Government intends to spend an overall 
total of more than 478 billion German marks [DM], DM1.35 billion 
of which have been allocated to Federal Environment Minister 
Klaus Toepfer. The opposition prophesies doom: "He can't even 
pay the branch office's phone bill with that." In spite of the 
budget cuts announced across the board, the environment minister 
can still show an increase of about DM90 million on paper. 
  According to the present draft, the Environment Ministry's 
budget includes a total of DM626.9 million in individual budget 
16 solely for the Federal Radiological Safety Office in 
Salzgitter, the major item - around DM549 million -- being the 
neutralization and permanent storage of radioactive waste. 
  Over DM151 million have been earmarked for reactor safety 
and 
radiological safety, including DM21 million for improving plant 
safety at Soviet-design nuclear power stations. About DM52 
million have been injected into the budget for nuclear safety 
purposes. Other major budget items are the ministry itself, with 
about DM100 million, and the Federal Environment Agency with 
around DM93 million. The Federal Research Station for Nature 
Conservation and Rural Ecology has DM20.3 million, nature 
conservation in general receiving DM67.4 million. 
<H5>  Job Cuts </H5>
  The Federal Environment Ministry as such shows a total of 
806 
established posts for 1994 -- 34 less than this year. Posts at 
the Federal Environment Agency have fallen from 839 to 824, 
whereas jobs with the Federal Research Station have increased 
from 189 to 195. The Federal Radiological Safety Office is 
reducing posts from 580 to 574. This means a cutback from 2,448 
to 2,399 -- an overall loss of 49 posts. 
  The environment minister was shown no pity by his political 
competitors in the battle for cash. The costly "dynosaurian 
technology" that nuclear power entailed was held up as the main 
culprit for the financial imbalance within the environment 
budget. "We deplore the fact that, yet again, you have emerged 
from this year's budget savings round stripped bare. You owe 
your budget increase to crafty accounting. Permanent items in 
the radiological safety and reactor safety section artificially 
inflate the budget, but the room for maneuver in your 
appropriation is becoming smaller and smaller. More and more 
money is being spent as a result of the Federal Government's 
failed nuclear policy, and at the same time less is going to 
pioneering environment technologies, environment research, and 
traditional nature conservation, not to mention investment in 
the environment in the new laender," said SPD [Social Democratic 
Party of Germany] deputy Marion Caspers-Merk, criticizing the 
new budget in the Bundestag. 
  To rub salt into the wound, she accused the Federal 
environment minister of "incompetence in environment policy," 
referred to Toepfer's statements in the media as "a mixture of 
attempts at self- justification, buck-passing, and juggling with 
words," criticized his "passive stance," and opined that, 
"Toepfer the environment policymaker has no fight left in him." 
  Klaus-Dieter Feige (Alliance 90/Greens) said, "The emptiness 
of environment policy also finds expression in the federal 
budget for 1994. Once funds for radiological safety have been 
deducted, all that remains to the Federal environment minister 
is a risible DM200 million, about DM80 million less than in 
1993." 
  Dagmar Enkelmann (PDS [Party of Democratic 
Socialism]/Leftwing List) described the Bonn Environment 
Ministry's new budget as a "hoax package or an atomic waste 
budget." "With over DM1.3 billion, the 1994 draft budget shows 
an increase of 7.1 percent over 1993. However, viewed 
realistically, the environment budget remains stationary at 0.3 
percent of the overall budget." 
  Hans Georg Wagner of the SPD said, "It is not hard to see 
that the environment minister is once again the great loser. 
The actual environment and nature conservation sector has 
suffered a DM64- million or 3.3-percent cut in real terms. If 
we add the cuts suffered in the 1993 budget, the environment's 
share in the budget has taken a 17-percent cut since 1992. 
Since 1992, when the situation in the new laender caused an 
explosive growth in environmental problems for us all, the 
budget has shrunk by nearly one-fifth. We no longer have an 
environment policy in the true sense of the term. The federal 
environment minister is a loudspeaker for environment policy." 
<H5>  "Looks" Do not Matter </H5>
  In his 10-minute speech, the federal environment minister 
barely referred to the massive objections voiced by the 
opposition. Instead, Toepfer trotted out a series of well-worn 
statements, brandishing a sort of balance sheet as his 
contribution to the budget debate. "Our environment policy in 
Germany has created jobs. Environment policy currently provides 
employment for 680,000 people in Germany. About 50,000 people 
are directly employed in environmental reclamation as a labor 
market policy measure. In recent times we have employed 120,000 
people under job creation schemes. About 15,000 people are 
usefully employed on reclamation work in the lignite mining 
industry. The federal and land governments spend DM2-3 billion 
a year on this item; this spending does not appear in my budget, 
but 75 percent of it is borne by the Federal Government. What 
matters is that we get the environmental reclamation done, not 
whether I would like a better-looking budget." 
  Toepfer pronounced himself in favor of the creation of a 
disposal infrastructure involving private industry. "We need an 
environmental infrastructure for sewage treatment and waste 
disposal facilities, and for reclaiming contaminated land that 
we have inherited from the centrally planned economy of the 
former GDR. We want to attract private capital as well for this 
purpose. In the new federal laender, 46 sewage treatment plants 
are currently being planned or built, or have already been 
completed, with private capital -- DM4.3 billion are being 
mobilized. I should be happy if as many private sewage works 
had been built in the original federal laender in the whole 
40-year history of the Federal Republic. Hats off to those who 
have assumed responsibility there and achieved this. This is 
growth policy and environment policy rolled into one. We shall 
pursue it to the best effect." 
<H5>  Morsleben Can Still Be Used </H5>
  Referring to the dispute over nuclear waste disposal, 
Toepfer 
stressed that all forces in the Federal Republic, regardless of 
their ideas as to the duration and exploitation of nuclear 
power, had to reach a consensus on disposal. Referring to the 
controversial Morsleben permanent disposal store, Toepfer said: 
"Morsleben can legally be operated until the year 2000. The 
Nuclear Safety Commission has pronounced the Morsleben store 
still usable. The storage quality will be changed, and the waste 
will not be stored at the taxpayers' expense; the cost will be 
passed on in the form of fees to those who store material there." 
  Toepfer said that he aimed to abolish ecological subsidies. 
This meant altering prices, as prices changed behavior and 
brought about technological developments. This road toward an 
ecological market economy was more successful than ecological 
regulations imposed from above or planned economy 
considerations. The Federal Republic already enjoyed a 
worldwide reputation for environment engineering. 
  Individual budget 16 also features a couple of interesting 
items. For instance, the federal minister receives an annual 
salary of DM275,000 inclusive of local weighting, plus an annual 
official expenses allowance of DM7,200 and a per diem allowance, 
albeit reduced to take account of the per diem etc. to which he 
is entitled as a Bundestag deputy. The parliamentary 
secretaries of state receive annual salaries of approximately 
DM65,000 less. The "secret fund" at the minister's disposal for 
extraordinary service-related expense in special cases contains 
another DM60,000 for 1994, and there are DM380,000 more for 
public relations work. Another DM14.7 million are earmarked for 
work designed to raise public awareness (pamphlets, films, 
informative material), inclusive of DM69,000 for technical 
publications. 
  DM325,000 are budgeted for the official vehicle fleet, and 
an 
approximate total of DM3.8 million for traveling expenses, DM3.5 
million for the ministry's telecommunications bill, and just 
DM2.6 million for data processing. Long-distance data 
transmission alone costs around DM300,000. The books and 
periodicals budget amounts to DM995,000. 
  The German Nature Conservation Circle receives DM485,000 and 
the German Council for the Care of the Countryside DM321,000 in 
subsidies. Further subsidies to the tune of DM450,000 are 
awarded for schemes run by various nature conservation groups 
and associations. DM3.6 million are earmarked for dues payable 
to international organizations, and the United Nations 
Environment Fund due amounts to DM10.8 million. Dues to smaller 
international organizations (waterfowl research, lesser whales) 
come to about DM1.75 million. The Association of German 
Engineers receives about DM3 million for the "clean air" 
program, and a similar sum goes to the Environmental Standards 
Institute. Operating expenses for the Environmental Sample 
Bank, which will gradually begin to cover the whole federal area 
from 1994, rise from the current DM5.5 million to DM6.86 million. 
  Party disputes notwithstanding, as far as alternative 
figures 
in the Bonn government camp are concerned, SPD environment 
spokesman Michael Mueller said, "If Toepfer were to go, it would 
be even worse." 
[Box p 37] Brief Interview: Grave Error [box head] 
  The interview with Federal Environment Minister Toepfer was 
conducted by our colleagues from the French periodical 
L'ENVIRONNEMENT MAGAZINE [EM], which publishes the original 
version in full and which has kindly allowed UMWELTMAGAZIN to 
print the following extract. 
  [EM] Do you really believe it is possible to reconcile the 
market economy with ecology? 
  [Toepfer] To be perfectly honest, yes. But the market 
economy can only solve its problems if it absorbs its 
environmental protection costs. In a market economy, everyone 
tries to cut costs or offload them on to others or onto nature. 
This is one of its basic principles. My motive for introducing 
environment taxes is not to take more money from the taxpayer 
but to induce polluters to mend their ways. German industry 
complains about an excess of environmental protection charges 
and claims that this is detrimental to competitiveness. The 
professional associations echo this cry. I have never tired of 
repeating that a proper environmental policy creates new jobs, 
but in the current time of crisis the first item to be deleted 
from the budget is environmental protection. In my opinion, 
this is a grave error that will create enormous problems in the 
future. 
  [EM] Are GATT and environmental protection compatible? 
  [Toepfer] Of course. I have recently discussed this with 
Brice Lalonde, who is currently drafting a report on this very 
issue. In any case, I believe that environmental protection as 
a concept must gradually find its way in so as not to halt the 
GATT machinery, by which I mean not leaving those countries that 
practise ecological dumping a free hand.

<F P=106> [Article by Karl F. Wentzel: "Trees in Germany Dying Earlier </F>
and Earlier; The Forest Supervisor: Now Beeches and Oaks Are 
Hit"] 
  [Text] Tomorrow Agriculture Minister Jochen Borchert will 
present the eleventh report on conditions of forests. Last 
year's report, with a slight increase of noticeable leaf loss by 
2 to 3 percent, so far marks the climax of all studies. It is 
noteworthy that the trend of damage continues from coniferous to 
deciduous forests. 
  If one wants to know more, one must relate all foliage 
findings between 1983 and 1993 to the up-to-date air quality 
measuring results and compare those data to the research 
findings and forestry experience of pollution effects. That 
leads to the following conclusions: 
  --German forests have significantly sparser needles or 
foliage than 15 years ago. One of every four trees shows a drop 
in foliage of over 25 percent, thus being in damage categories 
II to IV. Until 1985, this applied only to coniferous trees; now 
it applies to almost all types of trees. 
  --Needle loss and treetop thinning occurred even centuries 
ago near metal works and, since 1850, also in large areas of 
industrial regions. But this old damage has disappeared in West 
Germany since the building of high smokestacks as of 1964, and 
the 1983 order on high capacity furnace installations. 
  --The large-scale forest death since 1960 at altitudes above 
700 meters in the Erz, Iser, and Riesen Gebirge, caused by high 
sulfur dioxide pollution, has spread in west Germany only to 
border areas near the former GDR (Harz Mountains, Fichtel 
Gebirge). In the area it is confined to the regions of the large 
brown coal power stations in Saxony and Bohemia. 
  --In the eleven previous and present reports on forest 
conditions, the emphasis of top thinning has shifted from 
coniferous to deciduous trees. In 1983, it reached a first high 
watermark with 23 percent of fir and pine trees, dropped to 14 
percent by 1989, and then rose again to 24 percent by 1992. In a 
scissor movement, defoliation of beech and oak trees rose from 
11 percent (1984) to 32 percent (1992). 
<H3>  "But the Forest Will Not Die as Long as Foresters Nurture it 
Expertly" </H3>
  --This change in vulnerability of tree types can only be 
explained by the drastic change in air chemistry, i.e., the 
increase in nitrogen compounds and ozone with a simultaneous 
decrease in sulfur dioxide. 
  --For all types of trees, strong defoliation independent of 
the pollution type is concentrated in forests over 60 years old; 
in many forests it then intensifies to the dying of shoots and 
treetop deformation, and finally ends in premature death of the 
most sensitive individual trees and gradual forest dissolution. 
Thus air pollution leads to early aging and senescence. Science 
calls this `senescence acceleration.' 
  --The same trend is also indicated by the scarcely 
acknowledged experiences registered again and again by some 
50,000 foresters of Central Europe in their daily on-site work 
in the less foliated and sometimes prematurely dying forests. 
But wherever, however long, and however intensively pollution 
has damaged forests and soils: 
  A new greening or reforesting of the areas is possible, even 
with the highest soil acidity; 
  Ground vegetation becomes more profuse, thereby in many 
places becoming an increasingly bigger obstacle to reforestation. 
  The analyzed facts and findings make clear that the present 
widespread forest diseases are caused primarily by microchemical 
interference with the metabolism of leaf organs. Acid rain also 
leaches vital nutrients from the leaves and soil. Climatic 
changes, weather extremes, and pests can also accelerate the 
premature decay of the forest. 
  In regions particularly exposed to pollution, forests have 
hardly any prospect of reaching the forestry-desired age (on the 
average, firs reach the age of 100, oaks that of 180 years). 
After 40 years of professional work on recognition, effect, and 
prevention of pollution damage to forests, I consider "the age 
loss" of trees the worst effect of the new, far-flung air 
pollution on forestry and land culture. But the forest will not 
die as long as foresters nurture it expertly, fertilize it 
purposefully, and reforest immediately--be it the case after 
only 60, or after 180 years. 
<H5>  The Professor: Damage Through Environmental Protection </H5>
  The environmental protection of past years has hurt rather 
than helped the forest. That is the claim of Professor O. 
Schenck, founding director emeritus of the Max Planck Institute 
for Radiation Chemistry in Muelheim/Ruhr. His accusation: Since 
the mid-1950's, filter installations increasingly hold back flue 
ashes and flue gases--because they are considered pollutants 
under the federal pollution protection law. 
  But the dust contains useful substances vital for trees: 
minerals such as lithium and fluorine, sodium, potassium and 
calcium, iron, phosphorus--and above all magnesium. It forms the 
central atom of the green pigment, chlorophyll. For instance, if 
magnesium is lacking, the leaves turn yellow. 
  Every year, 125 kilograms of Sahara dust fall on every 
hectare of southern Italy. The minerals contained therein 
neutralize the sulfurous gases emitted by the volcano, Mt. Etna. 
In Germany, the annual amount of dust is 25 kilograms per 
hectare. Observations in the surroundings of cement factories 
showed: After filter equipment was installed, soil acidity 
increased noticeably. Because: The emissions of sulfur dioxide 
were not reduced to the same degree. So the percentage share of 
sulfur increased in the air. Today, the proportion is about 1:8. 
The smaller amounts of dust no longer suffice for complete 
neutralization. As a consequence, acid rain results.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrew Kouskouris: "Solid Waste Recycling in </F>
Greece"] 
  [Text] According to Council Directive 85/339/EEC of 27 June 
1985, on containers of liquids for human consumption, the 
government issued the bi-ministerial decision No. 
31784/954/8.4.90/251/B' on the types of packaging of liquid 
foods. There is also the Directive 91/156/EEC which covers some 
aspects of recycling -- reducing the wastes. 
<H5>  Composition of Refuse </H5>
  In 1984-85 the composition of the refuse in the Greater 
Athens Area was: 
  -- Organic: 58.5 percent 
  -- Paper, Cardboard: 19.2 percent 
  -- Plastics: 7 percent 
  -- Glass: 2.5 percent 
  -- Metal: 3.75 percent 
  -- Rubber, Wood: 3.5 percent 
  -- Inert: 1 percent 
  -- Rest: 4.55 percent 
  -- Total: 100 percent 
  Until recently, the average composition of waste in Greece 
was difficult to measure, however, new measurements in some 
areas shows that Greece is slowly, very slowly, approaching the 
composition of the middle European Consumer, especially as the 
organic fraction is reduced and the packaging fraction is 
increased. 
<H5>  Recycling </H5>
  Recycling is operating through source separation systems and 
the results in Greece for 1991 were: paper, 32 percent; glass, 
20 percent; aluminium, 26 percent. 
<H5>  Recycling Projects </H5>

  1. During the period 1990 till 1992, the Ministry of the 
Environment directed a number of awareness programmes aimed at 
the elementary and secondary schools (approximately 10,000 
students in all). The total quantity of source separated 
materials was as follows: 
  -- Paper: 110 tons 
  -- Aluminium: 10 tons 
  -- Glass: 2 tons 
  [Box] Consumption of Aluminium Cans as a Percentage of Total 
Recycling [box head] 
  -- 1985: 130 million cans (8 percent) 
  -- 1986: 230 million cans (11 percent) 
  -- 1987: 280 million cans (13 percent) 
  -- 1988: 430 million cans (17 percent) 
  -- 1989: 480 million cans (21 percent) 
  -- 1990: 500 million cans (25 percent) 
  -- 1991: 650-700 million cans (26 percent) 
  (Source: Report from the Ministry of Environment -- 85/389 
EEC. Hellenic Aluminium Company) [box end] 
  2. Seventy-five municipalities and communities have started 
source separation programs mainly for paper and aluminium cans. 
The Municipality of New Psyhiko was the first to begin a source 
separation program. Presently, New Psyhiko Municipality has 
started a source separation program and has constructed and 
currently operates a park for ecology including a train where 
schoolboys give aluminium cans to have a ride. The population 
of New Psyhiko's Municipality is only 14,000 inhabitants. 
  3. In the biggest landfill in Greece, and one of the biggest 
in Europe which is located in Athens, which has a capacity of 
3,500 tons per day, has been constructed and is managed by the 
Association of Municipalities and Communities in the Attika 
Region; a pilot plant for recovery of refuse (Refuse derived 
fuel (RDF) and compost) with a capacity of 2.5 tons per hour. 
  The above mentioned Association has planned and is currently 
purchasing equipment to set up a source separation project for 
paper in 13 municipalities with a total population 500,000 
inhabitants. 
  There is a study for the management of small hazardous 
wastes 
into the municipal wastes. It will be finished within the near 
future. 
  4. A compost plant is being built in the Municipality of 
Kalamata which will have a capacity of 80 tonnes per day plus 10 
tons of sludge. It will be ready next year. 
  5. The private sector which is partially represented by the 
Hellenic Company of Recovery and Recycling (51 companies which 
produce and distribute packaging products) is due to begin this 
year with a full-scale pilot program for source separation in 
all packaging materials. 
  6. There are four MEDSPA waste management programmes that 
cover recycling, two on Naxos (compost and source separation), 
one in the Municipality of Argostoli and one in the 
municipalities of Rio and Antirio. 
  7. Many seminars take place every year to educate local 
authority personnel in waste management including recycling 
(mainly source separation). The Government, through the 
Ministry of the Interior, collects information on municipal 
waste management for all local authorities having population 
over 2,000 inhabitants. 
  The Technical Chamber of Greece, after a study which 
finished 
in June of 1993 ("Needed Actions for the Protection of the 
Environment in Greece") estimated that: 
  a) A full-scale source separation programme during 1993 till 
2005 could reach a target of 100 percent of the recyclables with 
a total cost of 13 billion drachmas. 
  b) An estimated 60 percent of the total produced quantity of 
wastes per day all over Greece which is about 8,000 tonnes will 
be recycled or composed of (mechanically or some other method) 
with a total cost of 72 billion drachmas. 
  c) There is a sound proposal for founding an Institute of 
the 
Environment which will also handle the recycling, reducing and 
minimization of wastes.

<F P=106> [Article by Tony O'Brien and Jerome Reilly: "Minister Warns </F>
on Toxic Waste"] 
  [Text] Twenty five thousand tonnes of highly dangerous 
poisonous waste is being illegally dumped every year in this 
country -- and nobody knows where it is going, a government 
minister admitted yesterday. 
  Environment Minister Michael Smith said the country had to 
face up to the huge increase in the amount of toxic waste being 
produced and see how this could both be reduced and disposed of. 
  Ireland is now producing some 70,000 tonnes of officially 
classified toxic waste every year. And while 10,000 tonnes of 
this is disposed of abroad, and more incinerated by individual 
companies, thousands of tonnes remain unaccounted for. 
  "We have to presume that some 25,000 tonnes of poisonous 
waste is being dumped on ordinary landfill sites and other 
locations," said Mr Smith, who added: "In truth, we don't know 
where these highly dangerous substances are ending up." 
  Pointing out that Dublin produced more toxic waste than the 
rest of the country, Mr Smith again hinted that a national waste 
incinerator may be the preferred option. 
  But he stressed that no decision has yet been made on the 
issue. "I have already stated my view that incineration should 
not be excluded as a viable disposal option," he said, adding 
that new proposals will follow a major conference on hazardous 
waste being organised in January. 
  "The toxic waste being dumped is a hazard for people living 
here now and for future generations," he said. Another problem 
was the disposal of around 10,000 tonnes of clinical waste being 
incinerated in hospitals. 
  Decisions would have to be made. "We are producing more and 
more waste each year but we don't want landfill sites and we 
don't want incinerators but we have to face up to the problem 
and early next year we will make a decision one way or another."

<F P=106> [Article by Kjell Dragnes: "Wild Growth in the Wake of the </F>
Accident"] 
  [Text] Chernobyl/Kiev--"The zone"--it is only spoken of 
that way by those in the know--that restricted area 30 
kilometers in diameter around the power plant, has become a huge 
testing and research area. Six and one-half years after the 
explosion and the fire at the nuclear power plant--which began 
on 26 April 1986--the effects are being observed on people, 
animals, and plants. For researchers it has become a mecca. Here 
they hope to find answers to what man-made radioactivity does to 
the environment and those of us who live with the environment. 
  It is important to learn this, not just for the Ukrainians, 
but also for other countries with nuclear power and for 
countries without nuclear power. Because contamination knows no 
borders. The zone is uninhabited; 163,000 people were evacuated 
from the region. But beyond the zone people live. People live in 
Valdres in Norway, where there are places that are just as 
contaminated with radioactive materials as the soil and the 
woods in the vicinity of Chernobyl. 
<H5>  Berlin Blue </H5>
  The effects of this contamination could have been very 
great, 
in economic and health terms, if it had not been for Berlin blue. 
  "It might sound like boasting, but the fact is that the 
Norwegian initiative with Berlin blue is almost the only 
successful research project in Chernobyl, in Ukraine, in 
Belarus, and, not least of all, here in Norway," said Per 
Strand, a researcher at the Norwegian Radiation Protection 
Agency. Since 1990, and together with Brit Salbu and Knut Hove, 
professors at the University of Trondheim's College of Arts and 
Sciences [NLH], he has been working with Ukraine, Belarus, and 
Russia on the fallout from Chernobyl. 
  The pigment, which was first produced in Berlin in 1704, 
hence the name, contains a complex iron ion (FeIIFeII-(Cn)6) 
which has proven effective as a binder for radioactive cesium, 
Cs137. The first research on Berlin blue was carried out at the 
Radium Hospital in the sixties; later a method was developed 
using Berlin blue as an additive to blocks of salt lick and as a 
pre-additive. This was done at the Norwegian Agricultural 
College, which in 1991 tested tablets in Ukraine, Belarus, and 
Russia--with fairly remarkable results. 
  Berlin blue works in such a way that radioactive materials 
are not absorbed into the body or turn up in meat and milk. An 
absorption reduction of some 90 percent means that large 
contaminated areas can still be used by people and animals. 
  How important this is in economic and health terms can be 
illustrated by the following figures: 
  In Ukraine, more than 7 million hectares of ground have been 
contaminated by Cesium 137, so the radioactivity is over 1 curie 
per square kilometer (calculated another way: 37,000 becquerels 
per square meter). Today 2.6 million people live in this area. 
Between 1986 and 1991, Ukraine spent over 15 billion karbovanets 
to neutralize and reduce the effects of the fallout. Even if 
inflation is high and Ukraine's currency is still dropping in 
value, this is nevertheless a very major burden. 
  In addition, there are huge areas in Belarus, especially 
around Gomel. And areas in Norway. Norway is in fact the country 
outside the former Soviet Union that was the most affected, and 
will continue to be the most affected, by the fallout from 
Chernobyl. In Valdres, there are many areas where the 
contamination varies between 1 and 10 curies per square 
kilometer. 
  Norway is also especially vulnerable because we use 
wilderness areas for grazing to such an extent. A survey done by 
the NHL and the Radiation Protection Agency in Ukraine showed 
that on land that is farmed, plowed, and fertilized, the 
absorption of radioactive materials in plants is less. The type 
of soil is also important; the contamination of organic soil 
(soil rich in humus) is the worst; radioactive particles are 
more permanent in clayey soil. 
<H5>  Get By Cheaply </H5>
  By simply giving Berlin blue to domestic animals, absorption 
in meat and milk can thus be neutralized. The economic 
consequences are great. In Belarus alone, they would have to 
spend between 5 and 10 percent of the [gross] national product 
to neutralize the contamination; now they can get by with much 
less. 
  We are also doing that. If we had followed the international 
standards for the absorption of radioactive materials and not 
used any countermeasures, Norwegian agriculture would have lost 
between 1 and 2 billion kroner annually. Using Berlin blue, the 
radiation values are brought way down. Cost: around 100 million 
kroner. 
  The Norwegian research applies not just to reductions of 
absorption in animals. It also includes a project in which the 
aim is to study the mobility of radioactive materials in 
relation to the distance from a nuclear power plant where there 
have been emissions. The goal of this research is to learn more 
about what Norway could be exposed to if, for example, an 
accident were to occur at the Russian nuclear power plant on the 
Kola [Peninsula]. 
<H5>  Eight Thousand Dead From Radiation </H5>
  "We have seen many tears," said Vladimir Kholosha, the 
deputy 
minister at the Chernobyl ministry. "Tears because people had to 
leave their homes, tears because people died from minor 
illnesses. People's immune systems were so weakened by radiation 
that even `innocuous' diseases have become life-threatening." 
  Today there is hardly anyone who has an overview of what 
effect the radiation from Chernobyl has had on public health. 
Kholosha confirmed that about 8,000 people have died, and that 
it was due to large doses of radioactivity. In early September, 
the Ukranian national assembly, Verhovna Rada, approved a 
comprehensive program for the next two years and the period 
between now and the year 2000 to reduce the effects. But money 
is needed--scads of money--and Ukraine does not have it. 
  At the same time a major effort is under way, under the 
aegis, among others, of the UN and the EC, to survey public 
health conditions. A good six and one-half years after the 
accident, we are starting to see some of the consequences. In 
Ukraine and Belarus, infantile thyroid gland cancer has 
increased dramatically, a survey conducted by the World Health 
Organization, WHO, showed. Since 1989, 225 new cases have been 
reported in Belarus, 157 in Ukraine. Normally there would only 
have been two to three cases. 
  Ukrainian experts also think they are seeing more deaths 
from 
other diseases, among others of the heart, blood vessels, and 
the circulatory system, but inasmuch as there are so many 
factors that influence the development of such diseases, at the 
moment it is too early to suggest any connection. 
Regardless--the national assembly, Verhovna Rada, certainly 
stands by what it said when it states that the Chernobyl 
accident "will be seen as the worst tragedy in 20th century 
Ukrainian history, and will affect the lives of several 
generations of people." 
<H5>  Strange Evergreen Forest </H5>
  The needles on the fir trees do not look like ordinary 
needles--even if they come from the common fir, pinus 
silvestris. They are in different sizes. Some are long, others 
are short, some are growing in loops. From every growth point, 
where normally five branches would grow, here between six and 20 
grow. All the same, upon closer inspection, this green forest is 
not that normal. 
  "We can see changes in the pattern of growth," said Andrei 
Arkhipov, one of the researchers at the center in Pripyat. "But 
it is impossible to see whether there are genetic changes; for 
that, we have to have several generations of trees. The green 
forest of firs was sown with seeds from those trees that 
received the greatest radiation damage in 1986, and turned red." 
  Arkhipov is the son of Prof. Nikolai Archipov, one of 
Russia's greatest experts on the effects of radioactive 
contamination. For many years the elder Arkhipov conducted 
studies of the effects of the once unknown nuclear accident in 
Kyshtym in the Urals. Now the laboratory has been moved to 
Chernobyl. 
  The forest is just one of the research areas. In large 
greenhouses tests have been made on plants such as rape, lupine, 
oats, root crops, and vegetables to study the absorption of 
radioactive materials in the plants--and how this can be 
neutralized. 
  "The most effective countermeasure we have found to date is 
fertilization with potassium, which prevents the absorption of 
cesium. Applying lime is useful to reduce the absorption of 
strontium," Arkhipov said. The center has extensively mapped the 
contaminated area, which shows a spotty pattern. In some places 
the fallout can be great, just as it can be practically free of 
radioactive materials. The main goal of this research is to see 
how agricultural areas can be reused after a nuclear accident.

<F P=106> [Article by Oivind Loraas: "Snow in South Norway Is </F>
Extremely Polluted"] 
  [Text] Grey-black snow has fallen over the southeastern 
part of Norway over the last few days. Pollution from England 
and East Europe has made the snow extremely acidic. 
  Tonsberg--The snow that fell over the southeastern part of 
the country earlier this week was extremely polluted. At the 
regional college at Bo in Telemark the pH value of the 
precipitation measured 3.4. The pH value shows how much acid 
there is in the water. The lower the number, the more acidic the 
water. 
  "We took a sample of the precipitation on Thursday [2 
December], after personally observing how dirty-grey the snow 
was," says teacher Synne Kleiven in the Department of 
Environment Protection at the regional college. 
  "The tests we made show that the pH value of the 
precipitation was 3.4. The normal pH value of precipitation over 
Telemark is 4.4. This means that the snow that fell this week is 
10 times as polluted as normal. In a fishing lake anything alive 
will die long before the water becomes as acidic as the snow was 
this week." 
  Kleiven says the water has been filtered and great 
quantities 
of soot particles have been found. "The filter we used became 
completely grey as we filtered the water," she says. There is a 
layer in the snow almost 2 centimeters thick that is almost 
completely grey. We think this is the snow that fell the night 
before Wednesday. 
  "So far the pollution remains in the snow. The problem 
arises 
when the snow melts in spring. If this happens rapidly water and 
rivers will get an acidic pollution shock that might result in 
the death of fish and great damage to the environment," says 
Kleiven. 
  The National Pollution Inspectorate (NPI) has also received 
reports about the extremely acidic precipitation. 
  "We received the statistics from some 30 measurements 
carried 
out by the Norwegian Institute of Atmospheric Research (NIAR) 
yesterday. The numbers show a concentration of acid that is up 
to five times the normal amount in the precipitation that fell 
this week," Chief Engineer Tor Johannessen of NPI says. 
  "The measurements show a pH value ranging from 3.4 to 3.9 in 
the snow that fell last week. This is far below the normal 
value. The tests also show large concentrations of soot 
particles," says Johannessen. 
  Johannessen says that the acidic precipitation has fallen 
all 
over the southeastern part of the country, from the Agder 
counties to as far north as Osen in Hedmark. 
  "Periods with an extreme amount of acidic precipitation are 
something that we experience from time to time," he says. This 
is no acute crisis, but it might result in a large amount of 
local pollution when the snow melts. It might be especially bad 
if large amounts of acid collects in the snow during the winter. 
  The fact that there is so much soot in the snow indicates 
that the pollution is coming from East Europe where cleaning of 
emissions is quite poor. According to the Meteorological 
Institute the precipitation of the last few days has come from 
both the southeast and the southwest. This means that large 
amounts of pollutants have come down over Norway from both East 
Europe and England during the last days.

<H5>  This Is Acidic Precipitation </H5>

  -  Acidic precipitation is polluted snow or rain. It is first 
and foremost sulphur that pollutes, but there can also be large 
amounts of soot particles in the acidic precipitation. 
  -  The pollution is coming from heat-generating stations and 
industries that use oil or coal as a source of energy. Sulphur 
is released into the air and then comes back down as sulfuric 
acid along with the precipitation. 
  -  England, Germany, Russia, and the other countries in East 
Europe are the greatest users of coal and oil. 
  -  The Agder counties and Telemark in particular have been hit 
by 
acidic precipitation, but such pollution has been registered as 
far north as Sogn and Fjordane.

<F P=106> [Article by Ole Mathismoen: "Emissions From Kola Reduced"] </F>
  [Text] Emissions of sulphur at Kola have been strongly 
reduced since 1989. The reason for this is the gradual 
introduction of market forces into the Russian economy. 
  In 1990 about 550,000 tons of air pollution was 
emitted--mainly sulphur--from the metal industry at Kola. About 
half of this came from Pechenganikel at Nikel and Zapolyarnyy in 
the vicinity of the Norwegian border. How large the emissions 
will be this year nobody knows, but because of the much reduced 
industrial production they will be considerably lower. In August 
of this year the production at Nikel was 45.7 percent lower than 
in August of last year. 
  "During the last 20 years an incredible 9.6 million tons of 
sulphur dioxide have been emitted from the smelting works at 
Kola. The environmental destruction is enormous. Nobody should 
think that the problem has been solved even though market forces 
have taken a drastic bite out of this sulfuric hell," says 
Thomas Nilsen from Bellona. 
<H5>  Depression </H5>
  In the mining and smelting cities on the Kola peninsula 
depression is spreading. Last Monday the labor office in the 
metal city of Monchegorsk issued the first official announcement 
from the large metal conglomerate that owns the smelting works: 
One thousand fifty people will be let go. Journalist Sergei 
Chukov from the newspaper MURMANSKII VESTIK thinks this is real. 
The workers will get the boot. 
  In Russian industry such mass layoffs are something new. 
Locally at Kola the announcement from Monchegorsk is only viewed 
as a confirmation that the smelting industry is having a 
difficult time. 
<H5>  Cutbacks </H5>
  Prices for raw materials on the world market are low. 
Authorities in Moscow seem to have tightened up again on how 
much of their income the conglomerate might dispose of. 
Severonikel at Monchegorsk is struggling with sky-high debts 
owed to both the nuclear power plant at Kola and the Murmansk 
Shipping Company, which is hauling the ore from the Siberian 
city of Norilsk to the Kola works. There are rumors about 
layoffs of thousands of people both at Monchegorsk and at the 
metal companies at Nikel and Zapolyarnyy, which are owned by the 
sister company Pechenganikel. 
  Local sources describe the mood of the metal-producing 
cities 
as very depressed. Both at the metal works and at the nuclear 
power plant which supplies the industry with power, the workers 
presumably have not received full pay this fall. Previously the 
workers had contracts for five years or more. Now only a 
minority get a contract for more than a few months. 
  Even people with a solid knowledge of Russia have difficulty 
explaining what is really happening in northwest Russia. On the 
one hand their industry seems to be marked by depression, heavy 
debt in rubles, and rapidly falling production. But on the other 
hand more Russian nickel is being sold abroad than at any other 
time, and income in dollars is high. 
  Scientist Rune Castberg at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute is 
unsure whether what is happening at Kola is the result of a real 
economic crisis or whether the leadership has let the crisis run 
full course simply as a means of getting rid of superfluous 
employees. 
  Castberg has for years worked with the Kola problems. He 
does 
not think that market forces and the gradual economic freedom in 
Russia will result in a complete halt in pollution from Kola. 
  "Since the smelting works are there, it will benefit Russian 
society most to have as much activity there as possible. 
However, in the future production will to an increasing degree 
have to be profitable," Castberg says. 
  He thinks it probable that the part of the metal industry 
that is dependent on ore transported from Siberia will 
disappear, and that the smelting industry based on the local ore 
will remain. But even though some slight degree of modernization 
has taken place during the last decades, the technology and the 
buildings are mainly from the 1940's and 1950's. Whether the 
conglomerate can afford to modernize to the degree necessary to 
keep up production in the future without economic aid from 
abroad is unclear. 
<H5>  Skeptical of Support </H5>
  Castberg is skeptical as to whether Norway should give 300 
million kroner in support of modernizing the smelting industry 
in Nikel in order to reduce emissions further. 
  "I do not think this is the most efficient use of our money. 
We might rather help Pechenganikel achieve the full effect of 
the cleanup capabilities the company already has," Castberg says. 
  The point is really that the production at the metal works 
has been reduced more than the pollution. This means that the 
companies are unable to clean the waste gas as well as they have 
previously. One of the reasons is a strong reduction in the 
production of sulfuric acid.

<F P=106> [Article by Lars Porne: "Swedish Clearing of Russian </F>
Weapons"] 
  [Text] Before the Soviet occupation, there was a Swedish 
populace on the Estonian islands Stora Rago and Lilla Rago 
(Pakri Saar) off the naval base of Paldiski. Now that the 
Russians have gone home, these islands are not only devastated, 
but after decades as targets for firing and bombing practice, 
they are also strewn with unexploded shells. 
  The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm is now 
heading a project to clear the islands of all unexploded 
material and to make them safe to live on. 
  Senior research engineer at KTH Bengt Grisell has just 
returned from Tallinn, where he met with Estonia's environment 
minister, the former environment minister, and the defense 
minister. He has brought home a basic agreement that goes beyond 
clearing the two Swedish islands. 
  "Other items include clearing unexploded shells and mines in 
the waters around the islands, finding and clearing mines off 
Tallinn, finding and measuring Soviet radioactive dumping sites, 
disarming and recycling the enormous supply of Russian mines, 
and training Estonians in these fields." 
<H5>  Money Lacking </H5>
  It is only the money that is lacking and Grisell is now 
hoping for help from the Foreign Ministry. 
  "The Estonians see this as part of their democratization 
process," he said. 
  He has established cooperation with FMV [Defense Materiel 
Administration], the SIPRI [Stockholm International Peace 
Research Institute] peace research institute, and the military, 
which can supply the expertise. FMV has agreed to donate surplus 
explosives and the Defense Materiel Inspectorate has granted 
permission to ship these materials to Estonia. 
  The Russians have stockpiled and left behind thousands of 
mines on the island of Nargo (Naissaar) and the Estonian 
authorities fear the possible consequences of a forest fire. 
  "On Stora Rago the Russians have dug up the Swedish cemetery 
and plundered the graves. Bone fragments are lying around on the 
ground," said Grisell, who was there with his research ship 
Altair. 
<H5>  Russians Reveal Dumping </H5>
  Plans are to make this ship base for the major clearing 
project. 
  "I also signed an agreement with the Russians during a visit 
to St. Petersburg. They promise to make available all the 
information they have on the dumping of ammunition in the water, 
for example. The fact is that we have better relations with the 
Russians in this area than the Estonians have," Grisell said. 
  It is urgent that Stora and Lilla Rago be cleared quickly, 
since the islands are attractive to tourists and vacationers, 
now that the Russians have left. 
  Grisell said that the clearing operation would be easier 
because the islands consist of limestone and most of the 
unexploded shells are clearly visible. 
  "The unexploded shells could be of interest to criminals who 
would want to recover the explosives." 
  Consequently, work to explode the unexploded shells must 
begin as soon as possible. 
  The Estonians want to recover the mines. They contain tons 
of 
TNT, an explosive that hardly has any civilian use. It can be 
burned, but that would produce extremely toxic nitrous gases. 
  One method is to melt the TNT out of the mines--it has a 
melting point of about 80 degrees--and then mix it with some 
other substance to render it inactive and to make it useful for 
civilian purposes. 
  "The Estonians want to develop their own expertise in the 
clearance and destruction of old munitions." 
  When the Russians leave Estonia at the beginning of next 
year 
they will leave behind large supplies of previously top-secret 
military equipment near Tallinn. 
  "We will be the first people in the world to enter depots of 
this type," Grisell said. 
  "The Estonians also want us to look at other sites, 
including 
the secret Loksa submarine base near Tallinn." 
<H5>  Radioactivity a Concern </H5>
  One thing that concerns the Estonians deeply is that the 
Russians have dumped radioactive materials into the sea. Some of 
these dumping sites are marked on Russian nautical maps, while 
others are not. 
  As a result, Grisell will try to chart out the radioactive 
areas with the help of his research ship. This will require 
special equipment. 
  "We hope to begin in early spring, but we must come up with 
the money." 
  The Estonians have expressed the hope that this will proceed 
more rapidly that it has to date, since Swedish assistance has 
been bogged down in bureaucracy.

<F P=106> [Article by Hans Strandberg: "Chlorine Emissions Rapidly </F>
Reduced; 80-Percent Reduction in Four Years, `Unrealistic' 
Demands Achieved"] 
  [Text] The Swedish timber industry's emission of 
environmentally harmful chlorine compounds has been reduced by a 
good 80 percent in just four years, despite continued high 
production. Environmental demands were met several years ahead 
of time, something that had earlier been regarded as unrealistic 
by the industry. 
<H5>  Deformed Fish </H5>
  Emissions from long-lived organic chlorine 
compounds--including the very unfortunate dioxin--was one of the 
major environmental issues of the 1980's. 
  The most extreme sign of it was malformed, sometimes 
sterile, 
fish in the waters around pulp plants--where emission of 
bleaching agents was and is the largest source of pollution. 
But, there was also uneasiness concerning the more long-term 
accumulation of chlorine compounds on the sea floor, and in 
animals and people. 
  Society registered its concern--the government through tough 
environmental measures, consumers through boycotting 
chlorine-bleached diapers, coffee filters, and writing paper. 
Environmental correctness became a factor in competitiveness. 
  In 1988, the Riksdag set the goal of cutting emissions in 
half, corresponding to 1.8 kilograms of organically bound 
chlorine (measured by the so-called AOX [expansion unknown] 
method) per ton of pulp production. The effort to reach this 
level was to begin no later than 1992. The industry wanted more 
lenient standards and a longer time to fulfill them. 
<H5>  Alternative Chemicals </H5>
  The reality was quite different, all the environmental goals 
were exceeded. The industrial average for 1992, according to the 
most recent report from the Swedish Environmental Agency, was 
approximately 0.6 kilograms AOX per ton of pulp, a reduction of 
80 percent in four years. 
  "Yes, you are correct, it progressed very quickly--through 
rapid technical advancement and conversion to other bleaching 
chemicals. Above all, in the case of the most dangerous, 
long-lived compounds, including dioxin," said Erik Nystrom of 
the Swedish Environmental Agency. 
  The reason is due primarily to the fact that the old 
chlorine 
gas is no longer used as a bleaching agent. It has been replaced 
principally by chlorine dioxide, but also by chlorine-free 
alternatives such as hydrogen peroxide and ozone. Deformed pike 
are no longer to be found. 
  The political objective now is to reach levels by the year 
2000 at which "the environment is not harmed at all." 
<H5>  Closed Systems </H5>
  Are we perhaps already there? 
  "We don't know. There are those who believe that even 
today's 
chlorine content causes harm, if somewhat more diffuse, but 
there are also those who think the opposite. Even completely 
chlorine-free bleaching can cause certain problems, but we do 
not have sufficient knowledge," said Nystrom. 
  He feels that other emissions--metals, nutritive salts, 
lignin, resin acids--are now receiving greater emphasis and 
point to the next step, the "closed factory." Runoff water is 
returned to the factory and waste products can be readily 
controlled. This also saves energy. 
  "In three or four years, there is sure to be a number of 
factories with closed systems. It can be done with chlorine 
dioxide, but is technically simpler with ozone. Furthermore, the 
market is demanding ever more chlorine-free paper," said Nystrom.

<F P=106> [Commentary by chairman and deputy chairman of Environmental </F>
Protection Association: "Government Lowers Ambitions for 
Environmental Protection"] 
  [Text] This policy harms nature and undermines the Swedish 
timber industry's export potential, Ulf von Sydow and Stefan 
Edman feel. 
  Logging in Njakafjall in Vilhelminas is finished for this 
year. The rich forest with its many threatened species continues 
to be harmed. 
  But Njakafjell is not a unique case, rather an example of a 
more general course of events. Every week reports reach us on 
how valuable nature around our country is being damaged--a 
result of an exceptionally weak environmental protection policy. 
  The government says that the responsibility for managing 
environmental protection in the forests lies with the timber 
industry. It is called "voluntary cooperation." Laws that 
provide effective protection (outside of preserves and national 
parks) consequently do not exist. 
  Often, fortunately, individual timberland owners do 
cooperate. But if voluntary cooperation is contingent upon 
owners receiving compensation for sparing a valuable wooded 
area, environmental protection is likely also to be forfeit. 
State provision for compensating infringement are small and do 
not go far. 
  The politicians' most important contribution is doubtless 
the 
clarity of their goals. The proposition on biological diversity, 
for example, states that "...the environmental objective should 
be given the same emphasis and significance as various economic 
considerations." The new forest protection law contains similar 
formulations on objectives. 
  Other environmental areas are rife with obligatory, 
sometimes 
costly, demands that require adjustment. The catalytic 
converter, for example, adds thousands of kronor to the price of 
a new car. 
<H5>  Disadvantaged Area </H5>
  In the area of environmental protection, on the other hand, 
there are virtually no requirements. If a person wishes to 
protect the environment, that is fine, but if a person does not 
feel that he has the means or the interest, he can forego it. 
  The situation resembles conditions in the 1960's when 
industries were not obliged to defray environmental costs, 
rather they received state subsidies to deal with emissions. 
  The improvements that we have begun to notice with regard to 
forest management are important and positive, but they are not 
occurring because of legislation, but despite legislation. In 
reality, there is no environmental protection law worthy of the 
name. 
  A key problem is the regulations on compensation which were 
introduced in 1987. 
  --Before 1987, the extent of the demands regarding 
responsibility for the environment that society could make in 
connection with the felling of timber (sparing protected zones, 
old and dead trees, high brush, etc.) pertained to all of the 
affected property. After 1987, it pertained only to "the 
affected area of the property," that is, normally only the 
cutting area. 
  This modification meant that the responsibility on a daily 
basis for protecting nature during timber harvesting was 
dramatically reduced. But the resolution also opened the way for 
unwilling timberland owners to avoid the responsibility for 
protection by cleverly laying out their cutting area. A couple 
of these cases are pending in the courts. 
  --At the same time, a ceiling was introduced, which has been 
set after sentencing in a couple of cases at approximately 9,000 
kronor (the equivalent of about 50 trees). The timberland owner 
need never suffer greater expense. 
  If society requests greater responsibility, the timberland 
owner--regardless of what natural asset is threatened--can 
either refuse to take on the responsibility or else, demand 
compensation. The already limited exigencies to take 
responsibility are thus set aside completely. 
<H5>  Hasty Compromise </H5>
  The 1987 resolution was a hastily constructed compromise. 
The 
Social Democrats quite simply needed support in order to 
introduce plan and building laws. The consequences for 
environmental protection were not analyzed at all. 
  Since its enactment, the resolution has been criticized 
strongly, particularly by the Liberal Party, which had 
reservations from the start. 
  Thus it is the more surprising that the so-called Freedom 
and 
Rights Committee is now proposing that the somewhat scrambled 
Social Democratic-Center Party compromise be written into the 
Constitution and accorded the same status as the right to vote 
and freedom of the press! 
  Still stranger is the fact that neither the Left Party, the 
Social Democrats, nor the Liberal Party's committee members 
protested the suggestion! Did they not realize the consequences? 
  Clearly individual timberland owners should have the right 
to 
compensation in the case of a major infringement. But, at the 
same time, modern environmental thinking stipulates that each 
line of trade must be prepared to take economic responsibility 
for its effects on the environment. 
  We are convinced that most timberland owners agree with us 
that they must assume some fundamental, obligatory 
responsibility without compensation. 
  The current arrangement, in which the timber industry 
largely 
lacks legal (and thereby economic) responsibility for the 
environmental harm it perpetrates is unreasonable and benefits 
only the loggers who shirk their environmental responsibility. 
  If the proposal for a change in the Constitution is passed, 
it will exclude any possibility of creating modern conservation 
legislation. Do Olof Johansson, the Liberal Party, and the 
Social Democrats accept that? And where do the Christian 
Democrats stand on this? 
  At the same time, the government is on the verge of letting 
go of the most viable possibility for solving the need of new 
forest reserves. Sweden has, from the international perspective, 
protected a very small portion of its forested regions, only 0.5 
percent below the reforestation limit. 
  To achieve the goal of protected biological diversity, on 
the 
order of 10 times as much forest area should be protected. 
  The need is greatest in south and central Sweden, but 
establishing large reserves in these parts is expensive, 
complicated, and time consuming, not least because of the 
extensive parceling of property. 
  One way to rapidly improve our situation is to transfer a 
portion of the still completely state-owned Domain AB to the 
Environmental Agency and reduce correspondingly the value of the 
company. Such a solution was discussed already when the Office 
of Domains was incorporated a couple of years ago, but was not 
utilized. 
  By allowing Domain/Assi [Swedish Forest Industries] to merge 
with the partly private NCB, the government is on the verge of 
blowing its unique opportunity of establishing the needed 
reserves in a single stroke. Has the trade minister thought of 
this? 
<H5>  Biotope Protection </H5>
  A further step backwards is the government's application of 
so-called biotope protection that was intended to protect 
"certain smaller field and water areas (biotopes) that provide a 
habitat for endangered animals or plants or are otherwise 
especially deserving of protection." The protection was intended 
primarily to have an automatic, overall application. 
  The government has now determined that biotope protection 
should be implemented in a manner that completely waters down 
the Riksdag proposal: 
  --Protection for "habitats for endangered animal and plant 
species" will not be undertaken at all. Instead, there will be 
protection for a number of specified types of environment. 
  --Of the designated environments, there are only a few 
biotopes in logging areas that will be accorded automatic, 
overall protection. 
  Viewed in its entirity, this conservation policy means that 
the government has backed off from its previously established 
ambitions. The gap between political rhetoric and actual 
practice is widening. 
  This policy harms nature and also undermines the Swedish 
timber industry's opportunities in export markets. Credibility 
with regard to environmental efforts will be ever more 
important, and nothing would strengthen the Swedish timber 
industry's credibility more than a strong conservation 
legislation and an ambitious investment in additional nature 
reserves.

<F P=106> [Article by Gosta Karlsson: "Environmental Goals Cannot Be </F>
Met"] 
  [Text] The attempts to reduce the overfertilization of the 
North Sea by 50 percent by the year 1995 will not be successful. 
None of the eight North Sea nations will be able to cut its 
nitrogen emissions in half, as was agreed on six years ago. The 
threat to the ecosystem of the sea will thus remain. 
  The environment and agriculture ministers of the countries 
know this as they meet in Copenhagen on 7-8 December in order to 
discuss the protection of the North Sea. And in their hands they 
will get a fresh report in which researchers warn against the 
damaging effects on the marine environment if the countries' 
governments do not in earnest begin to deal with the nitrogen 
and phosphorus emissions. 
  The rivers that flow into the North Sea are loaded with 
nitrogen compounds. According to the most recent calculations, 
about 1 million tons of nitrogen are added to the sea that way 
each year. Its origin is primarily commercial fertilizer in 
agriculture and wastewater; 75 percent of the "river nitrogen" 
comes from the Rhine and the Elbe. 
  Furthermore, each year the North Sea receives about 600,000 
tons of nitrogen in the form of fallout from the atmosphere. 
Automobile traffic and industrial processes are the biggest 
sources here. 
<H5>  Overfertilizing </H5>
  In the central North Sea airborne transportation of nitrogen 
plays a greater role than river transportation, and the fallout 
of ammonia and nitric oxides in this sea has turned out to be 
greater than previously calculated. 
  The addition of phosphates from the Rhine and Elbe is said 
to 
have decreased somewhat in recent years, but, at least as 
regards the Elbe, researchers are uncertain whether this is the 
result of lower pollution or because the flow of water during 
the sampling period was lower than usual. 
  Thus, the overfertilization of the North Sea continues, 
despite the fact that at the Second North Sea Conference in 
London in 1987 the environment ministers of the affected 
countries agreed that nitrogen emissions must be reduced by 50 
percent--from the 1985 level--by the year 1995. None of the 
countries will be able to meet that commitment. 
  The effects of the massive nitrogen flow is, among others, 
that the balance between a variety of plant plankton (algae) is 
disturbed. Certain species spread at the expense of others and 
also increase their production of toxic substances when the 
supply of nitrogen becomes too high. An example of this 
phenomenon is the catastrophic accumulation of toxic algae in 
Skagerrak and Kattegat in 1968. 
  At the Third North Sea Conference, in The Hague in 1990, 
heavy metals and organic environmental poisons such as dioxins 
and PCB's [polychlorinated biphenyl] were the principal theme. 
The ministers decided that the emissions of about 40 indicated 
substances were to be halved, here as well from the 1985 level, 
by 1995. The substances are given in a "blacklist." Four of the 
substances, cadmium, mercury, lead, and dioxins, are to be 
reduced by 70 percent over the same period because of their 
toxicity in the environment, according to the decision in The 
Hague. 
<H5>  Uncertain </H5>
  Just what will happen to that goal is uncertain, judging by 
the levels of substances found in the bottom sediments and 
organisms of the North Sea. The researchers are saying, somewhat 
vaguely, that the "emissions have decreased, rather than 
increased." But even if the emissions have declined, it has 
still not had any impact on the North Sea. There, the levels of 
heavy metals and chloro-organic pollution are unchanged or even 
higher, in certain areas. 
  Footnote: The data on emissions are taken from the 
1987 "Quality Status of the North Sea," the most recent public 
report on the environmental condition of the North Sea. The data 
were submitted by the respective nations to an international 
research group, which has been given the task of following the 
development in the North Sea.

<F P=106> [Article by Gosta Karlsson: "Emissions Must Be Cut in Half"] </F>
  [Text] Farmers in Scania and western Sweden can prepare 
themselves for stricter environmental demands in order to reduce 
nitrogen emissions from fertilizer handling. The requirements 
are coming as part of the agreement by the North Sea nations to 
reduce by half the leaking of nutrients into the sea by 1995. 
  The contribution by agriculture to the overfertilization of 
the sea became a controversial subject on Wednesday [8 December] 
at the ministerial meeting in Copenhagen on the nations' efforts 
to restore the ecological balance in the North Sea. 
  England and France refused to join an agreement that by 1990 
[as published] or no later than 1992 [as published] agriculture 
must have switched to what is called balanced fertilization. 
  Exactly what such fertilization means has not been 
specified, 
but the purpose is to reduce the excess nutrient salts in the 
sea to a minimum. This goal is in line with the European Union's 
so-called nitrate directives, which take effect with the EEA 
[European Economic Area] agreement. 
<H5>  Overfertilization </H5>
  As a foundation for the agreement in Copenhagen, each of the 
eight North Sea nations has indicated which areas are most 
sensitive to overfertilization. The excess nutrient salts cause 
abnormal algae growth and disturbs the entire marine ecosystem. 
  England regards itself as not having any problems of 
overfertilization at all along its coasts. As for the rest of 
the North Sea, the British Government believes that it could be 
a matter of "little bits here and there." 
  "We cannot sign a decision to solve a problem that does not 
exist," said Deputy Agriculture Minister Earl Howe, who headed 
the British delegation to the Copenhagen conference. 
  He also was not of the opinion that it has been 
scientifically proven that leakage of nutrient salts and 
pesticides from British agriculture can cross the North Sea and 
affect other countries' marine areas. 
  France admits that there is a transitional problem to deal 
with, but does not want to agree to a deadline for measures. 
<H5>  Reactionaries </H5>
  Sweden's Agriculture Minister Karl Erik Olsson tells DAGENS 
NYHETER that on this point the British can only be described as 
"stubborn reactionaries" in environmental cooperation. 
  Karl Erik Olsson believes that Sweden, for its part, has a 
chance of being able to cut its nitrogen emissions in half by 
1995 "or about then." 
  He reveals that he will shortly submit a proposal for 
stricter environmental requirements for the way Swedish farmers 
handle fertilizer. 
  "We must reduce emissions of ammonia to the air from 
fertilizer plants as well as the handling of the fertilizer in 
the fields. We can do this by, among other things, using better 
spreaders for liquid fertilizer and by mixing it into the soil 
faster." 
  The stricter requirements apply primarily to the farmers of 
southern and western Sweden. 
  Since, according to Karl Erik Olsson, this will mean 
expensive new investments by the farmer in new equipment, he 
promises a generous transition period before new regulations 
take effect. 
<H5>  Strong Words </H5>
  At the conclusion of the Copenhagen conference with a news 
conference on Wednesday [8 December], Danish Environment 
Minister Svend Auken in harsh words condemned "the refusal by 
some large and prosperous industrial nations to deal with their 
wastewater treatment." 
  One-third of all the wastewater flowing into the North Sea 
is 
untreated. Svend Auken did not mention any countries by name, 
but it is well known that France, Belgium, and England are the 
principal ones. 
  Their wastewater contains very large amounts of by and large 
every environmental poison which affects the North Sea.

"Energy Efficiency First Signed by UK and Russia"] 
  [Text] An agreement that will take British energy 
efficiency expertise to Russia was signed today by Environment 
Secretary John Gummer and representatives of the Russian 
Federation. 
  It is the first time that a western country has signed such 
an agreement with Russia. 
  Speaking at the signing with Aleksander Kouzmitski, [name as 
received] Deputy Minister of Science and Technology, Mr Gummer 
said: 
  "I am delighted that the UK is at the forefront bringing the 
benefits of energy conservation to Russia and that my 
Department's Energy Efficiency Office has played a major role in 
making this possible. This country has companies that are the 
leading edge in this field and have much to offer." 
  "I warmly welcome this very practical sign of co-operation 
between our two countries which I hope will blossom further. Our 
companies can benefit through new trade opportunities while the 
people of Russia will have warm, but energy efficient homes." 
  "All energy conservation is good for the planet. The more 
energy efficient Russia can become the better it is for everyone 
as pollution is reduced and fuel saved." 
  Through the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe 
Energy Committee's Energy Efficiency 2000 programme 
demonstration projects are being set up in Eastern Europe 
including Russia. 
  British companies including Rolls Royce are interested in 
taking part in a scheme aimed at improving energy efficiency in 
10,000 Moscow flats owned by Gasprom, the Russian gas company. 
  As the projects are established it is hoped their ideas will 
spread throughout the country offering increasing business 
opportunities to British companies. The improvements would be 
paid for from the saving in energy bills. 
<H5>  Note to Editors </H5>
  Also present at the signing at the Department of the 
Environment in Marsham Street was Mr Boris Pamkin, Russian 
Ambassador, and representatives of Rolls Royce, March Consulting 
Group, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the 
Russian Federation, the Foreign and Commonwealth office and the 
Department of the Environment's Energy Efficiency Office. Press

  [Text] Geneva, Dec 13 (AFP) -- Greenpeace and the World 
Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) on Wednesday [day as received] 
condemned the GATT talks nearing their finale here, saying that 
negotiators had completely ignored vital environmental issues. 
  "The GATT as it stands right now seems to have a 
trade-at-all- costs attitude," Greenpeace said while the WWF 
attacked the proposed Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO) that 
will administer the GATT agreement. 
  "The MTO will have the power to override national laws on 
environmental protection, health and safety," WWF director 
Gordon Shepherd said. 
  "Uruguay Round drafts show that trade negotiators have 
failed 
even to establish a trade and environment committee within the 
proposed MTO," he said. 
  Charles Arden-Clarke of Greenpeace said that by ignoring the 
environment the credibility of the MTO had been damaged before 
its inception "at a time when the environment and sustainable 
development are at the top of the international political 
agenda." 
  Representatives from 115 nations are meeting here in an 
attempt to end the Uruguay Round of talks under the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

  [Text] In accordance with a directive from the 
Government of the Russian Federation, the Russian Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources has in 
conjunction with other affected ministries and agencies prepared 
and submitted for the government's consideration a draft 
``National Plan of Action To Implement the Decisions of the UN 
Conference on the Environment and Development'' (Rio de Janeiro, 
1992). As additional work is done on this draft, consideration 
will be given to the results of the Europe-wide conference 
entitled ``The Environment for Europe,'' held in Switzerland in 
1993. 
  The draft document that we propose to discuss in the pages 
of 
ZELENYY MIR has been considered and approved by an interagency 
commission established in accordance with the government's 
directive. 
<H5>  I. Conceptual Foundations </H5>
  The National Plan To Implement the Decisions of the UN 
Conference on the Environment and Development (subsequently to 
be referred to as ``the National Plan'') was developed for the 
purpose of providing a basis for urgent measures and basic goals 
with regard to ensuring environmental safety and restoring the 
environment. 
  This document is based on the Russian Federation law ``On 
Environmental Protection,'' decrees issued by the Government of 
the Russian Federation, decisions by the UN Conference on the 
Environment and Development (June 1992, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), 
the Lucerne Conference on a Program of Action To Protect the 
Environment of Central and Eastern Europe (April 1993, 
Switzerland) and the board of the Russian Ministry of Ecology 
[as published] in regard to priority areas requiring program 
development in the field of environmental protection, and 
statements contained in the Russian Federation's State 
Environmental Program. 
  The National Plan is a foundation for Russia's actions in 
regard to the environment and development. 
  It is essential to be guided by the following key 
principles: 
  -- consideration for environmental and development issues in 
the process of political and economic decisionmaking; 
  -- compliance with the requirements of environmental 
protection legislation and environmental standards; 
  -- compliance with the terms of environmental protection 
when 
implementing reforms designed to bring about sustainable 
economic development; 
  -- use of economic means to compensate for losses due to 
environmental pollution; 
  -- reduction of risks to public health resulting from 
pollution and the harmful effect of the environment, including 
air pollution in cities and buildings, water pollution, the 
problems of pesticides, wastes, noise, and ionizing and 
nonionizing radiation, coupled with creation of a system for 
monitoring the state of the environment and assessing its 
quality and the state of public health; 
  -- protection of the environment and natural resources with 
consideration for the maintenance of the distinctiveness, 
culture, and interests of native people and guarantees of their 
effective participation in the achievement of sustainable 
development; 
  -- further development of international cooperation for the 
purpose of preserving, protecting, and restoring the integrity 
of the Earth's ecosystems; 
  -- improvement of international legal relations pertaining 
to 
liability and compensation for the negative effects of 
environmental damage. 
  These principles will make it possible, despite a lack of 
funding and the state of existing economic relationships, to 
establish priorities among environmental problems when federal 
and regional program materials are compiled as components of the 
national plan of action. 
  The National Plan envisions a transition period during which 
gradual changes in the economic mechanism will be used to bring 
about adaptation to market relationships, as well as a gradual 
transition from strictly regulated, centrally planned management 
of natural resource use to a decentralized system of regional 
management. 
<H3>  Section 1. Development of a System for the Management of 
Natural Resource Use and Environmental Protection </H3>
  In recent decades the worsening state of the environment has 
begun to cause a real decline in people's standard of living and 
to limit opportunities for the economic and social development 
of major industrial regions and cities. More than 80 percent of 
the resources produced are expended to support 
resource-extracting and resource-intensive processing 
facilities: Smelting one tonne of steel ``consumes'' up to 20 
tonnes of primary resources (including mine overburden and 
enclosing deposits). More than 75 percent of all production 
wastes are to varying degrees toxic to the environment and human 
health. The wasteful and destructive nature of natural resource 
use is constantly giving rise to new and ever more acute 
environmental problems. 
  The worsening of the environmental situation is the result 
of 
structural deformations of the economy that have accumulated 
over a period of many decades and have resulted in the 
predominance of nature-intensive industries, outdated 
resource-intensive and energy-intensive technologies, a raw 
materials emphasis in exports, and inadequately focused efforts 
in recent years to prevent the harmful effects of commercial and 
other activities on human beings and the environment. 
  The beginning of radical economic reform made the issue of a 
changing role for the ecological factor in society's development 
more urgent. There is now a serious threat of a worsening 
environmental situation due to: 
  -- disruption of commercial relations, disruption of planned 
operating systems, and higher levels of production-related 
accidents; 
  -- enterprises' financial difficulties, which limit their 
ability to carry out environmental protection measures; 
  -- inadequate budget allocations to sectors responsible for 
the reproduction and protection of natural resources (forestry 
and water resource agencies, geological surveys and 
environmental protection agencies); 
  -- the lack of legislative restrictions on the powers and 
responsibility of organs of government and administration along 
vertical and horizontal lines, which leads to a lack of 
coordination in measures taken in the field of natural resource 
use and environmental safety, to irresponsible actions with 
regard to the disposition of natural resources, and to their de 
facto plundering. 
  The environmental situation can be stabilized and improved 
only through a change in the orientation of the Russian 
Federation's socioeconomic development, a formation of new 
values and moral guideposts, and a reconsideration of the 
structure of needs, goals, priorities, and means involved in 
human activity. This will require a complex of radical 
political, legislative, socioeconomic, technological, and other 
measures. Furthermore, the principle of reasonable compromise 
must be applied when resolving conflicts that arise between the 
need to abide by environmental regulations and restrictions and 
the economic motivation of commercial activity. 
  Thus, it is essential that a state policy be 
developed in the field of natural resource use and environmental 
protection. 
  The most important focus of state environmental policy is 
the 
creation of a new legal and economic mechanism to regulate 
interaction between state organs at various levels and natural 
resource users, and the inclusion of environmental requirements 
in the procedure for assessing the socioeconomic effectiveness 
of the administrative decisions that are made. 
  The nature of these transformations is: 
  -- improvement of environmental protection legislation, the 
system of environmental restrictions and regulations, and 
natural resource use regulations, with the goal of adapting them 
to the situation of price liberalization and destatization of 
property; 
  -- a gradual transition to international standards for 
technological processes and products that will create the 
essential conditions for Russia's inclusion in the world economy 
and the international environmental safety system; 
  -- unification of departmental systems for observation and 
monitoring of the state of natural resources and environmental 
sites that currently exist in the regions under unified 
methodological and organizational leadership; 
  -- economic incentives for resource and energy conservation 
and introduction of equipment and technology that meet 
environmental requirements, by means of state tax, lending, and 
price policies; 
  -- environmental assessment and evaluation of environmental 
impact during implementation of all programs and projects of a 
commercial or other nature; 
  -- creation of topical environmental maps, regional 
cadastral 
maps of natural resources, and geo-information systems using a 
unified digital topographic base; 
  -- creation of an environmentally oriented job market and 
development of enterprise in that field. 
  These transformations should lay the groundwork for the 
stabilization and subsequent improvement of the environmental 
situation in Russia. 
  Under conditions of price liberalization--including prices 
for fuel and energy resources--state environmental safety 
regulatory measures are an important factor in stimulating more 
efficient use of energy and mineral and water resources and 
reducing pollution of the air and water. Consideration for the 
real cost of resources will force a transition away from the 
practice of large-scale capital investment connected with heavy 
industrial production toward an ongoing process of replacement 
of existing capital equipment and introduction of new 
technologies, resulting in a reduction in the average amount of 
pollution per product unit. 
<H6>  1.1. Legislation and the Mechanism of Legal Standards </H6>
  Legal support for the National Plan will have as its goal 
the 
development of a scientifically based system of environmental 
legislation and the creation of an effective mechanism for its 
implementation for the purpose of protecting the environment, 
organizing rational natural resource use and creating an 
all-encompassing environmental safety system. 
  Existing environmental legal acts and the mechanism by which 
they are applied should be based on a harmonious combination of 
economic and environmental interests, with constant priority 
given to human beings' rights to a healthy environment and 
favorable living conditions, and to preservation of the 
biosphere's sustainable ecosystems. 
  In view of active entrepreneurial activity and the 
transition 
to a market economy, no legislative acts should be adopted that 
do not reflect environmental requirements. 
  In 1993-1994 a scientifically based system of environmental 
legislation should be created, and in the process it is 
essential that a whole series of fundamental legal acts be 
adopted: 
  1. in regard to matters under the jurisdiction of federal 
organs of state authority and organs of authority under the 
components of the Federation--the Fundamentals of Russian 
Federation Legislation on Environmental Protection and 
Regulation of Natural Resource Use; the Fundamentals of 
Legislation on Environmental Safety in Russia; the Fundamentals 
of Russian Federation Land, Forest, and Water Legislation; the 
Fundamentals of Legislation on Underground Resources; the 
Fundamentals of Legislation on Protection of the Atmosphere; the 
Fundamentals of Legislation on Flora; the Fundamentals of 
Legislation on Fauna; and the Fundamentals of Legislation on 
Specially Protected Natural Areas; 
  2. in regard to matters under the sole jurisdiction of 
Russian Federation federal organs of state authority--the 
Russian Federation laws ``On Protection of Public Health and the 
Environment During the Production, Use, Storage, and 
Transportation of Pesticides, Chemical Fertilizers, and Other 
Agricultural Chemicals,'' ``On the Continental Shelf of the 
Russian Federation,'' ``On the Exclusive Economic Zone of the 
Russian Federation,'' ``On Lake Baykal,'' ``On Production and 
Consumption Wastes,'' ``On Public Radiation Safety,'' ``On State 
Policy in the Area of Radioactive Waste Handling,'' ``On 
Environmental Assessment,'' ``On Environmental Monitoring,'' 
``On the Economic Mechanism of Natural Resource Use,'' ``On 
Measures To Provide Legal and Social Protection for Employees of 
Specially Authorized Russian Federation Agencies in the Field of 
Environmental Protection.'' 
  Additionally, it is essential to introduce environmentally 
oriented changes and additions to existing laws such as the 
Russian Federation law issued on 4 June 1991 and entitled ``On 
Foreign Investment in the Russian Federation,'' the Russian 
Federation Civil Procedural Code, the Russian Federation Code of 
Administrative Legal Violations, the Russian Federation Criminal 
Code, and the Russian Federation Civil Code. 
  The following should also be drawn up, in addition to the 
aforementioned legislative acts: 
  -- normative acts establishing a procedure for application 
of 
civil penalties for violations of environmental legislation; 
  -- a procedure for suspending or terminating the operations 
of associations, enterprises, and organizations that violate the 
environmental requirements of legislation (suspension of 
operations by individual units of equipment or assemblies, or 
individual types of work) and compensation for damages done to 
the environment; 
  -- a procedure for appealing decisions by executive bodies 
in 
the area of environmental protection and natural resources; 
  -- a procedure for preparation of the documents necessary to 
pursue criminal prosecution; 
  -- a procedure for collecting payments for natural resource 
use and environmental pollution; 
  -- a procedure for delineating the authority of 
environmental 
management organs. 
<H6>  1.2. Economic Regulation of Natural Resource Use </H6>
  The nature and scale of improvement in the environmental 
situation expected as a result of the implementation of economic 
reform may vary significantly depending on the nature of the 
environment and the pollutants in question. The market economy 
is not a panacea. In those cases in which it does not work, an 
energetic environmental protection policy is needed, 
particularly when expenses in connection with damage done to the 
environment as a result of which individual people or 
communities suffer are not compensated for by those responsible 
for the damage. Some of these measures could be aimed at 
adjusting market stimuli (for example, by forcing polluters to 
pay a fine as compensation for damage caused as a result of the 
emission or discharge of pollutants), while others could suspend 
the operation of the market mechanism by imposing limits on 
emissions or discharges and on natural resource use. 
  At the present stage of economic reform (1993-95), it is 
essential to use to maximum effect those levers and stimuli with 
the aid of which it is possible to utilize untapped resources to 
improve the environmental situation in the country without 
incurring significant expenditures. 
  Toward that end it is essential: 
  -- to improve the mechanism of payments for pollutant 
emissions and discharges, develop and introduce into practice 
standard payments as compensation for damages resulting from 
various types of adverse effects on the environment 
(noise-related, thermal, electromagnetic, radioactive, and so 
on); 
  -- to develop an economic mechanism for accounting between 
the individual regions of the Russian Federation and various 
states for damages caused to the environment by cross-border 
dispersal of pollutants; 
  -- to develop and introduce into practice a system of 
regional cadastral maps of natural resources, including 
estimates of the value thereof; 
  -- to carry out measures to develop and support 
environmental 
enterprise and improve legislation in order to develop an 
environmental services market; 
  -- to create a system of environmental restrictions and 
regulations governing natural resource use; 
  -- to develop ecological economic assessments at the stages 
of projection, planning, pre-project, developmental, and other 
economic decisions; 
  -- to provide tax breaks for that portion of enterprises' 
profits set aside for environmental protection measures; 
  -- to create a state order system to implement environmental 
protection measures in environmental disaster areas and in areas 
with acute environmental situations; 
  -- to attract foreign capital on favorable terms in order to 
make additional financing available for environmental protection 
measures; 
  -- to create a market trading in the rights to discharge 
pollutants into the environment within established limits; 
  -- to develop progressive standards for maximum permissible 
emissions (discharges) of pollutants for basic technologies and 
types of production; 
  -- to establish a special tax rate for products manufactured 
using environmentally hazardous technologies; 
  -- to create a multilevel system of environmental protection 
insurance funds to finance the prevention and elimination of 
environmental effects from major accidents and human-caused or 
natural disasters; 
  -- to apply lending on favorable terms and subsidies for 
enterprises that effectively implement environmental program 
goals; 
  -- to improve the search for new basic approaches to the 
economic management of environmental protection activity (the 
environmental price of production and environmentally based 
economic calculations of production efficiency); 
  -- to expand the special-rate (lending) form of financing 
for 
environmental efforts out of local, oblast, kray, republic, and 
Russian Federation environmental funds. 
  Federal administrative bodies in conjunction with republic, 
kray, and oblast administrative bodies will define key regions 
in which to conduct experiments to develop new elements in the 
economic regulation of natural resource use, arrange scientific 
support for that work with funding from the Russian 
Environmental Fund, disseminate the experience gathered in these 
key regions, and ensure broad study and consultation by 
specialists from other regions of the Russian Federation. 
<H6>  1.3. The Public Health-Related, Demographic, and Ethnic 
Aspects of Natural Resource Use </H6>
  Without exception, all efforts to ensure environmental 
safety 
set forth in the National Plan and all measures to develop a 
system of natural resource use and environmental protection 
administration and to encourage environmental training and 
education must to one degree or another guarantee the health of 
individuals and society. 
  One priority issue is the deterioration of health as a 
result 
of a poor-quality environment. A threat to human health (and to 
the economy) is posed by the following types of pollutants: 
  -- lead contained in the air and in soil, with its source 
being zinc and lead smelters and vehicles; 
  -- airborne dust from household furnaces, small enterprises, 
electric and heat generating plants, large metallurgical plants, 
and other plants; 
  -- sulfur dioxide and other gases, particularly in 
combination with dust. 
  Other sources of health hazard are: 
  -- nitrates dissolved in water as a result of inadequate 
planning of feed storage facilities and other agricultural 
facilities and settling ponds in rural areas, and from improper 
fertilizer use; 
  -- pollutants in food and water, particularly in cases of 
the 
direct presence of heavy metals or toxic chemicals in drinking 
water reservoirs or the improper disposal of toxic nuclear 
wastes. 
  In addition, it is essential that provision also be made for 
the following measures: 
  -- to establish criteria for and identify zones and sites 
that are sources of increased environmental hazard and that 
directly affect human health; 
  -- to create a system of environmental medical monitoring by 
pooling the efforts and funds of agencies under the Russian 
State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight, the 
Russian Ministry of Health, the Russian Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, local soviets, 
and other affected institutions, enterprises, and organizations. 
The Government of the Russian Federation will consider the 
possibility of additional allocations for these purposes; 
  -- to carry out environmental hygiene mapping of all of 
Russia; 
  -- to continue development of a system to track public 
health 
indicators and pinpoint factors negatively affecting the 
environment, taking into consideration the indirect and combined 
effects of various factors on public health; 
  -- to draw up an inventory and ranking of facilities in the 
economy that are hazardous to human health during normal 
operations and in the event of accidental emissions (or 
discharges); 
  -- to begin gradual introduction of a special natural 
resource use system within areas inhabited by or used 
economically by small peoples and ethnic groups in order to 
preserve their traditional natural resource use and cultural and 
economic ways of life. 
<H6>  1.4. State Environmental Assessment </H6>
  In order to ensure the effectiveness of State Environmental 
Assessment and improve its effectiveness during the 1993-95 
period, it is essential: 
  -- to pass a law on environmental assessment that will 
define 
the legal status of State Environmental Assessment and provide 
legal support for decisions made by State Environmental 
Assessment; 
  -- to adopt a statute on State Environmental Assessment on 
Russian territory; 
  -- to improve the existing system of funding for 
environmental assessment centrally and locally; to adopt a new 
procedure for payment to nonstaff experts and members of the 
Council on State Environmental Assessment, and make provision 
for significant recruitment of highly qualified specialists to 
work in the system of environmental assessment agencies; 
  -- to adopt a statute on payment of nonstaff experts and 
members of the Expert Council; 
  -- to clearly delineate the functions of subunits within the 
State Environmental Assessment of the Russian Ministry of 
Natural Resources and Environmental Protection, and in other 
agencies; 
  -- to develop an automated system of state environmental 
assessment; 
  -- to develop a system of geo-information support for the 
State Environmental Assessment system; 
  -- to develop a system of experts to define environmental 
disaster areas on the basis of regional categorization; 
  -- to develop guidelines for the conducting of medical 
environmental assessments; 
  -- to develop methodologies for tracking the state of the 
geological environment when environmental assessments are 
conducted; 
  -- to develop methodologies for monitoring the biological 
indices of industrial pollution; 
  -- to develop methodological recommendations to determine 
the 
degree of economic risk involved in various types of commercial 
activity; 
  -- to develop criteria by which to assess the ecological 
condition of the environment in regions with a high level of 
technogenic burden; 
  -- to develop a draft normative and organizational basis for 
interaction between the systems of Federal Geo-Ecological 
Monitoring and state environmental assessment; 
  -- to develop a draft and a working model of a system of 
geo-information support for the procedure of state environmental 
assessment; 
  -- in order to improve the training of employees of the 
Russian State Environmental Assessment system, to make provision 
for their focused training according to a special program and a 
single methodology; 
  -- to develop a methodological basis and a working model of 
an automated State Environmental Assessment work station; 
  -- to make provision for the establishment of temporary 
research teams on a cost-accounting basis, to develop normative 
and methodological documents regulating the operations of bodies 
of experts, requirements of planning documents, with 
consideration for scientific and technical advances, and 
promising objectives in the socioeconomic development of the 
republic and individual regions of Russia; 
  -- to reinforce the physical and technical infrastructure 
and 
create a testing laboratory (both stationary and mobile) in 
which to conduct control analyses as part of the assessment 
process and a data bank on nonstaff experts, scientific 
collectives, environmentally clean technologies, equipment, and 
so on. 
<H6>  1.5. The Federal System of Environmental Monitoring and 
Information Support for It </H6>
  At the present time a large portion of the information 
regarding the state of the environment and sources of adverse 
effects is scattered among agencies, has varying degrees of 
accuracy and quality, was collected and compiled for various 
purposes, and often either does not cover an issue in its 
entirety or is not reliable. 
  In the 1993-94 period, the main focuses of improvement in 
state environmental monitoring are: 
  -- development and approval of a ``Statute on Monitoring of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resource Use''; 
  -- development and practical application of a unified system 
of standardization and methodological support for the operations 
of state monitoring agencies in the fields of ecology and 
natural resource use; 
  -- development of a draft program for a unified state system 
to monitor the state of the environment using state and 
departmental systems, as well as efforts to guarantee their 
methodological, metrical, informational, and organizational 
compatibility; 
  -- creation of the first stage of a system for quick 
determination and analysis of causes and projection of the 
effects of emergency situations in connection with accidental 
environmental pollution; creation of systems for emergency 
warnings concerning discharges into the environment and 
automated monitoring of emissions at enterprises with an 
elevated risk of creating pollution by toxic chemical and 
radioactive substances; 
  -- implementation of comprehensive development of issues 
pertaining to the creation of an observation network at sites 
where hazardous chemical and radioactive substances are buried, 
and an inventory and comprehensive study of the environment at 
places where they are stored or buried; 
  -- creation of a network of stationary and mobile equipment 
to monitor pollution sources, including through the use of 
long-range and quick-measurement methods; 
  -- creation and support for the effective operations of a 
system of state monitoring of the protection and efficient use 
of natural resources based on interaction between all monitoring 
and inspection services in that field; 
  -- creation of a system to monitor the radiological 
situation 
in areas subjected to radioactive contamination as a result of 
the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, as well as 
in areas where nuclear industry and nuclear test sites are 
located; 
  -- implementation of technical refitting of the network for 
observation and monitoring; development and organization of 
serial production of measuring devices and auxiliary equipment 
and materials; 
  -- oversight of development of the manufacture of modern 
monitoring and measurement equipment and provision of that 
equipment to the appropriate services of environmental 
protection agencies; 
  -- oversight of the development, review, and establishment 
of 
pollution standards and issuance of licenses permitting 
pollutant emissions and discharges or natural resource use; 
  -- development of a procedure for suspending or terminating 
production activities by enterprises (or other production 
facilities) for environmental reasons; 
  -- performance of an analysis of existing standards 
governing 
the quality of natural sites, for the purpose of assessing their 
ecological and physical-chemical justification and developing a 
republic system of standards as the first stage in a transition 
to the establishment of environmental standards. 
  By 1995, there are plans to set up a State Information 
System 
(GIS) to gather, store, systemize, and process Russia's 
environmental information, for the purpose of achieving the 
following goals: 
  -- creation and maintenance of a data base on the state of 
the environment; innovative environment-protecting and 
resource-conserving technological, technical, organizational, 
and economic solutions; 
  -- creation of regularly updated environmental maps of 
Russia 
and individual regions; 
  -- maintenance of cadastral maps of natural resources; 
  -- projection of ecological situations within the country's 
territory; 
  -- tracking of environmental ratings issued to enterprises 
and regions; 
  -- development and improvement of the system for exchange of 
scientific and technical information about environmental 
protection with appropriate international, republic, and 
industry information agencies; 
  -- provision of up-to-date, complete, and reliable 
information on the state of the environment to organs of state 
administration, scientific and public organizations, and the 
public; 
  -- creation of a system to monitor the quality of data at 
all 
stages of their receipt, processing, compilation, and 
publication, and provision of that system with all necessary 
means and materials. 
  Geographical information and cartographic support should be 
organized on two levels: regional (republic, kray, oblast, and 
so on) and federal. The territorial correlation of this 
information (through aerial photographs or cartographical data, 
statistical reports, and so on) at each of these two levels will 
be provided with the help of the appropriate regional 
information elements. This sort of spatial correlation of 
information for the GIS will make it possible to begin 
establishing the GIS at the federal and regional levels 
simultaneously. 
  At the regional level, efforts to organize information 
support will require above all the creation of GIS's in the key 
regions (republics, krays, and oblasts). In the early stages, 
these will be oriented toward use in the study of specific areas 
and influence on them by commercial operations, and later (as 
information accumulates in the GIS) toward development of a 
mechanism to manage natural resource use in the region and a 
mechanism for interaction between GIS's at the regional and 
federal levels. 
  It is essential to create a central automated information 
and 
measurement system to monitor the environment and industrial 
emissions in one of Russia's industrially developed regions with 
an acute environmental situation, with subsequent use of 
experience with setting up that central automated system to 
develop an automated monitoring network for all of Russia. 
  The key goals that will be sequentially achieved in the 
process of establishing the GIS in 1993-94 will be: 
  a) at the regional level: 
  -- development of a conceptual model of the natural and 
economic complex in a base region; 
  -- selection and adaptation of GIS software; 
  -- determination of the basic and supplementary arrays of 
information modules for the GIS; 
  -- development of a system of regional information elements 
(TEI) in the base region; 
  -- development of a structure for the data base and 
selection 
of instruments for its implementation; 
  -- determination of the content of overview and 
overview-thematic maps; 
  -- development of data base structures for the basic array 
of 
information modules; 
  -- creation of a digital map and a section thereof for the 
base region; 
  -- assembly of a data base on the natural resources of the 
base region; 
  -- compilation of a list of application programs in support 
of the administrative mechanism; 
  -- development of programs to assess the effectiveness of 
environmental protection efforts; 
  -- development of a general plan for natural resource use in 
the base region, specifically through creation of digital maps 
regulating natural resource use. 
  b) at the federal level: 
  -- development of a conceptual model of Russia's natural and 
economic complex; 
  -- selection and adaptation of GIS programming compatible 
with the regional-level GIS; 
  -- creation of a system of federal regional information 
elements based on pooling of regional information element (TEI) 
systems at the regional level; 
  -- determination of the composition of information modules 
within the federal GIS; 
  -- determination of the composition of overview and 
overview-thematic maps; 
  -- development of the logical structures of data bases for 
the basic array of information modules; 
  -- creation of a digital map, the basis of the federal GIS; 
  -- creation of a communications channel and development of 
information interaction between the federal GIS and the GIS in 
the base region (at the level of digital base maps). 
<H5>  Section 2. International Cooperation </H5>
  The Russian Federation cooperates with more than 20 
countries 
as the legal successor to the former USSR with regard to its 
bilateral intergovernmental agreements in the area of 
environmental protection. Within the framework of those 
agreements, much attention is focused on border issues (for 
example, through agreements with Norway, Finland, and Sweden). 
Within the framework of interaction among the CIS member states, 
these issues will be resolved both on the basis of a 
multilateral agreement of 8 February 1992 and in accordance with 
bilateral agreements at the governmental level. 
  Implementation of the Agreement on Interaction in the Area 
of 
Ecology and Environmental Protection of 8 February 1993 will 
require coordinated actions by the member states and appropriate 
reflection in the National Plan of those obligations on the part 
of the Russian Federation that stem from the Agreement, as 
follows: 
  -- harmonization of any environmental protection-related 
legislative acts, environmental norms, and standards adopted; 
  -- joint development and implementation of interstate 
programs and projects in the area of natural resource use, 
including programs for the safe destruction and neutralization 
of chemical and nuclear weapons and highly toxic and radioactive 
wastes; 
  -- application of common approaches, criteria, methods, and 
procedures to assess the quality and monitor the condition of 
the environment and anthropogenic effects thereupon, and 
assurance of the compatibility of data on the state of the 
environment at the interstate and international levels; 
  -- use of coordinated methodologies to assess the effects of 
economic and other activities on the environment; 
  -- unification of methods by which to set standards for 
anthropogenic effects on the environment; 
  -- application of coordinated methods to monitor genetic 
changes in communities of living organisms and to protect rare 
and endangered species, as well as their habitats; 
  -- creation and support of an interstate ecological 
information system; 
  -- development and implementation of a coordinated 
scientific 
and technical policy in the area of ecology and environmental 
protection; conducting of coordinated basic and applied 
environmental research; 
  -- development and application of general principles 
designed 
to stimulate environmental protection efforts and sanctions 
against violators of environmental protection legislation; 
  -- adherence to general methodological requirements when 
conducting environmental assessments of programs and projections 
for the development of production capacity and of investment 
projects and other projects; 
  -- maintenance of an interstate Red Book. 
  In order to implement the National Plan, including through 
attraction of essential foreign experience and assistance, it is 
proposed that adjustments and additions be made to bilateral 
cooperation programs. These would focus on fuller utilization of 
the agreements in question. 
  In this regard, an important role will be played by the 
effective use of technical and financial assistance from 
international organizations and foreign investment. In view of 
the acuteness of environmental problems in Russia, an 
overwhelming majority of investment projects should have a 
clearly expressed environmental orientation, help improve the 
state of the environment, and be required to undergo an 
environmental assessment procedure approved by international 
organizations. 
  The obligations of the Russian Federation with regard to 
multilateral conventions and agreements as reflected in the 
National Plan will require close integration with other 
countries, in particular the European countries. 
  Implementation of the UN Conference on the Environment and 
Development (1992) in the European region will require 
coordinated actions by countries in such areas as: 
  -- change in the structure of production and consumption; 
  -- comprehensive consideration for the aspects of the 
environment and development in the course of decisionmaking; 
  -- protection of the atmosphere; 
  -- assurance of a high quality of fresh water resources; 
  -- environmentally safe use of toxic chemicals and waste 
processing and disposal; 
  -- exchange of environmentally acceptable technologies; 
  -- assistance with sustainable development of agriculture 
and 
rural areas; 
  -- protection of forests; 
  -- protection of seas and coastal areas. 
  These problems will be decided with Russia's participation 
through the mechanisms of regional and global conventions and 
international organizations. 
  A special role in this connection is played by the process 
of 
general European conferences of environmental ministers. The 
results of the second conference, held in April 1993 and 
essentially a concretization of the Rio de Janeiro forum's 
decisions for Europe, bore out the well-founded nature of that 
approach, and the Conference's main documents -- the ``Program 
of Action for the Countries of Central and Eastern Europe'' and 
the ``Declaration of the Ministers'' -- laid the groundwork for 
resolving the most pressing environmental problems of countries 
with transition economies through the use of foreign partners on 
a multilateral and bilateral basis. 
  Russia proposed that the European program give consideration 
to specific sites and areas in Russia, ecological restoration of 
which will require foreign assistance. 
  The cooperation that is currently developing with 
international financial organizations (the World Bank, the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and so on) on 
environmental protection and natural resource use in Russia will 
be focused primarily on implementation of the most important and 
capital-intensive elements of the national plan of action. Also 
focused on this will be bilateral programs of technical 
assistance to Russia. There are also proposals to combine 
efforts aimed at improving the legislative and regulatory basis 
of environmental protection efforts, creating an adequate 
infrastructure, systems for monitoring the state of the 
environment, and an information system for the purpose of 
decisionmaking, with specific measures at the regional level. 
  In large part, those measures will be aimed at improving the 
environmental situation in regions most harmful to human health, 
reinforcing the physical base and infrastructure of specially 
protected natural areas, and ensuring more efficient use of 
natural resources, in particular oil and gas. 
  A draft program for interaction with the World Bank 
envisions, in part, a stronger technical base for environmental 
protection agencies in Russia; implementation of measures to 
optimize the environmental protection system; creation of an 
appropriate regulatory and infrastructure base for that purpose; 
conducting of research projects; and implementation of measures 
in specific cities and at specific sites to solve the problems 
of industrial and household wastes, water quality (particularly 
drinking water), to reduce the level of pollutant emissions 
(including greenhouse gases) and to stop the production and use 
of substances that destroy the ozone layer; use of by-product 
gases (in the process of oil production and refining); to 
develop and appropriately equip a network of specially protected 
natural areas, and so on. 
  Detailed development and implementation of environmental 
cooperation programs will be carried out by a specially 
established center jointly directed by the World Bank and a 
council comprising the heads of the Russian Federation Ministry 
of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Fuel and Energy, the Russian Agency for 
International Cooperation and Development, and other ministries 
and agencies that will be participating in the projects. 
  In connection with Russia's signing of the framework 
Convention on Climate Change and the Biodiversity Convention and 
the need for their ratification or adoption, it will be 
necessary to take the following steps at the first stage. 
<H6>  2.1. The Convention on Climate Change: </H6>
  -- preparation of national cadastral maps of anthropogenic 
emissions from sources and absorption by absorbents of all 
greenhouse gases not regulated by the Montreal Protocol 
regarding substances that destroy the ozone layer. When such 
work is done the compatible methodologies approved by the 
parties to the Convention (in Article 4. 1a and 12a) must be 
used; 
  -- development of a national program of measures to lessen 
the effects of climate change through a comprehensive approach 
to the problems of anthropogenic emissions from sources and 
absorption of greenhouse gases by absorbents, as well as 
measures to promote adequate adaptation by sectors of the 
economy and the social realm to climate change (Article 4.15); 
  -- development of comprehensive plans in regard to 
commercial 
activity in coastal zones, water resources, agriculture, and the 
protection and restoration of regions affected by droughts, 
desertification, and floods (Article 4. 1e); 
  -- participation in the timely exchange of appropriate 
scientific, technological, technical, social, economic, and 
legal information in connection with climate and changes 
therein, as well as the economic and social effects of various 
reaction strategies (Article 4. 1h); 
  -- development of a national program of education, training, 
and public information on matters pertaining to climate change 
(Article 4. 1i and 12); 
  -- preparation of a national report on the implementation of 
Russia's obligations under the Convention (Article 4. 1j). 
  In connection with this, it is essential to carry out the 
following scientific research: 
  1. Development of a model cadastral map of greenhouse gas 
emissions (scheduled completion: 1993-94). 
  2. Development of a model cadastral map of greenhouse gas 
absorbents (scheduled completion: 1993-94). 
  3. Research on the possibility of applying the methodology 
for assessment of greenhouse gas concentrations proposed by the 
International Group of Climate Change Experts to the territory 
of the Russian Federation (scheduled completion: 1993-94). 
  4. Development of a draft national plan of research on 
climate change and its effects (scheduled completion: 1993-94). 
  5. Development of a draft program for rapid exchange of 
information pertaining to climate change (scheduled completion: 
1993-94). 
  6. Development of a draft national program to inform the 
public and train personnel in the field of climate change 
(scheduled completion: 1993-94). 
  7. Preparation of a draft national report on compliance with 
the Russian Federation's obligations under the Convention 
(scheduled completion: 1993-95). 
<H6>  2.2. The Biological Diversity Convention: </H6>
  -- development of a national strategy, plan, or program for 
the preservation and sustainable use of biological diversity; 
  -- definition of the components of biological diversity that 
are of significance for the preservation and sustainable use 
thereof, and creation of a monitoring system; 
  -- creation of a system of protected regions and regions in 
which it is essential to take special measures to preserve 
biological diversity; 
  -- development and approval of essential legislative 
standards for the preservation of threatened species and 
populations; 
  -- development and implementation of a program of scientific 
and technical study and personnel training for the purpose of 
implementing measures to define, preserve, and make sustainable 
use of biological diversity and the components thereof; 
  -- development and introduction of appropriate procedures 
for 
the conducting of environmental assessment of proposed projects 
that could have a significant negative impact on biological 
diversity; 
  -- development of national legislation regulating access to 
genetic resources and technologies and the transfer thereof. 
  The universal nature of the National Plan presumes the broad 
use for its implementation of all available mechanisms of 
interaction with other countries, including within the framework 
of international organizations, in particular the UN 
Environmental Program (UNEP), the European Economic Commission 
of the UN, the World Meteorological Organization, the World 
Health Organization (WHO), UNESCO, the UN Industrial Development 
Organization (UNIDO) and the UN Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO), as well as multilateral and bilateral 
international conventions and agreements. Of exceptionally great 
importance in this connection will be interaction with 
international financial organizations, through which technical, 
organizational, and financial assistance with the implementation 
of key elements in the Program will be provided. Also focused on 
these same goals will be efforts to ensure efficient use of 
foreign bilateral assistance (in addition to traditional 
bilateral cooperation in the field of environmental protection 
within the framework of appropriate agreements). 
  In addition, projects under programs of the national plan 
will also be partially financed with funding from a special 
foreign currency fund that is slated to be established by the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Environmental Protection and 
Natural Resources. It is planned that money will be paid into 
this fund by the World Bank, the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, 
and investors on the basis of various bilateral contracts. This 
fund, which will not be legally connected with the existing 
Federal Environmental Fund, will complement that fund. The 
executive mechanisms of the two funds should be combined. 
<H3>  Section 3. Ensuring Environmental Safety in Economic 
Development </H3>
  Questions of environmental safety and the measures 
implemented to achieve it should be considered an aspect of 
establishing permissible anthropogenic burdens on the 
environment and in particular on individual ecosystems, 
exceeding which could result or has already resulted in such 
irreversible changes in natural conditions that existing forms 
of adaptation by human beings, animals, plants, and 
microorganisms to the environment are not capable of ensuring 
their normal development and existence, and also as an aspect of 
preventive measures of protection against natural and manmade 
disasters. 
  The following are among the priority areas for investment: 
  -- direct capital investment aimed at protecting health. In 
regions with heavily polluted air, investment priority should be 
given to measures undertaken for the purpose of improving 
systems to control the dust level in air adjacent to enterprises 
in the nonferrous metals industry and steel smelting facilities, 
as well as measures to replace coal with gas as a source of 
energy at rayon heat and electric power stations and in homes. 
As for protection of water resources, there priority should be 
given to the initial treatment of industrial waste water 
containing a high level of heavy metals and toxic chemicals, 
which present a serious threat to groundwater and surface water, 
as well as to reduction in the excessive nitrate levels in 
drinking water sources located in rural areas; 
  -- capital investment earmarked for construction of areas 
for 
the processing, utilization, and environmentally safe storage 
(or disposal) of wastes and for production of environmentally 
safe chemical fertilizers and other agricultural chemicals; 
  -- capital investment designed to prevent and eliminate 
processes of land degradation and soil disruption and 
destruction, and to restore polluted land; 
  -- measures that provide for treatment of waste water in 
order to protect the ecology of coastal and tourist regions; 
completion of water treatment facility construction, 
particularly in areas where this could significantly improve 
water quality; implementation of programs that could prevent 
irreversible damage that might otherwise be done to the 
environment and to highly important ecosystems; 
  -- support for expansion and acceleration of capital 
investment carried out by industrial enterprises in accordance 
with implementation of the new economic policy, including 
measures such as reduction in the amount of salinated water 
discharged by mines, treatment of waste water from cellulose 
combines, textile mills, and chemical plants, and measures 
undertaken to reduce discharges of toxic substances by 
enterprises in the chemical and petrochemical industries; 
  -- measures not requiring large expenditures and designed to 
implement long-range environmental programs, especially in cases 
in which a program can be implemented quickly and with great 
savings. These include an end to the use of gasoline containing 
high lead levels, reduction in the amount of exhaust gases 
produced by automobile engines, financing of applied research in 
the field of ecosystem protection, and development of a system 
to collect, process, and distribute data and information 
pertaining to the environment. 
  Often there is much that can be achieved simply through 
``good housekeeping,'' that is, through careful repairs, efforts 
to prevent leaks, installation of more advanced monitoring 
equipment, and a reorientation toward stricter standards in the 
management of production and technologies. All these are 
economically advantageous ``no-lose'' measures, which will 
improve the economic results of enterprises' operations and 
decrease the amount of environmental damage they do. These sorts 
of small-scale actions will lay the groundwork for improvement 
in the state of the environment in connection with 
transformation of economic policy. These measures are very 
important, because large-scale introduction of anti-pollution 
technologies in various industries cannot be carried out until 
new markets are created for various types of products and the 
economic viability of specific enterprises is assured. 
  One important stage in defining scientifically based 
priorities in natural resource use and ways of implementing them 
is development of a comprehensive state scientific and technical 
program to be entitled ``Environmental Safety in Russia.'' 
  The top priority in efforts to achieve environmental safety 
is adoption of urgent measures to lower the level of effects on 
the environment and on human beings by ``hot spots'' in Russia 
to a safe level by the year 2005. 
  Toward that end, it is essential: 
  -- to develop criteria by which to assess the degree of 
environmental danger in such areas; 
  -- to conduct exploration and mapping of those areas with 
the 
aid of the criteria thus developed; 
  -- to develop and implement a plan of measures to gradually 
reduce environmental danger in such areas; 
  -- to create a system to monitor the condition of the 
aforementioned areas and the health of the people living in them; 
  -- to develop and introduce a system to warn employees of 
enterprises and the public in the event of particularly 
dangerous occurrences. 
  The next focus of efforts to ensure environmental security 
is 
elimination of accidents, manmade disasters, emergency 
meteorological situations, natural disasters, and the effects 
thereof. This will require: 
  -- ranking of production facilities, technologies, and types 
of operations in order to reduce technological and environmental 
danger on the basis of risk theory; 
  -- development and introduction of automated systems to 
monitor the most dangerous types of operations, production 
facilities, and installations. 
<H6>  3.1. Prevention and Elimination of the Effects of Accidents, 
Disasters, and Other Emergency Situations </H6>
  In order to lessen the likelihood of environmentally 
hazardous situations occurring, to reduce the scale of their 
effects, and to ensure human safety, it is essential that the 
following measures be implemented. 
  Criteria must be established in zones and at sites with an 
elevated level of environmental hazard identified in 1993-94. 
Facilities in the economy that are hazardous to the environment 
and human beings in the course of normal operations and in the 
event of accidental emissions (or discharges) of radioactive or 
chemical substances used, manufactured, or stored at those 
facilities must be inventoried and ranked. On the basis of this 
inventory, the following must be developed and implemented for 
enterprises and organizations, with consideration for input from 
local soviets of people's deputies: 
  -- a system of measures to maximally reduce the risk of 
environmentally hazardous situations emerging during the 
construction and use of chemical and petrochemical facilities 
and nuclear power facilities, on the continental shelf during 
the production of oil and gas, at mine tailing storage sites, at 
high dams, and at anti-mudslide and avalanche-protection 
installations, particularly in seismically active regions where 
fuel, radioactive substances, and toxic substances are stored; 
  -- programs to bring about the technical refitting, 
redesignation, or removal of worn-out and environmentally 
hazardous production facilities and enterprises, as well as 
planned resettlement of persons living within the boundaries of 
sanitary protection zones and zones surrounding enterprises in 
the chemical, petrochemical, microbiological, gas production and 
refining, metallurgical, coke, and chemical fertilizer 
industries and other environmentally hazardous enterprises and 
production facilities. 
  Means of early detection and emergency shutdown of equipment 
and shutdown of technological processes, as well as automated 
means of assessing the reliability of and danger of fire or 
explosion created by equipment, should be developed and put in 
place at commercial facilities. 
  Model regional plans for recovery from the effects of 
probable environmentally hazardous situations must be developed. 
  A national center for immediate environmental assistance 
should be established, and there should be participation in the 
establishment of similar international systems. 
  Additions must be made to building standards and regulations 
which regulate the siting of potentially hazardous facilities in 
Russia, as well as those that establish the requirement to 
include emergency planning and environmental assessment in 
planning documentation. 
<H6>  3.2. Ensuring Radiation Safety </H6>
  In order to ensure the safety of the public and the 
environment from radiation, it is essential: 
  -- to improve the existing system of radiation monitoring 
within Russian territory through establishment of Unified State 
Automated Radiation Level Monitoring; 
  -- to implement comprehensive monitoring of the radiation 
levels within Russian territory; 
  -- to develop and introduce standards in regard to 
protection 
of the public and the environment from radiation; 
  -- to develop and implement programs to normalize the 
radiation situation and to rehabilitate radiation-contaminated 
areas of Russia; 
  -- to present annual reports to the Government of the 
Russian 
Federation regarding the state of and additional measures to 
ensure the public's radiation safety; 
  -- to ensure close cooperation between Russia's ministries 
and agencies in regard to the introduction of unified 
requirements governing public radiation safety; 
  -- to conduct an analysis and assessment of scenarios for 
possible accidents at all existing enterprises and facilities in 
the nuclear power cycle within Russian territory;

public in the event of emergency radiation situations (accidents 
and disasters); 
  -- to develop and introduce a series of scientific and 
technical measures to reduce the effects of radon and similar 
substances on public health; 
  -- to carry out a detailed survey of all cities with a 
population greater than 100,000 by 1995 and of all cities with a 
population greater than 50,000 by 2000 for the purpose of 
locating unidentified sources of ionizing radiation, with 
subsequent cleanup of those sources, as well as 
gamma-spectroscope surveys of areas where nuclear detonations 
have occurred; 
  -- to conduct a study of areas where nuclear substances have 
been disposed of within the republic's territory, particularly 
at industrial enterprises in the nuclear power cycle and in 
bodies of water; 
  -- to objectively inform the public regarding the state of 
the environmental radiation level in the Russian Federation; 
  -- to arrange training and advanced training for specialists 
in the fields of radiation safety and environmental radiation 
safety. 
<H6>  3.3. Prevention of Environmental Pollution by Production and 
Consumption Wastes </H6>
  In order to prevent pollution of the environment by 
dangerous 
wastes resulting from production and consumption, it is 
essential that the following goals be achieved: 
  -- development in 1993 of a state Waste Program, to include 
research and development work to create new technologies and 
equipment for the processing of wastes and the production of 
such equipment; 
  -- accelerated drafting of a law ``On Production and 
Consumption Wastes''; 
  -- an inventory of all ministry-operated areas within 
Russian 
territory where wastes are stored (sludge and mine tailings 
storage, settling ponds, accumulators, spoils, and so on), as 
well as unauthorized dumps for the disposal of 
production-related and solid household waste; 
  -- on the basis of the data from the inventory and ranking 
of 
the industrial wastes created by enterprises, creation of a 
republic data bank on those wastes and technologies by which to 
process them; 
  -- creation of a stock-based exchange to engage in free 
trading in information and scientific and technical advances in 
the fields of production-related and consumption-related waste 
collection, transportation, utilization, and disposal; 
  -- incentives for destatization of enterprises that collect 
and process waste; 
  -- establishment of small businesses and joint ventures to 
recover usable materials and manufacture products out of them; 
  -- implementation of accelerated development of capacities 
to 
collect and utilize various types of secondary resources, plus 
introduction of progressive technologies for their processing; 
  -- development and introduction of technologies to 
neutralize 
and process toxic industrial wastes; 
  -- development of a plan for the siting of toxic industrial 
waste and solid household waste storage facilities in Russia 
based on regional planning documents and projects; 
  -- construction of specialized facilities for the 
neutralization and environmentally safe disposal (or storage) of 
toxic industrial wastes for which there are currently no 
environmentally or economically acceptable means of processing; 
  -- guarantees of environmental safety in the operations of 
facilities that destroy chemical weapons, including the storage 
of such weapons at their point of origin, transportation to 
destruction sites, destruction (or neutralization) of the 
weapons, destruction (or utilization) of the products of 
neutralization, and disposal of nontoxic waste; 
  -- monitoring of the collection, processing, and 
transportation of used daylight lamps that contain mercury and 
other heavy metals; 
  -- introduction of enterprises (or installations) to 
neutralize pesticides that have been banned or are not suitable 
for use; 
  -- introduction of a method of combined processing of solid 
household waste with preliminary separation of valuable 
components, composting of organic wastes, and utilization of the 
noncomposted residue for pyrolysis; 
  -- development of an industrial-scale technology to obtain 
biogases at storage sites (or dumps) and make comprehensive use 
of such gases, with a primary goal of creating appropriate 
facilities for cities with a population of more than 100,000; 
  -- development of garbage processing plants with a capacity 
of 23-25 percent of all solid household waste by the year 2005. 
<H6>  3.4. Conversion and Ecology </H6>
  A solution to the problem of environmental safety and 
achievement of goals that will improve the environmental 
situation in the Russian Federation will be more difficult 
without the use of the defense complex's production capacity and 
scientific and engineering potential. Therefore, a number of 
state programs for conversion of the defense complex include a 
separate Conversion and Ecology program. 
  Those programs' goals are: 
  -- to improve the environmental situation in regions with a 
critical anthropogenic burden; 
  -- to bring about restructuring of the various sectors of 
the 
military-industrial complex in order to solve environmental 
problems; 
  -- to steadily expand civilian production capacity of 
environmentally oriented products; 
  -- to create an economic mechanism for achieving the 
environmental goals of conversion; 
  -- attraction of funding for environmentally oriented 
conversion measures; 
  -- inclusion of the environmental conversion agenda in the 
structure of radical economic reform in the Russian Federation. 
  In order to accomplish these tasks, the Conversion and 
Ecology program makes provision for: 
  -- establishment and accelerated development of a market in 
environmental jobs and services; 
  -- inclusion of a mechanism of state economic regulation and 
incentives for conversion-related environmental measures; 
  -- legal and economic standards in support of the mechanism 
by which the environmental aspect of conversion functions; 
  -- structural and informational support for the program and 
coordination of efforts. 
  The first stage in the Conversion and Ecology program, 
scheduled for 1993, will create a scientific and technical 
foundation upon which to develop and prepare for serial 
production, beginning in 1994, new types of environmental 
protection equipment, technologies, materials, and monitoring 
devices, as well as to establish production relations and 
cooperation on the manufacture of environmentally oriented 
products in place of ties disrupted or neglected following the 
disintegration of the USSR. 
  The program includes goals in the following main areas: 
  -- development and creation (introduction) of new 
technologies and equipment to treat gaseous emissions and waste 
water and to process, neutralize, and recycle solid waste (Area 
1); 
  -- development and creation (introduction) of measuring and 
information systems to provide background monitoring of the 
state of the environment and monitor pollution sources (Area 2); 
  -- development (introduction) of methods and means of 
restoring natural areas disrupted by economic and military 
activities (Area 3); 
  -- development and creation (introduction) of new, 
environmentally clean resource- and energy-conserving 
technologies and types of manufacture (Area 4); 
  -- establishment of a physical and technical base for a 
maritime environmental monitoring system to monitor Russia's 
economic zone and territorial waters (Area 5); 
  -- establishment of a legal and economic mechanism to 
regulate and stimulate federal systems of environmentally safe 
and sustainable development in the process of defense industry 
conversion (Area 6); 
  -- restructuring of the economic complex in regions with a 
critical environmental situation as part of the process of 
defense industry conversion in the Russian Federation (Area 7). 
<H6>  3.5. Environmental Support for the Armed Forces </H6>
  The goal of environmental support for the Russian Armed 
Forces is to achieve environmental safety in the operations of 
the Russian Federation Armed Forces and to protect personnel, 
weapons, and military equipment under conditions of 
environmentally adverse anthropogenic and natural factors. 
  The principal focuses and goals of the Russian Armed Forces 
in the area of environmental protection are: 
  -- environmental support for the day-to-day operations of 
troops and naval forces; 
  -- environmental support for the operations of the Russian 
Armed Forces in conditions in which they are affected by 
environmentally adverse anthropogenic and natural factors; 
  -- environmental monitoring of the Russian Armed Forces 
within the system of state environmental monitoring; 
  -- restoration of the environment in the process of the 
Armed 
Forces' day-to-day operations following maneuvers, special work, 
accidents, and disasters at military facilities; 
  -- military-scientific support for the principal areas of 
Russian Armed Forces environmental safety; 
  -- participation in environmental support in all the stages 
of the life cycle of weapons and military equipment and the 
planning, construction, and use of Russian Armed Forces 
facilities, in conversion of defense manufacturing facilities, 
and in all the stages of utilization and destruction of nuclear, 
chemical, and conventional weapons and military equipment; 
  -- interaction with state and ministerial environmental 
protection organs and international cooperation on environmental 
support for military operations; 
  -- training of military ecologists. 
  Priority tasks with regard to Russian Armed Forces 
environmental support are: 
  -- participation in the utilization of nuclear power 
facilities and nuclear warheads and in the storage and 
utilization of radioactive waste; 
  -- participation in the removal of metal fragments and 
rocket 
fuel from areas where pieces of booster rockets land; 
  -- utilization of outdated or damaged military equipment and 
weapons, including nuclear submarines, long-range missiles, and 
chemical weapons; 
  -- qualitative improvement in the condition of bases and 
depots for fuel, lubricants, and rocket fuel components 
(reservoirs, pumping stations, and fuel pipelines); 
  -- assessment of the environmental damage caused by troops 
in 
their countries of deployment; 
  -- construction of new and reconstruction or expansion of 
existing treatment facilities; 
  -- conducting of environmental ranking of military 
facilities 
and establishment of an environmental monitoring system; 
  -- implementation of comprehensive and ongoing environmental 
training and education for military personnel, Army and Navy 
employees, and members of their families; 
  -- establishment and proper outfitting of environmental 
units, which will be assigned to restore disrupted environments. 
<H6>  3.6. Environmental Aspects of the Development of the Fuel 
and Energy Complex </H6>
  The priority of environmental efforts in the strategy to 
develop the fuel and energy complex results from that complex's 
very intensive negative effects on the environment. For example, 
enterprises in the fuel and energy complex account for 50 
percent of all emissions into the atmosphere, up to 35 percent 
of all waste water discharges into natural bodies of water, and 
approximately 30 percent of all solid waste, which occupies 
significant areas of productive land and constitutes a source of 
secondary pollution. 
  The main principle guiding the assurance of environmental 
safety in the fuel and energy complex is a comprehensive 
approach to efficient use and conservation of fuel and energy 
resources at all stages of their production and processing on 
the basis of progressive and environmentally clean technologies, 
including the functioning of unified energy technology 
installations. 
  A significant role in reduction of environmental pollution 
can be played by optimization of the fuel and energy balance as 
it relates to the structure and siting of other production 
facilities that release harmful substances, as well as by an 
increase in the percentage of centralized heat supply to 
industrial and nonindustrial facilities. 
  There are plans for a transition from traditional methods of 
fuel combustion to the use of new furnaces, and to the 
development and introduction of steam-gas and gas-turbine 
installations employing intracycle coal gasification. 
  It is essential that incentives be provided for the 
development and introduction into use of nontraditional, 
environmentally clean methods of producing energy (using solar, 
thermal, wind, and biomass power), as well as low-potential 
energy sources. 
  There will be marked progress toward improvement of the 
system for the collection, transportation, and refining of 
by-product gaseous products, as well in the detection, location, 
and elimination of oil leaks and spills in production and 
refining regions, particularly under the environmentally 
sensitive conditions that exist in the North. 
  In view of the objective orientation toward primary use of 
coal to produce energy, environmentally clean technologies for 
coal mining, transportation, upgrading, and processing are 
becoming more widely used, with mandatory utilization of waste 
products, recultivation of disrupted land, and ecosystem 
restoration. 
  Research and development work will continue on the 
development and manufacture of high-efficiency methods and 
equipment to purify exhaust gases and utilize the products thus 
trapped, particularly sulfur compounds, nitrogen oxides, and 
hydrocarbons, as well as on equipment to treat waste water, 
including recirculating systems and systems to process and 
utilize sludge. 
<H5>  Section 4. Environmental Training and Education </H5>
  The principal goals of environmental training and education 
are to develop an environmental culture in individuals and 
throughout society and environmental awareness and thinking and 
a responsible attitude toward nature on the part of each person, 
and to foster practical experience with natural resource use and 
competent decisionmaking. 
  The main principles of environmental training and education 
are: 
  -- universality and continuity; 
  -- vertical and horizontal integration of formal and 
informal 
training and educational structures; 
  -- flexibility, variability, a problem-oriented approach, 
and 
continuity in study and training; 
  -- unity of general, vocational, and ecological training and 
education; 
  -- consideration for practical needs; 
  -- consideration for ethnic interests and for cultural and 
regional characteristics; 
  -- humanization and an orientation toward development of a 
socially active individual and environmental awareness, 
thinking, and culture. 
  On the basis of these fundamental goals and principles of 
environmental training and education, and on the basis of the 
Russian Federation law ``On Environmental Protection,'' the 
overall goal of the strategy for development of environmental 
training and education is to create a system of universal 
comprehensive and continuing environmental training and 
education that will encompass the entire process of preschool 
and school training and education, vocational training for 
specialists at secondary and higher educational institutions, 
and advanced training for such specialists with the aid of the 
mass media. 
  The structure of this system of universal comprehensive and 
continuing environmental training and education (subsequently to 
be referred to as the system of continuing environmental 
training and education [SNEVO]) may be represented by the 
following basic and interconnected branches: 
  -- preschool environmental training in the family and in 
specialized training institutions, both state and private; 
  -- environmental education for workers (training of workers 
at vocational and technical schools and on the job); 
  -- environmental education for middle-level specialists 
(training at technical secondary schools, at higher vocational 
schools, and at pedagogical schools); 
  -- environmental education at higher schools: special 
environmental education, introduction of environmental training 
for specialists in all fields and areas of specialization, and 
environmental training for academic and scientific personnel; 
  -- environmental education for specialists and 
administrators 
with higher and secondary specialized education (special 
courses, advanced training courses, advanced training 
institutes, and academic centers); 
  -- on-the-job environmental education for blue-collar 
workers, office workers, engineering and technical personnel, 
and administrative personnel at enterprises and in the social 
realm; 
  -- informal environmental training and education, and 
self-education for children and adults. 
  The principal measures by which to implement this strategy 
are: 
  a) Creation a state/private system to administer SNEVO. This 
will require: 
  -- identification of existing state and private 
organizations 
that have experience with cooperation in the field of 
environmental training and education, development of functional 
and structural diagrams, and establishment of state/private 
administration for SNEVO on a basis of legal standards; 
  -- creation of interdepartmental coordinating and 
methodological councils at all levels and a higher state 
certification commission to issue certificates and licenses in 
the field of environmental training and education; 
  -- establishment of a Russian (International) Center for 
Environmental Training and Education and a network of regional 
centers (an environmental education space). 
  b) Establishment of a foundation of legal standards. This 
will require: 
  -- development of sublegal acts, normative acts, standards, 
and the other normative legal documents that are essential for 
the establishment, functioning, and development of SNEVO. 
  c) Preparation of the scientific and methodological base. 
This will require: 
  -- analysis and selection on the basis of quality of 
scientific plans for methodological complexes (qualifications 
descriptions, standards, curricula and programs, methodological 
guidelines, computer programs, and so on), textbooks, and mass 
media materials; 
  -- development and publication of textbooks and start-up of 
audiovisual program production; 
  -- development and creation of programs for mass media 
communications. 
  d) Development of a system of personnel support for all 
levels and types of environmental training and education. This 
will require: 
  -- development of qualifications descriptions, standards, 
content, and methodologies for the training of SNEVO 
instructional personnel at universities, higher pedagogical 
institutions, schools, and colleges; 
  -- organization of training for personnel studying SNEVO 
planning and administration. 
  e) Creation of a state/private system to provide the 
reliable 
and timely environmental information essential to and adequate 
for high-quality environmental training and education of the 
entire population. This will require: 
  -- establishment of the informational data bases essential 
to 
the functioning of SNEVO; 
  -- organization of universal community environmental 
training 
and children's programs utilizing various means of 
communications; 
  -- creation of a system to provide environmentally 
significant information to state and private SNEVO organizations 
and the public; 
  -- establishment of a universal interregional information 
and 
reference system linked with the international information 
network. 
  f) Orientation of the content of environmental training and 
education toward individual development and solutions to the 
problems of society's sustainable socioeconomic development and 
environmental safety. This will require: 
  -- provision of reliable information in the field of 
environmental protection and efficient natural resource use, 
socioeconomic development, and environmental and 
socio-environmental situations at the regional, republic, 
national, and world levels to educators, teachers, and 
instructors; 
  -- provision of information regarding the fundamental 
principles of normative legal documents in the field of 
environmental protection and efficient natural resource use to 
all participants in SNEVO; 
  -- analysis of the content of environmental training and 
education from the standpoint of the need for its updating or 
creation, or for developments that will take into consideration 
the requirements for its reorientation, with participation by 
scientists and experts in the appropriate fields of knowledge 
and activity; 
  -- retraining of educators for the system of formal and 
informal education in a field of new or updated content, and 
introduction of that field into curricula, programs, and the 
educational process. 
  International cooperation in the field of environmental 
training and education is an important means of implementing 
SNEVO. 
  The primary goal of this is to utilize international 
experience and include Russia in the world process of ecological 
training and education. From the standpoint of achieving the 
goal of international cooperation, the following measures have 
priority: 
  -- creation of a national service for the collection, 
processing, and dissemination of environmental information, and 
its inclusion in the international system; 
  -- realization of joint research and projects to design 
technologies and means of studying psychological and pedagogical 
support for the education process; 
  -- participation in projects within the framework of 
international educational programs in the field of ecology and 
environmental protection, UNESCO, and UNEP; 
  -- widespread and systematic dissemination of results 
obtained by the international community and their adaptation to 
the conditions of environmental training and education in Russia; 
  -- development and realization of joint projects in the 
field 
of training and advanced training for ecologists and scientific 
and pedagogical personnel; 
  -- creation of an international methodology coordination 
center for environmental training and education; 
  -- exchange of schoolchildren, students, and specialists in 
the field of environmental training and education. 
  Creation of a well-developed SNEVO will be a lengthy and 
gradual process of improving existing and developing lacking 
elements and branches in the structure of environmental training 
and education and integrating them into the system of general 
and vocational education. 
<H3>  Section 5. Priority Measures and Focuses of Environmental 
Restoration </H3>
  In accordance with the Russian Federation law ``On 
Environmental Protection'' (Section 1, p 4), the following must 
be protected against pollution, spoilage, damages, exhaustion, 
and destruction: 
  -- natural ecological systems and the ozone layer; 
  -- land, mineral resources, surface water and groundwater, 
the atmosphere, forests and other vegetation, animals, 
microorganisms, the genetic stock, and natural landscapes; 
  -- state nature preserves, nature reserves, national nature 
parks, natural monuments, rare or endangered plant and animal 
species, and their habitats. 
  On the basis of the above, priority issues that require the 
development of programs at the federal level have been defined. 
<H6>  5.1. Focuses of Environmental Protection and Efficient 
Natural Resource Use </H6>
  Basic measures to improve the environmental situation in 
Russia as applicable to various environments and resources are 
as follows. 
<H6>  5.1.1. Water Resources </H6>
  Water resources are polluted virtually everywhere in Russia. 
  The level of pollution of surface water varies widely. 
Levels 
in excess of the MPC [maximum permissible concentration] for 
petroleum products, organic substances, ammonium and nitrite 
nitrogen, zinc, and other pollutants are found in 20-40 percent 
of all samples analyzed. 
  Discharge of waste water by enterprises and municipal 
facilities has resulted in the degradation of many aquatic 
ecosystems. Agriculture has a considerable effect on the quality 
of surface water through farming, particularly irrigated 
farming, pasturage, livestock farms, and other facilities that 
represent a major source of organic substances and pesticides in 
natural water. The adverse effects of economic activity are 
reflected most markedly in the state of small rivers, many of 
which have been turned into waste-water canals and are clogged 
with reeds, are silted up, and have courses that have to a 
considerable extent lost their carrying capacity and drainage 
ability. 
  In order to protect and make efficient use of Russia's water 
resources, it will be necessary in 1993 to draft an 
environmental program entitled ``Efficient Use of Water 
Resources and Restoration of Water Quality,'' to include: 
  -- development of a methodology for determining and 
standards 
governing environmentally permissible diversion of water 
resources from river watersheds; 
  -- revision of the methodology for calculating maximum 
permissible content standards, with the goal of calculating the 
pollutant burden on bodies of water by including fallout from 
the atmosphere and watershed runoff (i.e., drainage from drained 
land, unchanneled and untreated waste water from cities and 
industrial sites, and agricultural runoff); 
  -- with consideration for the aforementioned standards, 
development and approval of comprehensive plans for the use and 
protection of water resources in the principal watersheds of 
rivers, and in particular for regions with an acute 
environmental situation; 
  -- development of the status of specially protected river 
watersheds and a corresponding Russian law; 
  -- completion of the development of plans for water 
protection zones (strips) along rivers, demarcation of 
boundaries of shoreline strips, and establishment of regulations 
governing natural resource use in these, particularly in river 
watersheds in the Central, Central Chernozem, Volga, and 
Northern Caucasus economic regions; 
  -- implementation of a series of measures to reduce 
pollution 
of bodies of water and halt most discharges of untreated waste 
water into bodies of water by 1996; 
  -- development and implementation of measures designed to 
completely halt log drives; 
  -- use of the introduction of water-conserving technologies 
to stabilize and then reduce the amount of fresh water diverted 
for industrial needs; 
  -- reduction in the discharge of heavy metal salts, toxic 
compounds, and biogenic substances into marine basins to levels 
that will ensure stabilization of marine ecosystems; 
  -- development of technology and efficient equipment to 
clean 
up oil spills in marine basins and shelf deposits of heavy 
fractions of oil pollutants; 
  -- continuation of work on engineering and technical support 
for the environmental safety of marine transportation, and 
development by 1994 of methods and technical means of conducting 
loading and unloading operations with chemical cargo that is 
carried in bulk solid or liquid form, which will prevent the 
release of pollutants into the environment. By 1995, all 
granular chemical cargo must be transported in packages or in 
especially designed railway cars. Efforts to improve the designs 
of tanker and dry-cargo ships must be speeded up, including 
through their outfitting with environmental protection equipment; 
  -- development of environmentally safe methods and technical 
means of exploring and processing sea floor resources, utilizing 
foreign experience; 
  -- completion of a geological survey of the continental 
shelf, including geo-ecological mapping, first near major urban, 
industrial, recreational, and defense agglomerations, and also 
within the bounds of the most dangerously seismically active 
maritime zones along the coastline of the Caucasus, the Crimea, 
Kamchatka, and Sakhalin; 
  -- development of a methodology for short-term and long-term 
prediction of destructive earthquakes in seismically active 
maritime zones in the Pacific and Alpine-Mediterranean seismic 
belts; 
  -- substantial improvement in public water supplies and 
improvement of drinking water quality to public health standards 
by 1995, toward which end it will be necessary: 
  -- to ensure the use of underground water, as a rule, as 
sources of drinking water and water for household use; 
  -- to reduce the use of drinking water for technical 
purposes 
by a factor of 1.5; 
  -- to develop new combined methods of decontaminating 
drinking water and its conditioning, including desalination, 
iron removal, fluoride removal, and so on; 
  -- to do research on and start up production of absorbents 
to 
remove radionuclides from drinking water; 
  -- to oversee the manufacture of portable installations for 
collective and individual use to treat and disinfect drinking 
water in rural areas and under field conditions; 
  -- to establish enterprises to manufacture water measurement 
equipment to meet water users' demand for means of monitoring 
the amount of water they divert and discharge; 
  -- to create capacities capable of supplying the public with 
bottled drinking water; 
  -- to expand efforts to build and renovate water supply and 
sewage systems, as well as facilities for thorough treatment of 
waste water in the republic's cities and other population 
centers; 
  -- to develop means and ways of utilizing the residue that 
accumulates at water supply and sewage facilities; 
  -- to develop programs to increase Russia's production of 
the 
basic chemical reagents for drinking water production (aluminum 
sulfate, liquid chlorine in containers and tanks, and 
polyacrylamide); 
  -- to reassess construction standards and regulations in the 
field of sewage system planning, making provision therein for a 
ban on acceptance of substances by community sewage systems that 
cannot be removed by biological treatment facilities; 
  -- to establish a specialized industrial base to produce 
modern and high-efficiency water filtration equipment for 
complete installations, pumps, turbines, measurement and 
automation devices, membranes, reagents, and so on; 
  -- to create automated monitoring and control systems to 
maintain water quality in centralized systems for commercial and 
drinking water supply; 
  -- to make provision for urgent measures to develop the 
centralized water supply in rural population centers. 
<H6>  5.1.2. The Atmosphere </H6>
  Despite the substantial drop in manufacturing output (by 
25-30 percent) that has occurred in virtually every sector of 
the economy, pollutant emissions into the atmosphere from point 
sources in 1991 decreased by less than 9 percent in comparison 
to the previous year, and totalled approximately 32 million 
tonnes. 
  There has been a steady increase in concentrations of 
nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide. A high level of pollution 
often results from low-level and unorganized sources of 
emissions of specific (to various sectors) pollutants. The air 
continues to be polluted by hydrogen fluoride (in the vicinity 
of aluminum plants), carbon disulfide (in the vicinity of 
enterprises manufacturing synthetic fibers), and other harmful 
substances. 
  In order to prevent air pollution by stationary and mobile 
sources of pollutant emissions, it is essential that a Clean Air 
for Russia program be developed, to include: 
  -- commencement in 1993 of efforts to monitor motor vehicle 
emissions, including compounds containing lead, sulfur, heavy 
particles, benz(a)pyrene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and 
aldehydes; development and introduction as of 1993 of state 
emission standards for currently manufactured and new models of 
vehicles on a par with standards in effect in the most developed 
countries; 
  -- acceleration of the transition of transportation to 
compressed and liquified gas, introduction of special converters 
for motor vehicle exhaust fumes and introduction of soot 
filters, and establishment of diagnostic centers and stations to 
monitor the technical condition of vehicles; an increase in the 
production and use of unleaded gasolines to 80 percent by 1996; 
  -- complete resettlement of residents out of sanitary 
protection zones around enterprises no later than 1995 and 
according to schedules agreed upon with local soviet organs, 
regarding this as a priority social and economic objective; 
  -- implementation of measures that will make it possible to 
reduce emissions of specific toxic substances (compounds 
containing chlorine, fluorine, carbon disulfide, hydrogen 
sulfide, mercury, lead, methylmercaptanes, paprine proteins, 
individual hydrocarbons, and so on) in technological processes 
by 50 percent; 
  -- a significant increase in the production of low-ash and 
low-sulfur types of fuel, to be used primarily in areas with an 
acute environmental situation; 
  -- increase by 43-45 by 1995 the number of cities with a 
network of stationary stations and points for monitoring the 
level of air pollution, and introduction of automated air 
pollution monitoring systems in 1993-95 in the cities of 
Angarsk, Berezinki, Krasnoyarsk, Magnitogorsk, Norilsk, Omsk, 
Sterlitamak, Salavat, Tolyatti and Cherepovets; commencement of 
such work in the cities of Bratsk, Nizhniy Novgorod, Lipetsk, 
Perm, Yekaterinburg, Ufa, Chelyabinsk, Nizhniy Tagil, 
Novokuznetsk, Novosibirsk, and Kemerovo; 
  -- start-up of serial production of modern gas filtration 
and 
scrubber systems and instruments to monitor air pollution and 
emissions from point sources; 
  -- reduction of sulfur oxide emissions by 50 percent in 
comparison to 1980 levels in the Republic of Karelia, Leningrad 
Oblast, and Murmansk by no later than 1995, in compliance with 
an intergovernmental agreement between the USSR and Finland. 
<H6>  5.1.2.1. Protection of the Ozone Layer </H6>
  In order to solve the global international environmental 
problem of how to preserve the ozone layer and protect human 
beings from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation, and in 
compliance with the Russian Federation's obligations stemming 
from the Vienna Conference (1985) and the Montreal Protocol 
(1987), it is essential to develop a program entitled 
``Production of Ozone-Safe Coolants and Compliance With the 
Russian Federation's International Obligations in Regard to 
Protection of the Ozone Layer,'' which should include the 
following measures: 
  -- implementation of monitoring of the ozone layer and 
timely 
detection of trends toward the thinning thereof; 
  -- construction of an environmental model based on the 
system 
``human beings--the biosphere--the ozone layer''; 
  -- development of a proposal to ensure environmental safety 
in the development of Russian Federation industry; 
  -- introduction into the country's economy of ozone-safe 
coolants for refrigeration equipment and components for foam 
plastic materials using alternative compounds and aerosol 
packaging with ozone-safe propellants, as well as those using no 
propellants. Current production facilities that use 
ozone-damaging substances must be completely rebuilt in order to 
make them capable of using hydrocarbon propellants, replacing 
fluorine-containing solvents and developing formulas for new 
detergents for cleaning various types of equipment; 
  -- creation of alternative halocarbons and 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) for use in existing machines and 
equipment; 
  -- conducting of efforts in connection with the collection 
and processing of significant quantities of ozone-destroying 
substances that are currently in use in various systems and 
pieces of equipment in many industries. 
<H6>  5.1.3. The Land and Soil </H6>
  Processes of land pollution and degradation, and the 
disruption and destruction of soils, particularly in farming 
areas, continue to develop in a catastrophic manner. 
  Enormous environmental and socioeconomic damage is done by 
soil erosion and formation of ravines, contamination of the land 
with toxic and radioactive substances and consumption- and 
production-related wastes, desertification of pasture land in 
arid and tundra zones, disruption of the land in the process of 
mining, construction, geological exploration, and other types of 
work, packing and degradation of soils due to the use of heavy 
agricultural equipment, degradation of soils due to irrigation 
and drying, losses of valuable land due to flooding and subsoil 
flooding as a result of hydraulic installation construction, 
increasing soil acidity due to the effects of acid rain and use 
of acidic chemical fertilizers, and the progressive development 
of floods, landslides, and land slippage. 
  These negative processes are occurring over areas totalling 
hundreds of millions of hectares. The land area contaminated by 
hazardous substances exceeds 62 million hectares. 
  In order to increase the sustainability of agricultural 
production in Russia, the Government of the Russian Federation 
has developed and approved the State Comprehensive Program To 
Increase Soil Fertility in Russia (Government Decree No. 879, 
issued on 17 November 1992). 
  That program includes: 
  -- greater consideration for ecology in agriculture and 
other 
land use in the process of land reform and the interfarm 
redistribution that will occur in 1993-95; 
  -- development and implementation of republic and regional 
programs to protect land against degradation and conserve and 
restore lands already degraded; 
  -- comprehensive study and mapping of land resources and the 
soil and vegetative cover in order to create a basic foundation 
for a cadastral land map, as well as comprehensive study and 
mapping of agricultural land with regard to humus content, 
micro- and macro-elements, heavy metals, and residual quantities 
of pesticides, nitrates, and radionuclides; 
  -- development in 1993-94 of scientific groundwork for 
agriculture and land use, and economic incentives for efficient 
land use; 
  -- conducting of rapid hydrogeological and geological 
engineering research to predict the water-salinity ratio and the 
balance of soils and groundwater, as well as to make 
recommendations concerning ways of preventing negative effects 
from land improvement; 
  -- development of a program to restore land, the condition 
of 
which has worsened as a result of swamp formation and salination; 
  -- changes in the structure of capital investment in land 
improvement efforts that will increase the proportion of work 
done to radically improve low-productivity farmland and make it 
arable; tighter monitoring of strict compliance with 
environmental protection requirements in the course of the 
construction, renovation, and use of land improvement systems, 
as well as during the use of areas thus reclaimed; 
  -- plantings in 1993-95 of protective woodlands on an area 
of 
at least 225,000 hectares, including field-protecting windbreaks 
on 72,000 hectares; 
  -- an increase in protection of crops from pests and 
diseases 
by biological means to 80 percent in soil under cover and to 40 
percent under field conditions; 
  -- substantial reduction in the area of waterlogged land; 
  -- rapid recultivation of disrupted land, with the goal of 
reducing disrupted areas by at least 30 percent by 1995; 
recultivation over an area of 384,000 hectares, including at 
least 188,000 hectares for use as farmland; 
  -- a 25 percent reduction by 1995 in the amount of fertile 
topsoil in storage, with improved utilization thereof in the 
reestablishment of fertility on recultivated land and 
low-productivity farmland; improvement of low-productivity 
agricultural land through application of fertile topsoil to an 
area of 50,000 hectares; 
  -- reassessment of standards for the number of livestock 
permitted per unit of land, with consideration for the specific 
nature of their care and the pasturage methods employed; by 
1995, development of a measure to regulate the number of 
livestock on the basis of the current and potential yield of 
land used for feed production; 
  -- a halt to processes producing lower soil fertility 
through 
improved quality and efficiency in the use of organic 
fertilizers. By 1995 use of organic fertilizers should be 
increased to 600 million tonnes, and by the year 2000 to 700-750 
million tonnes, through improvement in the storage and 
processing of manure, widespread use of straw, peat, sapropel, 
and waste products from agricultural and industrial production; 
  -- development of a system of measures in regard to the 
comprehensive application of chemical fertilizers and 
pesticides, with provision for their safe use in agricultural 
production; 
  -- development of a program to create agricultural equipment 
with permissible effects on soils; 
  -- a ban on the use of lands of natural 
preservation-related, 
therapeutic, recreational, historical, or cultural significance 
for industrial and agricultural purposes; 
  -- a halt to the allocation of particularly valuable 
agricultural land for state and public needs; 
  -- granting of areas to small peoples and ethnic groups for 
traditional natural resource use that will not be subject to 
expropriation or industrial development; 
  -- conducting in 1993 of an inventory of land disrupted in 
the course of mining, geological exploration, construction, and 
other work, with the findings of this inventory to be used to 
implement essential measures aimed at accelerating and improving 
the recultivation thereof; 
  -- regulations based on the economic requirements of tracked 
vehicle use in the tundra zone; accelerated development and 
production of special regional equipment that does not disrupt 
the North's soil and vegetative cover (using pneumatic treads, 
air cushions, and so on); 
  -- development and implementation of a comprehensive program 
to protect Russian Chernozem soils from degradation and restore 
their fertility; 
  -- preparation of recommendations of ways to improve 
regional 
organization and structure in order to create sustainable and 
self-regulating landscapes; 
  -- development and implementation of technological complexes 
employing special machinery for recultivation work and efforts 
to increase the productivity of low-productivity agricultural 
land; 
  -- establishment of a hybridization center to develop new, 
improved strains of plants for use in the recultivation of 
disrupted and polluted land and in increasing the productivity 
of low-productivity and degraded agricultural land; 
  -- development of handbooks of informational, normative, and 
technological materials on recultivation of disrupted land and 
protection of land resources during mining operations; 
  -- development of criteria and methodology for environmental 
economic assessment of the anthropogenic effects of industrial 
and other enterprises on land resources, as well as a 
methodology for environmental economic assessment of the 
operations of existing enterprises and planning of new 
enterprises. 
  The Government of the Russian Federation has developed and 
approved a State Program for Land Monitoring in the Russian 
Federation (Russian Federation Government Decree No. 100, issued 
5 February 1993) for the purpose of gradual introduction of land 
monitoring in the Russian Federation; this will include a system 
of observations on the condition of land for the purpose of 
timely identification of changes, assessment of those changes, 
and warnings and identification of the effects of negative 
processes. 
  This program makes provision for: 
  -- creation of a base of legal standards and scientific 
methodology for land monitoring; 
  -- a landscape and environmental classification of Russia's 
territory, including identification of areas of occurrence of 
the principal negative processes, broken down by type and by the 
degree of their effect on the land's condition; 
  -- creation of a land monitoring information bank; 
  -- improvement of existing and introduction of new methods 
of 
technical means and technologies for land monitoring; 
  -- creation of organizational structures for land 
monitoring. 
<H6>  5.1.4. Underground Resources and Mineral Resources </H6>
  For many years there have been high levels of losses 
connected with the underground mining of coal (23.5 
percent)--including coking coal (20.9 percent)--chrome ore (27.7 
percent) and potassium salts (62.5 percent). 
  The state suffers serious harm from the loss of valuable 
components and incomplete refining of minerals once they are 
mined. For example, more than one-third of all tin and 
approximately one-fourth of all iron, tungsten, molybdenum, 
potassium oxide, and phosphorus pentoxide are currently lost in 
the process of ore enrichment. Furthermore, losses during the 
enrichment process exceed losses connected with mining by a 
factor of seven for iron and by a factor of five for tungsten 
and tin. 
  Serious harm is done by enterprises' desire to selectively 
work the best sections of deposits, resulting in the 
accumulation of stockpiles of low-quality minerals and loss of 
their industrial significance. 
  The legal and economic foundations of complete and efficient 
utilization and protection of underground resources are set 
forth in the Russian Federation law ``On Underground 
Resources.'' That law (Section 1, p 3) states that determination 
of the strategy for use of, the rate of reproduction of, and the 
further expansion and improvement in quality of the mineral raw 
materials base is to be made based on development and 
implementation of federal programs. 
  In order to achieve efficient utilization of mineral 
resources, it is essential: 
  -- to develop and enact ``Regulations for the Protection of 
the Environment in Connection With Underground Resource Use''; 
  -- to develop and implement measures to improve the 
management of the state's underground resources. When licenses 
are issued to use underground resources, highly efficient use of 
those resources and protection of the environment by the 
underground resource users must be ensured; 
  -- to carry out an inventory and reevaluation of reserves 
for 
the 25-30 most important types of minerals, taking into 
consideration the latest advances in equipment and technologies 
for the mining and processing of minerals, stricter 
environmental protection requirements, and changes in prices for 
the products of the mining sectors of the economy; 
  -- to implement a series of measures to ensure efficient and 
complete utilization of mineral deposits, including development 
and introduction of mineral mining equipment and technologies 
that produce the maximum possible and most economically feasible 
level of mineral extraction, a transition to comprehensive 
technological approaches to development of deposits, expansion 
of the spectrum of usable components produced through in-depth 
processing of mined minerals, and achievement of complete 
utilization and use of wastes from the mining and mineral 
refining industries; 
  -- to lay the scientific groundwork and create a base of 
laws 
and standards and an economic mechanism to provide incentives 
for the efficient and environmentally safe development of the 
underground realm, including projects for possible 
nontraditional uses of exhausted mines for the benefit of the 
economy; 
  -- to conduct comprehensive geo-ecological monitoring of the 
environment for the purpose of laying the groundwork for its 
efficient use and preservation and the protection of areas from 
dangerous and catastrophic natural and technogenic effects; 
  -- to conduct a geological, technological, and economic 
assessment of technogenic deposits; 
  -- to develop and make the transition to new economic 
relations between geological survey organizations and 
enterprises in the mining industry; 
  -- to ban operations by enterprises that mine and refine 
minerals but are not equipped with the technical means for 
recording and monitoring the quantity and quality of the mineral 
raw materials mined, refined, or lost by them. 
<H6>  5.1.5. Specially Protected Natural Areas </H6>
  Specially protected natural areas in the Russian Federation 
form a unified functional system that is set aside for the 
preservation and study of natural diversity and supports 
ecological diversity and the conducting of environmental 
monitoring. 
  The territory of specially protected areas is distributed as 
follows. Preserves occupy 1.2 percent of the country's 
territory, reserves another 2 percent, and national parks 0.2 
percent. 
  In order to ensure inexhaustible use of animal and plant 
life, a program must be developed to preserve and restore the 
species diversity of flora and fauna and to preserve the biota's 
genetic stock. 
  That program must include: 
  -- development and implementation of a program to establish 
a 
system of specially protected natural areas, with provision for 
an increase by 1995 in the area of preserves by 18.8 million 
hectares and national natural parks by 12 million hectares, and 
by the year 2000 by another 5.8 million hectares and 6.3 million 
hectares, respectively. This will bring their totals (including 
existing areas) to 51.6 million hectares (3.3 percent of the 
republic's total area) by 1995 and to 63.7 million (3.7 percent) 
by 2000; 
  -- focusing of the management of nature preserves, national 
parks, and reserves of federal significance in a single organ, 
the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural 
Resources; 
  -- expansion of the rights and functions of preserve and 
national park staff to ensure effective protection of 
preservation areas; 
  -- establishment of a state planning and survey service to 
organize specially protected natural areas; 
  -- provision of directed funding for research in the field 
of 
preserve management, allocation of the necessary budget funding 
for the planning, establishment, and development of newly 
organized state preserves, national parks, and reserves of 
republic-wide significance; 
  -- determination of a procedure for the organization of 
national parks, assignment of capital investment limits to them, 
and allocation of physical, technical, and financial resources 
to them; 
  -- development of indices by which to assess the results of 
operations by national parks and state preserves; 
  -- study of the interaction between national parks and other 
land users to organize the protection and efficient use and 
reproduction of natural resources and to provide cultural, 
household, and information services and environmental education 
to the public; 
  -- creation of a unified central data base on the dynamics 
of 
natural processes throughout the entire territory of the 
republic within the unified Chronicle of Nature information 
retrieval system. 
<H6>  5.1.6. Forests, Flora, and Fauna </H6>
  One of the most important problems in the ecological balance 
is the restoration of forests. In the Russian Federation, forest 
restoration efforts are being carried out to an extent that 
exceeds the amount of clearcutting currently being done. In 1991 
Russia cut 1.417 million hectares of forest, and replanted 
forests on an area of 1.562 million hectares. According to 
foresters' estimates, reforestation needs to be done on 1.276 
million hectares. However, in a number of oblasts and republics 
the quality and effectiveness of reforestation efforts are low. 
Moreover, due to the use of equipment and technologies by the 
timber industry in recent years that result in the virtually 
complete destruction of the forest ecosystem, large amounts of 
new growth and young trees of valuable species are dying in 
Russia's mixed forest zone, and undesirable species replacement 
is occurring. 
  In accordance with a decree issued by the RSFSR Council of 
Ministers on 16 March 1990, No. 93, ``On Urgent Measures To 
Improve the Environmental Situation in the RSFSR in 1990-95 and 
Principal Focuses of Environmental Protection in the 13th 
Five-Year Plan and the Period up to the Year 2005,'' in 1990 the 
RSFSR Ministry of Forestry drew up a ``State Program for 
Reforestation in Russia in the Period up to the Year 2005.'' By 
decision of the Russian Government (in a protocol issued on 28 
September 1992, No VM-P42-31), the Forest Committee under the 
Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection, the Russian 
Ministry of Economics, the Russian Ministry of Finance, and the 
Russian Ministry of Agriculture were directed to amend that 
program, with consideration for current legislation and the 
transition to market relationships. When amended, the program 
will specify the amount of work to be done and the physical, 
technical, and financial resources that work will entail. 
  Successful reproduction of forests can be achieved only on 
the basis of close interconnection and a balance among 
technological processes used in cutting, reforestation, 
cultivation of timber stands, and organization of effective 
conservation and protection of forests, combined with 
appropriate scientific support and physical and technical 
supplies. A lack of balance in any measure will result in the 
inefficient functioning of the entire system. 
  Implementation of this state program will include: 
  -- reduction in the amount of clearcutting, replacing it 
with 
selective and gradual harvesting, and efforts to ensure that 
forestry requirements are complied with in the process of timber 
harvesting; 
  -- establishment of a forest ecology monitoring service, 
particularly in regions with a high concentration of enterprises 
in the nonferrous and ferrous metals industries and the chemical 
and petrochemical industries, as well as regions with 
radioactively contaminated forests, the Lake Baikal watershed, 
the Far Eastern Region, and other regions where there exists a 
real danger of disruption in the environmental balance; 
  -- an increase in the effectiveness of reforestation 
efforts, 
the survival rate and quality of artificially created stands, 
targeted reforestation of stands of oak, beech, cedar, and 
others of the most valuable tree species, and expansion of 
special-purpose tree farming; 
  -- creation of protective forest plantings to prevent water 
and wind erosion; reconstruction and repair of previously 
established protective stands; 
  -- preservation of the current levels of timber harvesting 
and young tree stand thinning, coupled with improvement of 
quality and improvement in the means of conducting such harvests; 
  -- development of transportation access to forests and an 
increase in the amount of repair and maintenance work on 
existing forest drainage systems; 
  -- improvement of forest seed production and nursery farming 
based on production of high-quality seeds and selection of 
planting materials; 
  -- improvement in methods of protecting the forest against 
insect pests and diseases, with an emphasis on the use of 
biological methods and means, tighter monitoring of occurrences 
of insect infestations and diseases, and improvement in 
ground-based forest protection equipment. 
  During the period in question, the volume of work in 
connection with forest reproduction is planned at the 1992 
level, or with a slight increase by 1995. 
  As a result of implementation of this program, during this 
period the Forest Committee will carry out forest restoration 
over an area of 2.53 million hectares, including plantings of 
cedar forest on 92,000 hectares and oak on 56,000 hectares. A 
total of 6.5 million hectares will come of age and be 
reclassified as commercial stands of young timber. 
  Due to a protracted drought in a number of regions of Russia 
this year, there has been a marked increase in the incidence of 
forest fires. A significant contributing factor to the 
inadequate level of forest protection against fires was the 
chronic shortage of budget allocations for such purposes, the 
poor physical and technical infrastructure of forest 
firefighting services, and sharp increases in the cost of 
leasing aircraft and the prices of physical resources and 
equipment. 
  In order to improve protection against forest fires, and in 
compliance with Russian Government Decree No. 254, issued on 28 
July 1992, the Forest Committee, in conjunction with other 
affected ministries and agencies, has developed a program to 
protect forests from fire in 1993-97. 
  That program makes provision for: 
  -- reinforcement of existing airborne and ground-based 
forest 
firefighting services, plus creation of new units for the rapid 
detection and extinguishing of forest fires, with those units to 
be provided with physical and technical resources in line with 
scientifically established standards; 
  -- establishment of special mobile units in regions with 
large areas of forest to fight major forest fires, those units 
to be equipped with all-terrain firefighting equipment and the 
means of transporting it; 
  -- accelerated development of designs and manufacture of 
tanker aircraft to fight forest fires directly from the air; 
  -- development and introduction of space-based information 
support for forest fire protection efforts and monitoring of the 
forest fire situation, as well as a system for detecting and 
providing up-to-date information on fires as they occur, along 
with other operational information; 
  -- establishment of a computer network and communications 
system of unified interagency dispatcher stations for ongoing 
management of forest fire prevention; 
  -- allocation of budget funding for the operating expenses 
and centralized capital investment required for air- and 
ground-based forest protection. 
  In order to protect and efficiently utilize plant and animal 
resources, it is essential: 
  -- to develop and perfect legislative foundations, 
standards, 
and regulations for the protection and reproduction of animal 
life and regulation of hunting, and to define measures to 
increase penalties for violations of the requirements thus 
established; 
  -- to create an effective system for the protection and use 
of plants (including forests) and animal life (including fish 
resources); 
  -- to continue to develop and perfect methods for the 
comprehensive management of forestry, hunting, and fishing; 
  -- to conduct an inventory of and map the habitats of rare 
and endangered plant and animal species, and to create and 
expand existing genetic banks; 
  -- to set environmentally justified limits on the 
procurement 
(harvesting) of wild medicinal and food products from the forest 
and on the basis thereof to organize the industrial use and 
reproduction of those resources; 
  -- to provide state record keeping and state cadastral 
mapping of plant and animal resources and to maintain the 
Russian Red Book on a qualitatively new level, with 
consideration for the economic independence of republics and 
regions; 
  -- to implement a series of measures to prevent 
desertification and degradation of steppe vegetation; 
  -- to expand the network of botanical preserves, genetic 
reserves, and preserves for distinctive forest boundaries and 
mast-producing areas; 
  -- to develop and establish a new procedure for the 
creation, 
expansion, and storage of botanical and zoological collections; 
  -- to develop and introduce a system of economic, legal, and 
ecological standards for the use of plants; 
  -- to develop and put in practice a new economic mechanism 
for regulation of the use of animal resources, defining a 
procedure for assigning hunting lands on a lease basis and 
issuing all types of permits for the rights to use animal 
resources; 
  -- to continue the study of the effects of animal activities 
on the formation of biological and geological cenoses, conduct a 
classification by landscape type, and on the basis thereof 
determine the optimum density and number of wild animals for 
each region, as well as limits and quotas on their removal; 
  -- to ensure monitoring of compliance with international and 
interrepublic programs and conventions to protect rare and 
endangered migratory animals and plants, and to develop foreign 
economic relations in that area of activity; 
  -- to continue to improve methods of surveying rare and 
particularly valuable types of animals in the wild, with their 
subsequent reintroduction into nature and implementation of 
measures to make broad practical use of these methods; 
  -- to make fuller use of advances in science and technology 
and the system of aerial and space observation of the 
distribution and migrations of wild animals, in particular 
saiga, wild northern reindeer, and other large hoofed animals, 
sea mammals, and waterfowl; 
  -- to develop fishing in Russia's internal bodies of water, 
to increase the effectiveness of efforts to protect and 
reproduce fish populations, to increase the release of fry of 
valuable commercial fish species into natural bodies of water 
and reservoirs, and to establish fish hatcheries capable of 
producing more than 340 million fry annually. 
<H6>  5.1.7. Resorts and Other Recreational Areas </H6>
  In order to preserve the therapeutic and curative functions 
of naturally occurring natural sites, it is essential: 
  -- to restrict economic activities in the vicinity of 
resorts 
and unique recreational areas and to remove from those zones 
enterprises that are not connected with the functioning and 
development of resorts and therapeutic facilities or with public 
services, while ensuring the most favorable sanitary conditions 
for therapy and recreation; 
  -- to develop in the 1993-94 period scientifically based 
criteria for maximum permissible anthropogenic burden on the 
environment of resort and recreational areas; 
  -- to ensure by 1995 the development of regional 
comprehensive plans for environmental protection at resorts of 
republic-wide significance; 
  -- to set up a system for monitoring the state of natural 
therapeutic resources, landscapes, bodies of water, the air, 
soil, and vegetation; 
  -- to develop a cadastral map of areas in Russia that are of 
recreational significance; 
  -- to develop an economic and legal mechanism to regulate 
the 
recreational use of nature (accelerated amortization of fixed 
capital at recreational sites and facilities, special 
requirements governing development of natural recreational 
resources, and policy on personnel, prices, and taxes). 
<H6>  5.2. Urgent Measures To Bring About Environmental 
Restoration of Russia's Regions </H6>
  The most important goal of environmental restoration in the 
Russian Federation is to reduce the worsening conflicts between 
the siting and condition of production facilities and the 
sustainability of the natural development of ecosystems at 
various levels. 
  One important element in solving environmental problems in 
the region is to ensure the natural development of individual 
ecosystems and preserve unique natural complexes and landscapes. 
This will necessitate the development of environmental 
regulations governing natural resource use at the regional and 
territorial levels, with assignment of a priority classification 
to a given region's ecosystems, unique natural complexes, and 
landscapes. 
<H6>  5.2.1. The Volga-North Caspian Region </H6>
  The Volga-North Caspian Region consists of 32 oblasts and 
republics in the Volga Region. 
  The environmental situation in this region is hallmarked by 
a 
combination of a significant quantity of anthropogenic factors 
influencing the environment and the functional activities of the 
environment's components. The Volga-Caspian basin has a 
predominance of industries that produce the most toxic wastes 
and have ineffective treatment facilities. The most harmful 
types of production are enterprises and associations in the 
chemical, oil and gas refining, cellulose and paper industries, 
the fertilizer and pharmaceutical industries, and so on. 
  Many industrial enterprises have mostly outdated technology, 
resulting in the creation of large amounts of liquid, solid, and 
gaseous wastes. 
  The particularly complex environmental situation in the 
Volga 
watershed has necessitated the development of a program entitled 
``Amelioration of the Environmental Situation and Increase in 
Resource and Economic Potential in the Volga Watershed (Revival 
of the Volga).'' 
  This program makes provision for: 
  -- development and implementation of a series of radical 
measures to bring about a substantial reduction in the release 
of pollutants into the environment, lowering of atmospheric 
emissions to permissible levels, and discontinuation of polluted 
waste water discharges into bodies of water; 
  -- development and approval in 1993 of a program on the 
construction of facilities for the thorough removal of biogenic 
elements from waste water and implementation of other measures 
to combat the eutrophication of bodies of water in the 
watershed, with consideration for advanced foreign and Russian 
experience in this field; 
  -- construction in the 1993-95 period of enterprises and 
facilities for the utilization, neutralization, and disposal of 
toxic industrial, household, and other wastes with capital 
investment funds allocated for the development of those sectors 
of the economy, as well as expansion and renovation of existing 
facilities using associations', enterprises', and organizations' 
own funds; 
  -- further development of economic facilities in the Volga 
River watershed, primarily through conservation of water 
resources and a significant reduction in water use per unit of

<H6>  5.2.2. The Baltic Sea Basin </H6>
  In accordance with the Convention on Protection of the 
Marine 
Environment in the Baltic Sea Region (1974 and 1992), various 
declarations (1988, 1990, and 1992), the Convention on 
Long-Distance Cross-Border Air Pollution (1979), the 
intergovernmental Soviet-Finnish Agreement on Cooperation in the 
Field of Environmental Protection (1985), urgent measures 
stemming from Russia's obligations, and the Declaration on 
Revival of the Baltic Sea (1990), and in order to restore the 
normal ecological balance, it will be necessary to draw up a 
comprehensive joint program of environmental measures in the 
Baltic Sea basin. 
  That program will include: 
  -- a halt to discharges of untreated or inadequately treated 
waste water, achieving a 50 percent reduction in the release of 
organic substances, nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, salts, 
and heavy metals into bodies of water by 1995; 
  -- completion by 1994 of construction of a series of 
treatment facilities and sewage networks in St. Petersburg, 
Kaliningrad, Petrozavodsk, Pskov, and other cities for the 
purpose of complete biological purification of waste water, with 
establishment of local treatment facilities at enterprises. 
Construction should begin on a system of storm sewer lines with 
waste water routed to treatment facilities. Also slated for 
construction are facilities to provide additional treatment of 
waste water and a high degree of purification from nitrogen and 
phosphorus compounds, and secondary use of this additionally 
purified water in cities and by industrial enterprises; 
  -- implementation by 1995 of a program to protect the 
environment at enterprises in the timber, cellulose, and paper 
industries in the Republic of Karelia, Leningrad Oblast, and 
Kaliningrad Oblast, eliminating discharges of untreated waste 
water and reducing pollutant emissions into the atmosphere; 
  -- development and gradual introduction by 1995 of 
environmentally safe methods of agriculture and use of food 
industry facilities that will preclude adverse effects on water 
protection zones and the release of production- and 
livestock-related waste water, organic and chemical fertilizers, 
and toxic chemicals into bodies of water; 
  -- reconstruction of docks and cargo handling facilities at 
ports, to ensure environmental safety in connection with their 
operations; 
  -- development of methods of air- and ship-based long-range 
monitoring of the state of the marine environment, with the goal 
of quickly detecting pollution sources and initiating steps to 
eliminate them; 
  -- participation in the creation of a unified international 
system to monitor the condition of the Baltic Sea, along with 
development and implementation of a unified program to improve 
the environmental situation in the Baltic Sea basin; 
  -- development and approval of a statute on Lake Ladoga as a 
natural site of national significance; 
  -- development and gradual introduction by 1995 of a system 
to regulate natural resource use in the Lake Ladoga watershed, 
with consideration for the natural and economic characteristics 
of the region in question, the acuteness of the environmental 
situation, and international environmental quality standards; 
  -- development of a program to make industrial production in 
the Lake Ladoga watershed more environmentally sound; 
  -- development of an environmentally justified strategy for 
socioeconomic development in the Lake Ladoga watershed, with the 
goal of bringing the structure and distribution of production 
facilities into accordance with the natural resource potential 
of the region in question and reducing the acuteness of the 
environmental situation. 
<H6>  5.2.3. The Sea of Azov Basin </H6>
  As a result of flow regulation along the Don and Kuban 
Rivers, intensive irrigation, and large volumes of permanently 
diverted water use, the influx of fresh water into the Sea of 
Azov has decreased by as much as 65 percent as compared to the 
average annual flow of its tributaries, and this has resulted in 
a change in the water balance and caused an increase in the 
sea's salinity from 10 to 14 percent. As a result, there has 
been a change in the species composition of fish populations and 
food organisms, with valuable fish species being replaced by 
less valuable ones. Increasing contamination of the marine 
environment has resulted in the accumulation of pollutants in 
aquatic biotas and has created a real possibility that the 
genetic stock of fish populations in the Sea of Azov will be 
lost. 
  In view of the extremely acute environmental situation in 
the 
Sea of Azov basin and the negative ecological processes 
occurring in it, processes that threaten to lead to irreversible 
changes, it is necessary to implement: 
  -- during the 1993-95 period, a series of environmental 
protection measures to prevent pollution of bodies of water, 
conserve water, and reduce permanent diversion of water in order 
to halt completely all discharges of contaminated waste water by 
1995 and ensure an average annual flow of at least 34 cubic 
kilometers of fresh water into the Sea of Azov; 
  -- during the 1993-95 period, efforts to improve in a 
comprehensive manner the condition of small rivers, restore in 
all areas a system of water protection zones, and ensure 
compliance with that system, and beginning in 1993 halt the 
cultivation of lands in water protection strips adjacent to 
bodies of water; 
  -- planting in the 1993-95 period of artificial forest areas 
on nonproducing areas of forest land and unused agricultural 
land; completion of efforts to create protective forest stands 
to prevent erosion processes; 
  -- reduction in harmful emissions into the atmosphere in 
1996 
in cities and industrial centers along the Sea of Azov 
coast--Rostov-na-Donu, Taganrog, Novocherkessk, Krasnodar, and 
others--according to established standards, plus construction in 
the 1993-95 period of enterprises and facilities for the 
utilization, neutralization, and disposal of toxic industrial, 
household, and other wastes; 
  -- broad introduction beginning in 1993 of circulatory water 
use and other environmental protection measures within rice 
irrigation systems in order to halt the release of runoff water 
that is contaminated with pesticides and chemical fertilizers 
into bodies of water; 
  -- termination in 1994 of the use of pesticides to cultivate 
rice fields in Krasnodar and Stavropol Krays and Rostov Oblast, 
development and introduction of scientifically based zonal soil 
protection and water-conservation systems for use in 
agriculture, with provision made for restrictions on and 
subsequent banning of pesticides, and introduction of biological 
methods of protecting plants from pests and diseases; expansion 
of selection efforts to create disease- and pest-resistant rice 
strains; 
  -- a halt to the construction of new irrigation systems 
until 
such time as existing systems have been rebuilt to increase 
their efficiency; 
  -- installation of fish protection devices on all water 
collection and water discharge installations on collection and 
drainage systems; 
  -- development of a system for the comprehensive use and 
protection of water and land resources in the basin of the Sea 
of Azov, with priority attention to urgent matters pertaining to 
restoration of the ecological and sanitary situation; 
  -- implementation of a program of bank-reinforcement work, 
with the establishment if necessary of a specialized 
organization for the realization thereof, as well as the 
development and introduction by 1995 of environmentally safe 
channel-dredging work; 
  -- during the 1993-94 period, equipping of all ports in the 
Sea of Azov basin with equipment to receive and treat 
commercial, household, and industrial waste water from ships, 
establishment of a service to eliminate spills of petroleum 
products and other substances, and equipping of that service 
with oil and garbage collectors, oil booms, and other essential 
equipment; 
  -- research and development work aimed at preventing the 
dispersal in the Sea of Azov basin of hydrobiont species that 
are not appropriate to that ecosystem; 
  -- study on the issue creating specially protected fishing 
preserves in the Gulf of Taganrog and in the estuaries and 
deltas of the Don and Kuban Rivers. 
  In view of the fact that the Republic of Ukraine discharges 
more than 1 billion cubic meters of polluted waste water into 
the Sea of Azov basin, or 24 percent of the total amount of 
polluted discharge in that basin, it is essential that an 
agreement be reached with the Republic of Ukraine in 1993 
regarding coordinated measures to reduce the discharge or 
emission of pollutants to established levels by 1995. 
<H6>  5.2.4. The Black Sea Coast </H6>
  In accordance with the Convention on Protection of the Black 
Sea From Pollution (1992), and in order to bring about radical 
improvement in the environmental situation in that region, it is 
essential: 
  -- to ensure an annual increase in the amount of 
shore-reinforcement and antislippage efforts, in order to 
essentially achieve shoreline stabilization in the resort region 
by 1995; 
  -- to implement a series of measures to reduce air pollution 
by vehicle exhaust to established levels and to establish 
monitoring and regulatory stations, equipping them with the 
necessary equipment and instruments; 
  -- to halt the excavation of sand and gravel in coastal 
waters and from riverbeds in 1993; 
  -- to develop, with consideration for a prior inventory, a 
scientifically based concept for the socioeconomic development 
of the Black Sea coast resort zone in Krasnodar Kray, 
determining the levels of optimum and maximum recreational 
burden on its natural therapeutic resources; 
  -- to implement urgent measures to stop environmental 
pollution by the Tuapse Transshipment Oil Depot, and also to 
increase deliveries of lead-free gasolines to resort cities for 
use in automobiles and other means of transportation, in order 
to make a full transition to that type of fuel possible in 1993; 
  -- to equip port facilities with equipment to receive and 
treat waste water from ships; 
  -- to build and put on line in the 1993-95 period facilities 
to treat: storm sewer runoff in the cities of Sochi, Tuapse, 
Anapa, and Gelendzhik; deep-sea releases of waste water from the 
city of Tuapse in 1993; and the same in the cities of Sochi, 
Novorossiysk, Gelendzhik, and Anapa in 1995; 
  -- to reduce discharges of biogenic substances by 50 percent 
by 1995, and then to halt completely the discharge of polluted 
waste water into bodies of water in the Black Sea basin; 
  -- to create a system of water supply and sewers by 1995 
that 
will be fully capable of meeting demand for water and sewage 
management in the cities of Sochi, Tuapse, Gelendzhik, 
Novorossiysk, and Anapa and in resort towns; 
  -- to continue construction of a highway to bypass downtown 
Sochi, renovation of individual sections of the state highway 
connecting Novorossiysk, Tbilisi, and Baku, and renovation of 
transportation hubs within city limits; 
  -- to ban in all areas as of 1993 the use of bottom trawls 
in 
commercial fishing, as these have an adverse effect on aquatic 
biocenoses; 
  -- to expand the network of specially protected bodies of 
water and their adjacent territories in the Black Sea basin, 
particularly in the vicinity of Cape Tarkhankut and the Gulf of 
Karkinit; 
  -- to assess effects on the Black Sea ecosystem by 
hydrobionts accidentally introduced into the Black Sea basin and 
draft recommendations on preventing their negative effects on 
the sea's characteristic fauna; 
  -- to do research on the dynamics of the Black Sea's 
condition under the influence of anthropogenic pollution and 
variations in the level of the hydrogen sulfide layer, and based 
on the results thereof to develop a strategy of action to 
restore marine and coastal ecosystems and the environment. 
Necessary measures must be taken to involve states along the 
Danube River and the Black Sea Coast as well as international 
organizations in these efforts. 
<H6>  5.2.5. The Arctic Region </H6>
  Construction of waste water treatment facilities is 
proceeding extremely slowly in this region and is not keeping 
pace with increasing volumes of industrial and housing 
construction. Goals for the construction of water protection 
facilities are not being met in a satisfactory manner. 
Enterprises and organizations located in this region are not 
carrying out measures to minimize their volume of untreated 
waste water, are doing little to introduce progressive 
production technology, and have been too slow in resolving 
problems pertaining to the complete processing of raw materials 
and utilization of waste products. 
  The necessity of solving the North's environmental problems 
prompted the development of a program entitled ``Protection and 
Efficient Use of Natural Resources in the Russian Arctic.'' 
  In view of the special significance of the Arctic Region in 
the formation of our planet's current climate and in determining 
the level of the ocean, as well as its importance as a source of 
territory and natural resources for the Russian Federation, it 
would be appropriate: 
  -- to classify the Arctic as a natural region under a 
special 
natural use regime; 
  -- to develop regional environmental standards to regulate 
economic activities within coastal and offshore areas, on the 
continental shelf, and in Russia's maritime economic zone; 
  -- to establish through legislation the priority of the 
Arctic's native population's interests when matters pertaining 
to economic use of the region are decided. In order to preserve 
traditional forms of natural resource use, the establishment of 
ethnic territories should begin as of 1993; 
  -- to designate bodies of water and water courses that are 
the principal sources of water supply for population centers (in 
particular this should be done for compact settlements of the 
North's small peoples), and by decisions of local soviets ban 
economic and other activities that could result in pollution of 
those water sources; 
  -- to develop effective methods of recultivating the soil 
and 
vegetative cover of tundra and mixed forest-tundra areas; 
  -- to ensure adequate fire protection for reindeer pasturage 
and forests adjoining the tundra; 
  -- to develop and ensure as of 1993 the manufacture of 
specialized vehicles for survey and exploration work in the 
Arctic, as well as for use by the small peoples of the North to 
engage in their traditional trades, with equal weight 
distribution, which will not cause topsoil disruption; 
  -- to shift heating of rural population centers in the 
Arctic 
zone to briquetted coal, gas, or liquid fuel that will eliminate 
the use of firewood in the forest tundra zone; 
  -- to end log drives, making the transition to 
transportation 
of timber logged on the upper reaches of rivers solely by ship 
by 1995; 
  -- to define routes and zones for the development of 
tourism, 
in order to prevent disruption of natural environments; 
  -- to step up efforts in connection with the planning, 
industrial production, and introduction into use of 
environmentally clean wind-power installations to provide heat 
and electricity to population centers; 
  -- to eliminate piles of timber and mud along the routes of 
oil and gas pipelines and to clean up and recultivate such 
areas, with subsequent transfer thereof to land users in amounts 
and for time periods agreed upon with local bodies; 
  -- to establish facilities for the utilization and 
neutralization of household waste, and to build crossing points 
across mainline gas pipelines that intersect the migration 
routes of wild animals; 
  -- to build, expand, and renovate fish farming facilities 
designed to compensate for damages done to fish populations in 
the Arctic watershed; 
  -- to develop and organize production of equipment to 
contain 
and collect oil from water surfaces in order to fully supply 
such equipment by 1995 to enterprises and organizations located 
in the region; 
  -- to accelerate construction of facilities to utilize 
by-product petroleum gas; to develop and introduce technical 
means of eliminating sediments contaminated by heavy oil 
fractions; 
  -- to develop and arrange for production of a necessary 
quantity of effective technical means to remove oil pollution 
from soil, and by 1996 widely introduce microbiological methods 
of fighting oil pollution in soils. 
<H6>  5.2.6. The Caucasus Mineral Waters </H6>
  In accordance with Russian Federation Government Decree No. 
462, issued on 6 July 1992, the administration of the Caucasus 
Mineral Waters was assigned to develop in conjunction with the 
Russian Ministry of Health and the Russia Ministry of Ecology 
[as published] a long-range state program on the commercial and 
residential development of the specially protected ecological 
and resort region known as the Caucasus Mineral Waters. That 
program must make provision for: 
  -- removal of industrial and agricultural enterprises under 
ministry and agency control from residential and resort zones in 
the region; 
  -- amendment of the general plans of resort cities in the 
Caucasus Mineral Waters, an increase in the level of 
organizational work to implement those plans and make efficient 
use of the territory of those cities, with the goal of maximum 
improvement in the conditions of treatment, recreation, and 
residence for working people and preservation of natural 
therapeutic resources; 
  -- development of a comprehensive regional plan to protect 
the environment at resorts in the Caucasus Mineral Waters, 
making that plan the basis for implementation of the 
environmental protection and sanitation improvement measures set 
forth in plans for economic and social development; 
  -- creation of a unified water supply system for resort 
cities based on underground water resources known to exist in 
the Malka Aquifer; 
  -- elimination of nonfunctional wells and removal of animal 
farms and complexes from the second sanitary zone surrounding 
resorts; 
  -- an end to the discharge of used mineral water and other 
untreated waste water into any bodies of water; 
  -- structural reorganization of the sanitarium and resort 
complex; 
  -- transformation of the Caucasus Mineral Waters into an 
international resort center through creation of an appropriate 
legal mechanism to attract foreign investment. 
<H6>  5.2.7. The Lake Baykal Watershed </H6>
  Lake Baykal is a unique natural landmark, and its problems 
have attracted the close attention of the public in our country 
and around the world. Despite the fact that the Lake Baykal 
watershed as a whole is not among the regions with an acute 
environmental situation, the lake ecosystem's sensitivity to 
external influences is so great that there is a threat of 
dangerous trends changing its basic elements, and that demands 
immediate action. However, a reduction in individual adverse 
effects cannot fundamentally change dangerous trends toward 
change in the environment. That will require radical structural 
change in environmental protection efforts. Without making a 
radical change in the existing ecological and economic systems 
in the region and lessening the adverse connections and 
functions which both directly and indirectly continue to harm 
the environment, the country will be forced to invest an ever 
larger portion of its gross national product in stabilization of 
the environment and preservation of the conditions necessary for 
life in the Baykal region. 
  In view of the above, and also in compliance with Russian 
Presidential Edict No 295, issued on 25 March 1992 under the 
title ``On Urgent Measures of State Support for the Economy of 
the Buryat SSR'' (point 11), a Comprehensive Program for the 
Protection and Efficient Use of Natural Resources in the Lake 
Baykal Watershed (Basic Aspects) has been developed. 
  That program contains plans to ensure: 
  -- creation of an environmental monitoring system; 
  -- establishment of a regional economic mechanism to ensure 
protection for and efficient use of natural resources; 
  -- greater emphasis on the environment in physical 
production 
through use of low-resource, low-waste, and no-waste 
technological processes and highly efficient water supply 
systems and methods of purifying waste water and emissions of 
dust and gases; 
  -- closure or restructuring of enterprises that are 
particularly hazardous to the environment into safe or 
environmentally tolerable types of production, implementation of 
technical refitting and renovation on the basis of Russian and 
foreign advances, as well as removal of production facilities 
from the region or their relocation in a more environmentally 
sustainable zone; 
  -- primary use of more environmentally safe types of 
fuel--low-sulfur and low-ash coals, natural gas, and 
electricity--in the shoreline protection zone; centralization of 
heat production, greater use of diesel, and refitting of 
transportation to use unleaded gas or natural gas; 
  -- optimization of the structure of agricultural production, 
reduction of the area of erosion-prone areas cultivated, and 
implementation of anti-erosion measures; 
  -- implementation of measures to reduce runoff of 
pesticides, 
chemical fertilizers, and organic substances from agricultural 
land, gradual reduction in the use of artificial means of plant 
protection, and development of biological methods for that 
purpose; 
  -- recultivation of disrupted land in areas of mining 
operations; 
  -- conducting of a high-quality economic assessment of land 
based on the terms of the land reform now under way and with 
consideration for the need to protect natural sites in the Lake 
Baykal region; 
  -- intensification of environmental protection measures in 
the region's social infrastructure: centralization of the water 
supply and sewage system in cities and urban-type towns, 
construction of garbage processing plants, creation of green 
areas within city boundaries, creation of well-appointed 
recreation zones, and introduction of modern means of treating 
and utilizing municipal and household waste from small 
population centers; 
  -- reestablishment of Lake Baykal's biological resources and 
expansion of fish breeding capacity; 
  -- widespread introduction of scientifically based forms of 
managing hunting, fur farming, and utilization of other forest 
resources; 
  -- directed formation and development of a unified network 
of 
protected areas, encompassing all valuable multipurpose sectors 
of the ecosystem in the Lake Baykal watershed; 
  -- development of a recreational complex, with consideration 
for the requirements of environmental protection for natural 
complexes in the region; 
  -- creation of the necessary environmental conditions for 
the 
activities of the region's population and provision of 
environmentally pure food products; 
  -- creation of a system to reduce the effects of accidents 
and disasters, predict them, and warn the public in a timely 
manner; 
  -- extensive public involvement in matters pertaining to 
environmental protection and efficient natural resource use in 
the Lake Baykal watershed. 
<H3>  Section 6. Basic Principles of the Mechanism for 
Implementation of the National Plan of Action </H3>
  At the present time, there are serious difficulties with the 
implementation of urgent environmental protection measures to 
improve the environmental situation in the Russian Federation. 
  Based on a statement in the Russian Federation law ``On 
Environmental Protection'' (Section 111, Article 17), planning 
of environmental protection measures is carried out as part of 
programs and projections of socioeconomic development on the 
basis of the State Ecological Program and with consideration for 
the natural resource potential of individual regions. 
  The Russian Federation State Ecological Program is a 
unified, 
scientifically based system for the creation and implementation 
of environmental programs at the national, international, and 
regional levels, encompassing solutions to problems at various 
levels with a single comprehensive approach. Thus, the State 
Ecological Program should be viewed as an organizational and 
economic mechanism for the implementation of the National Plan. 
  We must stop the practice of dealing with effects rather 
than 
their causes, of developing measures only to eliminate existing 
environmental emergencies, which are, as a rule, the result of 
ill-conceived natural resource use manifested through the 
unjustified siting of production facilities and use of 
inadequate technologies, as has often been the practice of state 
administrative organs over the past 10-15 years. Therefore, one 
important goal is the use of existing scientific potential to 
develop a comprehensive approach to determining priority areas 
and measures within the appropriate programs, as well as a 
scientifically based state ecological program as the system 
behind those programs. 
  In view of the considerable amount of capital investment 
necessary for implementation of environmental protection 
measures, in compliance with the Russian Federation law ``On 
Environmental Protection'' (Section 111, Article 17, paragraph 
3), those funds must be allocated as a separate item in federal, 
republic, and other budgets. 
  The Russian Federation State Ecological Program should make 
provision for the development of a unit of a general functional 
nature, which will be essential for the implementation of 
environmental programs at various levels. 
  That unit should include the following subprograms: 
  -- monitoring of the environment and sources of influences 
on 
it; ecological mapping; 
  -- establishment of environmental quality standards and 
natural resource use standards; standardization of technological 
processes, facilities, and products; 
  -- an economic and legal mechanism for environmental 
protection and natural resource use; 
  -- a system of state environmental monitoring and 
assessment; 
  -- key areas in the protection and restoration of natural 
environments and the efficient use of Russia's natural resources; 
  -- manufacture of environmental protection equipment and 
installations; 
  -- improvement in the system of environmental education, 
training, and propaganda. 
  Improvement in the ecological condition of the environments 
and ecosystems, and their component natural sites and complexes, 
as well as improved efficiency in natural resource use, should 
be achieved through implementation of programs at various levels 
which take the specific characteristics of industries and 
regions into account, with environmental protection and 
efficient natural resource use possessing the status of state 
priorities. 
  Depending on their objectives, programs may be subdivided 
into: 
  -- comprehensive and of varying territorial extent 
(regional, 
interregional, international, watershed-based, applicable to one 
natural complex, and so on); 
  -- resource-oriented (use and protection of water, soil, 
forests, living resources, and so on); 
  -- economic sector-based (environmental protection measures 
for various industries, transportation, agriculture, and so on). 
  Procedure for the development and implementation of federal 
directed environmental programs was established by Russian 
Federation Government Decree No. 638, issued on 27 August 1992. 
  The procedure for development of directed environmental 
programs includes the following stages: 
  -- compilation of a list of one-time programs to be 
implemented, that list to be based on a selective and 
coordinated list of regional issues that can be resolved on the 
basis of a program; decisionmaking to further develop those 
issues; 
  -- designation of a body to manage the directed program, a 
body that will be responsible for the creation and 
implementation of each specific program and the sources of 
development funding; 
  -- designation of a head of program development and 
co-executors (this should, as a rule, be done on a competitive 
basis); 
  -- approval of the technical objective of program 
development; 
  -- preparation of a draft program; 
  -- coordination of the program with affected organizations; 
  -- approval of the program. 
  One essential condition for effective program implementation 
is the creation of a clearly functioning organizational and 
economic mechanism for management of the environmental program 
which will be adequate to its goals and objectives and to the 
conditions of transition to market-based relations. 
  That mechanism must define: 
  -- the program's legal status; 
  -- the administrative body and administrative structure for 
program implementation; 
  -- methods of arranging physical and technical support 
(state 
orders, agreements, contracts, or leasing); 
  -- sources of and procedure for program measure funding; 
  -- procedure, methods, and schedules for monitoring of 
program implementation; 
  -- forms of economic and other incentives for program 
participants; 
  -- forms of economic and administrative liability on the 
part 
of program participants for failure to complete or for partial 
completion of program measures. 
  One specific feature of programs to reduce or prevent 
environmental pollution is that they set long-range limits on 
pollutant emissions and discharges and outline development 
scenarios that will ensure that the established limits are 
achieved. 
  The technical and economic justification for specific 
environmental protection measures should be provided during the 
process of preparing programs for the development of individual 
enterprises and industries, and programs for regional 
socioeconomic development, with consideration for actual 
financial balances. The degree of correlation between regional 
and industry programs and the environmental programs approved 
should be determined with the consent of environmental 
protection agencies or in the process of state environmental 
assessment, as provided for by legislation. 
  During implementation of this approach, consideration will 
be 
given to the environmental factor during development of all 
programs for the country's social and economic development. 
  Programmatic solutions to each priority issue, with 
consideration for their specific nature and scale, ambitious 
schedules for their resolution, and the need to focus resources 
in order to implement them, should make provision for economic 
support for implementation that will include designation of 
measures to be carried out using the federal, regional, and 
local budgets, as well as state nonbudgetary environmental funds 
at all levels. 
  Such measures include: 
  -- construction of interfarm land improvement systems, 
environmental protection facilities and hydraulic installations, 
land improvement, maintenance of land improvement systems in 
areas populated by small peoples and at labor-short farms in the 
non-Chernozem zone, Siberia, and the Far East; 
  -- research work of industry-wide significance; 
  -- efforts to radically improve lands in connection with 
increased soil fertility, including the study and preparation of 
planning and estimate documentation; 
  -- planning and survey work on the organization of land use; 
  -- forest protection and restoration measures; 
  -- hydrometeorological and environmental monitoring work; 
  -- topographical and geodesic work; 
  -- a program to ensure environmental safety; 
  -- state preserves; 
  -- construction of environmental protection facilities in 
preserves, as well as laboratories for the conducting of 
environmental monitoring; 
  -- construction of major interregional drinking water 
reservoirs, as well as other water management measures intended 
to improve the ecological condition of bodies of water.

  [Excerpts] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today 
called for more efforts to be directed towards soil conservation 
and protection of water catchment areas throughout the country. 
President Moi observed that water levels in many rivers have 
been reduced as a result of land degradation and destruction of 
water catchment areas. The president noted that unless water 
was conserved all forms of life would perish, and added that it 
was a responsibility of everyone to conserve the natural 
resources. 
  He noted that environmental protection should be uppermost 
in 
the development agenda, from the locational to the district 
level and urged forest officers to emphasize it. He also called 
on agricultural extension officers to teach farmers how to dig 
bench terraces where the land was steep. The president further 
noted the wealth of the community depended on natural resources 
and hence there was a need to protect it. President Moi was 
speaking at various places when he made an extensive tour of 
southern and central Baringo. [passage omitted] 
  Noting that the country was facing food shortages, the 
president advised Kenyans to exercise a spirit of being mindful 
of each other, whereby those who have should help the others. 
He at the same time assured wananchi [citizens] that the 
government will do its best to see that no one goes without 
food. [passage omitted]

Assembly of the Republic approved a resolution ratifying the 
Vienna Convention on the protection of the ozone layer and the 
Montreal Protocol on substances which destroy the ozone layer, 
as well as the respective London and Copenhagen amendments. The 
deputies did not debate the resolution since it dealt with a 
very technical issue. On the draft electoral law, the deputies 
set up a 10-man commission to redraft a motion which must be 
approved tomorrow before the approval of the electoral law. 
Tomorrow the deputies will also examine the law on [words

<F P=106> [Article by Paul Okunlola: "The Environment"] </F>
  [Text] Up to $12.5 million (N275 million) is to be spent 
over the next five years by the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) on the installation and adoption of 
environmentally sound strategies for managing danagerous toxic 
and hazardous wastes in Nigeria. 
  All the 30 states and Abuja, the Federal Capital, as well as 
seven Federal Ministries are to be involved in the 
implementation of the scheme, which is to commence next month. 
  The programme focused essentially on the development of an 
executive capacity for managing industrial pollution, which had 
been highlighted under Agenda 21, at the 1992 June summit of the 
United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 
(UNCED), as a major threat to the environment. 
  The principal sources of industrial pollution are petroleum 
and petro-chemical industries; manufacturing industries; and 
agricultural industries, particularly producers of pesticides. 
  Already, a two-member consultancy team has been rounding off 
preliminary work on the establishment of a programme outline 
that will involve the scope, priority areas and modalities for 
executing the programme. 
  The team comprised a New York-based environmental engineer, 
Mr Larry Quinn, who recently returned home, and a Nigerian 
specialist in pollution control and analytical chemistry, 
Professor Oladele Osibanjo. 
  The programme will, however, be executed and co-ordinated by 
the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA), with 
participation also being drawn from the Ministries of Petroleum 
Resources; Health and Human Resources; Industries; Water 
Resources and Agriculture; Mines, Power and Steel; and 
Transport, which should normally deal with marine pollution 
control. 
  "Right now, we do not have any marine pollution control. 
Ships dump anything on our shores and our oceans. We do not have 
the manpower, though, on paper, they have the responsibility," a 
source disclosed at the week-end. 
  Specifically, the programme will involve the training of a 
corps of pollution control managers in all the three tiers of 
government, who will monitor existing industries and prevent 
environmentally unfriedly industries from coming into the 
country. 
  Other aspects of the grant will comprise the supply of 
scientific and technological equipment towards equipping some of 
the ministries involved in the programme, training of the 
personnel to man them, and generation of some of the 
environmental data base required for the project. 
  The first two years will be used in training staff, but 
these 
people will now be used in generating data upon which future 
planning can be based. 
  Besides the staff development aspects of the consultancy 
schedule, the specialists were also expected to have drawn up a 
detailed outline of specific environmental control needs in the 
country. 
  Key areas of interest already highlighted for documentary 
review by the consultants are: Control of industrial pollution; 
management of agrochemicals; control of water pollution; 
promotion of environmentally sound technology; and monitoring 
and assessing of the environment and natural resources. 
  The programme itself is a fallout of on-going efforts by the 
Nigerian Government to establish a comprehensive environmental 
management support scheme, to be funded both nationally and by 
donor agencies. 
  Following the outcome of a 1991 multi-sectoral needs 
assessment exercise, the issue of environmental management had 
topped the list of identified problem areas requiring support 
services. 
  These had included development of a programme of natural 
resources, soil and biodiversity conservation; combating drought 
and desertification, and stimulation of urban and community 
development schemes.

  [Text] Jakarta, Kompas -- Australia, through its 
International Development Aid Bureau (AIDAB), has provided a 
6.1-million Australian dollar (8.3 billion rupiah) grant for 
planning and managing district rivers (DAS) in Noelmina, East 
Nusatenggara. A memorandum of understanding [three preceding 
words in English] was signed in Jakarta on 22 November by 
Forestry Minister Jamaludin Surjahadikusumo and Australian 
Ambassador to Indoensia Allan R. Taylor. 
  The Australian ambassador clarified that the effort was 
undertaken as part of the Australian community's responsibility 
in connection with environmental problems. The Australian 
Government believes that its cooperation with Indonesia will 
bring about mutual benefit. 
  Mr. Taylor admitted that this is the first time that 
Australia has participated in any of the forestry projects. 
Besides, East Nusatenggara is not a new region because prior to 
this Australia had participated in several other projects such 
as the Joint District Development project which concluded in 
March 1992. 
  The Noelmina DAS project was selected because the region is 
one of the 39 DAS projects which the Forestry Department 
considers the most prone to land erosion. 
  In his statement, Forestry Minister Jamaludin clarified that 
the government has five objectives to achieve in carrying out 
the DAS projects. The first is to maintain a balanced hydrology 
condition in an effort to minimize forest degradation, prevent 
land erosion, destruction of land, and floods. The second 
objective is to increase land productivity, while the third is 
to create more public awareness about the importance of forests, 
land, and water pollution. The government's fourth objective is 
to increase the central and provincial government's capability 
of managing natural resources. The fifth objective is to 
increase the local community's living standards.

  To the reader! 
  This directory includes information on 818 ecological 
organizations operating on the territory of the former USSR 
(there are explanatory articles on 551 of them and another 267 
are mentioned). The states which were part of the Union still 
have a great deal in common, among other things, a grave 
ecological situation. And there are common patterns which can be 
traced in the history of the "Green" organizations here. 
  The stages of the development of the ecology movement and 
the 
classification of Green organizations by several criteria are 
presented in an article by Aleksandr Shubin, historian and 
cochairman of the Russian Greens Party. This article is placed 
at the beginning of the directory. 
  Data on organizations are combined into two chapters: 
  1. Interrepublic organizations (operating on the territory 
of 
all or several former Union republics); 
  2. Republic and local organizations. 
  Within the chapters devoted to a particular republic they 
are 
placed in the following order: 

  -  republic organizations, 
  -  the capital's organizations 
  -  organizations in oblasts, krays, and republics which are part 
of the Federation (oblast organizations, organizations of the 
oblast center, and organizations of populated points). 

    The directory has alphabetical indexes of names, 
nongovernmental organizations mentioned (the pages where the 
explanatory article is found are set off in italics 
[not given in English translation]), mass information media, and 
populated points. 
  The data on organizations are presented in items of 
information which usually tell the organization's size, age, and 
social make-up, the history of its creation and activity, the 
sources of financing, mass information media (set off in 
italics [given in all capital letters in English 
translation]), and other things. Then the addresses and contact 
telephone numbers and a short bibliography (set off in 
italics [merely listed in English translation]) are 
indicated.

<H3>  A. SHUBIN: THE ECOLOGY MOVEMENT IN THE USSR AND THE 
COUNTRIES WHICH EMERGED FROM IT </H3>
  The ecology movement is a diverse and in many respects 
unique 
phenomenon which appeared in our countries in the second half of 
the 20th century. The lack of such a movement in the 
prerevolutionary history of Russia caused some serious 
differences between the domestic ecology movement and other 
social trends. Ecologists did not have a domestic tradition to 
which they could turn. The result of that was the initially slow 
rate of evolution of the ecology movement, the importance of 
Western experience for it, the lack of an independent positive 
ideal for a long time, and other things. 
  Just as in other industrial countries, the appearance of the 
ecology movement was caused by the crisis of the industrial 
system in a particular stage of its development. The attempt to 
implement the scientific-technical revolution by preserving the 
industrial structures of vertical management of production 
aggravated the ecological crisis, while the parallel development 
of social self-awareness and ordinary literacy in the natural 
sciences sphere made people willing to oppose the process of the 
destruction of the environment and man. 
  Industrial man, alienated from decision making, from 
information, and from nature itself, crowded in cities, and 
oppressed at the factory and at home, began to understand his 
position. He had become so complex that he could no longer 
fulfill his role of a specialized cog in the industrial machine 
on which industrial civilization is based. 
  Despite the universality of the causes of the appearance of 
the ecology movement in various countries of the world, its 
genesis in the USSR had its own particular features. Above all 
it occurred under conditions of a supermonopolized 
state-industrial system. The high degree of monopolization in 
all spheres of life determined the system's destructiveness in 
relation to nature and man. Police and political control over 
any kind of manifestation of public activism made it more 
difficult for the reaction to this destruction to develop. 
  At the same time, however, society's lack of influential 
social subjects independent of the party and state made its 
paternalistic function develop. The state attempted to protect 
its subjects from its own parts. As soon as the ecological 
problem began to be recognized by the official community (and 
that happened during the "thaw" of 1953-1964), "the party and 
the state" took some steps to increase control over certain 
violations of ecological standards (above all by private 
citizens). 
  Social activism which was directed against these violations 
but did not affect political aspects was also legalized. 
  Thus began the first INDUSTRIALIZED period of the 
ecology movement (approximately 1958-1982). During this period 
the movement was typically built into the structures of official 
public organizations like the All-Union Nature Protection 
Society (VOOP). But within the framework of these structures 
informal associations arose--Nature Protection Squads (DOP's). 
The first DOP's were formed in the early 1960s and in 1968-1972 
became a system which encompassed the entire country. This 
system was focused above all on the struggle against poaching 
and cautious, only within the framework of the law, restraint of 
the most flagrant manifestations of industrial expansion. 
  After the "thaw" was curtailed, the system of the nature 
protection movement became a refuge for the liberal-minded 
intelligentsia, above all youth, who in the DOP's and inspection 
offices of VOOP could find an opportunity to serve society 
outside state structures in relatively autonomous and not very 
bureaucratized groups, an opportunity which was very scarce at 
that time. Participation in DOP's and VOOP inspection offices by 
people with "unorthodox" views threatened the existence of these 
very organizations. This promoted the formulation of a unique 
ethical principle which excluded the political orientation of a 
nature protection group. "Our business is ecology." 
  The romance of the DOP's contrasted with the "orderliness" 
of 
"developed socialism" and provided an opportunity to temporarily 
escape the all-encompassing industrial system. At the same time, 
however, the state was able to channel this social activism in 
the direction it needed. Nevertheless, accumulated experience 
with the institutionalized nature protection movement allowed 
people to gradually come to the conclusion that large-scale 
ecological problems could not be solved within the framework of 
the official structures. 
  The rapid buildup of ecological problems in the second half 
of the 1970s and early 1980s also promoted this awareness. The 
attempt to deal with this wave of violations, which were the 
result of objective economic and social causes and the "sins of 
the system," led to an increasing number of confrontations 
between the nature protection movement and the system's 
influential links--beginning with bureaucratic poachers and 
ending with the ministries which joined the initiative to 
"reverse the flow of the northern rivers." Ecologists were made 
to understand that they were interfering in what was not their 
business. The crisis of the movement brought a new stage of the 
movement into being--the PETITION stage 
(approximately 1982-1989). 
  This stage was characterized by the greater independence and 
larger scale of the ecology movement. It still remained a nature 
protection movement and appealed primarily to the authorities, 
intending to change their particular decisions and at the same 
time not change the system. But the ecology movements and groups 
independently selected the object of the attack without taking 
into account the elite's position and resorted to mass 
mobilization means--they called on the population and proposed 
that they support the appeal to the authorities. 
  During this period the movement acquired a primarily 
negativistic orientation. Ecologists spoke out against the most 
destructive installations and projects, hoping to restrain 
industrial expansion and localize its harmful consequences. Such 
a strategy in the ecological organizations united people of the 
most diverse views, from conservative-ethnocratic to anarchist. 
  The first mass campaign of this stage ended in success. In 
1986 the "river reversal" project, which had originally been 
supported by the country's highest leadership (including the 
"architects of perestroyka"), was canceled, although the former 
system of water management was preserved and the problems of 
water supply which "reversing the rivers" was supposed to 
resolve continued to worsen. 
  The position of the country's leaders in relation to the 
growing ecology movement in this stage was relatively favorable. 
The protest of the citizens driven to desperation was directed 
against the local bureaucratic leadership and fit the strategy 
of "pressure from below" which was supposed to make the local 
clans more conciliatory toward the "perestroyka leadership." The 
"fathers of perestroyka" appealed to the public; they needed a 
powerful public movement, but one which would not encroach upon 
the foundations of the system, that is on the highest 
leadership's authority. 
  The original "apolitical nature" of the movement and the 
"patriotic" conservatism (which later took on an anticommunist 
slant) of many of its leaders from the writers' milieu, the 
concentration on particular objects, and the lack of a 
constructive program seemed to guarantee that the process was 
under control. 
  However, it became explosive. The years 1987-1989 were the 
most productive from the standpoint of the number of movements 
which arose and the scale of demonstrations. The need to 
coordinate efforts in the petition and rally campaigns brought 
broad associations of ecological organizations and movements to 
life. In 1987-1988 the Social-Ecological Alliance (SoES) 
emerged. In 1989 the even broader Greens Movement emerged. About 
a million people participated in the campaign against the 
construction of the Volga-Chogray Canal. 
  The successes of the ecological protest directed toward the 
elite were marked. Dozens of harmful enterprises were shut down 
and projects for reversing water resources and power engineering 
giants (the Katun GES, for example) were buried. But given the 
preservation of the former economic system, this promoted 
greater paralysis of the economy, which in itself was caused by 
other things. 
  These processes promoted greater opposition by the regime to 
the ecology movement. This could not fail to cause the 
politicization of the ecological masses, and that was extremely 
dangerous to the CPSU, which was losing equilibrium. The 
continued concessions threatened the superindustrial economic 
system with permanent paralysis. At the same time, however, the 
ecological crisis continued to expand despite the localized 
successes of the Greens, since it was caused by deeper reasons 
than ill will or the stupidity of particular functionaries. 
  This stalemate meant a crisis not only of government policy 
in the field of ecology, but also a crisis of the ecology 
movement itself. The negativism of its demands during this 
period was unpromising--the problems built up faster than 
enterprises could be closed. But even the closing of enterprises 
did not yet resolve the problems. The ecology movement needed a 
constructive alternative and a positive ideal which could 
suggest a solution to the problem in principle. The need for 
this alternative program was also dictated by criticism of the 
ecology movement for its negativism. 
  Naturally, from the very start the ecology movements had 
formulated alternative programs capable of offering solutions to 
local ecological crises. But these alternatives were primarily 
technical. Their great complexity as compared to simple but 
ecologically harmful projects and decisions of state organs and 
the requirement of additional expenditures prevented the 
implementation of the ecological projects. 
  The joint struggle against these phenomena and the 
accumulated experience and information already in this period 
promoted specialization of the movements and formulation of 
comprehensive alternative technical projects (projects of the 
six sections of VOOP, and the power engineering project of 
Novosibirsk "Pamyat"). But all these projects also remained 
unrealized when they ran up against the sociopolitical 
structures of industrial-bureaucratic society. 
  The de-ideologization of the ecology movement more and more 
became an anachronism. In 1989 it provoked more and more serious 
conflicts. The acceptance of Novosibirsk "Pamyat" into SoES 
caused a multitude of protests by its members despite the lack 
of "ecological" claims against this organization. The attempt to 
reconcile the entire political spectrum from "patriots" to 
anarchists within the framework of the ecology movement proved 
increasingly hopeless. A new stage of the ecology movement began. 
  This stage can be called POPULIST (1989-1991). Its 
first symptoms were revealed during the 1989 election campaign 
when the ecology movement supported candidates who advanced 
ecological slogans. 
  The politicization of the ecology movement and the move by 
most ecological organizations to open opposition to the CPSU by 
1990 required the promotion of a political idea which would not 
split the unity of the activists who were assembled in them. 
This idea was found most quickly in the "Union republics." Here 
the idea of protecting the environment and the cultural legacy 
was quickly combined with the idea of national resurrection and 
then, independence. The accelerated onset of the populist stage 
in republics striving for independence (the Baltic republics, 
Georgia, and in part, Armenia) starting in 1988 accounted for 
this. A coincidence of factors of the petition and populist 
periods as well as the geographic compactness of the territory 
resulted in a sharp increase in the size of the ecology 
movements in these republics and their rapid integration into 
unified systems, and later the recognition of their independent 
social interests. 
  Such processes also occurred in the Ukraine, where they 
initially were not so clearly expressed. But even here the 
Chernobyl Catastrophe stimulated an upsurge and rapid 
politicization of the ecology movement. 
  But in Russia the national factor, which promoted the 
upsurge 
of the ecology movement in 1982-1986, did not play a significant 
role in most organizations after this. For various reasons the 
mass consciousness of the politically active strata of the 
population rejected chauvinist and near-chauvinist ideas. The 
"guilt complex" of a large people reinforced by most of the 
intelligentsia made the abstract-democratic idea foremost. 
  A large part of the ecology movement accepted this idea 
after 
the general democratic political movement moved to open 
opposition to the regime. The relatively slow formation of the 
ecology movement's sociopolitical posture allowed general 
democratic groups to take over as leaders of the ecologists and 
integrate the ecologist activists into their own make-up. 
  The idea that Western forms of civilization would provide 
full salvation, which dominated in the consciousness of the 
socially active population, infatuated the ecology movement too 
during this period. The example of the Western countries which 
had "dealt with" ecological problems "in their own homes" seemed 
convincing proof of the ecological effectiveness of private 
property and parliamentary democracy. 
  The concern of the leaders of "Democratic Russia" about 
expanding the electoral base promoted the inclusion of 
abstractly formulated ecological demands and promises to help 
shut down the most dangerous installations in election programs 
of the "democratic" candidates. As a result most ecology 
movements supported the "Democratic Russia" candidates in 
elections and identified hopes for solving ecological problems 
with their victory and the defeat of the CPSU. 
  Only a minority of ecology groups abstained in 1990 from 
supporting the election campaign of the "democrats," but for 
various reasons. A certain number of the groups were inclined to 
support the "patriots." Also preserved was the fundamentally 
apolitical tendency, which during this period largely coincided 
with the "democratic" orientation: politics for politicians and 
ecology for ecologists. 
  But deep within the populist ecological movement with its 
orientation to support "prestigious political leaders" new 
trends were maturing, trends which were an alternative to 
populism and inclined to formulate an independent sociopolitical 
posture, an alternative both to the Western and to the 
communist-"patriotic" orientation. This relatively new 
phenomenon in the ecology movement was related to the movement 
to create a Greens party. 
  The appearance of groups which warned that hopes placed on 
liberals who had come out of the CPSU were false and which 
proposed a philosophy of seeking an alternative to the 
contemporary industrial society presaged a new crisis in the 
ecology movement. This crisis did not delay in bursting out 
after the "democrats" came to power in several cities and on the 
parliamentary level in Russia. The mass move of the nomenklatura 
to democratic banners and the "decommunization" of the CPSU put 
the question of changing to freer forms of the market and 
Western political forms on the agenda. The "democrats" came to 
power and had to begin paying debts, including ecological debts. 
  But the ecologists suddenly encountered processes which were 
directly opposite their expectations. In 1990-1991 the 
"democratic" administrations fundamentally revised their 
attitude toward ecological problems. One of the clearest 
examples was the refusal of the Moscow leadership to freeze 
construction of the Northern TETs [Central Heat and Power 
Plant]. The economic troubles which had broken out during this 
period made it possible to set a new theoretical base under this 
policy. The mass information media tried to convince the 
population that ecological problems should be solved after 
economic ones. 
  This same idea was the basis of the "500 days" program 
supported by the majority of the democratic camp. A large number 
of the newly elected deputies set former ecological demands 
aside. The Western orientation of foreign policy and economic 
ties more and more clearly marked the prospects for turning the 
country into an importer of industrial and radioactive wastes. 
The new economic relations did not lessen but on the contrary 
intensified the plundering of natural resources and violation of 
ecological standards. 
  The rapid change in the position of the "democratic" leaders 
on the question of ecology had a demoralizing effect on the 
ecology movement. Some of the movement's activists convinced 
themselves that the arguments of the opponents of ecological 
priorities were right. Without an independent constructive 
program, they continued to follow former political leaders. Some 
ecologists were profoundly disappointed in the results of their 
social activity and drew the conclusion that it was hopeless to 
oppose industrial expansion. Some were poorly informed of the 
changes which had occurred and continued to trust in "victorious 
democracy." 
  All these factors caused a marked decline in the ecology 
movement, the collapse of many organizations, and a decrease in 
the numbers of members remaining. 
  At the same time, however, the unfolding of ecological 
disaster together with the "democratic" camp's more and more 
obvious responsibility for it helped gradually increase the 
influence in the ecology movement of organizations oriented 
toward an alternative social program. Theories of anarchism 
began to acquire a great deal of influence in the ecological 
milieu (the active participation of anarchists in ecological 
work promoted this). 
  But the emergence of an alternative movement in the populist 
period was painful, running up against both the old traditions 
formed in the ecology movement and "growing pains." 
  The movement in support of creating a Greens Party emerged 
in 
December 1988 (it had existed under this name since 1989), but 
the party itself was proclaimed only in March 1990. The 
development of the party in 1990-1991 was accompanied by splits, 
the collapse and emergence of organizations, and the lack of 
workable interregional structures. Most ecology activists 
shunned the party Greens and their ideology, suspecting the 
"alternative advocates" of a desire to subordinate the movement 
to themselves on the one hand and to split the "democratic camp" 
on the other. 
  At the same time, however, the search for an alternative 
ideology was fraught with internal clashes related to the 
ideological differences of the authors of the different theories 
of ecological policy. 
  The situation changed in 1992, which signaled a new period 
in 
the development of the ecology movement. This period may be 
called the ALTERNATIVE. The reforms of 1992 and the 
absence of the "eternal culprit" in the form of the CPSU finally 
helped overcome the "political inferiority complex." The 
conference of ecological organizations in St. Petersburg 
dedicated to the intergovernment conference on the environment 
and development showed the ability of the most diverse ecology 
movements, both party and nonparty movements, to form an 
independent public posture. 
  Those groups which survived the crisis of 1991 acquired 
experience in public activity and formulation of constructive 
programs. Despite all the disagreements, an understanding became 
established that local problems are subordinate to global ones 
and comprehensive reforms whose principles are based on 
ecological priorities must be carried out. 
  Most of the groups which survived until 1992 also found 
their 
own "ecological niche" in society and a commercial and political 
base. All this created the prerequisites for a new upsurge in 
the ecology movement in 1992. Although this upsurge does not 
promise such quantitative growth in ecology movements as in 
1988-1989, the influence of the Greens on social processes in 
1992-1993 may prove to be more substantial than before. 
  Despite these new phenomena in the milieu of the ecology 
movement, the scope of change must not be exaggerated. 
Development is occurring unevenly. 
  The history of the development of the ecology movement 
determined the extreme diversity of its forms. In order to 
simplify the orientation in its structure we will propose 
certain principles of classification of ecological organizations. 
  Ecological organizations may be classified based on 
different 
features. Above all these are: geography of activity, number of 
members, link with governmental organizations, work areas, 
organizational structure and self-identification, work areas 
[sic], methods of work, and ideology. 
  The geographic distribution of ecological organizations is 
uneven. Concentration of ecology groups in zones with bad 
ecological situations is natural. But for ecological 
organizations to appear, an alarming ecological situation is not 
yet sufficient (strictly speaking, even the controversial Soviet 
ecological standards are violated practically everywhere). A 
certain level of political sophistication and an absence of 
authorities who destroy the organization of opposition are 
needed. 
  As a result the largest number of ecology movements and most 
widely-branching systems took shape in the Baltic republics, 
Ukraine, Armenia, Georgia, a number of oblasts of Russia 
(Chelyabinsk, Tomsk, and Nezhegorodskiy, for example), and some 
metropolitan areas (St. Petersburg, Moscow, Nizhniy Novgorod, 
Novosibirsk, and others). Small ecology groups exist in each 
oblast, but the degree of their influence and activism is 
different. The "ecology map" looked different in different 
periods. 
  By geographic range of activity, organizations may be 
divided 
into localized ones (tied to a particular naturally occurring or 
industrial object whose significance does not require the 
cooperation of ecology movements on the scale of the populated 
point), territorial ones (rural, rayon, city, oblast, regional, 
interregional, republic, all-Union, and international), and 
specialized ones. Specialization is linked to the struggle 
against a common enemy, a common ideology, or party affiliation. 
  The number of organizations which exist in a region may 
reflect not only the strength but also the weakness of a 
movement and its fragmentation. The formal size of a movement is 
also a disputable factor for evaluating the scale of the 
movement (it depends on the structure of the organization and 
frequently does not promote effective activity). By size 
organizations may be divided into microgroups (a few people), 
small (up to 30 people), medium-sized (up to 100 people), large 
(up to 1,000 people), and mass organizations. Despite the 
arbitrary nature of this gradation, the formal nature of size in 
the ecology movement and the large gap in the total numbers and 
the real aktiv must also be taken into account. 
  An organization's impact cannot always be determined by 
participation in organs of power either (many organizations have 
deliberately declined to nominate their candidates in 
elections). It is also risky to judge an organization's might by 
its financial resources--a great deal of capital may attest to 
the organization's dependence on industrial "sponsors." 
  Various approaches to the problem of financing an 
organization sometimes cause friction among different 
organizations. Usually ecology organizations treat the very idea 
of commercial support of ecological activity positively, but 
they are very scrupulous on the question of links between this 
financing and production facilities which harm the environment 
and man. The popularity in the ecological milieu of the idea of 
creating their own ecologically harmless production facilities 
and even whole settlements is also tied to this. Organizations 
dependent on state-economic organs usually arouse suspicion in 
the ecological milieu too. 
  An organization's effectiveness is determined above all by 
performance of those tasks which it sets for itself. In the 
ecology movement "small causes" and the formulation of global 
social projects are equally valuable from the standpoint of 
internal division of labor in the milieu of ecology activists. 
While in the first stages the greatest respect in the ecology 
movement went to organizations with large numbers of members 
which were able to shut down enterprises, later the "weight" of 
politically influential organizations grew. After the size of 
the ecology movement declined, the activism of members and their 
organizational and propagandist talents became especially 
important. 
  An organization's work areas depend on the region's problems 
and the ideology of the group's leaders, and the presence in 
that group of specialists on the particular problem. Among the 
work areas typical of the ecology movement we should single out 
the struggle to shut down harmful production facilities and to 
participate in cleaning up the consequences of environmental 
pollution, expert research work and monitoring of the state of 
the environment, protection of the cultural legacy and the 
restoration or support of the existence of ecological and 
cultural monuments, theoretical work, political work, and 
participation in the work of organs of power. 
  The various work areas also presuppose various methods: 
voluntary ecology work days, expert studies, street parades, 
agitation in the mass information media, petition campaigns, 
production of publications and leaflets, debates, seminars, and 
conferences, picketing of installations, and even "ecological 
terrorism," that is to say, violent actions against destroyers 
of the environment. Naturally the last method does not enjoy 
great popularity, although it has certain admirers, in the 
Rainbow Keepers organization for example. 
  Some organizations specialize in a small set of methods, but 
most prefer to vary them broadly. Typical of the ecology 
movement are two directly opposite trends of development--from 
the lack of specialization and work in all areas to 
concentration of efforts on a narrow group of problems, and the 
opposite--from specialization to global approaches to ecological 
problems. 
  Naturally the specialization and globalism of the later 
period for the most part differs qualitatively from similar 
phenomena of earlier origin. And specialized and "universal" 
groups which have gone through a long evolution are usually 
distinguished by much greater constructiveness than groups which 
have appeared recently. 
  The transfer of the experience of old groups to new ones is 
also possible, of course. This is accompanied by the passage of 
activists who have experience in public (not necessarily 
ecological) activity to the new group. 
  The problem of the transfer and accumulation of experience 
in 
the ecology movement is closely related to the processes of 
development of various ideological trends in it. A certain 
number of ecological organizations are oriented to comprehensive 
philosophical systems (Christianity, Rerikh's teachings, and 
original theories), but in most of them the sharing of views is 
not so comprehensive. 
  As was already said, predominating until 1991 were 
deliberate 
de-ideologization (initially, before the 1989 elections even 
external apoliticality), populism (abstractness of unifying 
slogans), and general democratic views whose sense consisted in 
a Western orientation of consciousness and selection of 
"democratic" symbols like "multiparty system," "parliament," and 
"market." 
  Despite the prevalence of these directions, already in 
1988-1989 virtually the entire ideological palette of the 
ecology movement had been formed. 
  "Patriotically" oriented groups evolved toward the idea of 
ethnocracy--the need to establish political privileges for the 
"native" nationality. Ethnocratic groups are operating in the 
ecology movement of St. Petersburg, Krasnoyarsk, and 
Novosibirsk. In 1992 the advocates of ethnocratic views made an 
unsuccessful attempt to extend their influence to the Russian 
Greens Party. The sharply negative reaction of the party to the 
attempt to organize a "patriotic" faction in its make-up showed 
that even in a moderate version "patriotic" ideas are vigorously 
rejected in the ecological milieu. 
  Conservative ideology which sometimes characterizes itself 
as 
patriotic (in the original meaning of this word) is more 
widespread. Despite the fact that the holders of these views are 
not organized within the framework of the ecology movement, they 
are fairly large in number. A conservative orientation of 
thinking corresponds to the ecology movement's orientation to 
protect the natural and cultural environment. 
  Liberal-democratic and social-democratic views remain the 
most widespread political ideology in the ecology movement. A 
legacy to the movement from previous development, democratic 
ideology is supplemented in the ecological milieu with greater 
attention to ecology and social protection. 
  Liberal-democratic ideology predominates in the Democratic 
Party of Greens of Chelyabinsk Oblast--the largest of the Greens 
parties. Democratic views of various hues predominate in the 
mass of members of other Greens parties too. 
  Respectable ecology movements and Greens parties of the West 
which fight to protect the environment without questioning the 
foundations of Western society are the usual model for the 
democratic ecologists to imitate. At the same time, however, the 
costs of Westernization in countries which were part of the USSR 
promote an evolution of the bearers of democratic ideology 
toward socialist, anarchist, and conservative views. But this 
process has just begun. 
  The weaknesses of the "democrats'" policies promote the 
support of state-socialist (communist) views in the ecological 
milieu too. But the CPSU's responsibility for the destruction of 
the environment in the recent past makes the state socialism of 
certain ecologists more of a dying phenomenon. 
  Different directions of nonstate socialism and anarchism are 
becoming much more popular among ecologists. The rejection of 
the state as a mechanism for solving social problems by these 
trends is in keeping with ecological criticism of the 
destruction of the environment by the departments. This initial 
area for cooperation becomes, upon further examination, 
supplemented by deeper correspondences. Both the Greens and the 
anarchists favor the priority of local interests over statewide 
ones. Preservation of the environment from outside expansion is 
the task of ecologists which incites them against the state's 
centralized bureaucracy. 
  A consistent ecological approach also presupposes rejection 
of the industrial organization of production--the main source of 
industrial expansion against the natural environment. As a 
constructive antithesis to the industrial system based on total 
control, anarchism suggests self-government and decentralization 
of the economy, including technological decentralization. This 
in turn is in keeping with the preference which ecologists give 
to small-scale production rather than industrial giants. 
  The participation of anarchists in the ecology movement, 
from 
the moment anarchist organizations were restored in the USSR, 
from the beginning promoted alliance relations between them and 
ecologists and then the interpenetration of anarchist and 
ecological organizations as the latter were politicized. 
  The diversity of anarchist organizations from left-socialist 
to anarchist-communist and the complicated relations with them 
were also reflected in the development of the politicized 
ecology movement. The conflicts of the syndicalists and 
communists in anarchism were especially noticeable during the 
formation of the Greens Party, which as a result split into the 
Russian Greens Party [RPG] in which the supporters of market 
relations--the syndicalist anarchists (communal 
socialists)--have great influence, and the Greens Parties League 
[LZP], whose initiators belonged to the ecosocialist 
(communist-anarchist) trend, which opposes market mechanisms. 
  Of course, the conflicts between the anarchists were not the 
only but merely one of the reasons for the split in the Greens 
Party, which had appeared "before its time," in the populist 
period. But the participation of politicized groups which had 
already undergone lengthy political evolution and gained the 
corresponding experience in events related to the split helped 
accelerate the political "evolution into manhood" of the ecology 
movement, which relatively quickly passed through the inevitable 
period of internal ideological conflict. Splits occurred in the 
milieu of the Greens parties earlier and less painfully than 
could have been expected in the event of autarkic development of 
the politicized ecology movement. As a result the politicized 
ecology movement was able to overcome the most acute internal 
conflict before the alternativist stage involving the mass 
politicization of ecologists began. It is significant that it 
was precisely the anarchists, who clashed among themselves in 
1991, who helped normalize relations between the RPZ and the LZP. 
  The very fact of a demarcation into different organizations 
helped reduce the internal tension which existed in the general 
but amorphous organization. The distribution of ecological 
organizations across the political spectrum and the quantitative 
predominance of general democratic cadres help consolidate 
efforts of politicized ecologists into the struggle against 
common enemies. Only in relation to ethnocratic organizations do 
most ecology organizations continue to be split. 
  An organization's ideology and the time when it emerged 
determine the structural composition. Initially, as a rule, 
amorphous groups and traditionally democratic organizations with 
an elected leadership and broad rights for rank and file members 
emerged. 
  The coordinating council, whose members made up the real 
aktiv who were involved in constant work, was the usual form of 
the management organs in democratic organizations. The rest of 
the members were enlisted for actions and assisted in certain 
work areas. Expenditures of personal time of rank and file 
members were less than that of leaders, but also caused an 
impact on the adoption of decisions. Internal specialization or 
notions of the need for this arouse a desire to support a 
sectional structure of organizations which from time to time 
dissolves into the common mass of members and then is 
periodically revived. 
  Despite the fact that this democratic form remains 
predominant, others also exist. Some organizations were able to 
preserve an amorphous structure--no management organs and only 
general coordination of work, support of regular exchange of 
information, and joint actions of those who want to join with 
it. The largest ecological organization of the former USSR, the 
Social-Ecological Alliance, has close to an amorphous structure. 
  There are centralized organizations which are grouped around 
one leader and maintain a higher level of discipline than other 
organizations. These organizations are not numerous. 
  Associations of ecological organizations keep to democratic 
(usually understood as federative), confederative, and amorphous 
structures. A confederation (a free association of subjects with 
minimal powers in the coordinating organs) is the most typical, 
but there is no strict line between these structural forms. 
Thus, for example, the Moscow Ecological Federation in reality 
is a typical confederation. As a rule interregional 
organizations with a freer structure are more viable. 
  The organizational self-identification of organizations is 
weakly related to their real structure. As a rule it depends on 
the organization's ideology, the conditions of its emergence and 
registration, and the traditions and conditions of the 
movement's development in a particular stage. Ecological 
organizations call themselves groups, parties, committees, 
sections, patrols, associations ["obyedineniye" and 
"assotsiatisiya"], alliances, federations, confederations, and 
so forth. The "ecologists' trade union" and "ecological 
international" also exist. But it is very risky to judge an 
organization by its name. 
  During the period of its existence, the ecology movement has 
undergone a noticeable evolution both from the standpoint of 
internal structure and from the standpoint of its position in 
society. Starting from the role of public assistant of state 
organs and at the same time of the lower classes in which 
opposition sentiments had matured, the ecology movement later 
became one of the levers used to overthrow the existing form of 
autocracy. 
  In trying to limit the destructive aspects of the industrial 
system, ecologists helped paralyze this system, because it 
cannot but be destructive. For this reason the "victory of 
democratic forces" was accompanied by paralysis of the ecology 
movement--industrial society, after replacing the red flags with 
the tricolored ones, did not change its quantitative 
characteristics and therefore did not have a response to the 
ecological "challenge." 
  For this reason the prospects of development of the ecology 
movement seem large in scale. It will apparently grow right up 
to the stabilization of the sociopolitical system and, if the 
new regime does not violently smash the structure of the 
ecological organizations, the movement will occupy its niche in 
the new social system. This may be both parliamentary opposition 
(in a number of cases--the regime's ally in conducting certain 
aspects of its policy) and a nonparliamentary movement oriented 
to pressure the establishment in order to check the development 
of ecological catastrophe. 
  In the event of the rout of the existing ecological 
organizations with the stabilization of the regime, the latter 
will all the same try to isolate or create loyal ecological 
structures which can fulfill functions close to those which the 
ecology movement performed in the 1970s. But in that case the 
accumulated experience of constructive work will be lost and 
radical-extremist trends will intensify in the illegal ecology 
movement. 
  In any case the peak of the ecology movement is still ahead. 
Processes of destruction of man's environment continue to 
develop at a rapid rate. The crest of the ecology movement which 
will evidently come at the end of the millennium may take on the 
most diverse forms, from a movement of civic initiatives to 
ecofascism and spontaneous destructive riots. Which of these 
forms is chosen depends not only on today's theoretical and 
practical searching by ecology movement activists but also on 
the form of society which sooner or later will replace the 
industrial society. 
  The crisis of industrial society which is manifested above 
all in the ecology crisis may be resolved through global 
catastrophe able to thrust civilization way back or even put an 
end to humankind, or through the qualitative transformation of 
society while preserving those achievements of civilization 
which do not result in the destruction of man's habitat. 
  This choice in turn depends on the ecology movement. At the 
same time, however, social strata interested in overcoming man's 
alienation from the adoption of decisions affecting him and his 
habitat are already being formed. The gradual surmounting of 
strict class division into those who govern and those who are 
governed, the development in society of principles of 
self-government and autonomy of economic and social subjects, 
the growth in the cultural level of broad strata of the 
population, the development of means of communication and 
flexible and energy-saving technologies, affirmation in social 
consciousness of the principles of civil rights and social 
stability, and recognition of the importance of global 
problems--all these at-first-glance heterogeneous circumstances 
help form a social stratum able to become the foundation of a 
new, already post-industrial society based on the predominance 
of a civil society over the state. Consequently the stratum 
itself may be called civil. 
  Representatives of this stratum combine in one body the 
functions of the intellectual, the direct producer of output, 
and their own manager, recalling the "small bourgeoisie" in 
traditional Marxist terminology. The adherence of this stratum 
to small production forms, the production of information, and 
frugality, including in relation to resources, is in contrast to 
the civilian class of industrial civilization and makes this 
stratum the potential base of the ecology movement. Recognition 
of this idea is a most important factor which determines the 
extent of the costs to overcome industrial civilization and the 
destructive ecological crisis. 
<H5>  INTERREPUBLIC ORGANIZATIONS </H5>
<H3>  Association of Anarchist Movements ["Assotsiaysiya dvizheniy 
anarkhistov" (ADA)] </H3>
  The association operates on the territory of the former 
USSR. 
Appeared in May-November 1990 during the withdrawal of some 
nonsyndicalist anarchists from the Confederation of 
Anarcho-Syndicalists. Has no coordinating organs and interaction 
is carried out through an information network and joint actions. 
  Participated in the blockade of the Balakovo AES in 
June-July 
1990 and in picketing the Gorkiy AEST [atomic heat and power 
plant] in May 1991. Certain activists of the Greens Parties 
League are members of the ADA. 
  In July 1991 in the industrial zone of the city of 
Zaporozhye 
organized an ecology protest tent camp. The action was conducted 
jointly with representatives of the Rainbow Keepers (Saratov), 
the Greens Parties League (participants in the League from 
Nizhniy Novgorod [including S. Fomichev], Kiev, and other 
places), the Association of Saratov Anarchists, the 
Revolutionary Anarchists Initiative (Moscow), anarchists and 
pacifists from Zaporozhye; a representative of the Confederation 
of Anarcho-Syndicalists and the Confederation of Independent 
Trade Unions, Dmitriy Dundich, participated. In all 19-20 
people. Seven of them were students from Nizhniy Novgorod, 
Kharkov, Kazan, and Kiev. 
  The camp's participants appealed to managers of enterprises, 
to the city soviet, and to the press. City residents' attitude 
toward the camp was at first indifferent. 
  On 19 July, the day before Metallurgists Day, eight 
representatives of the ecology protest camp, having notified the 
press in advance, climbed up the 200-meter smokestack of the 
coke shop of the Zaporozhye Coke and Chemical Plant and 
announced that they would not come down until their demands were 
met: 

  -  to stop the processing of imported coal tar; 
  -  to ensure 
that existing decontamination structures operated perfectly and 
to stop the work of production facilities without 
decontamination structures, providing workers with compensation 
for the forced inactivity; 
  -  to offer representatives of the 
public the opportunity to monitor the plant's operations 
unobstructed and to obtain reliable information at the 
enterprise. 

    On 22 July the chairman of the city soviet, Yu. Bochkarev, 
held a meeting with camp representatives and Deputy M. 
Chernysheva, who supported the pickets' demands. During the 
meeting a support rally was held in front of the city soviet 
building. A reconciliation commission made up of representatives 
of industry, deputies, and representatives of the protest camp 
was created. (Even before the camp the city soviet deputies had 
decided to shut down the processing of coal tar in the 
tar-distilling shop.) 
  On 30 July the pickets left the stack. 
  On 5 August two rallies were held in Zaporozhye: a 
sanctioned 
rally (1,000 people) and an unsanctioned one (2,000 people). 
There it become known that the plant was continuing production 
while the pickets had left the stack earlier, believing the 
promise that their demands would be met. 
  On 6 August the pickets blocked the plant administration 
with 
a demand to fulfill the oblast nature committee's decision. The 
plant administration expelled them by calling OMON. The pickets 
were taken to the police station. The rayon procurator announced 
that criminal proceedings were being instituted against them. 
Eight members of the ecology camp (of those who remained free) 
declared a hunger strike demanding that those arrested be freed 
and that the demands be carried out. The city's population 
stopped the militsia's attempts to expel the hunger strikers 
from the square. In the evening of that same day all those 
detained were freed. 
  On 7 and 8 August the hunger strike on the square continued. 
  On 9 August the decree of the oblast nature committee was 
fulfilled--the tar-distilling shop stopped processing imported 
tar. 
  On 10 August a notice from the procurator's office arrived: 
for lack of elements of a crime criminal proceedings would not 
be instituted against the pickets. The camp's hunger strike was 
terminated. 
  On 12 August a rally of city residents proposed to make the 
pickets Honorary Citizens of Zaporozhye. 
  On 17 August an ecological mourning march was conducted 
within the framework of the Red Rue festival. A Central 
Television program filmed the march and the film was later 
stolen from the reporter on the train. 
  Under the influence of the action in Zaporozhye, an informal 
ecology organization called the "Clean Air Committee" emerged.

<H5>    Greenpeace ["Grinpis"] </H5>

  The Soviet division was founded in June 1989 under the 
international foundation "For the Survival and Development of 
Humankind." It has a structure and carries on activity 
characteristic of Greenpeace, that is to say, in fact it is the 
Greenpeace regional organization. 
  The chairman of the Soviet division in 1989-1991 was 
Academician A. Yablokov and members of the board of directors 
included S. Zalygin, R. Sagdeyev, A. Chilingarov, and Ye. 
Velikhov. 
  In 1991 the Greenpeace leadership was completely replaced 
and 
the role of foreign Greenpeace organizations in the management 
of the Russian organization was increased. At this time there 
exists a board of directors consisting of five people, among 
whom are the chairman of the Greenpeace International [GI] board 
of directors, Matti Vuori, and the director of the Russian 
Greenpeace office, Aleksandr Knorre. 
  In 1990 the Soviet division was working on two programs: 
"Ladoga" and "Western Siberia." The latter proposed to intervene 
in construction of gigantic joint-venture oil and gas chemical 
complexes in Tyumen Oblast. The coordinator of the "Western 
Siberia" ecoprogram is Vladimir Zamoyskiy. 
  At the present time Greenpeace of Russia projects

with GI) oppose paper and pulp industry wastes and support 
nuclear-free seas, energy conservation and alternative sources 
of energy, and other things. 
  The execution of ecological programs requires cooperation 
with local Greens associations, representatives of the press, 
and state functionaries. Within the framework of the programs, 
information is gathered on enterprises and public opinion and on 
who is involved in the construction of a joint venture. 
Greenpeace publishes the information gathered. The making of 
videofilms is planned.

<H5>    Nature Protection Squads Movement ["Dvizheniye druzhin po </H5>

okhrane prirody"] (DOP Movement) 
  An "alliance of public non-professional volunteer 
organizations and associations of youth" (by-laws of the DOP 
Movement). It operates on the territory of the USSR. 
  In mid-1991 there were 156 squads operating in the USSR, 
which included roughly 5,000 people; for the most part they are 
students and in addition a small group of VUZ graduates and 
secondary school students. 
  The movement's goal, according to the by-laws, is "the 
resolution of pressing problems of protection of nature and the 
environment and education based on practical nature protection 
activity by field specialists able to solve these problems." No 
political goals are pursued. 
  "Concrete practical nature protection activity is the most 
important thing for the movement's participants. For the 
movement the conversion of this work into a fashionable hobby or 
political bait is intolerable." (From the "DOP Movement 
Manifesto.") 
  The basic areas of activity of the DOP Movement include the 
following: identification, planning, and organization of 
protectable natural areas, protection of preserves and spawning 
grounds of cartiloginous fish, the fight against poaching, land 
planning, protection of small rivers, the fight against 
industrial and agricultural pollution, and ecological propaganda. 
  The DOP Movement's activity is noncommercial in nature and 
the basic source of funding is voluntary donations. 
  Membership in the DOP Movement is collective. The following 
demands are made on the particular squads in addition to local 
nature protection work; complete self-government, voluntary 
selection of work areas and independent planning of the work, 
constant contact with other DOP's, and participation in 
intersquad programs and actions. 
  Members are accepted in the DOP Movement at movement 
conferences (including regional ones, but with the participation 
of at least 12 members of the movement) by an absolute majority 
vote. Given compliance with the same conditions an organization 
may be expelled from the movement. Organizations which wish to 
be members of the movement are registered as candidates for 
membership in the movement the moment the application is 
submitted to the secretariat of the DOP council. 
  The highest body of the DOP Movement is the all-Union 
(interrepublic) conference convened by the movement council in 
accordance with the decisions of the previous conference or on 
demand of at least one-third the movement's members, but at 
least once every 2 years. The conference ratifies the movement's 
by-laws and other documents and the criteria and procedure for 
membership in the movement, admits and expels members of the 
movement, and elects the DOP Movement council and other elected 
organs. Members of the DOP Movement participate in conferences 
with full voting rights, while candidates for membership have 
the right to a consultative vote. Decisions of the conference 
and the organs of the DOP Movement are only recommendations. 
Conferences have the right to reorganize the movement (with at 
least a two-thirds vote in favor) or to terminate its activity 
(by unanimous decision). 
  The DOP Movement council is the movement's 
executive-representative and coordination-information organ 
between all-Union (republic) conferences. The movement council 
is a legal person that represents the movement. The coordinator 
of the movement council is Askhat Abdurakhmanovich Kayumov 
(Nizhniy Novgorod). 
  The movement has the longest history among the independent 
public movements. It began with a nature protection circle 
organized in the spring of 1958 by students of three Tartu 
VUZes--Tartu State University, the Estonian Agricultural 
Academy, and the Tartu Medical Institute. The first nature 
protection squad appeared on 13 December 1960 in the school of 
biology at MGU. At first the DOP's appeared in natural science 
departments but soon other departments joined the movement. 
  By 1972 there were about 40 student squads. Operations work 
in the fight against poaching was the basic area of their 
activity in the early 1970s. But in 1970-1972 four squad members 
were killed by poachers. 
  And in order to avoid dilettantism and fragmentism, on 21-27 
September 1972 the first all-Union DOP seminar with the 
participation of delegations from 28 squads from 22 cities of 
the USSR was held using the facilities of the DOP in the MGU 
school of biology. Then DOP seminars and conferences began to be 
conducted every year or two. The squads' activity began to be 
comprehensive in nature: operations work was supplemented with 
scientific research work. 
  In 1976 in Kirov squad members conducted a seminar in which 
the first comprehensive program for the fight against poaching 
as a social phenomenon--the "Shot" program--was discussed. Since 
that time occupational training of squad members has begun: they 
have studied the foundations of social psychology, legislation, 
criminal science, and operations work. 
  In 1976-1977 work began on other multifaceted international 
programs as well: "Spruce," "Recreation," "Fauna," and others. 
Their goal was to reduce the level of poaching. 
  On 13-19 September 1977, in Perm, at the "Methodology of VUZ 
Youth Work on Nature Protection" seminar, the coordinating 
council of the student nature protection movement was created in 
order to improve contacts between squads; Svyatoslav Zabelin, 
the commander of the MGU DOP, became the chairman of the council. 
  The years 1972-1979 were the peak years of the DOP's. Among 
the activists of the movement of that time were Nikolay Krayev 
(the Kazan Squad), D. Kavtoradze, who worked together with 
Svyatoslav Zabelin on uniting the squads, and the first 
commander of the DOP of the Kazan Chemical Technical Institute, 
Sergey Mukhachev; his statement that "Nature should have its own 
people everywhere" became the slogan of the DOP. 
  Since the early 1980s, in the opinion of some of the 
movement's leaders, a crisis situation has taken shape in the 
DOP's. The number of squads has begun to decline gradually. 
  Beginning in 1985, different ecological and 
ecological-political groups and organizations began to appear on 
the basis of the DOP's. Among other things, in August 1987 the 
Social-Ecological Alliance (SES) was formed at the initiative of 
DOP graduates. 
  The First All-Union DOP Movement Conference was held in 
Dolgoprudnyy in Moscow Oblast on the base of the MFTI [Moscow 
Physicotechnical Institute] DOP on 8-11 December 1987. The 
Ecology and Peace Association, the USSR Academy of Sciences 
All-Union Ornithological Society, the MFTI DOP, and the MGU 
school of biology conducted it. Taking part in the conference 
were 110 DOP's (96 with a full vote and 14 with a consultative 
vote) from 74 cities of the USSR. The conference was dedicated 
to defining strategic tasks and resolving organizational 
questions. The "Model Statute of the Student DOP" and the 
"Statute on the Coordinating-Methodological Council of the DOP 
Movement" were adopted and the members of the council and its 
chairman, Aleksey Volkov (MFTI DOP), were elected. 
  The Second All-Union DOP Movement Conference was held in the 
settlement of Staryy Saltov in Kharkov Oblast on 23-27 October 
1989. Participating in it were 78 squads (63 with a full vote 
and 15 with a consultative vote) from 58 cities of 3 Union 
republics. The "DOP Movement By-Laws," the "Statute on 
Membership in the DOP Movement," the "Statute on the Movement 
Council," and the "Statute on the Editing of Information 
Materials ("Herald") (Sergey Taglin, KhGU [Kharkov State 
University], Kharkov, became the editor). The need for regular 
publication of a press organ was recognized. 
  The basic provisions of the resolution adopted at the 
conference were later included in the USSR Supreme Soviet Decree 
"On Urgent Measures To Normalize the Ecological Situation in the 
Country." 
  Many of the conference participants linked the crisis in the 
movement with the lack of a political program and of new leaders. 
  A group for formulating the "DOP Movement Platform" and the 
"DOP Movement Manifesto" was created at the conference. 
  A representative function was declared the priority function 
of the movement council at this stage. Dmitriy Boriskin (VGU 
[Voronezh State University] DOP, Voronezh), Askhat Kayumov (GGU 
[Gorkiy State University] DOP, Gorkiy), and Oleg Cherp (MFTI 
DOP, Moscow) were elected cochairmen of the council. The 
chairman of the council before then, Aleksey Volkov (MFTI DOP), 
was elected one of the four deputy chairmen of the council along 
with Aleksandr Gavrilov (RRTI [Ryazan Radiotechnical Institute], 
Ryazan) and Dmitriy Goncharov (MGU school of biology DOP, 
Moscow); one place was reserved for the Belarus representative 
until the republic conference. 
  Another 10 organizations (including the Tula Oblast Youth 
Ecological Alliance [TOMES] and the Kharkov Oblast Ozone Ecology 
Center) were admitted into the movement. 
  The movement's Third All-Union Conference was in all 
probability conducted in later 1990 in the city of Moscow on the 
base of MGU, MFTI, and MOPI [Moscow Oblast Polytechnic 
Institute]. 
  In 1990-1991 the movement had to perform various nature 
protection tasks. The Voronezh State University DOP fought 
against the construction in Voronezh of an atomic heat plant; 
the Nizhniy Novgorod State University DOP fought for an 
immediate drawdown of the Cheboksary Reservoir; and the Ryazan 
people's volunteer nature protection squad--for preserving the 
Oka floodplains. Squads also worked on the "Fauna," "Flora," 
"Recreation," "Refuge," "Spruce," "Primrose," "New Year's 
Bouquet," and "Spawning" programs. 
  The DOP Movement cooperates regularly with the 
Social-Ecological Alliance (see article), conducts joint 
actions, exchanges information, and helps in work. Some of the 
DOP's are collective members of the SES. 
  The emblem of the movement was adopted by decision of the 
Perm Conference (1977). The author was Sergey Krinitsyn (Ural 
State University DOP, Sverdlovsk). "The emblem of the movement 
is a circle whose top half is dark blue and whose bottom is 
green. Located on the right side of the emblem is a red circle 
whose center lies on the border dividing the blue and green 
parts while the circumference passes through the center of the 
sign. The diameter of the small circle is one-third the diameter 
of the large circle." (From the materials of the All-Union DOP 
Movement Conference of 8-11 December 1987.)

<H3>    Movement To Create the Greens Party ["Dvizheniye za 
sozdaniye partii `Zelenykh'"] </H3>
  This is an informal ecological-political organization 
operating on the territory of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and 
Ukraine. Appeared in December 1988 as the organizing committee 
of the Greens Party as a result of the meeting in Moscow of 
representatives of various ecology clubs from Kuybyshev 
(Samara), Leningrad (St. Petersburg), Bryansk, Khmelnitskiy, and 
other cities. In the spring of 1989 the Moscow group joined it 
and a new name was ratified. 
  In August-September 1989 the Kuybyshev (Samara), Chapayevsk, 
and certain other sections of the movement took part in 
organizing a protest action against the construction of a plant 
to destroy chemical weapons in the city of Chapayevsk in 
Kuybyshev (Samara) Oblast. The protest was supported by the 
public and labor collectives. As a result, by decision of the 
government construction of the plant was terminated. 
  In late March 1990 the Founding Conference of the Greens 
Party (see article) took place in Moscow. Taking part in its 
work were about 80 representatives of various ecology 
organizations from 4 republics (the RSFSR, Belarus, Kazakhstan, 
and Ukraine). 
  The resolution adopted at the congress was based on the 
movement's program formulations: "We support the radical 
transformation of society on the basis of the preeminence of 
ecology, civil self-government, and direct democracy. We intend 
to utilize existing legislative institutions as a rostrum to 
publicize our views and ideas and to oppose totalitarianism, 
authoritarianism, chauvinism, industrial expansion, and 
ecofascism..."

<H5>    Greens Movement </H5>

  This is an all-Union public organization. The goals are: 
monitoring the state of the environment, the population's 
health, and the quality of food products and consumer goods; 
gathering and disseminating ecological information; providing 
ecological education, and shaping public opinion. 
  The founding conference of the Greens Movement was held in 
February 1989, 2 months after the founding conference of the 
Social-Ecological Alliance (see article); the two organizations 
overlap each other in many respects, and at first this made it 
questionable whether their coexistence was useful. The common 
goals and proximity in time of appearance are results of the 
fact that "the idea was hovering in the air" and different 
people undertook to carry it out. At the same time there are 
certain differences between the organizations. 
  The chairman is the writer and journalist Oleg M. Poptsov 
(since 1990 a people's deputy of the RSFSR and member of the 
RSFSR Supreme Soviet). Responsible secretary in 1989-1991 was 
Lyubov Borisovna Rubinchik. 
  In 1989 concluded an agreement with the German Robin Hood 
Greens Movement (headed by Gerd Renker) and the Ecological 
Institute in Freiburg (FRG) on prospects for creating an 
International Information Center on the Ecology of Nature and 
Ecology of Culture, a Data Bank. The West German side offered 
computers and organizational equipment and the editorial office 
of the journal SELSKAYA MOLODEZH [Rural Youth] allocated space. 
Information is gathered in three fields--ecology, culture, and 
the ecology movement. According to the contract, the Greens 
Movement data bank is a noncommercial enterprise for public 
movements. In the future it is planned to create a network of 
computer data banks throughout the country and join it up with 
an international data bank network. 
  Together with some state and public organizations, the 
action 
"Caravan of Life" (a special train on the Murmansk-Tashkent 
route) was held from 17 October to 4 December 1991 in order to 
gather information on the ecological situation in the country 
for the government and the Brazil-92 conference. During the 
action meetings were held with local Greens, harmful production 
facilities were visited, and press conferences were held. Taking 
part in the "Caravan of Life" were activists of the Ecological 
Developments Bureau (Yu. Shevchuk--leader of the action), 
anarchist organizations, and the Russian Greens Party (see 
article). 
  The Greens Movement runs a regular column,"Weather for 
Tomorrow," in the journal SELSKAYA MOLODEZH (for the most part 
information materials are published in it) and has its own page 
in the weekly ZEMLYA. 
  After some leaders of the Greens Movement came to power, its 
organizational structure became markedly weaker and a whole 
number of leading activists focused on work in the 
Social-Ecological Alliance (see article).

  It was founded in 1988 under the Altair Agency. The by-laws 
were adopted at that time. The initiators of the creation of the 
laboratory were a group of people who worked on similar topics. 
It operated under the foundation for less than a year. 
  The basic areas of work were: 

  -  conduct of independent ecological expert studies; 
  -  work on 
examining different ecosystems as a consequence of social 
transformations in the past (this topic was declared the best at 
the foundation's competition); 
  -  development of various 
ecological plans; 
  -  work to create preserves and substantiating 
the usefulness of creating preserves along the Cossack defense 
line of the Moscow state; 
  -  reconstruction of the history of land 
use of particular territories based on the current state of the 
top soil; 
  -  expert studies of the causes of fluctuations in the 
ground water level in certain regions, primarily in the European 
part. 

    Ten people are permanent members; specialists are recruited 
for particular jobs and students--for on-the-job training. 
Age--25-33 years. 
  The laboratory was the founder of the Social-Ecological 
Alliance (see article) and belongs to the Academy of the Urban 
Environment as a cofounder.

<H5>    Greens Parties League ["Liga zelenykh partiy"] </H5>

  This is a party-confederation of non-professional groups. 
  It was formed on 10-11 May 1991 at the meeting of several 
Greens Party organizations (see article) in Nizhniy Novgorod. 
The Nizhiy Novgorod Greens Party, the Lipetsk Greens Party 
Organization, and several organizing committees of Greens Party 
organizations announced the name change of the Greens Parties to 
the Greens Parties League. This decision was not recognized by 
most Greens Party organizations. The Greens Parties League 
adopted a left-radical declaration which rejected the principles 
of industrial society. 
  In May-October 1991 it sharply opposed the Russian Greens 
Party (see article), considering it "to blame for the split" of 
the Greens Party. 
  The basic forms of work are: conducting rallies, picket 
lines, and the like. 
  The initial size of the league [LZP] was a few dozen people. 
In October 1991 several liberal Greens organizations which did 
not recognize the left-radical principles of the LZP founders 
joined it; they included the Democratic Greens Party of 
Chelyabinsk Oblast (see article) with a formal membership of 
more than 1,000 people. 
  The social-occupational make-up includes pupils, students, 
workers, white-collar workers, and unemployed people. 
  There are about 25 local organizations in all in the league. 
In addition to Russia, league organizations exist in Kiev, 
Odessa, Ilyichevsk, Bashkiria, Tataria, Chuvashia, and other 
places. 
  The cochairmen of the league are S. Fomichev (Nizhniy 
Novgorod), Fedorov (Lipetsk), and T. Bulat (Odessa). The 
coordinating council of the league consists of 15 people. 
  League activists participated in the blockade organized by 
the Nizhniy Novgorod Greens and anarchists of the AST being 
built there. In July-August 1991 the members of the LZP from 
Nizhniy Novgorod, Kiev, and other cities along with Ukrainian, 
Kaliningrad, and Saratov anarchists participated in the blockade 
of an ecologically dangerous industrial enterprise--the coke 
chemical combine in Zaporozhye. In addition, each local 
organization of the league conducts its own local actions. 
  On 26-27 October 1991 the Third LZP Congress (the numbering 
of the congresses comes from the first PZ [Greens Party] 
congress) was held in Lipetsk. Corrections were made to the 
by-laws and the coordinating council and three cochairmen of the 
league were elected.

<H3>    Moscow Ecology Center ["Moskovskiy ekologicheskiy tsentr"] 
(METs) </H3>
  The center has the status of an international and all-Union 
club and at the same time a comprehensive educational 
institution. 
  Created in the spring of 1991. The founders were the USSR 
Ecological Alliance (see article), the Moscow Institute of 
Precision Chemical Technology imeni M. V. Lomonosov (MITKhT) and 
Russia's Open University (ROU). 
  The chairman is V. S. Timofeyev, professor and rector of 
MITKhT. Manager of the educational center is N. F. Reymers, 
doctor of biological sciences and president of the Ecological 
Alliance. 
  Jointly with Russia's Open University the center created a 
new specialization, ecology. One can obtain a bachelor's degree 
and a master's in this field. Anyone who wants, from an upper 
classman to an academician, can study. Courses are by 
correspondence but since September 1991 short regular courses 
have begun to operate. It is planned that the best students will 
spend a year studying ecology at one of the U.S. universities.

<H5>    Next Stop USSR ["Nekst-Stop-SSSR"] </H5>
  The movement originated in Denmark in 1987 when 65 young 
Danes went to the United States and near the nuclear test range 
in Nevada began to propagandize ideas of peace and speak out 
against nuclear weapons testing. 
  Next Stop's first contacts with Soviet independent 
organizations (Commune, "Socialist Initiative," and others) date 
to February 1988. It was proposed to set up extensive 
communication between activists of the public movement and 
people with common interests within the framework of a people's 
diplomacy program. 
  An organizational meeting of representatives of Denmark's 
movement and the Soviet initiative group was held on 9-10 July 
1988. The initiative group reached 250 people in 1988. 
  In April 1989 a Next Stop group was formed in Kazakhstan and 
set its goal to stop experiments at the Semipalatinsk and 
Aktyubinsk test ranges. 
  The next meeting of participants in the movement from the 
USSR and the Scandinavian countries (about 150 people) took 
place on 4-5 February 1989. Participating from the Soviet side 
were representatives of youth, political, ecological, and 
creative organizations and rock groups from more than 20 cities 
of the USSR from the Baltics to Almaty. 
  In September 1989 the international campaign "Next Stop" was 
held throughout the USSR, and during it a debate was held in 
Murmansk on the topic "Society and Ecology" (representatives of 
the movement from Denmark, Finland, the FRG, and Sweden 
participated). 
  The Kazakhstan group became an independent public 
organization waging a struggle against nuclear testing. From 500 
to 1,000 people participate in the events. The coordinating 
council consists of 17 people. The coordinator is D. Mamadzhanov.

<H3>    Noosphere ["Noosfera"], All-Union Ecology Association 
["Vsesoyuznoye ekologicheskoye obyedineniye"] (VEO) </H3>
  Operates on the territory of the former USSR and other 
countries. The founding meeting of the VEO occurred on 13 June 
1989. The founders were the International Foundation for the 
Survival and Development of Humankind, Zhilsotsbank SSSR, USSR 
Academy of Medical Sciences Institute of Labor Hygiene and 
Disease Prevention, the USSR Ecological Alliance (see article), 
the council of primary organizations of the USSR Goskomprirody 
All-Union Economic Society, and the Soviet Committee on the 
UNESCO "Man and the Biosphere" Program. 
  The by-laws were registered in the Moscow Soviet in 
September 
1990. The program is adopted for the year. 
  The goal of its creation was to concentrate scientific and 
production potential of various types of organizations on the 
effective practical resolution of problems of protection of 
nature and human health in different regions of the USSR and 
abroad. 
  The tasks are: to create alternative, ecologically clean, 
renewable energy, ecologically clean and safe means of 
transportation, equipment to protect humans from the impact of 
dangerous artificial factors of the environment, and means of 
improving human health. 
  The forms of activity are: 

  -  joint utilization of the latest technologies and systems 
for decontaminating air, water, and soil; 
  -  organization of 
production and sale of output in demand on the world market; 
  -  joint patenting of technical innovations and technologies; 
  -  development and introduction of low-waste technologies, 
ecologically clean technologies for handling agricultural 
production, equipment for biological stimulation and defense of 
plants and animals, and ecologically clean technologies for 
processing agricultural products; 
  -  development and creation of a 
bank of technologies for processing waste that exists in the 
USSR and abroad; 
  -  practical assistance to enterprises in 
compiling ecological factory labels and conducting ecological 
expert studies of production facilities, soil, and water; 
  -  propaganda of ecological knowledge--seminars on general and 
special ecological topics; 
  -  encouragement of work in the area of 
protection of nature and human health together with state 
institutions, cooperatives, and domestic and international 
public organizations; 
  -  publication of collections of the most 
interesting reports. 

    The collective members (partners) of the VEO are introducing 
the following developments: a compact power plant, technologies 
for managing atmospheric precipitation, an automated hothouse, 
an electronic separator, intellectual development games by the 
pedagogue B. P. Nikitin, a writing instrument for the blind, 
disposable syringes, dishes, and so forth. 
  The membership is mixed: collective--based on collective 
management of labor and self-government in order to carry on 
economic and other activity not prohibited by law, and 
individual persons (about 40 people) able to take part in 
implementing the VEO's goals. In order to withdraw from the VEO 
the governing board must be notified in writing 2 months in 
advance. 
  The organizational structure: 
  When necessary the VEO creates cost accounting subdivisions 
and opens regional branches, offices, and centers operating 
within the limits of authority granted by Noosphere. VEO 
independently approves its staff and the staffs of regional 
centers, branches, offices, and other subdivisions without 
consideration of the norms and ratio of number of management 
employees and specialists. VEO members retain their legal and 
economic independence and operate on the basis of their own 
by-laws. 
  The highest body is the general assembly (conference). The 
supreme assembly (conference) issues decisions if three-quarters 
of its members are present. Its competence includes electing the 
governing board and the auditing commission as well as reviewing 
complaints against the actions of the chairman of the governing 
board and the chairman of the auditing commission of the VEO. 
  The governing board (eight people: the chairman of the 
governing board, the secretary and members of the governing 
board) provides overall leadership and monitoring of the work of 
its presidium and the board of directors of the VEO. The 
governing board is convened by its chairman when necessary, but 
at least three times a year. The chairman of the governing board 
and the general director of the VEO is S. A. Domashnev. 
  The presidium of the governing board coordinates the VEO's 
activity between sessions of the governing board. 
  The board of directors (the director and four deputies) is 
the VEO's executive and administrative organ. All operations 
involving terminating the VEO's activity are carried out by a 
liquidation commission. For the purpose of propaganda and 
dissemination of ecological and commercial information related 
to it, the Noosphere VEO press center carries on independent 
publishing activity. The director of the press center is the 
editor of the journal ZELENYY KREST, N. A. Kharitonenko. 
  Capital in rubles and foreign currency is compiled from the 
stock fees of VEO members--representatives of different ecology 
organizations, enterprises, and departments. 
  On 23-27 April 1990 a scientific seminar on problems of 
ecology was held in the city of Vladimir. Its organizers and 
sponsors were the VEO, the International Foundation for the 
Survival and Development of Humankind, the USSR Academy of 
Sciences VINITI [All-Union Institute of Scientific and Technical 
Information], and APN [Novosti Press Agency], among others. 
  Regional ecology centers have been created in Kursk, 
Cherepovets, Voronezh, Bashkiria, and the Far East. They are 
joined in cost accounting and work is done on contract. 
  The emblem (see drawing). The inscription: "Remember! Now it 
is not the inventor who is seeking a sponsor, but the Noosphere 
VEO which is seeking the inventor!"

<H3>    United Trade Union of Ecologists ["Obyedennyy profsoyuz 
ekologov"] (OPE) </H3>
  This is an all-Union organization which besides purely trade 
union tasks "takes upon itself the resolution of ecological 
problems which are urgent but expensive for the state." 
  The OPE was created no later than March 1991 by 
representatives of 36 ecology organizations from different 
regions of the country; it joins together scientists and 
specialists of ecology organizations and representatives of the 
public who are doing nature protection activity. According to 
the organizers' assertion, on 18 April 1991 there were about 
10,000 members in the OPE. 
  Significant tax benefits are extended to enterprises which 
join the union. 
  The OPE's goal is "to consolidate efforts of everyone who 
considers defending nature and man from the negative 
consequences of production activity their task"; "to direct the 
force of laws on trade union activity toward resolving 
ecological tasks, since the right to clean air and clean water 
and hence to life itself is an inalienable social human right, 
while increasing the effectiveness of its activity is the 
ecologist's inalienable occupational right." 
  One of the OPE's tasks is to resolve issues of pension 
support, payment for sick time, and payment for drug expenses in 
a new way.

<H5>  Greens Party ["Partiya zelenykh"] (PZ) </H5>
  This is a political party. Founded in March 1990 at the 
founding conference in Moscow. In 1990 the PZ was organized on 
the principles of complete autonomy of local organizations and 
basic democracy: adoption of decisions "from the bottom up," 
maximum prerogatives for the lower structures (general 
assemblies and local referendums); imperative mandate 
(delegation of powers by lower structures to their delegates in 
higher party organs); rotation. The PZ proposed to fight against 
totalitarianism, industrial expansion, and fascist tendencies 
and for expansion of the sphere of self-government. 
  Several factions existed in the PZ: ecosocialist 
(communitarian-anarchist), communal-socialist 
(syndicalist-anarchist), liberal-ecological, and patriotic. 
  The party has about 1,000 members and supporters. The 
social-occupational make-up includes: primarily youth (older 
secondary school students, college students, and others) and in 
some cities the scientific intelligentsia, creative workers, 
teachers, and the like. 
  The leaders of the PZ are V. Damye, A. Shubin, and A. 
Zheludkov (Moscow), S. Krivov (Samara), S. Fomichev (Nizhniy 
Novgorod), A. Kokryatskiy (Khmelnitskiy, Ukraine), and M. Shubin 
(Bryansk). 
  The press organ is the independent journal TRETIY PUT. 
  The first congress of the PZ was held on 9-10 June 1990 in 
Kuybyshev (Samara) at the premises of the branch of the Central 
Museum of V. I. Lenin. Participating in its work were 56 
delegates and more than 50 observers from 25 of the country's 
cities representing about 600 members. At the suggestion of the 
organizing committee the following questions were to be 
discussed: 
  1) adoption of PZ by-laws; 
  2) adoption of a PZ program; 
  3) election of PZ management organs. 
  Because of disagreements which arose no decisions were made 
on any of the points of the agenda. The PZ provisional governing 
board was elected as a compromise. The basic causes of the 
disagreements were contradictory views on the party's structure 
and political orientation. The Samara, part of the Moscow, the 
Western Ukrainian, and the Tatar organizations were at the stage 
of breaking relations with the structure being created. The 
management organ is the coordinators' council (19 people) headed 
by the provisional chairman A. Atnashev (Orenburg). 
  The second PZ congress which was supposed to perform those 
tasks which had not been resolved at the first congress was 
planned in Orenburg in late October 1990. But delegates from 
only five regional organizations came to work at the congress. 
In view of the lack of representation and previous 
disagreements, the congress was in fact broken off and defined 
as a work meeting of a number of regional PZ party 
organizations. As a result working resolutions which were in 
fact not distributed to the regional and primary PZ 
organizations were adopted. 
  In late 1990-early 1991 work was underway to organize new 
and 
register existing primary structures of the party, to finish 
work on program and charter documents, and to create an 
information agency, "Zelenaya Nit" [Green Thread]. Practical 
measures with ecology protection characteristics were organized 
primarily by local structures. 
  Some PZ organizations appeared as critics of the "500 Days" 
program and worked to create alternative groups of left-radical 
and left-socialist orientation, and certain PZ subdivisions 
participated in mass demonstrations of the Democratic Russia 
movement. 
  In May 1991 the PZ split into the Russian Greens Party (see 
article) and the Greens Parties League (see article). The split 
was caused by both ideological (attitude toward the market) and 
personal differences.

<H3>    Social-Ecological Alliance ["Sotsialno-ekologicheskiy 
soyuz"] (SES or SoES) </H3>
  This is the largest informal association of ecology groups 
on 
the territory of the former USSR. Gathers and disseminates 
ecological information and develops ecological and political 
programs. Conducted several all-Union actions with the 
participation of up to a million people at one time, beginning 
in 1989. 
  The initiative group was formed on 6 August 1987 at the 
Third 
Conference of Student Nature Protection Squads in the Caucasus 
State Biosphere Preserve. 
  On 14 December 1988 the conference of the aktiv of ecology 
groups of Moscow and the Moscow Region made the decision to 
prepare to form the USSR Ecological Society and an organizing 
committee for conducting the founding conference was formed. 
  On 24-26 December 1988 the founding conference of the SoES 
took place in the Moscow Hunter and Fisherman's House and about 
150 groups from 90 of the country's cities participated. There 
the by-laws were adopted and the operational actions council, 
the editorial staff, and auditing commission were elected. 
  The SES by-laws were accepted for review by the presidium of 
the USSR Supreme Soviet on 10 February 1989. The Supreme Soviet, 
which referred to the 1930 USSR VTsIK [All-Russian Central 
Executive Committee] Decree on Public Organizations did not 
register the alliance (at least by the start of 1990). The SES 
does not have legal status or a bank account. The question of 
registration was postponed by the USSR Supreme Soviet until a 
Law on Public Organizations is adopted. 
  On 26-28 December the Second SoES Conference was held and 
representatives of 106 cities participated. 
  Members of the SES hold different views and convictions, but 
admission to membership in the alliance of the ecology division 
of Novosibirsk Pamyat at the Second Congress caused a protest 
among many members of the CES. 
  The organizational center is in Moscow. Primary, regional, 
and associated organizations are located in 111 cities of 8 
former Union republics. By 1 November 1989 it joined together 
112 organizations with a total aktiv of more than 3,000 people, 
as well as more than 200 individual members from 145 cities and 
populated points of 11 Union republics. In 1990 about 150 groups 
were in the alliance; they included 120 from the RSFSR. In 1991 
there were about 600 informal nature protection organizations. 
The largest of them were Delta (St. Petersburg), Green World 
(Astrakhan), the Kalmyk Steppe Association (Elista), Green Wave 
(Volgodonsk), the Surgut People's Ecological Society, the Altay 
Ecological Alliance, the Novosibirsk Initiative, the Ecology 
Committee (Tyumen), the Bashkir Branch of the SES, and others 
(see article). The SES coordinating and information center was 
already linked with more than 300 non-professional ecology 
associations in 260 cities and populated points of all the 
former Union republics even in 1989. Ties and cooperation are 
expanding. 
  Organizations and citizens are joined together in the CES on 
the principles of "self-organization, public self-government, 
and self-financing" with the "most complete, reliable, and 
effective information provided to all of its members" (from the 
CES by-laws). 
  The SES is an "association of organizations, associations, 
and citizens who, based on their own convictions, regularly 
participate in the work on nature protection, decontamination of 
the environment, or other activity focused on harmonizing the 
condition of the biosphere" (from the Decisions on the Formation 
of the SES). 
  The goal is to "unite intellectual potential, material and 
financial means, and the organizational possibilities of the 
alliance's members to preserve and restore the natural and 
cultural environment and to prevent destruction of natural and 
cultural treasures and human health" (SES by-laws). 
  The tasks are: 

  -  participation in resolving problems of protecting the 
plant and animal worlds, of agricultural, industrial, radiation, 
and other pollution, and of the construction and use of major 
sources of energy; 
  -  assistance to citizens and associations in 
nature protection activity; 
  -  propaganda of ecological 
knowledge. 

    The basic forms of activity are: 

  -  participation by SES specialists in conducting ecological 
expert studies of economic projects and administrative 
decisions; 
  -  development of alternative projects and 
technologies; 
  -  gathering and dissemination of ecological 
information; 
  -  organization of public monitoring of the condition 
of the environment, the population's health, and the quality of 
goods and of compliance with nature protection legislation; 
  -  organization of all-Union actions in defense of the 
environment; 
  -  advancement of initiatives, including legislative 
initiatives, in state and other organs; 
  -  participation in 
elections of different levels of people's deputies; 
  -  conduct of 
economic (including foreign economic) activity not prohibited by 
Soviet laws. 

    The first SES action was the submission of the unpublished 
draft CPSU Central Committee and USSR Council of Ministers 
decree "On Measures To Accelerate the Development of Hydropower 
Engineering in the USSR in 1990-2000" for national discussion. 
(The decree proposed building more than 90 large GES's on the 
rivers of Siberia, the Far East, and other regions with a 
sharply lessened role for expert studies). A large number of 
protest letters came to the CPSU Central Committee and as a 
result this decree was in fact not adopted. 
  The basic measures: 

  -  an all-Union protest action against construction of the 
Volga-Chogray Canal; activists of more than 100 cities 
participated in the action and more than a million signatures 
were gathered; 
  -  the "Katun" campaign: the fight against 
construction of the Katun GES, including organization of a 
summer protest camp on the Katun and development of alternative 
versions of development of Gornyy Altay; a special SES committee 
gathered information for state experts: comprehensive expert 
study of the project drew the conclusion that it was 
economically and ecologically unsound; 
  -  the Chernobyl Bell 
campaign; 
  -  conduct by SES member organizations from Kirishi, 
Tomsk, Volgograd, Kremenchug, and other cities of two 
scientific-practical conferences, mass collection of signatures, 
and other actions focused on stopping production of feed protein 
from petroleum paraffins (BVK); as a result the USSR Supreme 
Soviet adopted a decree to terminate production of BVK starting 
in 1991; 
  -  a campaign against construction in Tyumen Oblast of 
petrochemical complexes, including organization of mandates to 
people's deputies of the USSR, publication of appeals in the 
central press, and participation in the work of the USSR 
Goskompriroda expert commission; 
  -  participation of an SES 
working group in research involving the consequences of and 
prospects for USSR atomic power; 
  -  expeditionary work in sites of 
the habitat of the cheetah, which was considered extinct in the 
USSR; 
  -  participation of an SES working group together with USSR 
Supreme Soviet Ecology Committee in a study of the complex of 
problems of developing the preserve system in the USSR and doing 
questionnaire surveys of preserve collectives; processing of 
information collected; 
  -  information and organizational support 
of the production of individual and collective equipment for 
monitoring the quality of the environment and food products, 
including nitrate content in agricultural output; 
  -  with SES 
support 39 people were elected people's deputies of the USSR 
(including Aleksey Yablokov, Aleksey Kazannik, and Gennadiy 
Filshin) and 18 people were elected people's deputies of the 
RSFSR (including Viktor Revyakin and Valeriy Menshikov; today 
they are, respectively, chairman and deputy chairman of the 
RSFSR Supreme Soviet Committee on Questions of Ecology); there 
are also people supported by the SES among the people's deputies 
of Ukraine and Moldova; almost everywhere there is an SES 
branch, their representatives have become deputies of local 
soviets and members of ecology commissions; 
  -  implementation of 
the "Democratic Consolidation" program focused on combining the 
efforts of people's deputies of the USSR with Greens programs; 
  -  protest actions against including certain candidates guilty 
of 
following an anti-ecology policy in the make-up of the USSR 
Council of Ministers during discussion by the USSR Supreme 
Soviet of its new membership in 1989; 

    before 1990: 

  -  preparation and conduct of an all-Union campaign to 
declare a 5-year moratorium on construction of AES's and ATS's, 
as well as the proposal to develop provisions on the procedure 
for classifying rayons and populated points as ecological 
disaster regions (these SES proposals were rejected by the USSR 
Council of Ministers); 
  -  constant organizational and information 
support by the coordinating and information center (the former 
information center) of the work of USSR and RSFSR supreme 
soviets' committees on questions of ecology; 
  -  members of the SES 
council participated in preparing the text of the USSR Supreme 
Soviet Decree "On Emergency Measures To Normalize the Ecological 
Situation in the Country"; at the initiative of the SES the 
following points were included in the Draft Decree and 
adopted: 

    * termination of financing of building projects without a 
positive finding from an ecological expert study; 
  * termination of the production of BVK; 
  * termination of the practice of withdrawing group 1 forest 
land by decision of the executive power; 
  * formulation of provisions on economic incentive for 
enterprises doing ecologically useful activity; 

  -  conduct of the first historical-ecological expedition camp 
for secondary school students in the region of the city of 
Sviyazhsk on the Volga (before 1990) by the Green World Club 
(see article) and the KKhTI [Kazan Institute of Chemical 
Technology imeni S. M. Kirov] Nature Protection Squad (city of 
Kazan); 
  -  conclusion of a contract on the yearly publication of 
an anthology with the provisional name "Ekofakt" on the 
ecological situation in various regions of the country by 
Progress Publishing House; 
  -  April 1990: together with the U.S. 
Natural Resource Defense Council, conduct of an independent 
international expert study of the plan for creating in the city 
of Kaluga in Ivanovo-Frankovsk Oblast a Soviet-American 
enterprise for producing polyvinyl chloride and items made from 
it; as a result the American side recalled its documents and 
postponed conclusion of a contract; 
  -  an agreement in principle 
was reached with the Natural Resource Defense Council on a joint 
expert study of the ecological situation in Bashkiria; 
  -  in 
mid-1990 together with the DOP Movement (see article) and the 
Audubon Society (United States), a program of Soviet-American 
nongovernmental monitoring of acid rainfall was signed; 
  -  no 
later than November 1990 members of the "Ekomonitoring" 
department of the Social-Ecological Alliance completed two 
projects on ecological monitoring of the first phase of the 
Karakum Canal (10 films over the course of a year and one-half 
using data for the period from 1956 through 1989) and the Neva 
Inlet (1983-1989) and did some remote ecological research (the 
watershed of the Rybinsk Reservoir in 1987 and the forest fire 
zones in Tyumen Oblast in 1988); 
  -  in July-August 1991 an SES 
medical-biological expedition worked in Arkhangelsk Oblast in 
the White Sea basin where the year before a catastrophic 
destruction of marine animals had been observed; 
  -  in March 1991 
in Khimki (Moscow Region) a Soviet-American conference of 
nongovernmental ecology organizations was conducted with the 
participation of about 100 Soviet and 50 American 
representatives of Greens organizations; the problems discussed 
at the conference became the SES's areas of activity; they 
include the preserve system and ecologization of agriculture, 
nature protection laws and law and global problems of ecology, 
radiation safety and alternative energy, clean technologies, 
independent monitoring, ecological education and the creation of 
a unified computer network, relations between official and 
nongovernmental nature protection associations, and joint 
ecology projects; a joint statement was adopted. 

    Membership in the SES is individual or collective. 
Organizations and citizens register as candidates for membership 
after submitting group and individual applications to the 
coordinating and information center and become actual members at 
SES conferences by a two-thirds vote of the delegates present. 
Organizations and citizens may expel members and candidates for 
membership in the SES by the same two-thirds vote. SES members 
(individual and collective) have the right to participate in 
conferences with full voting rights. Dual membership is allowed 
in the SES: some DOP's which are members of the DOP Movement as 
well as organizations of Greens parties are simultaneously 
collective members of the SES. 
  In early 1991 there were more than 150 collective members 
and 
organizations numbering about 15,000 people in the SES. 
  The highest SES body is the conference convened by the SES 
operational actions council in accordance with the decision of 
the previous conference or on the demand of at least one-third 
of the collective members of the SES, but at least once a year. 
The conference elects and recalls members of the membership 
organs (including members of the operational actions council, 
the director of the coordinating and information center, and the 
editor in chief of the press organ), ratifies the work plan for 
the year for the elected organs, handles admission to membership 
in the SES and expels members from it, and ratifies proposals on 
legislative initiatives. The conference's decisions are adopted 
by a simple majority vote. 
  The operational actions council works on behalf of the SES 
in 
the period between conferences, advances legislative initiatives 
on the SES's behalf, "elects people's deputies of the USSR," 
provides monitoring of the activity of the coordinating and 
information center in registering SES branches, opens accounts 
in USSR banking institutions, organizes international contacts 
on the SES's behalf, and so forth. The council's decisions are 
made on a collective basis and are valid if more than half of 
all the SES members voted for them. 
  The coordinating and information center is an enterprise 
created by the operational actions council and works on an 
independent balance. The center "collects essential information, 
offers it to interested persons and organizations, and forms 
working groups to resolve particular issues and problems." 
  SES branches may be created by at least three SES members 
and 
are registered by the operational actions council. SES branches 
are independent in resolving their own internal issues, 
including determining their structure and highest bodies and 
areas and forms of work, and are also on independent balances. 
  The following are sources of financing: 

  -  cash receipts from state enterprises, institutions, 
organizations, cooperatives, and other legal persons and from 
foreign and international organizations and individual citizens; 
  -  income from measures conducted on the SES's behalf; 
  -  income 
from SES economic activity. 

    The SES established contact with the European Greens Parties 
Headquarters and cooperates with the U.S. Natural Resource 
Defense Council and the Audubon Society (United States), the 
Greens and Antinuclear Movement in the FRG (a contract on 
interaction until 1990 was concluded with the last two), and 
other Western European and American ecology organizations. 
Jointly with the Soviet branch of Greenpeace (see article), the 
SES works on the "Western Siberia" program, which includes an 
expert study of the activity of joint ventures of the region's 
petroleum and gas chemical complex. At the all-Europe meeting of 
the international Friends of the Earth organization (before 
1990), the SES delegation proposed a program of cooperation of 
national and international nongovernmental ecology organizations 
in the areas of monitoring the condition of the environment, 
developing and introducing various ecological technologies and 
producing the corresponding equipment, and training specialists. 
  The SES did not immediately include a point on a moratorium 
on construction of atomic power plants in its program and thus 
alienated the domestic antinuclear movement. 
  In 1990 through the efforts of the SES the directory 
"Sotsialno-ekologicheskiy soyuz. Informatsionno-metodicheskoye 
pismo" [Social-Ecological Alliance. An Information-Methodology 
Letter] was published. In 1991 the directory "Vsya nasha zhizn. 
Vestnik socialno-ekologicheskogo soyuza" [All Our Life. Bulletin 
of the Social-Ecological Alliance] came out. The editor in chief 
was Ye. Golovina (Moscow, "Master," 6 printers sheets, print 
run--3,000 copies each in Russian and in English). Since 
November 1988 information letters of the ecology movement have 
been periodically published (more than 10 issues). 
  The SES has its own emblem approved at the conference. 
  SES leader S. Zabelin is an assistant to the president of 
Russia's advisor on ecology, Academician A. Yablokov. 
  In 1992 the SES plans joint actions to institute court 
proceedings against enterprises which violate ecological laws.

<H3>    Let Us Save the World and Nature ["Spasem mir i prirodu"] 
Association </H3>
  The association's plans includes programs: "Model City" (for 
small cities of Russia which are suffering from aggressive 
industry) and "Interconversion" (social retraining of Soviet 
military personnel discharged into the reserve and others). At 
the association's plenum held in late 1990 expeditions were 
planned, social and ecological programs were adopted, and the 
concept of creating an international assistance network for 
countries which by the forces of the elements are in an 
emergency situation was reviewed. One of the main tasks of this 
network is monitoring. (According to UNESCO data, 43 percent of 
the aid given to Armenia did not reach its destination). 
  In 1990 the association conducted a Soviet-American 
expedition sailing from New York to Leningrad. Yachtsmen's 
expeditions preceded the week-long peace march around the United 
States. One of the participants in the expedition made a film 
which was shown formally in the Oktyabr Hall of the House of 
Unions in Moscow. 
  The association is a member of the preparations committee of 
the 1992 UN conference in Brazil CED-92 [Conference on the 
Environment and Development--92]. Within the framework of 
preparations for the conference, national public hearings on 
problems of the environment and development of the ECO-92 Forum 
were held in Moscow on 6-8 July 1992. Participating in them were 
representatives of the Soviet and world community interested in 
resolving ecological problems. Among the organizations of the 
Forum were the Soviet Nongovernmental CED-92 Preparations 
Committee, the Geneva "For Our Common Future" Center, and the 
International CED-92 Assistance Committee. 
  The association is the main organizer of the youth part of 
the Forum-92 program. On the first day of the hearings devoted 
to young ecologists, the question of the lack of teaching aids 
for ecological disciplines was raised, although the RSFSR 
Ministry of Education announced a competition of authors' 
programs to compile such a textbook.

<H5>    USSR Ecology Foundation ["Ekologicheskiy Fond SSSR"] </H5>

(EKOFOND) 
  This has been in existence since April 1989. Registered in 
April 1991. 
  Has the following programs: 

  -  "rendering of material assistance to victims of ecological 
disasters and to volunteers for restoring native nature, 
development of universal ecological education, and revival of 
the public movement to save the environment; 
  -  conduct of 
independent ecological expert studies; 
  -  creation of no-waste and 
low-waste technologies, new instruments, assemblies, equipment, 
and other technical devices, including electric cars; 
  -  cultivation of ecologically clean agricultural products; 
  -  defense of particular sections of nature from encroachments 
of 
industry through the creation of nature-history parks, and other 
things; 
  -  international programs of defense of nature; programs 
of the Soviet branch of the World Information Center and the 
Ecological Inventions Foundation; 
  -  creation of films, 
newspapers, and journals, organization of conferences, seminars, 
and symposiums on the most acute problems of ecology, and 
cultural-ecological programs." 

    Provides financial assistance to victims of accidents and 
natural disasters. Participates without charge in financing 
ecology programs (including research in the field of promising 
ecological technologies) offered to the foundation by citizens, 
organizations, and enterprises. The capital attracted to the 
Ekofond for special purposes is used only for the development of 
the particular program. 
  In March 1990 jointly with the newspaper ZA RUBEZHOM, the 
Ekofond conducted a competition for the best ecological act. Of 
the 650 works proposed, 5 were declared best. Taking the 
opinions of the newspaper's readers into consideration, the 
prize of R10,000 was awarded to a doctor of medical sciences and 
director of the Rodniki Tuberculosis Prevention Clinic in 
Ivanovo Oblast, A. A. Saleyev. 
  On 4-5 June jointly with the Oktyabrskiy Rayon Committee of 
the CPSU and the board of directors of youth programs under the 
All-Union Komsomol Central Committee, the Ekofond organized a 
number of charitable concerts in Moscow which were dedicated to 
World Environment Day. The USSR Ekofond decided to transfer the 
full amount collected to Oktyabrskiy Rayon in the city of Moscow 
as one of the most ecologically polluted. 
  In 1992 schools, kindergartens, and palaces of pioneers and 
school children in the rayons of Belarus who suffered as a 
result of the Chernobyl catastrophe, as well as those in rayons 
of Karakalpakia and Kazakhstan which make up the Aral Ecological 
Disaster Zone, will receive the newspaper ZELENYY MIR at the 
foundation's expense. 
  The foundation has branches in almost all Union republics 
and 
four branches in the Russian Federation (the Oks Regional 
Branch, the Ural Branch, the Chelybinsk Branch, and the Northern 
Caucasus Branch). 
  Together with the Russian Ecological Academy in Leningrad 
became the initiator of the creation of the Russian Ecology 
Foundation (see article), whose founding assembly occurred on 31 
May 1991. 
  The Ekofond is the cofounder of the Veterinary Society in 
the 
USSR and the Anti-Nicotine Foundation. 
  Cooperates with the International "Vita Longa" Association, 
the World Information Center, and the Ecological Inventions 
Foundation. 
  The management organ is the expert council. About 100 
enterprises and cost accounting organizations have become 
collective members of the foundation.

<H3>    USSR Ecological Alliance ["Ekologicheskiy soyuz SSSR"] 
(EKOSOYUZ, ES) </H3>
  "A self-governed independent nongovernmental public 
organization which carries on its activity in accordance with 
the USSR Constitution and laws of the country and its Union 
republics, as well as... the by-laws" (Ekosoyuz By-Laws, 1.1). 
  Created at the founding conference in Moscow on 24 December 
1988. Founders: USSR Geographic Society, the USSR Ecology 
Foundation, and the "Algoritm" [Algorithm] Youth 
Scientific-Technical Creativity Center. 
  Ekosoyuz operates on the territory of the USSR. Its 
organizational center is in Moscow. 
  The goal is to "achieve ecological security and the 
prosperity of the USSR and the world and harmony between man and 
nature" (By-Laws, 21). 
  The tasks are to monitor the condition of the environment 
and 
compliance with nature protection legislation, to conduct 
ecological-social-economic expert studies of existing and newly 
created installations; to form an "ecology market"--a knowledge 
market, to develop alternative, "clean" technologies and 
technical devices, to help enterprises create low-waste 
technologies, to produce various types of monitoring devices; to 
create "ecological enterprises, consortiums, and joint stock 
companies which will make the problems of our planet's difficult 
issues the basis of their activity; to create a network of 
scientific centers; and to shape public opinion. 
  The basic forms of activity are: 

  -  organization of scientific developments related to the 
study of the ecological situation in the USSR and the solution 
of particular ecological problems; 
  -  advisory-coordinating 
assistance in conducting practical measures in the field of 
ecology; 
  -  participation along with other public organizations in 
conducting expert studies of economic installations; 
  -  organization and conduct of regional, all-Union, and 
international conferences, symposiums, and the like on ecology 
issues; 
  -  ecological education and propaganda of ecological 
knowledge. 

    In 1989 the USSR Ekofond along with the newspaper ZA 
RUBEZHOM 
organized an ecological competition and along with the 
AUCCTU--an ecological exhibit at USSR VDNKh [Exhibit of the 
Achievements of the National Economy]; the Central Television 
broadcast "Ecological Expedition in the Moscow Region" began. 
Representatives of the ES participated in conducting a number of 
ecological expert studies and conferences. Together with SSOD 
[Union of Soviet Friendship Societies and Cultural Ties With 
Foreign Countries] they organized and conducted a meeting of the 
Soviet public and deputies of the FRG Bundestag on the topic 
"FRG Policy in the Area of Environmental Protection." In late 
1990 the Ekosoyuz created a scientific-production and commercial 
association of ecologically oriented enterprises and 
organizations, the Nature Use Federation ["Federatsiya 
Prirodopolzovaniya"]. 
  Before April 1991 Ekosoyuz had received a state license for 
a 
trademark of ecological quality, the "White Lotus" (the symbol 
of the ES). The mark will be awarded after a public expert study 
(independent occupational collectives will conduct it) to goods, 
devices, and technologies, which will provide enterprises and 
associations with an advantage in commerce, including abroad. 
  No later than April 1991 the ES published a brochure 
"Methodology of Scientific (Ecological-Social-Economic) Expert 
Study of Projects and Economic Undertakings." 
  Within the framework of Russia's Open University (ROU), a 
department of theoretical ecology headed by the president of 
Ekosoyuz was created in the college of natural sciences and 
mathematics. 
  USSR ES was one of the founders of the Russian Ecological 
Alliance no later than April 1991. 
  In the spring of 1991 the ES, together with MITKhT [Moscow 
Institute of Fine Chemical Technology] and ROU, founded the 
Moscow Ecology Center. 
  There are another seven republic and a multitude of regional 
branches in the USSR ES in addition to the Russian ES. 
  Membership in the ES is collective. The exception is people 
with the title "Honorary Member of the USSR Ecological 
Alliance." It is nominal and does not afford any legal rights as 
an ES member. Soviet and foreign societies and associations and 
labor collectives with organizational and financial independence 
may be members of the ES. To join the ES an organization (or 
labor collective) must send a written application, select its 
representative to the ES Council, and establish the amount of 
the organization's annual membership dues which it can afford, 
and if desired pay an initiation fee. The ES is a confederation 
of its collective members and branches operating independently. 
  The highest management organ is the conference, which makes 
amendments and additions to the by-laws, determines the 
directions of work of the ES, and elects the Ekosoyuz council 
bureau. All decisions are made by a majority vote. Regular 
conferences are convened by the ES council at least once every 5 
years. 
  The Ekosoyuz council, as a rule convened once a year, 
coordinates the ES work in the intervals between conferences. It 
includes representatives of all members of the ES. The number of 
members in the council is not restricted. 
  The ES secretariat (5 people on staff), who are hired to 
work 
and paid under existing norms, perform ongoing work. 
  The main source of financing is voluntary and mandatory 
deductions of members and support of interested international 
and Soviet foundations. 
  Because of the USSR ES's close connection with state 
departments, the largest nongovernmental ecology organizations 
refrain from active cooperation with it. At the same time, 
however, some ES activists are members of the coordinating 
council of the Moscow Ecological Federation (see article).

<H5>    Ecology and Peace ["Ekologiya i mir"], Soviet Association </H5>
  According to the by-laws, it is an all-Union public 
organization which operates in accordance with the constitutions 
of the USSR and the Union republics; and provides independent 
public expert study of the most dangerous nature-transforming 
projects and formulation of new ecological concepts of the 
development of the country and its individual regions. 
  The founders were the Soviet Peace Foundation and the Soviet 
Peace Defense Committee [SKZM]. The Ecology and Peace 
Association was created in June 1987 under the SKZM. Its core 
was made up of public affairs commentators and scientists who in 
1983-1986 had done a comprehensive independent expert study of 
plans for reversing part of the flow of northern and Siberian 
rivers, the results of which served as scientific grounds for 
the adoption in August 1986 of the CPSU Central Committee and 
USSR Council of Ministers Decree "On Terminating Work To Reverse 
Northern and Siberian Rivers." With the association's 
participation other similar projects were rejected 
("Volga-Chogray," "Volga-Don-2," "Danube-Dnepr," and others). 
  On 23 January 1989 the founding assembly transformed the 
"EiM" Association under the SKZM into an independent public 
organization the SA "EiM." The by-laws were ratified and the 
governing board and its chairman, Sergey Pavlovich Zalygin 
(writer, editor in chief of the journal NOVYY MIR, and a 
people's deputy of the USSR), were elected. 
  Members of the governing board include academicians of the 
USSR Academy of Sciences and VASKhNIL [All-Union Academy of 
Agricultural Sciences imeni V. I. Lenin] A. L. Yanshin, G. S. 
Golitsyn, A. A. Dorodnitsyn, B. S. Sokolov, N. A. Shilo, V. A. 
Tikhonov, A. S. Monin, and A. V. Yablokov. Five of the members 
of the governing board are people's deputies of the USSR. 
  The goals are: 

  -  to shape ecological public consciousness focused on 
preserving peace and natural treasures and the ecological 
balance on the Earth; 
  -  to help unite the public ecology movement 
on the basis of new ecological thinking; 
  -  to increase the level 
of ecological substantiation of national economic 
decisions. 

    Forms of activity are: scientific-research, expert study, 
methodological and advisory, and lecture and propaganda 
activity. The EiM participates in electing deputies to all 
levels of soviets. 
  The basic results of the nature protection activity are: 

  -  together with other ecology organizations, expert studies 
were done of the most ecologically dangerous water management 
projects: the Volga-Chogray, Volga-Don, Danube-Dnepr canals, the 
Bashkir (Ishtuganovskiy) Reservoir, the Leningrad Dike, and 
others and the public was notified of the results; 
  -  with the 
assistance of "EiM" the journals NOVYY MIR and PAMIR conducted 
an expedition to the ecological catastrophe region in the Aral 
basin in the fall of 1988 (see NOVYY MIR, No 5, 1989); 
  -  on 22-23 
November 1989 "EiM" and the Soviet Peace Foundation conducted 
the First All-Union EiM Conference on the topic "Ecology and 
Agriculture" with the participation of delegations from the 
United States and the FRG; 
  -  in 1990 the program "Agroecology" 
was developed; it was an expert ecological-economic evaluation 
of the condition of the agroindustrial complex and its economic 
mechanism and the ecological consequences of contemporary land 
use and animal husbandry. The results were published in the 
anthology "Ecology and Agriculture"; 
  -  no later than 7 February 
1991 the association held a press conference for Soviet and 
foreign journalists, "Ecological catastrophes in the USSR: 
Facts, Causes, and Consequences," devoted to three major 
ecological catastrophes which had occurred in the last 2-3 
decades and were getting worse at that time (the Aral Basin, the 
Lower Volga and Caspian Region, and the Neva Inlet and the Gulf 
of Finland); a professional evaluation of the ecological 
situation given by scientists and members of the association and 
the identification of the socioeconomic causes of ecological 
catastrophes were a contribution to the preparatory process for 
the UN conference on the "Environment and Development" (Brazil, 
1992). 

    On 26 March 1992 they participated in discussing the 
possibility of producing ecologically clean food products on 
Russia's territory in Moscow at the House of Scientists 
(ministers and scientists took part in the discussion). 
  Membership is individual and collective. Collective members 
operate on the basis of their by-laws and the EiM by-laws. The 
criterion for membership is compliance of activity with the EiM 
by-laws. 
  The highest management organ is the conference, which is 
convened at least once every 2 years (the conference is valid if 
at least half the members of the EiM participate). Decisions are 
made by a simple majority vote. The conference elects the 
governing board and the auditing commission; adopts decisions on 
the areas and forms of work of the EiM; and adopts and amends 
the by-laws. 
  The governing board manages the work of the EiM in the 
periods between conferences, elects the chairman and his 
deputies, the secretaries, and the members of the governing 
board bureau from its members, and makes decisions on admission 
into membership and expulsion from the EiM. The governing 
board's decisions are made by a majority of the governing 
board's members. 
  The governing board bureau represents the EiM in all state, 
cooperative, public, and other organizations in the USSR and 
abroad, provides operational management of the association's 
activity, and formulates special-purpose programs of activity of 
the EiM. Decisions are adopted by a majority vote. 
  The chairman of the governing board and his deputies and the 
secretaries open and close accounts in banks on behalf of the 
EiM and sign official documents which support the activity of 
the EiM. 
  Sources of financing are: voluntary contributions, revenue 
from the State Budget (there is the USSR Decree on Extension of 
the Force of the 19 February 1988 USSR Council of Ministers 
Decree No 240 'On Improving the Conditions of Activity of the 
SSOD, Soviet Committees, the SO KK and the Communist Party of 
the USSR, and the SFM' to the SA EiM) and founding 
organizations, and membership dues.

<H5>    Belarusian Ecological Alliance (BES) </H5>
  This is a nonpolitical organization. Its task is make the 
population active in order to resolve the crisis ecological 
situation and "put an end to the destruction of natural, 
spiritual, and moral values and people's health as the basis of 
the nation's well-being." 
  The alliance was formed on 1 June and approved by the BSSR 
Supreme Soviet presidium on 24 August 1989. Among the founders 
of the BES were the Belarusian Peace Defense Committee, the BSSR 
Writers, Architects, and Artists unions, the BSSR Ministry of 
Health Institute of Radiation Medicine, and others. 
  Forms of work are: organization in the republic of a mass 
ecology movement able to perform practical tasks; formation 
among citizens of a contemporary ecological worldview; support 
and creation of cooperative cost accounting enterprises in the 
field of ecology; creation of special purpose funds of the BS 
and its own bank of ecological information; advertising and 
publishing activity; submission of proposals to resolve 
particular ecological problems to the Supreme Soviet and the 
Government; and approval of awards and prizes for active work in 
nature protection activity. 
  In 1989 the BES participated in creating a governmental 
program to clean up the consequences in Belarus of the accident 
at the Chernobyl AES. At its insistence a number of points 
focused on the general cleanup of the ecological situation of 
regions which had suffered were included in the program. 
  In April 1991 together with the musical ecology movement 
"Clean Water Rock" (see article) the BES conducted a charitable 
event dedicated to the fifth anniversary of the catastrophe at 
the Chernobyl AES. Artists of Belarus and other USSR republics 
and from abroad held several concert rallies in some of the 
republic's cities. The slogan was "Today life on earth depends 
on you!" 
  The social base of the BES is primarily scientific workers 
and VUZ instructors. 
  Membership is individual and collective. Persons at least 16 
years of age who participate in the BES's work, recognize the 
by-laws, and pay membership dues may become members of the 
alliance; dues include an initiation fee of 1 ruble and an 
annual fee of 1 ruble. Children under 16 years of age 
participate in BES work as corresponding members without paying 
membership dues. 
  BES members have the right to participate in all spheres of 
the alliance's activity and elect and be elected to BES 
management organs; to receive the necessary assistance in the 
alliance's management organs in order to perform the goals and 
tasks envisioned by the by-laws; and to obtain a BES 
identification card and chest badge of the established model. 
  A BES member is obligated to: comply with the by-laws; 
participate in BES activity; "by personal example affirm a 
stewardly attitude toward nature" and nurture great ecological 
sophistication aand morality in himself"; and pay dues. 
  With substantial scientific and practical experience in 
nature protection activity, one can become a BES expert, and 
this is certified by an appropriate document. Experts are 
approved by the governing board; expert groups are formed and 
they give lectures and reports on the BES's behalf. 
  The president of the BES is B. P. Savitskiy and the vice 
presidents are L. G. Tarasenko, Ye. P. Petryayev, and R. G. 
Garetskiy. 
  The alliance's structure: Individual members of the BES may 
create a primary organization (at least 5 people), the 
structural basis of the BES. Primary organizations are combined 
into regional divisions which have the rights of a legal person. 
The council elected at the regional conference manages the 
regional division's work. The supreme organ of the BES is the 
republic congress (called at least once every 3 years). An 
extraordinary congress is assembled at the demand of one-third 
the BES members or two-thirds of the members of the BES 
governing board. A BES conference is convened every year. In the 
period between congresses and conferences the governing board 
and its presidium manage the alliance's work. The BES president 
bears responsibility for all types of alliance activity, obeys 
the congress, provides overall leadership of the BES and the 
governing board, and manages BES credits. 
  Sources of income of the BES are individual and collective 
membership dues, cost accounting activity of cooperatives, and 
donations.

<H5>    Greens Movement of Georgia </H5>
  Formally organized by April 1988. Joins together about 5,000 
people of various social strata; they are writers, 
cinematographers, workers, peasants, students, and academy 
members. There are 11 regional and more than 80 primary 
organizations in the movement. 
  The GNG was first headed by corresponding member of the 
Georgian Academy of Sciences, Professor Grigol Tumanishvili. 
Formally the movement was called the Ecological Association 
under the All-Georgian Rustaveli Society (the EA is part of the 
People's Front of Georgia and cooperates with the National 
Movement of Georgia). 
  On 10-13 December 1989 the first GMG conference was held. At 
the conference the movement's new structure was approved--the 
council of cochairmen (Rezo Khuntsariya, Marika Darchiya, and 
Nana Nemsadze) and the executive council (Zurab Zhvaniya, 
Kvandzhi Maniya--press secretary, and Levan Mamaladze--learned 
secretary); and a comprehensive program of activity developed 
specially for the conference was examined: it was made up of 
draft ecological legislation and a political, economic, social, 
and ecological program of actions. 
  The movement's philosophy is: "Nature is our master. That is 
what our ancestors believed, and they treated Mother Nature 
correspondingly. To resurrect our ancient culture of human 
society's relationship with the environment, return the ancient 
attitude and moral interpretation of the world to the people, 
and awaken a sense of stewardship and a sense of participation 
and responsibility in each person is the immediate and paramount 
task." 
  Activity includes protest actions against: harmful emissions 
of industrial enterprises into the sea, rivers, and air; mining 
of ore by open-pit mining, poisoning of food products by 
chemical fertilizers, cutting of the forests in the mountains of 
Georgia, in particular Svanetia, and unlimited livestock grazing 
as a threat to alpine meadows. 
  The results of the activity were: in the fall of 1988 the 
construction of the Caucasus Pass Railroad (R80 million had 
already been spent and the total cost of the project was R1.5 
billion) was stopped; the construction of the Khudonskiy Arched 
High Dam was stopped (R200 million was spent and the total cost 
was R0.6 billion; the plan for a series of earthfill dikes on 
the Enguri River was rejected; construction of a reservoir in 
Kakhetia was frozen (about R100 million was spent); and the work 
of the anti-hail service was stopped (the population of Eastern 
Georgia had insisted on this repeatedly during the 30 years of 
its activity). 
  Among the members of the Greens Movement coordinating 
council 
are Mamukha Georgiyevich Shikhashvili (city of Tbilisi).

  -  taking of photographs and filming of movies (the children 
made five films about ecology and three of them were satires; 
the films are shown in schools and pioneer camps and on 
television, and the film "Ecology, Problems, and Us" was shown 
on Georgian television twice); 
  -  dissemination in markets of 
leaflets which say "Do not poison us, your children, with 
chemicals: we are the branch which you are sitting on"; 
  -  marches 
and bicycle races in gas masks with posters and banners; 
  -  "'combat actions' of detachments of road blockers against 
drivers of garbage trucks who unload garbage in the city's green 
zone." 

    The alliance has contacts with more than 150 children's 
organizations with similar goals; cooperates with Greens 
(children and adults) of the FRG, Cyprus, the United States, and 
other countries as well as with compatriots. Information on the 
alliance's activity regularly appears on the pages of the 
Georgian Komsomol Central Committee NORCHI LENINELI (in Georgian 
and in Russian, print run of 500,000 copies). 
  The alliance is a branch of the Georgian Peace Defense 
Committee and supported first the ecology association and after 
its transformation into the Greens Party of Georgia (see 
article) began to support the party. On this account Yu. V. 
Lukashvili said: "The chicken has not been born yet, but its 
chick is standing squarely on its feet and acting." 
  The alliance's difficulties: few adults, especially those 
with ecological training.

<H5>  Aral-Asia-Kazakhstan Committee </H5>
  Founded in November 1987 at the initiative of the poet 
Mukhtar Shakhanov (people's deputy of the USSR in 1989-1991, 
people's deputy of the Republic of Kazakhstan since 1991) under 
the Writers Union of Kazakhstan as the Committee on Problems of 
the Aral. In 1988 transformed into the Public Committee on 
Problems of the Aral, Balkhash, and the Ecology of Kazakhstan. 
Since mid-1989 has borne the name: Public Committee of the Aral, 
Balkhash, and the Ecology of Kazakhstan. Has had its present 
name since mid-1991. Officially registered on 14 April 1989. 
  At the start of the committee's activity there were about 
100 
highly placed people in it: "After the accident at Dzhamalkum 
(1988) and Shakhanov's sharp criticism of a number of leaders of 
Agroprom, the Ministry of Water Management, and the oblast 
soviet, the ministers not only left the committee but demanded 
that it disband." 
  Organized the "April" meeting in Aralsk on 6-7 June 1988. In 
September 1988 at the committee's initiative an international 
Aral movement of poets, "20th Century. Peace and Ecology," was 
formed. Publishes materials in the press. 
  Elected at the committee's founding conference on 15 June 
1989 were the presidium (25 people, and a year later--about 15 
people, the presidium meets at least 4 times a year), the 
chairman (Mukhtar Shakhanov), the scientific coordinator (Salmen 
Tugelbayev), and the responsible secretary (Pamilya 
Bekturganova). By 1990 there were two responsible secretaries 
who had been discharged. 
  The number of members as of 1 January 1990 was 180. 80-90 
percent are aged 40-60 years, 30 percent were figures of culture 
and party and Soviet employees before the summer and fall of 
1991; 10 percent are pensioners and 15 percent are employees of 
the mass information media. 
  The tasks are to provide "propaganda of ecological 
knowledge, 
rational use of natural resources, and social aid to residents 
of ecological disaster regions," and other things. 
  The main areas of work are: indoctrination of ecological 
awareness and study of public opinion on solutions of problems 
of ecology by regions (Aral, Balkhash, and others). 
  Cooperates with Goskomprirody Kazakhstan, the antinuclear 
movement Nevada-Semipalatinsk (see article), and the republic's 
ecological institutes. 
  Publishes an ecological bulletin and allocates money to buy 
medicines for residents of the Aral Region. Plans to build a 
children's sanitorium and clinic. Studies the experience of 
other "green" organizations and movements. 
  The headquarters is on the premises of the editorial office 
of ZHALYN. Conducts meetings in the House of Scientists of 
Kazakhstan and on the premises of the editorial office of the 
journal ZHALYN. More than 200 people, for the most part writers, 
journalists, and scientists, participate in the meetings. 
  There is an independent cost accounting division in 
Kyzyl-Orda Oblast. 
  Has by-laws. Has its own emblem. At the committee's expanded 
meeting in the summer of 1991, it was decided to create the 
International Public Committee "Aral-Asia-Kazakhstan." T. 
Hayashi, the committee's vice president, member of the governing 
board of the Japan-USSR Society, and president of the firm 
Tachibank Trading, spoke at this meeting and reported that the 
Global Infrastructure Foundation of Japan (one of the largest 
charitable organizations in the world) proposed the concept of a 
plan for reviving the Aral Sea. The committee established an 
annual international Aral prize which will be awarded to 
scientists, statesmen, and political figures for special 
services in formulating and realizing plans and programs to 
revive the Aral, with presentation of a badge of honor and a 
cash prize.

<H5>    Greens Front of Kazakhstan </H5>

  A non-professional association. Registered on 24 August 1989 
as a republic organization under the Nature Protection Society, 
although at first work was only done in Almaty. Has by-laws and 
a program. 
  The GF founding meeting took place on 8 June 1988. Among the 
founders were the social-ecological association "Initiative," 
the "Otrar" MZhK [expansion unknown], the Noosphere Center, the 
Creation Cooperative Commune, the ecology center of the 
Kazakhstan Komsomol Central Committee, and others. The front 
united participants in clearing a walking trail (1.5 kilometers 
long) along the Malaya Almaatinka River. "This orientation to 
concrete, ongoing work has been preserved up to the present day; 
it includes the organization of volunteer work days to plant 
trees, to clean up territories after mudflows, to water streets, 
and so forth." 
  The goal is to "search for optimal forms of interrelations 
of 
man and the environment." 
  The tasks are to "close" the destructive manmade reservoirs 
in the region of Almaty, resolve the problem of air pollution 
over the capital, and prevent water from leaking from the 
collector Lake Sorbulak. 
  Involved in ecological education, in particular in relation 
to reservoirs. 
  At first the GF was the largest volunteer association of the 
city of Almaty. But in the fall of 1988 a split occurred in it 
between the advocates of political activity (they made up the 
initiative group of the Almaty People's Front) and the advocates 
of purely ecological activity. 
  By early 1990 there were 67 activists in the GF and by early 
1991 there were about 50 people. 
  The GF council consisting of 10 people meets twice a month 
on 
the premises of the Republic Nature Protection Society. 
  The movement's chairman is Marat Akhmetkhanovich 
Chimbulatov, 
candidate of biological sciences, chief of the "Kazgeofizika" 
AGO [possibly Archives of the Geographic Society], city soviet 
deputy, and chairman of the city soviet's ecology commission. 
Among the members of the GF are two city soviet deputies and 
four rayon soviet deputies. 
  Members of the aktiv include V. Gapchak, Ye. Glebov, M. 
Kanevskaya, V. Karachev, S. Kuratov, A. Skopin, Ye. Slavko, and 
Ye. Sheyger. 
  The association is a member of the Greens Movement (see

<H5>    Nevada-Semipalatinsk </H5>
  The antinuclear movement of Kazakhstan. The goal is to 
dismantle all the nuclear test ranges on Kazakhstan's territory, 
establish public monitoring of industrial waste, and create an 
ecological map of the region. "Nevada" means that the movement 
simultaneously supports the termination of nuclear tests in the 
United States. It has branches in all oblast centers of 
Kazakhstan. Enjoys the support of the population outside the 
state's borders. 
  Founded in February 1989. The latest discharge of 
radioactive 
substances during tests in February 1989 served as the impetus 
for the movement's creation; on 26 February Olzhas Suleymenov, 
the first secretary of the Writers Union of Kazakhstan before 
the fall of 1991, a people's deputy of the USSR (1989-1991), and 
author of books, including "AZ i Ya" [AS i A] (which suggested 
an Asian-centered view of history), in a speech on republic 
television proposed to organize the movement, and occurring on 
28 February on the premises of the Writers Union in the city of 
Almaty was the organizing meeting (2,000 participants) which 
adopted an appeal; on 13 March the by-laws were adopted; it was 
registered at the rayispolkom on 16 March 1989 and the same day 
a bank account was opened. On 21 October 1991 it was registered 
by the Kazakh SSR Ministry of Justice, Registration No 0001. 
  The management organs are: the working group of the 
coordinating council (15 people) and the ispolkom (7 people), 
which works on economic questions. The chairman is O. Suleymenov 
and the vice chairmen are M. Auezov and S. Sanbayev. There are 
released employees. In all there are about 100 permanent 
participants. Affiliates of the movement were created in 15 
oblasts of Kazakhstan and in Moscow. A scientific center was 
formed. A distinctive feature of the movement is its 
international make-up. 
  The movement's tasks are stated in the article by its 
activists Olzhas Suleymenov and Vladimir Yakimets "Third Race" 
(that means testing of third generation nuclear weapons): 
  "During the period of time remaining until 1995, public, 
parliamentary, international, and governmental organizations 
need concentrated joint work: 

  -  "to revise and toughen the system of international 
treaties prohibiting the development, production, and testing of 
nuclear weapons; 
  -  "to create a system of economic and political 
sanctions against countries which violate the proliferation 
system; 
  -  "to formulate measures of efficient monitoring of all 
stages of production and transport of existing nuclear 
materials; 
  -  "to organize an international ecological 
purification program of enterprises of the nuclear 
military-industrial complex of countries of the nuclear club and 
countries at its threshold." 

    One more task, in O. Suleymenov's opinion, is that "in our 
consciousness we must single out the threat from geniuses and 
from quiet, modest individuals in secret laboratories as an 
independent factor." 
  Starting in March 1989, signatures began to be gathered in 
Almaty for the movement's benefit, and then money--at first 
semilegally, but soon the signature lists began to be put up 
openly in organizations and institutions. 
  On 17-19 July a scientific-practical conference on the 
impact 
of nuclear weapons testing on the health of local residents was 
organized in Semipalatinsk. 
  On 6 August the world antinuclear march from Semipalatinsk 
to 
the rayon center of Abayskiy Rayon, the settlement of Karaul, 
which is located near a test range, was conducted. 
  In the fall a rally near the Moskva Hotel and a procession 
to 
the Kremlin Palace of Congresses were organized and an appeal 
was delivered to the Second Congress of People's Deputies of the 
USSR. 
  On 9 September and 9 December republic conferences of the 
movement's supporters were held. 
  By late 1989 more than 1 million signatures had been 
gathered 
for the appeal to close the nuclear test range. 
  From 28 February until mid-1991 the newspaper IZBIRATEL was 
published in the Kazakh and Russian languages (12 pages, in 
newspaper format. Photo offset. Print run--50,000 copies). The 
editor in chief was Yermek Tursunov. Publication stopped because 
of financial difficulties. 
  On 24-27 May 1990 the international conference "Voters of 
the 
World for Banning Nuclear Weapons Testing" was held in Almaty 
and Semipalatinsk (more than 700 participants, among them guests 
from various countries). 
  In September a Peace March was held together with 
representatives of foreign antiwar organizations. 
  No later than mid-1991 a conference on the occasion of the 
arrival of German medical personnel from a Turkish-German 
medical foundation was held; they came at the invitation of the 
Nevada-Semipalatinsk Movement in order to familiarize themselves 
with the consequences of nuclear tests in Semipalatinsk and the 
state of medicine in the region. 
  No later than 8 August 1991, after the USSR Ministry of 
Defense offered R5 million as compensation to the residents of 
rayons adjacent to the test range for three planned nuclear 
explosions and the Kazakhstan Supreme Soviet decided to place 
the question of continuing nuclear testing on a referendum of 
local residents, the movement's activists called upon the 
population to vote against the new tests. 
  From May through September 1991, together with the public 
committee "Nomadic People's Trek into the 21st Century" and the 
"Next Stop" Movement, this movement conducted a series of events 
whose goal was to close nuclear test ranges, achieve a universal 
moratorium on testing, and destroy all types of weapons of mass 
destruction; the "People's Trek" began near the Semipalatinsk 
test range and from 6 through 9 August made stops in Japan in 
the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, crossed the Pacific Ocean 
to the United States, and ended its itinerary near the test 
range in the state of Nevada. 
  Several rallies were held in Almaty and other cities of 
Kazakhstan. 
  Thanks to the movement's active work to ban nuclear weapons 
tests, the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Range was closed by edict 
of the president of the Republic of Kazakhstan, N. Nazarbayev. 
  On 27 March 1992 the movement's forum began work; the goal 
was to demand that the missile testing range in China near the 
Chinese-Kazakh border be shut down. 
  The organization is financed by the Soviet Peace Committee 
and the Soviet Peace Defense Committee, and it includes R25,000 
received from the Soviet Peace Committee. 
  The movement's symbol is the palm of a hand raised in a 
gesture of protest.

territory. The group was created in October 1988 and registered 
in May 1989. 
  The movement unites about 30 people. The social make-up 
includes entrepreneurs, scientists, creative intelligentsia, and 
others; technical intelligentsia 30-45 years old predominate.

Pedagogical Institute. 
  The center originated to fight to close down the Khimprom 
[Chemical Industry] Production Association (since the summer of 
1989 the enterprise has begun to gradually change 
specializations). Then the tasks expanded and included 
propaganda of ecological knowledge, planting of green buffer 
zones near chemical plants, organization of ecological expert 
studies, including the gathering of capital to conduct them, and 
similar things. From making preparations for public actions, the 
center gradually changed to working primarily through 
cooperatives and associations. 
  Founds and cofounds different commercial enterprises 
involved 
in nature protection activity. 
  Participants in the movement organized the Flora Cooperative 
under the oblast production association and began work to create 
a wooded sanitary-buffer zone around the superphosphate plant 
and the next year--around the Dzhambul Khimprom Production 
Association, but already through efforts organized under the 
association's cost accounting section. More than 300 hectares of 
wooded area were planted. Planting of a sanitary buffer zone 
around the Novodzhambul Phosphorous Plant are planned in the 
very near future. 
  The creative association Propaganda for the Fundamentals of 
Ecological Knowledge ["Ekologicheskiy vseobuch"] is involved in 
nature protection and naturalist education for children and 
teenagers, set up a puppet theater, prepared a chapter in a book 
on the native region "Rare and Disappearing Animals and Plants 
of Dzhambul Oblast," participated in creating the film by the 
film director and animal painter V. Belyalov, "On the Shores of 
the Bilikul," dedicated to saving it, and together with one of 
the creative associations of Kazakhfilm and the commercial 
center Aziya is involved in shooting a documentary film on the 
Great Silk Road and the plant world of the desert and the Tian 
Shan, while next in line are two books on Dzhambul's historical 
past. 
  The Nature Cooperative began to produce express analyzers of 
agricultural products for nitrates and nitrites. 
  The small enterprise Ecology is building decontamination 
structures. 
  The Flora and Nature cooperatives, the small enterprise 
Ecology, and several other enterprises combined into the 
Association of Ecological Small Enterprises and Cooperatives, 
ELTEKS, in December 1990; the general director is Murat 
Berkaliyev, candidate of technical sciences. The small capital 
of a number of enterprises put together becomes "million-ruble 
contracts for construction of decontamination structures, 
production of consumer goods worth tens of thousands of rubles, 
and construction of new shops in which the volume of output is 
to be... quadrupled."

rescinded. In November 1987 and in June 1988 they conducted a 
sociological survey of the residents of Pavlodar on their 
attitude toward perestroyka and in late 1988--on the ecological 
situation in the city. In 1989-1990 they opposed the 
construction of residential buildings in the floodplain of the 
Usolka River, conducted a public opinion poll, and suggested 
creating an ecological commission including experts from Almaty. 
  Gradually the EKOM began to be politicized. In December 
1989, 
V. Galenko was elected deputy of the oblast soviet and two other 
members of the group became deputies of the rayon soviet. The 
group had confrontations with the leadership of the city and the 
oblast (EKOM promoted the retirement of the chairman of the 
oblast soviet, Yu. Meshcheryakov). 
  Every week the group gathers in the assembly hall at the 
following address: city of Pavlodar, ul. Dzerzhinskogo, d. 46. 
It publishes a bulletin. 
  In August-September 1989 the group published two issues of 
the type-written NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in a 1*2 meter format and 
distributed the newspaper for exhibit on fixed stands. 
  There are groups of supporters at the aluminum, tractor, and 
chemical plants of Pavlodar and an affiliate in Ekibastuz (about 
10 people). 
  Is a member of the Social-Ecological Alliance (see article).

with the Almaty center organized the first antinuclear rallies 
in Karaul and Semipalatinsk and 5,000 and 10,000 people, 
respectively, participated. On 21 October, after the latest 
nuclear explosion, rallies were again organized in these cities 
with participation by more than 10,000 people. Antinuclear 
rallies were held later too, and in December a "tribunal" was 
held on the Semipalatinsk Test Range and in September 1990--a

<H5>  Environmental Defense Club ("Vizes Aizsargs Klub"--VAK) </H5>
  Its tasks are protection of nature and monuments of ancient 
days, as well as political goals. It was formed in 1980. 
Initially it brought together participants in the restoration of 
architectural monuments. Evening meetings and guitar concerts 
were held in restored Catholic churches. In 1984 they joined 
into a group named the Center for the Defense of Monuments. The 
members of the center studied folklore and forgotten and 
forbidden writers and became involved in ecological issues. On 
25 February 1987 the center was officially registered under the 
name Environmental Defense Club. 
  On 10 October 1987 the club conducted its first ecology 
rally, called "For Clean Air," outside the VEF [Valst Electrical 
Engineering Plant]. The authorities tried to stop the club's 
activities, but could not. At one time club meetings were held 
at the University, but club members were driven out there and 
from other premises as well. Then they began organizing weekly 
meetings in parks, usually Arkadiy Park. They once held a rally 
outside the House of Political Education. 
  At that time the club was the largest independent 
organization in the republic. People of different political 
convictions gathered around it. In 1987-1988 more radical people 
than before began to predominate in the club leadership; they 
created an organizational structure that permitted the 
implementation of radical political decisions. 
  In 1987 in Riga the club organized the first demonstration 
(in Latvia during the Soviet years) against construction of a 
subway in Riga. The participants believed that construction was 
not justified from an economic standpoint. Moreover, it could 
have impaired the appearance of the old city. Despite being 
prohibited the demonstration was held. The participants marched 
through the entire old city. As a result the decision to build 
the subway was withdrawn. 
  A week later VAK organized an ecological demonstration 
against pollution of the Jurmala coastline by the Slok Pulp and 
Paper Combine. The next demonstration was directed against 
construction of an atomic power plant. Branches of the club were 
formed in the port cities of Ventspils and Lijepaja (inhabitants 
of these cities took part in VAK demonstrations). In Vidzem in 
northeastern Latvia the club organized actions in support of 
preserving the natural area near the Gauya River. 
  The ecological demands were taking on a political coloring. 
  On 16 July 1988 a rally was held in Mezhapark demanding 
restoration of the national symbols of Latvia. About 50,000 
people took part. On 3 September "hundreds of thousands of 
people all along the Baltic coast" came to the seacoast for a 
public prayer meeting. 
  "By the end of the summer of 1988 VAK reached its political 
apex." VAK activists took part in the organization of the 
Latvian People's Front and the Movement for the National 
Independence of Latvia. A large share of the radical 
participants in the club began acting within these 
organizations. The club began to become less political. The 
formation of the Latvian Greens Party (see article) in early 
1990 was the next step along the path "from a politicized 
organization to the club of dedicated amateurs that it had been 
in the beginning." 
  The club today does not have a rigid structure. Its 
activities are "distinguished not so much by good organization 
as by good fantasy." They are usually conducted outdoors, "far 
from the closed halls in which the politicians gather." VAK 
organizes picketing, sometimes outside military installations, 
and ecological protests to stop actions. In 1990, for example, 
the club organized picketing in Saldus District where a firing 
range was set up in an old cemetery and corpses flew into the 
air during exercises. 
  In the fall of 1991 the club, together with the Latvian 
Republic Committee for Environmental Defense (see article), the 
Latvian Greens Party (see article), and the Vieda Publishing 
House of Ecological Education conducted the second "Green 
Logicians" conference in order to invigorate the Greens movement 
in the republic. 
  The president of the club is A. Ulme. The club puts out the 
journal STRABURAGS. VAK includes the Environmental Defense Club 
of the city of Lijepaja (see article) and the Environmental 
Defense Club of the city of Jurmala (see article).

<H5>    The Environmental Defense Committee </H5>
  After the first "Green Logicians" conference, which was held 
in Latvia in 1989, the committee became independent of the 
government. In the fall of 1991 it, along with other Latvian 
ecology organizations (the Latvian Greens Party [see article], 
the Environmental Defense Club [see article], and the Vieda 
Publishing House of Ecological Education) called the second 
"Green Logicians" conference.

<H5>    The Latvian Greens Party </H5>
  The political representatives of the Greens movement in the 
Supreme Soviet of Latvia. "The leadership of the LGP is 
convinced that an independent Latvia is a prerequisite to 
solving ecological problems." But there were disagreements 
within the LGP on the ways to achieve independence, through 
parliament or through citizens committees. 
  The party was formed after the first "Green Logicians" 
conference, which took place in Latvia in 1989. The first 
meeting of the LGP initiative group was held in the late fall of 
1989. The founding congress was on 14-15 January 1990; it was 
officially registered. The founders were VAK (the Environmental 
Defense Club--see article), the Youth Center at LGU [Latvia 
State University] (see article), and other organizations. 
  The party's goals are set forth in its Manifesto, which 
announces the formation of the Greens Party (the Manifesto was 
adopted at the founding congress of the party): "transition of 
the economy from agroindustry to agroculture and from large 
production facilities to small and medium-sized enterprises. The 
current priority of the economy must give way to the priority of 
life, and the consumption society must become a preservation 
society. The path to this lies in overcoming the indifference of 
the hired worker, making him a proprietor of the land, and 
through making ecological awareness a part of people's 
thinking." By early 1990 the LGP program was in the development 
phase, and it was expected to be adopted at the next party 
congress in July 1990. Party members consider the Manifesto a 
statement of the "principles of the Green philosophy," which set 
"remote goals." But the program should be a "very concrete 
document." 
  The total membership at the start of 1990 was about 100, and 
by the summer of 1991 it was 3,000. The party by-laws envisions 
the status of full members of the LGP and the status of 
nonvoting party supporters. The party has formed a temporary 
coordinating council (one of its members is Karlis 
Overtedzh-Gudermanis). LGP members cannot belong to other 
parties. About 60 percent of party members at its inception were 
activists from the Environmental Defense Club. All three 
cochairmen of the LGP (among them Juris Zvirgzds and Valts 
Vilnitis) are members of the Club Duma and the Club president 
and both vice presidents are LGP members. This illustrates the 
interpenetration of the structures of the two organizations. But 
the Club is involving primarily in organizing protests and 
picketing, while the party engages in work in parliament. 
  In the elections to the Latvian Supreme Soviet in March 
1990, 
seven of the eight deputy candidates from the LGP were elected. 
The goal of the parliamentary "Green" faction is "legislation to 
protect the environment, to protect human beings in this 
environment, and to preserve the peace as a prerequisite to 
achieving all of this." 
  In the fall of 1991 the party, along with other Latvian 
ecology organizations--the Environmental Defense Club (see 
article), the Committee for Environmental Defense (see article), 
and the Vieda Publishing House of Ecological Education, called 
the second "Green Logicians" conference in order to invigorate 
the green movement in the republic. 
  The LGP also collaborates with the Latvian People's Front.

<H5>  "Atgaja" Club (Society) </H5>
  In translation "atgaja" means freshening [of the air] or 
sprout or shoot [of a plant]. 
  The club was founded in 1987. It emerged as the result of 
the 
joining of the Kaunas Ecology Club and the nature protection 
club. It was registered at the Komsomol Committee in 1988. The 
registration papers list about 500 members. The group of 
activists is 50-60 persons. 
  The age range is from secondary school to pensioners. "In 
activities 15-year-old students walk side by side with 
professors, punks with pensioners." 
  The management organ is a council of six persons headed by a 
chairman. The council is elected each year. 
  The society consists of two groups: Greens and the monument 
preservation group. 
  Goals and tasks: "Atgaja tries by all humane means to 
preserve environmental balance and preserve monuments of culture 
and the natural world." 
  Atgaja is involved above all with monuments that are 
perishing, neglected, or being specifically destroyed. It 
participates in the preparation and adoption of drafts and laws 
on protection of cultural monuments and the environment. 
  It organizes lectures, exhibits, and propaganda actions. It 
conducts activities in ecological education and antiwar 
indoctrination. It promotes the "Green" way of life. 
  An official newspaper of the society is published. 
  Activities: 
  1986-1988--numerous actions and a constant "struggle" with 
the city authorities for preservation of St. Gertrude's Catholic 
Church, a monument of 17th century architecture. Restoration and 
establishment of a museum in the 18th century house in which an 
outstanding Lithuanian linguist lived. 
  1988--the ecological protest march through Lithuania. The 
purpose was to show the republic's hotspots to the people, to 
study the Neris, one of the largest rivers, and to determine the 
condition of monuments and the environment. 
  The marches have become traditional. The "Living Ring of the 
Baltic," an action to save the Baltic Sea, has been conducted 
since 1988. 
  Summer of 1989--peace march along the same route and 
further. 
The goals were the same, plus antiwar propaganda. 
  August-September 1989---protracted picketing stopped 
construction of the Nemen military installation. 
  In 1988-1989 construction of 5-8 units of the Kaishiador 
GAES 
[pumped-storage electric power plant] on the Nialunes River was 
stopped; numerous actions were conducted throughout Lithuania to 
accomplish this. They took part in various actions as the result 
of which construction of the third power unit at the Ignalin AES 
was suspended. They conducted many volunteer work days, cleaned 
up illegal dump sites on river embankments, planted trees, and 
worked on saving the oak park in Kaunas. 
  In 1989 four members of Atgaja went on a hunger strike, 
demanding an immediate start to construction of decontamination 
facilities for the city of Kaunas. 
  The symbolic fee to join Atgaja is R3-R5. The sponsors of 
its 
actions are various institutions, organizations, and especially 
plants that produce chemical products. Atgaja also gets funds 
from donations. The sponsors of the peace march were the 
chemical plant in Kedlpiai (R15,000), the chemical fertilizer 
plant in Ionova (R15,000), the Peace Committee (R10,000), and 
others. Atgaja pays for the restoration of monuments, conducts

<H5>    The Greens Movement of Lithuania </H5>
  It was founded in late 1987 and registered in the spring of 
1989. The total membership is more than 10,000. Its source of 
financing is dues. The GML is a member of Sajudis and of the 
International Greens Movement and enjoys the support of the 
Lithuanian Academy of Sciences. 
  The GML disseminates its information through the 
Lithuanian-language newspaper GREEN LITHUANIA (published since 
March 1989) and the monthly 1-hour television program "Green 
Wave." 
  Prehistory: In late 1987 the first Ziamina Ecology Club (see 
article) in Lithuania appeared in Vilnius, and by June of 1988 
two more similar clubs were formed in Lithuania, in Kaunas and 
Klaipeda. On 5 August 1988 at a meeting of representatives of 
the Vilnius and Kaunas clubs it was decided to form the republic 
Greens Movement. 
  The movement held debates on the Ignalin AES and the 
condition of the Niamunas River delta; they drew a large 
response. 
  On 4 September 1988 the movement together with the Latvian 
Greens organized a human chain along the coast of the Baltic Sea. 
  The movement's first congress was held on 30 April and 1 May 
of 1989. The congress was attended by 150 delegates. They 
adopted a by-laws and a program and elected an 11-person 
coordinating council and a parliament (17 consultants and one 
representative from each of the 70 ecology clubs of Lithuania). 
The first chairman of the GML was Arturas Abromavicius, followed 
by Aidas Vaisuras. Among the members of the GML coordinating 
council are Professor Zigmas Zigmovich Vaisvila, people's deputy 
of the USSR, and Girginius Vitautovich Jakubauskas, chief 
specialist in ecology for the nature protection department of 
the Institute of Planning for Industrial Construction. 
  Thanks to the activities of the movement: 
  --expansion of the Ignalin AES was prevented; 
  --construction of the Kaunas GES was delayed; 
  --the quality of food products was improved by organizing 
republic-wide boycotts, for example the milk boycott conducted 
in the republic in the winter of 1989.

<H5>    Lithuanian Nature Protection Society (LNPS) </H5>
  "A voluntary, mass, public organization." Its goal is to 
involve the public in nature protection work, help in 
identifying natural wealth, and multiply it and ensure its 
rational use. 
  The tasks of the society, according to its by-laws, which 
was 
adopted in 1984, are: 
  --"propaganda for party and government decrees on the 
question of nature protection and indoctrination of the 
population with a communist attitude toward nature and its 
protection"; 
  --"implementation of public monitoring of the use of 
natural wealth." 
  To accomplish its tasks the LNPS publishes and distributes 
appropriate literature and organizes lectures, exhibits, special 
months devoted to nature protection, planting, contests, and 
other large-scale activities. It develops plans and outlines for 
fixing up and landscaping areas, consults on these matters, and 
provides assistance in planting the grounds of kolkhozes, 
sovkhozes, industrial enterprises, and so on. 
  It collaborates with the State Committee for Nature and the 
Lithuanian Academy of Sciences and maintains contacts with the 
Nature Protection Societies of other former Union republics. 
  The structure, staff size, and monthly wages fund of the 
Republic Council of the Lithuanian Nature Protection Society are 
ratified by the Lithuanian Council of Ministers. 
  The membership is varied. Persons who have reached the age 
of 
16 and who take part in LNPS activities may become members of 
the society; children under the age of 16 can be young members 
of the society. People are admitted to the LNPS by the primary 
organizations, while collective members are admitted by the 
presidium of the council of the rayon (or city) branch of the 
society. 
  Members of the LNPS have a membership card and pin of a 
design established by the LNPS. 
  LNPS members may be rewarded, under established procedures, 
with certificates of honor, distinguished service pins, and the 
title of honored member of the society; gratitude to them may be 
expressed formally. Employees and activists of the LNPS may also 
receive bonuses in the manner established by the Lithuanian 
Council of Ministers from funds allocated for this purpose. 
Social measures may be employed for violation of the LNPS 
by-laws, all the way to expulsion from the society. 
  Structure: 
  The highest body is the LNPS congress, which meets at least 
once every 5 years. An extraordinary congress may be called on 
the demand of at least one-quarter of the local branches. A 
congress is empowered if more than two-thirds of the delegates 
participate in it. 
  The congress elects the republic council and auditing 
commission of the LNPS. The republic council calls a plenum at 
least once a year. An extraordinary plenum is called on the 
demand of at least one-third of the republic council or the 
central auditing commission. 
  The executive body is the LNPS presidium. 
  Local organizations: rayon and city divisions of the 
society. 
The highest body is the rayon (city) conference, which is held 
every 2-3 years. The conference is empowered if at least 
two-thirds of the delegates attend it. The conference elects the 
council and the auditing commission of the society. The council 
of an LNPS branch elects a presidium of the council, chairman, 
deputy, responsible secretary, and executive body--the 
presidium. The auditing commission reports to the conference. 
  Primary organizations are formed at enterprises, 
institutions, and sovkhozes where there are at least five LNPS 
members. The highest body is the meeting of members, which is 
called at least once a year. The meeting elects the chairman and 
cashier. 
  Resources: initiation and membership dues, income from 
publishing activity, voluntary donations, and other monetary 
means. 
  Initiation fee--10 kopecks; annual dues--50 kopecks, but 20 
kopecks for college and secondary students (trade-vocational 
schools and others) and R50 a year for collective members. 
Honored members of the LNPS do not pay dues. They themselves 
establish the particular amount. 
  The LNPS ceases activity on the decision of its congress or 
by order of the Lithuanian Council of Ministers.

<H5>    Moldavian Greens Movement ("Aktsiunya Verde" [AVE], Greens </H5>

Movement of Moldova) 
  It was founded in November 1988 with the aid of the 
Moldavian 
Nature Protection Society (see article) and was registered in 
1990. 
  It uses ecological causes as the beginning of political, 
social, and ecological reforms. 
  According to the by-laws of the AVE and the materials of the 
founding conference (August 1989): 
  The AVE is a radical, democratic, civil initiative to 
surmount the ecological crisis, eliminate the deadly 
technocratic model of nature use, and mold an ecological, 
evolutionary way of life; 
  the AVE is a self-governing public movement that is 
"realizing the right of the people to a healthy living 
environment." 
  It works together with all people and organizations within 
the framework of its by-laws. 
  It is structured according to the principles of democratic 
centralism. It rejects violent acts, chauvinism, nationalism, 
and other forms of discrimination. 
  Its goals are: 
  --"to awaken the general human conscience and the feeling 
of humanism, cultivate biospheric ('green') ethics, and raise 
new generations of people on these grounds"; 
  --"to combine the interests of defending peace, the 
homeland, and nature. To strive for the elimination of nuclear, 
chemical, and bacteriological arsenals and abolition of the 
chemical strategy in agriculture"; 
  --"to oppose the actions of the departments which are 
aggravating the biospheric and demographic situation in Moldavia 
and throughout the Dniester basin"; 
  --"to defend the interests of the region from the 
standpoint of the ethnocultural rights of the population for 
whom the region is their homeland." 
  To achieve its goals the AVE holds conferences and other 
public-scientific forums on ecology, conducts demonstrations, 
rallies, and other actions in defense of nature as well as 
public discussions, works for implementation of existing laws, 
cooperates closely with people's deputies at all levels, 
organizes free labor actions and charitable measures, and 
participates actively in them. 
  The AVE is setting up an environmental data bank. It brings 
lawsuits against departments and others who violate nature 
protection laws. Where necessary it prepares alternative plans. 
It works toward the recall of deputies who do not carry out 
their duties. 
  It founded the Greens Foundation and other societies. It 
organizes public protests against AES's and is conducting a 
study of the Prut River together with Romania. 
  The structure of the AVE: 
  Its highest body is the republic ecoforum, which comprises 
representatives elected by the primary organizations. It gathers 
once a year and, when necessary, in extraordinary session within 
1 month when demanded by at least three-quarters of the members 
of the initiative group. 
  Between ecoforums the movement is directed by the initiative 
group, headed by the chairman of the presidium or his deputy. 
The group elects, from its own members, the AVE presidium, its 
chairman, two deputies, and a secretary, with 2-year terms. 
  The activities of the AVE are carried on primarily through 
the primary elements, and also by means of the problem 
commissions that are created. In addition to the problem 
commissions the initiative group forms a republic problem-debate 
club and directs its work. 
  In their ongoing activities the rayon (city) subdivisions 
are 
independent on the condition that they regularly coordinate them 
within the framework of the republic AVE. The rayon (or city) 
AVE society is directed by the corresponding initiative group 
(headed by a presidium and auditing commission). 
  Money is received from the activity of cooperative, 
contracting, and other economic subdivisions; from the sale of 
articles and memorabilia, and income from AVE activities. The 
AVE uses revenue received by the Greens Foundation from the 
subsidies and voluntary donations of organizations, 
institutions, and private persons. 
  AVE money is used for development of the movement, to pay 
for 
the work of experts, to organize contests, as prizes and 
bonuses, and to pay associates. 
  The membership: 
  A citizen of the republic who recognizes the by-laws and has 
reached the age of 16 may be a member. Admission to membership 
is done in two stages through the primary elements: persons who 
have been active in defending the environment are enrolled as 
competitive members of AVE (on submission by the primary 
element), and from these competitive members people are selected 
for admission to full AVE membership. 
  A full member "understands the ecological way of thinking, 
always acts in conformity with convictions and principles 
developed on its basis, actively disseminates AVE ideas, has not 
besmirched his own personal moral image in any way, has been 
admitted into AVE membership on the basis of a personal 
application and two recommendations from AVE members of at least 
1 year's standing (at first they were from confirmed 
environmentalists known to the public of the republic)." 
  Collective membership with the rights of AVE supporter is 
encouraged and does not change the individual membership. The 
AVE joins together ecology clubs, cooperatives, and societies. 
  Full AVE members who by their activities and behavior 
compromise society or do not fulfill their obligations are 
expelled from AVE membership by decision of the ecoforum (a 
majority of two-thirds of the votes of the delegates present). 
Competitive members can be expelled in the primary element (by a 
majority of two-thirds of the votes) or on the initiative of the 
ecoforum. 
  The AVE is a member of the Social-Ecological Alliance (see 
article). It is a part of the world Greens Movement and also of 
the Greens Movement that is operating in the territory of the 
former USSR (see article). 
  It publishes a newspaper (officially registered). The AVE 
has 
its own logo and other symbols.

<H5>    Moldavian Nature Protection Society (MNPS) </H5>

  It was formed on 30 November 1950. By 1987 it had 1.2 
million 
members and 4,500 primary organizations. Collective members 
comprise 1,850 enterprises, kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and 
construction and other organizations. There are 30,000 
activists, 1,725 lecturers, 2,000 detachments of "green" and 
"blue" patrols, and 90 school forestry groups that involve 3,500 
students. 
  Its primary tasks are: providing active assistance to state 
organs in implementing measures related to the protection and 
scientifically substantiated, rational use of natural wealth and 
improvement of the environment; multiplying natural wealth, 
planting in populated points, along roads, and so on; organizing 
and implementing public monitoring of the extent of use of 
natural resources and their preservation; propagating knowledge 
of nature. 
  The MNPS carries on its work through a broad network of 
primary organizations. 
  As a rule the rayon and city divisions of the society make 
370-400 surprise inspections a year checking on preservation and 
rational use of land and water resources and protection of 
atmospheric air and monitoring correct use of toxic chemicals. 
  Each year they conduct 7-8 contests, among which the 
following can be singled out: "For the best primary organization 
of the society," "Birds--Our Friends," and "Nature through the 
Eyes of Children." 
  Together with the State Committee for Nature, Agroprom, and 
other organizations MNPS conducted annual competitions "For best 
performance of techniques for controlling soil erosion, raising 
soil fertility, and using land rationally." In 1985-1988 the 
winners of the prize included the Kaushanskiy Economic Planning 
Sovkhoz-Tekhnikum, the Tsvetushchaya Moldaviya Sovkhoz-Tekhnikum 
of Viticulture, and others. 
  In addition, each year they conducted a contest for best 
treatment of the topic of nature protection in the periodical 
press, radio, and television. In 1985 2,548 articles were 
published in this connection; the newspaper VYATSA SATULUY told 
about the contest in greatest detail. 
  People's universities of nature are operating in 49 rayons 
and cities of the republic. They have about 4,000 students. 
  On 27 July 1989 they adopted this decision: "The Seventh 
Congress finds that perestroyka and the wave of renewal have had 
a positive effect on MNPS activities. The conscious 
participation of MNPS members and young friends of nature in 
practical nature protection activities is becoming more 
vigorous." 
  According to the by-laws individual MNPS members have the 
right to elect and be elected to congresses and conferences and 
to the governing and auditing bodies of the society; to receive 
consultation and training in schools and people's universities 
organized by MNPS, and to use the society's library. MNPS 
members are obligated to stay on the roll and participate 
actively in society activities, to propagate the tasks of MNPS, 
to attract new members, and to pay annual dues. If people do not 
pay dues during the year and do not work in the society, they 
are expelled from MNPS. 
  Collective members have the right to allocate 
representatives 
for participation in different organs of the society. They are 
obliged to "carry on explanatory work about the points of the 
CPSU Program and decrees of the Party and Government on 
questions of nature preservation and the goals and tasks of the 
society, to disseminate knowledge about nature," and so on. 
"Collective members may be released from payment of membership 
dues with the knowledge of the appropriate ispolkom of the 
soviet of people's deputies and by decision of the presidium of 
the council of the rayon or city branch." 
  Certificates of honor and valuable gifts are given to MNPS 
members for active participation in nature protection work and 
their names are put on the Honor Board and in the society's Book 
of Honor. 
  Organizational structure: 
  The highest body is the congress of the society, which is 
convened once every 5 years and selects the republic council. 
The republic council elects the presidium, the executive organ. 
The auditing commission is elected from MNPS members who do not 
belong to the republic council. The RC is subordinate to the 
congress. 
  Local organizations. By decision of the presidium of the 
republic council rayon and city branches are formed in the 
rayons and cities of republic subordination. These branches are 
subordinate to the MNPS republic council and its presidium. The 
highest body of the branches of the Moldavian society is the 
rayon or city conference, which is held at least once every 2-3 
years. Other than this the rayon and city branches copy the MNPS 
structure. 
  Primary organizations. They are formed at various 
institutions and organizations where there are at least five 
members. The highest body of the primary organization is the 
general meeting, which is convened at least once a year. All 
questions in MNPS are decided by open ballot. If the primary 
organization has more than 15 members, they elect an auditing 
commission. The auditing commission elects its chairman and 
secretary. 
  Attached to the presidium of the republic council there are 
scientific-technical councils, an editing and publishing 
council, and six volunteer sections: preservation of the earth 
and its interior; atmospheric air; fauna; flora and monuments of 
nature; the use of pesticides; and a youth section. They provide 
methodological guidance for the work of all rayon and city 
branches. 
  They have conducted socialist competition between the rayon 
and city branches of the society under the slogan, "For a 
stewardly attitude toward nature." 
  Resources: initiation and membership dues (initiation fee of 
15 kopecks, annual dues of 30 kopecks; college students pay 5 
and 10 kopecks, respectively; secondary students do not pay; for 
collective members the initiation fee is R20 and membership dues 
are R50; the republic council can lower the amount of dues); 
income from production, trade, and publishing activity, 
lectures, courses, exhibits, and other activities; income from 
property that belongs to the society; voluntary donations, and 
revenue.

and its local organs, the State Committee for Science and 
Technology, organizations of the agroindustrial complex, and 
others in using the advanced knowhow in economic activities of 
the NTTM Centers; and using other forms of propagating knowledge 
of ecology. 
  To accomplish its tasks VETs can sell its own completed work 
at contract prices, become a collective member of voluntary 
associations, cooperatives, and international organizations; 
jointly with other associations which have similar tasks, 
finance nature protection programs; create international 
collectives of specialists to solve global problems of ecology 
and scientific forecasting; and create joint enterprises and the 
like to carry on export-import operations in the subject of its 
activity. 
  Forms of activity: intermediary activities; formation of 
labor collectives within the limits of economic contract 
relations; exploratory scientific research; monitoring of 
geosystems. 
  "In its activity VETs observes socialist legality and state 
discipline." 
  Organization and management of VETs: 
  The management organ is the VETs central council. 
Methodological and scientific guidance is provided by the 
scientific-technical council of the presidium of the VETs 
central council. VETs is subordinate to the VOOP central 
committee. 
  In its activity VETs combines collective decision-making and 
centralized management during implementation of decisions on the 
basis of economic independence and the initiative of the center 
itself. 
  VETs is headed by a director who operates on a 
one-man-management basis. He is competitively elected for 5 
years. The director and chief accountant of VETs are ratified in 
their positions and released from them by decision of the 
presidium of the central council in agreement with the 
scientific-technical council of VOOP. 
  For the performance of large-scale projects chief designers 
(scientific directors) of the development are appointed and 
councils of chief designers (scientific councils) are ratified. 
  A main expert council (GES) and problem-oriented expert 
councils (PES's) are formed with the rights of consultative 
bodies to ensure overall coordination of projects. The 
membership of the GES is coordinated with the presidium of the 
VOOP council and ratified by a joint decision of the director of 
the center and the scientific-technical council of the VOOP 
central committee. The membership of a PES is coordinated with 
the GES and ratified by the VETs director. 
  Calendar plans of contract work and future plans for longer 
periods of time are developed, as are plans for economic and 
social development. 
  VETs is supplied with special equipment and instruments by 
ministries and departments based on its orders. This is done 
through USSR Gossnab [State Committee for Material and Technical 
Supply] in the established manner. 
  State registration of VETs developments is done at the 
All-Union Scientific-Technical Information Center of the USSR 
State Committee for Science and Technology. 
  In accordance with its by-laws VOOP established the charter 
fund of VETs at R100,000 and its working capital at R150,000. 
  VETs ratifies for a 3-year period the normative percentage 
of 
deductions to the fund of the VOOP central committee (30 percent 
of profit). 
  Local organizations: VETs can organize its own 
branches--regional ecological centers [RETs's]. They are formed 
at oblast, kray, and city councils of VOOP and at the republic 
councils of the nature protection societies of the Union 
republics (with the consent of the latter) as independent 
cost-accounting organizations. The higher-ranking organization 
for an RETs is the VETs. The presidium and the 
scientific-technical territorial council of VOOP provide 
scientific methods guidance for the RETs's.

<H5>    All-Russian Order of the Labor Red Banner Nature Protection </H5>

Society ["Vserossiyskoye ordena Trudovogo Krasnogo Znameni 
obshchestvo okhrany prirody"] (VOOP) 
  It was founded in 1924. 
  Its main goal is to promote and carry out state nature 
protection policy. 
  The primary charter tasks are: 
  --ecological education of the population and shaping of 
objective public opinion on important ecological problems; 
  --involvement of the population, especially VOOP members, 
in practical nature protection activities; 
  --public monitoring of compliance with nature protection 
laws; 
  --organization and development of the club movement in 
natural science areas. 
  The membership is varied. At the start of 1990 VOOP had more 
than 36 million members and young friends of the society, joined 
into approximately 200,000 primary organizations and clubs, as 
well as 79,000 collective members from among enterprises, 
organizations, and institutions. The total number of nature 
protection society councils is 2,436. 
  VOOP has a far-flung structure of public subdivisions 
(scientific-technical councils, sections, commissions, 
committees, public inspectorates for nature protection, 
detachments of "blue" and "green" patrols, and the like). 
  The management organ is the presidium of the central council 
of VOOP. The chairman of the presidium of the VOOP central 
council is VASKhNIL Academician A. Kashtanov. The first deputy 
chairman is Ivan Barishpol. The other members of the VOOP 
central council are V. Rakhilin, O. Kolbasov, and Yu. Yefremov 
(honorary member of VOOP). 
  Primary activities: 
  Already in the early 1980s VOOP was taking an active part in 
the development and establishment of the system of the first 
Russian national parks. 
  The main event of 1988-1989 was the All-Russian Inspection 
of 
the Use of Reclaimed Lands. A plenum of the VOOP central council 
was held based on its results. 
  In 1989: 
  --more than 600,000 lectures were given, up to 150,000 
students studied in people's universities, and about 38,000 
exhibits were organized; 
  --by order of the society the films "The Scars of War and 
the Wounds of Peace," "Bioshield," and "Rivers of Our Childhood" 
were made. An amateur film festival on the topic of nature 
protection was held jointly with the RSFSR Ministry of Culture; 
  --an all-Union ecology poster contest was held jointly with 
USSR Goskomprirody and other interested organizations; 
  --through public efforts more than 8,000 kilometers of 
banks along small rivers were cleaned up, about 8,000 springs 
were protected by construction, 90,000 hectares of suburban 
forests and wooded parks were cleaned up, 3 million trees were 
planted, and so on; 
  --expert commissions continued work on atomic power plants, 
the Ishtuganov Reservoir in Bashkiria, and the series of BES's 
[possibly bioengineering plants] on the Katun River in Altay 
Kray; 
  --central and local VOOP councils took part in deciding the 
fate of construction of the Cheboksary pumped-storage power 
plant, construction of the bypass road in the city of Sochi, the 
problems of Pleshcheyev Lake in Yaroslavl Oblast, and 
construction of the Caucasian Pass Railroad; 
  --to stimulate the club movement, the all-Russian 
association of cat fanciers clubs was formed in early 1989, and 
at the end of the same year the Alliance of Animal Lovers was 
founded; 
  --the All-Russian Ecology Center and the Soyuzekoservis 
Production Association were formed under the VOOP central 
council; 
  --VOOP became involved in the international action, "Trees 
for Life"; 
  --VOOP enlarged and improved the "Bioshield" march, in 
which significant financial resources are invested; 
  --work was done to create public ecology funds; 
  --specific issues related to Losinyy Ostrov [Moose Island], 
Samarskaya Luka [Samara Arc], and other national parks were 
resolved; 
  --no later than March 1991 a session of the presidium of 
the VOOP central council discussed the situation at Samarskaya 
Luka, one of the first Russian national nature parks, which had 
become a site of industrial development of natural wealth and 
for dumping radioactive waste. A decision was adopted to study 
the situation and place before the highest state organs the 
question of a comprehensive solution to the problems of the 
national park; 
  --VOOP called for all interested public organizations, 
enterprises, and institutions to cooperate to carry out specific 
nature protection programs (EKOLOGICHESKAYA GAZETA No 2-3, 1991, 
p 2); 
  --in early May 1991 VOOP organized and carried out a 
surprise inspection of land reclamation at farms in Zagorskiy 
and Yegoryevskiy rayons of Moscow Oblast, Astrakhan, 
Kaliningrad, and Novosibirsk oblasts, Krasnodar Kray, and 
Mordvinia; violations of nature protection law were identified; 
  --the 11th plenum of the VOOP central council was held in 
the summer of 1991. It discussed draft documents for the next 
VOOP congress: the 1991-1995 Program of Society Actions and 
by-laws. The regular congress was held in October. It adopted a 
policy of enlarging the rights of primary and other local 
subdivisions of VOOP in the organizational and financial areas 
and decided to introduce cost accounting principles in 
conducting certain types of nature protection work and services 
for the population and to carry on continuous ecological 
training; 
  --VOOP is one of the founders of the newspaper ZELENYY MIR 
[Green World], which began coming out in January 1991. The 
presidium of the VOOP central council paid R100,000 from 
membership dues to the fund of the newspaper ZELENYY MIR after 
adopting, in February-March 1991, the decision of the publisher 
of the center's newspaper EKOPRESS to lower the price of a 
single copy from 50 to 20 kopecks; 
  --VOOP together with the Arkhangelsk Pulp and Paper Combine 
founded EKOLOGICHESKAYA GAZETA [Ecology Gazette], which began to 
come out in November 1991. 
  Management structure: 
  VOOP consists of 248 trade subdivisions (stores) in 48 
oblasts, krays, and republics of Russia and 10 production 
enterprises. Its commercial activity has mainly a nature 
protection orientation. 
  Its income in 1989 was more than R15 million; R6 million of 
this is membership dues which go entirely for nature protection 
activity. 
  In 1989 VOOP switched to a new model of economic activity 
and 
the councils were switched to new conditions within the limits 
of the funds received with due regard for expanding the economic 
activity of VOOP enterprises and organizations. 
  VOOP founded the Engineering Ecology Publishing Foundation 
(before the start of 1991). 
  VOOP is a member of the International Nature Protection 
Alliance.

<H3>    Public Committee To Save the Volga ["Obshchestvennyy komitet 
spaseniya Volgi"] (OKSV) </H3>
  "Russian national-patriotic public organization." 
  The committee was formed at its founding conference on 27 
January 1989 in Moscow on the initiative of the public 
organizing committee made up of representatives of regional 
newspapers and cultural and ecological initiative groups. About 
250 persons attended: representatives of cities and populated 
points in the Volga basin as well as regional newspapers. 
  The goal: ecological salvation of the Volga from 
"unrestrained exploitation by industrial departments and 
cultural rebirth of the lives of the Russian peoples in the 
Volga basin." 
  Forms and methods of work: demonstrations and picketing at 
AES's, organization of scientific expert studies on specific 
ecological problems, and propaganda work in the press. 
Participation in political actions of solidarity with Russian 
national-patriotic forces. 
  Membership in the organization is not fixed (in practice 
collective membership evolved). It was planned to institute 
individual membership in the first quarter of 1992. 
Social-professional composition: primarily representatives of 
the urban creative and scientific-technical intelligentsia. 
  By the start of 1992 it had about 5,000-6,000 supporters. 
The 
constantly active body of activists was about 300. The main 
structural units of the OKSV were groups of 20-30 persons joined 
into regional organizations under overall coordinating 
direction. The regional organizations, whose number reached 22 
by the start of 1992, are the foundation of the organization 
structure. 
  The highest body is the conference. The working body is the 
board of directors, which has 62 members (representatives of 
regional organizations and chairmen of subject commissions). The 
leader of the organization is S. A. Shatokhin. 
  An organizing committee of 20 persons, representatives of 
regional newspapers and initiative groups, first formed in 
Moscow in October 1988. Among the cities represented were 
Kalinin (Tver), Kuybyshev (Samara), Gorkiy (Nizhniy Novgorod), 
Astrakhan, Kostoma, Kazan, Ulyanovsk, Ivanovo, and Volgograd. 
They formed 16 commissions, among them commissions on peasants, 
energy, fishing, archives (for the purpose of creating a public 
archive fund), cultural heritage, cultural relations with 
Russians abroad, law, science, information, theory, and others. 
  At the founding conference the OKSV Program and by-laws were 
adopted. Three cochairmen were elected (S. Shatokhin, V. 
Denisov, and F. Shipunov), plus the board of directors and its 
chairman (the writer V. Belov). 
  On 29 January 1990 a working conference of the OKSV was held 
with participation by 352 delegates representing the regions 
(representation was 1 person out of 20). There was a partial 
change of leadership at the conference: S. Zhukov (later also 
removed on a working basis) was elected cochairman in place of 
V. N. Denisov and the position of chairman of the board of 
directors (held by V. Belov) was eliminated. Positive work by 
the press (the journal VOLGA and the newspapers VOLGA of 
Astrakhan, PRAVDA of Kalinin [Tver], PRAVDA of Volgograd, 
NIZHEGORODSKIYE NOVOSTI, and VECHERNYAYA KAZAN) in illuminating 
the ecological situation in the region was noted. The failure of 
the scientific, cultural, and legal commissions was noted. The 
work of S. A. Shatokhin as official responsible for creation of 
AKSV regional structures was praised. 
  Regional founding conferences had been held in Moscow, 
Saratov, Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Rostov Velikiy, Ufa, Rybinsk, and 
Volgograd by the start of 1990. In the course of 1990-1991 the 
Nizhniy Novgorod, Cheboksary, Samara, and various other regional 
organizations were formed. 
  During 1991 the Volgograd regional organization was 
especially active. In January 1991 they formed the Lower Volga 
Ecological Parliament (chairman L. N. Savelyeva) with about 100 
members. The Parliament held four sessions in 1991. People's 
deputies of all levels were represented in it, and thanks to 
this the "Rebirth of the Volga" program (authored by V. V. 
Naydenko, rector of the Nizhniy Novgorod Construction 
Engineering Institute) was developed and prepared for 
ratification on the state level. 
  During this period the OKSV takes credit for stopping 
construction on the Bashkir, Tatar, Gorky, and Rostov AES's and 
suspension of the AES's being planned for Kalinin and Yaroslavl. 
  At the end of February 1992 a report and election conference 
was to be held in Nizhniy Novgorod (the headquarters of OKSV was 
to be moved there from Moscow). At the conference a change in 
the structure of the organization was planned, after which it 
would presumably be organized on the territorial principle: an 
organization of the lower Volga with its center in Volgograd, 
the middle Volga with its center in Nizhniy Novgorod, and the 
upper Volga with a center in Tver. It was assumed that the 
centralized coordinating leadership would be in Nizhniy 
Novgorod. It was contemplated that nonworking structures would 
be eliminated, nonworking members of the OKSV would be removed 
from governing bodies, and the size of the board of directors 
would be cut from 62 to 40-45. 
  During preparation for the conference the question of 
establishing an Ecological Party on the basis of the OKSV is 
being discussed. 
  The OKSV does not have its own newspaper. The one issue of 
the newspaper SPASENIYE which came out (August 1991, 5,000 
copies, 4 pages, editor was F. Ya. Shipunov) was put out by 
Shipunov without the participation of OKSV and, in the words of 
S. A.Shatokhin, has no relationship to the organization.

<H5>    Russian Greens Party ["Rossiyskaya Partiya Zelenykh"] (RPZ) </H5>

  A political party. It was formed on 25 May 1991 from a 
number 
of Greens Party (see article) organizations and several 
ecological organizations. It declared itself the successor to 
the Greens Party that existed before. The RPZ initially 
comprised 20 organizations with a total membership of about 
1,000 persons. At the founding conference the by-laws and the 
Declaration of the Russian Greens Party were adopted and the 
party's working and management bodies were elected. 
  Primary forms of work: conducting rallies and picketing to 
defend the environment, conducting independent expert studies 
and investigations, doing agitation and educational work, and 
doing work in representative organs of power. 
  The party declaration is a synthesis of the views of its 
general democratic and anarchist factions. The by-laws envision 
preservation of the full independence of structures that belong 
to the party. 
  The highest governing body is the congress. The coordinating 
organ is the council of cochairmen, consisting of 15 persons who 
represent different regions of Russia. Among the members of the 
council of cochairmen are V. Gushchin, I. Blokov, and V. Panov 
(St. Petersburg), A. Shubin (Moscow), M. Salakhov (Perm), V. 
Kniginichev (Chelyabinsk), V. Pushkarev (Novokuznetsk), S. 
Grosheva (Kemerovo), V. Skorin and A. Tukhvatulin (Sterlitamak), 
V. Rapota (Norilsk), and others. The RPZ has deputies in the 
local governmental bodies in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Norilsk, 
Novokuybyshev, and elsewhere. 
  Because the party by-laws envision full independence of the 
regional structures belonging to the RPZ, from the moment of the 
organization's formation active work has been done primarily in 
the local areas. The most important campaigns have been the 
struggles against the Novokuznetsk Metallurgical Combine, 
logging in the forests of Karelia, the Northern TETs [central 
heat and power plant] in Moscow, and others. Local organizations 
take part in the political struggle against authoritarian groups 
in governmental organs. 
  Radio Russia's program "Green Thread" is run on the basis of 
the RPZ. 
  On 21 June 1991 Vladimir Gushchin was beaten up; shortly 
before this he had published an interview in the city press 
about cases of illegal trade in lumber (sale of lumber to 
Finland for hard currency) and of instances of persecution of 
RPZ activists who were working on this question. Nina Zuyeva, 
one of the party activists who was trying to conduct an 
independent investigation of logging in Leningrad Oblast, 
perished. 
  In February 1992 a meeting of the cochairmen of the RPZ 
spoke 
out against the danger of the spread of chauvinist ideas in the 
ecology movement. 
  On 28-29 February 1992 the RPZ acted as one of the 
organizers 
of the conference of nongovernmental organizations in St. 
Petersburg. 
  In March-April 1992 party activists investigated an accident 
at the AES in Sosnovyy Bor, Leningrad Oblast (according to V. 
Gushchin's statement, the Greens faction of the Finnish 
parliament raised doubts about the official version to the 
effect that only technical equipment at the AES was damaged 
because cesium-137, traces of which were found in Finland on the 
border with Leningrad Oblast, appears when a reactor is damaged).

<H5>    Christian Ecological Alliance of Russia </H5>

[Khristiansko-ekologicheskiy soyuz Rossii"] (KhESR) 
  The organizational center is located in St. Petersburg. It 
was formed in October 1989. Among the initiators of its 
formation was the Leningrad "Delta" ecological association (see 
article). It comprises several groups of different political, 
cultural, and ethical directions, including the informal Jewish 
Rebirth organization and the Russian national-patriotic group 
Pamyat [Memory]. 
  The goals of the organization are to achieve a balance 
between nature and man, and between man and man on the basis of 
Christian ethical principles and commandments, and the struggle 
for the formation of a law-governed, democratic state in Russia 
whose spiritual life should be based on Christianity. 
  Tasks: preparation of an alternative plan for the social 
development of St. Petersburg, the granting of free-city status 
to it, resurrection of churches, transfer of all educational 
institutions to them, conversion of the Karelian isthmus into a 
preserve, and so on. 
  Primary forms of work: cultural-educational lectures, 
organization of debates, conduct of charitable events, 
collection of signatures, rallies, mass ecological actions, 
participation in election campaigns, and so on. 
  Membership in the KhESR is not fixed and dues are mainly in 
the form of donations. The work of the alliance is coordinated 
by its chairman (S. Kozhevnikov since it was founded) and two 
cochairmen. The KhESR Declaration was adopted as its program 
document. 
  In mid-1990 there were 20 activists, mainly members of the 
creative intelligentsia. The alliance is organizationally part 
of the Russian Christian Democratic Movement. It is joined with 
the Christian Democratic Union of Russia in a political bloc. 
  On 21 April 1990 (within the framework of celebrating Earth 
Day) the alliance together with the Christian Democratic Union 
of Leningrad, the Delta ecology association, and the Greens 
Alliance organized a rally (about 500 participants). Ecological 
and anticommunist slogans predominated at the rally.

<H5>    Brateyevo, Committee for Public Self-Government of the </H5>

Brateyevo Microrayon 
  It appeared in September 1988. The impetus to form the 
committee was the grave ecological situation which had developed 
in Brateyevo (the microrayon of 60,000 inhabitants began 
operating in 1985-1986 despite the prohibition of the sanitary 
epidemiological service; it is in the immediate vicinity of the 
Moscow Petroleum Refinery in Kapotnya and other ecologically 
"dirty" enterprises). 
  In the summer of 1988 there were several rallies in the 
microrayon (up to 3,000-4,000 participants) at which demands 
were made to take steps toward a radical improvement of the 
ecological situation in the region. Because the residents and 
the rayon authorities did not reach mutual understanding at that 
time and none of the 26 deputies of the rayon soviet who 
represented the microrayon lived in Brateyevo, the participants 
in the rallies also demanded their recall and the election of 
new deputies from among the inhabitants of the microrayon. 
  The founding meeting of the committee was held on 4 
September 
1988. The statute on the committee was ratified at a session of 
the rayon soviet on 29 September. This marked the beginning of 
working contacts between the committee and the rayon authorities. 
  At the present time the committee has about 100 members. The 
management organ is a coordinating council (10 persons). Each 
member of the coordinating council is responsible for a certain 
area of the committee's work. There is no chairman. The 
committee set up four centers: ecology, work with the 
population, development of the social sphere, and information. 
The centers have formed commissions (about 25 in all). There are 
3-5 members of the committee working in each commission along 
with the activist inhabitants of the microrayon (there are 
several hundred activists). Sessions of the coordinating council 
and committee are held weekly. The commissions are working 
constantly. Personnel changes are made at a conference of 
building representatives. (The conferences must be held at least 
once a year. In 1988 and early 1989 they were held quarterly.) 
Information meetings are held to inform the population of the 
microrayon about the committee's work. The committee is a legal 
person and has premises (committee meetings are held in the 
meeting room of the secondary school) and a current account in 
the bank. 
  At the present time committee members take part in all 
sessions of the rayon soviet and present reports there. 
Relations with the Mossovet have been established. The opinions 
of inhabitants of the microrayon have started to be taken into 
account in the construction of new enterprises. The committee 
conducted a referendum to clarify the opinion of the population 
about intentions to establish an industrial zone near the 
microrayon. About 70 percent of the inhabitants of the 
microrayon took part, and more than 99 percent were against the 
construction plan. A session of the rayon soviet supported this 
decision. S. Druganov, one of the leaders of the Brateyevo 
Committee, was nominated as a candidate for people's deputy of 
the USSR in 1989 and people's deputy of the RSFSR in 1990. He 
was elected people's deputy of the RSFSR. 
  They have no press organ. The committee maintains contacts 
with self-government committees that exist or are forming in 
other rayons of Moscow and in other cities. It has been a member 
of the Moscow People's Front since 1988.

<H5>    Moscow River ["Moskva-reka"], Organizing Committee </H5>
  Ecology organization consisting of specialists and public 
activists working on the problems of rivers in the Moscow River 
basin. 
  It was formed within the All-Russian Nature Protection 
Society (see article) in 1987. It has been independent since 
1991. Initiators of its formation were A. V. Chernov (geologist) 
and V. M. Khmelinskiy. The by-laws were adopted on 7 September 
1991. The committee is not officially registered. 
  It joins the ecology organizations Brateyevo (see article), 
Yauza (see article), and Rublevo (see article), the Moscow 
Esperanto Club "Scio" (Knowledge), and the ecology committee. 
  The goal of Moscow River is to join together all those who 
are concerned about the ecological problems of the Moscow River 
basin (clean water and air) and involve the organizations that 
are polluting the river to carry out comprehensive studies and 
find joint solutions to the problems. 
  It organizes press conferences on ecological problems of the 
Moscow River. It is proposed to organize an expedition from the 
source to the mouth of the Moscow River to carry out the charter 
task. The governing board has nine members, representatives of 
the member organizations. A chairman is not elected in 
principle. There are no membership dues. The committee 
collaborates with the MEF [Moscow Ecological Federation] (see 
article), SES [Social-Ecological Alliance] (see article), and 
SNIO [Union of Scientific and Engineering Societies]. It is in 
contact with ecology organizations in Kolomna, Mytishchi, and 
elsewhere. 
  It has no official premises. It uses the SNIO quarters in 
building No 18 on ul. Sadovo-Kudrinskaya for meetings.

<H5>    Moscow Greens Party Organization ["Moskovskaya organizatsiya </H5>

partii zelenykh"] (MOPZ) 
  It was organized in May 1990 on the basis of the Movement To 
Create the Greens Party with the assistance of activists of the 
Confederation of Anarcho-Syndicalists, the Biryulevo-Zagorye 
Self-Government Committee, and the ecology section of the 
Artists Union. It joined the Greens Party. 
  It is organized on the principles of "basic 
democracy"--complete subordination of the coordinating organs to 
the rank-and-file members. 
  In April-December 1991 the organization held a series of 
rallies against construction of the Northern TETs, the cutting 
of wooded areas, construction of a bread plant in a zone of 
heightened radioactivity, and other ecological problems of the 
capital. It sharply criticized the policy of the Moscow mayor's 
office and supported the Mossoviet. It has two deputies in the 
city soviet and two in rayon soviets. 
  The "Green Thread" radio program has been produced since 
March 1991 with help from MOPZ. 
  MOPZ developed its own program in the fields of economics, 
politics, and social and ethnic relations. It supports 
self-government and a market economy based on collective 
ownership of the means of production. This position was 
criticized by V. Damye, one of the cochairmen of the MOPZ. In 
May 1991 he left the MOPZ, which was the start of the ensuing 
schism in the Greens Party. 
  The MOPZ joined the RPZ. In late 1991 it sharply criticized 
government policy in the area of prices, privatization, and 
exploitation of natural resources. An MOPZ rally on Human Rights 
Day, 10 December 1991, was broken up and 11 persons were 
detained, including 5 deputies. Following this, under pressure 
from the MOPZ deputies, the Mossoviet proclaimed Sovetskaya 
Square a "Hyde Park." 
  On 19 April 1992, just before Earth Day, the MOPZ and the 
Cosmos Society (see article) jointly conducted a volunteer 
ecology work day in "Hyde Park," picking up filth and trash. By 
this action the MOPZ was trying to convince Moscow residents 
that they themselves can put an end to disorder in the city, 
without relying on strong executive power. 
  In the spring of 1992 the MOPZ took part in the campaign 
against commercialization of the parks of Moscow. 
  MOPZ deputies belong to the Mossoviet ecology commission and 
the "Strong Council" group. Deputy A. Zheludkov was elected 
chairman of the municipal soviet of Biryulevo-Zagorye.

<H3>    Moscow Ecological Federation ["Moskovskaya ekologicheskaya 
federatsiya"] (MEF) </H3>
  This is an association of ecology groups of Moscow and 
Moscow 
Oblast. The first organizing session took place in August 1988. 
The founding conference (with about 500 participants) occurred 
15 April 1989 (founders were the Moscow City Council of the 
All-Russian Nature Protection Society [see article] and the 
Moscow Nature Committee). In March 1990 the MEF was registered 
by decision of the VOOP. At the beginning of 1992 the MEF still 
was not registered at the Mossoviet. 
  In August 1989 the Federation comprised 57 informal groups, 
then in the spring of 1990 it was about 50, and by the beginning 
of 1992 there were about 70 groups which differed by nature of 
their activities and by size (the largest ones--Bittsa [see 
article], Brateyevo [see article], and Northern Region--bring 
together up to 1,000 persons). Individual members are mainly 
specialists and experts in fields related to nature protection 
activity. The MEF is organized on the confederative principle. 
  In conformity with the by-laws, the highest body of the 
federation is the conference, which must be held at least once a 
year. In the intervals between conferences the executive organ, 
the coordinating council, operates. The coordinating council 
meets regularly (about twice a month). 
  Initially the MEF's work was coordinated by the council and 
three cochairmen--Lyubov Rubinchik, Sergey Druganov, and Vadim 
Damye. At first the council was elected from representatives of 
organizations, then later by the functional principle. In the 
opinion of L. Rubinchik, this made the council able to do more 
effective work. 
  Shortly after the April conference, cochairmen of the MEF 
(L. 
B. Rubinchik and V. I. Vasiliadi) were elected. 
  The council directs several working groups. The program 
group 
works on polishing the by-laws and the MEF program. The 
scientific information group prepares drafts and proposals for 
the MEF on ecology policy, enlists specialists to work with the 
federation, and gathers the suggestions of MEF groups and 
members on solving local ecological problems. Most of the groups 
that belong to the federation have similar histories of 
origination and development. The groups emerged spontaneously to 
solve some local problem, for example contamination of the 
environment by existing enterprises (Yauze [see article], 
Biryulelvo), construction of new enterprises (Brateyevo, 
Northern Region), and to save natural and cultural sites 
threatened with destruction ("Sloboda" [see article], 
"Studenets" [see article]), in particular cutting forests 
(Tushino, Strogino, Teplyy Stan). The number of people 
participating in the work of the groups is constantly changing. 
It depends, among other things, on the severity of the problem. 
There was also one political group among the organizers of the 
MEF--Commune. Later the Moscow Organization of the Greens Party 
(see article) joined the MEF. 
  The forms of activity of the groups go through three stages: 
  1) collection of signatures, protest letters, telegrams, and 
appeals to official bodies; 
  2) organization of independent expert studies (usually the 
results obtained by the experts do not influence the decision on 
the issue); 
  3) if favorable results are not achieved in the first two 
stages, MEF participants go over to "extremist" methods: 
picketing or blockading sites (Lefortovo, the Northern TETs, 
Sloboda), picketing official bodies, and rallies in front of the 
Mossoviet building (Bittsa, Tushino). 
  All these methods, as a rule, only gained time, without 
leading to accomplishment of the goal. Some groups stopped their 
activity, others split, and still others reorganized. Public 
self-government committees appeared (Brateyevo, Golyanovo, 
Solntsevo, and others). 
  The joining of the groups into a federation was the next 
stage. In June 1989 the MEF took part in the work of the ecology 
session of the Mossoviet. Most of the MEF's package of proposals 
was adopted by the session. Federation participants considered 
cooperation with official nature protection organizations such 
as the Moscow Nature Committee and the Moscow City Council of 
the VOOP to be promising. 
  To make this cooperation more productive, the MEF 
participated in the March 1990 elections for people's deputies. 
MEF cochairman S. Druganov (KOSU [Public Self-Government 
Committee] Brateyevo) was elected an RSFSR people's deputy. More 
than 10 MEF members joined the "Greens" faction that was formed 
in the Mossoviet. Federation participants were also elected 
deputies to the rayon soviets of Moscow and the oblast; they 
were mainly experts. In the elections for RSFSR people's 
deputies, the MEF helped defeat A. Matrosov, who at the time was 
deputy chairman of the Mosgorispolkom and was on the candidate 
list of Democratic Russia. 
  The MEF participates in expert studies of plans for 
residential and industrial construction in Moscow and the oblast 
(including the study of the Northern TETs, the new draft of the 
Master Plan for Development of Moscow, and construction of a 
bread bakery in a zone of heightened radioactivity in 
Khoroshevskiy Rayon of Moscow). It is conducting an 
investigation of the activities of the Moszelenkhozstroy 
Scientific-Production Association which led to cutting trees in 
Moscow and in the wooded park protective zone. It is fighting to 
have the Moscow Nature Committee directly subordinate to the 
Mossoviet, not to executive organs. It is organizing a system of 
ecological education and training, for Mossoviet deputies among 
others. In 1989 the MEF together with the Moscow Nature 
Committee and the Moscow City Council of the VOOP began 
preparation of an ecology program for the Mossoviet. 
  In the summer of 1991, the MEF together with SoES brought 
suit against the Russian Government for authorizing garden plots 
in areas with category No 1 forest. 
  Several members of the MEF belong to the public ecology 
council of the Moscow Nature Committee.

  It was formed by an initiative group of members of the 
section on protection of living nature of the MGOOP. It was 
ratified by decision of the Mosgorispolkom in January 1989 and 
re-registered in March 1992. 
  It is a non-commercial organization. Its goal is to teach a 
moral attitude toward nature and animals. One of the society's 
tasks was the struggle for a law on protection of animals, and 
on 30 March 1989 the "Edict on Responsibility for Cruel 
Treatment of Animals" was adopted. A struggle is being waged 
against cruel persons, several trials have been held, and 
articles on timely subjects are published in OGONEK, TRUD, and 
elsewhere. 
  The management organ is the presidium (at first with 4 
members, by April 1992 consisting of 10). The society has about 
30 active members. The chairman of the society is USSR People's 
Deputy and academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences A. V. 
Yablokov. 
  It belongs to the Moscow Ecological Federation (see 
article).

  It appeared in 1988. The initiator was P. A. Kostromicheva. 
The society was registered with the rayon soviet. Its by-laws 
and program were adopted in the summer of 1990. 
  Goal: to have ecological awareness in society and provide 
information to the population. 
  Rallies are conducted and society members attend sessions of 
the soviet, work in the deputy commission or with it, and make 
inquiries. 
  Together with associates of the Institute of Geochemistry 
and 
Crystallography, they prepared a map of contamination of the 
rayon with heavy metals and other harmful substances and found a 
region contaminated with mercury--up to 50 times the permissible 
concentration; in some places radioactive contamination reaches 
160 milliroentgens per hour. The information was brought to the 
attention of deputies of the rayon soviet and the Mossoviet 
ecology commission, but no concrete steps were taken. 
  There are 30 activists, and the other members are not 
recorded. They have three cochairmen and a coordinating council. 
  The society collaborates with the Moscow Ecological 
Federation (see article). It does not have official premises.

<H5>    Tourism, Sport, and Recreation ["Turizm, sport, otdykh"], </H5>

Association 
  Goal--establishment of a University of Tourism with several 
branches: families, children, therapeutic, sports, and ecology. 
  In February 1991 they began giving lectures and conducting 
practical classes in the ecology tourism branch. The course of 
study is planned for 2 months. After completing it students on 
tourist excursions can make ecological observations of 
vegetation, the earth's surface, and streams of water, take 
samples, and work with instruments that measure radioactivity. 
This will allow organizations engaged in ecological assessment 
to enlist tourists to work in difficult-to-reach regions where a 
scientific party cannot always be sent. 
  President of the association is V. V. Malyakov.

<H5>  For Clean Air and Water [Za chistyy vozdukh i vodu] </H5>
  A social-ecological society, it was founded in November 
1987. 
It was formally organized on 6 May 1988. The society's by-laws 
and program were adopted in 1988. Membership is individual. 
There are about 70 members in all, with 10 activists. Meetings 
of the society are held on Fridays at 1900 hours in the 
gorispolkom building (20-30 participants). 
  The society works on ecological and social problems. It 
analyzes and adds to existing nature protection plans, chiefly 
relating to discharges of the chemical plants and oil 
refineries; it monitors the quality of food products and 
consumer goods, and public health. It watches to see that nature 
protection laws are obeyed, and it works on the problem of 
moving residents out of buffer zones. 
  On 29 November 1987, after the government adopted a decision 
to build a polycarbonate plant, more than 10,000 people came out 
to demonstrate and held a rally at the gorispolkom building. The 
initiative group for the rally (seven persons) made up the 
nucleus of the society. 
  The society tried to hold another rally on 22 June 1988 in 
connection with the 19th CPSU Conference. The city leadership 
moved the rally to the Sports Palace and "filled the hall mostly 
with people who were specially brought in" and "disrupted the 
speeches" of the rally initiators. After this the city 
authorities prohibited rallies. 
  "Society activists are being subjected to many forms of 
persecution and attacks in the republic and central press. D. 
Novitskiy was discharged from his job." 
  They are taking action against construction of the Bashkir 
AES. 
  They took part in the 1989 election campaign. They organized 
picketing and called for votes against Academician Tolstyakov 
and second secretary of the CPSU gorkom Yurin. They supported 
IZVESTIYA correspondent V. I. Prokushev (who became a USSR 
people's deputy) and the local mufti. 
  In February 1990 they joined the newly formed League of 
Democratic Forces of the city of Ufa. Since February the league 
has put out its newspaper UFIMSKOYE VREMYA monthly (editor in 
chief--S. G. Molodtsova). 
  In April 1990 a representative of the society joined the 
Unified Committee of Public Organizations (see article). 
  On 13 May 1990 within the framework of the league, they took 
part in the mass action called the "Living Chain." 20,000 
inhabitants of Ufa and nearby populated points 
(Novoaleksandrovka, Inors, Gastello) held hands and formed a 
living chain from the Council of Ministers of the Bashkir ASSR 
to the Khimprom [Chemical Industry] Production Association. 
  The society is a member of the Social-Ecological Alliance 
(see article). It collaborates with the ethnic cultural centers 
of the city, including the Tatar, Mari, Chuvash, Jewish, and 
German clubs Together with representatives of the Tatar, Mari, 
and German clubs the society joined the OKNF (10-20 persons from 
Ufa, Sterlitamka, and other cities). It worked to form a 
people's front. It took part in the formation of the Radical 
Democratic Bloc (formed in January 1990 during the struggle 
against the CPSU obkom).

opportunity to organize independent expert studies, and so on. 
  During the 1989 election campaign they and other independent 
groups supported V. I. Kirillov, senior scientific associate at 
the Voronezh Polytechnic Institute. He was elected USSR people's 
deputy. Six members of Ecological Initiative became deputies of 
the city soviet of people's deputies.

<H5>  Purification ["Ochishcheniye"], Ecology Club (EKO) </H5>
  This is an initiative group formed on 29 February 1988 after 
the 13 February ecology rally. The Purification Ecology Club has 
operated since April 1988 when the founding meeting was held. On 
8 September 1988 the club was registered at the gorispolkom. In 
the same month EKO adopted by-laws which envision individual and 
collective membership and dues. A council of nine persons was 
formed. The Purification program was made public at a rally on 
15 October 1989. Open meetings of the club (15-70 participants) 
were held weekly at the Yubileynyy DK. 
  The goal of the club is to improve the ecological situation 
in the city relative to air pollution by the Nizhniy Tagil 
Metallurgical Combine. 
  Forms of work: holding rallies in defense of the 
environment, 
participating in elections, organizing exhibits, and holding 
contests on ecology subjects, and the like. 
  Its size in 1989 (maximum) was: aktiv--20 persons, 
collective 
members--more than 500, individual members--70. In February 1992 
the aktiv was 4 persons, individual members were less than 30, 
and there were really no collective members. 
  Social-occupational composition: engineering-technical 
personnel, workers, students. Ages--from 20 to 55 years. 
  Source of financing--dues. 
  It does not have a press organ. Activities: on 5 July 1988 
an 
ecology rally was held on Teatralnaya Square, dedicated to World 
Environmental Protection Day and organized by independent groups 
(up to 3,000 participants). After the rally there was organized 
gathering of signatures (about 30,000) on an appeal to the 
Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet concerning the need for a 
fundamental improvement in the ecological situation in the city. 
Leaders of enterprises, the CPSU gorkom, and the gorispolkom who 
agreed with the assessment of the situation spoke. Members of 
the Rally-87 group (Sverdlovsk-Yekaterinburg, including S. 
Kuznetsov, who is now an RSFSR people's deputy) and independent 
journalists participated in the rally. 
  On 14 July 1988 a session of the gorsoviet devoted to 
discussion of ecological problems was held. Club representatives 
spoke at it, criticizing the measures proposed by the 
authorities to normalize the situation and calling these 
measures intolerable (large expenditures and small impact). 
  On 30 July 1988 Purification conducted a silent protest by 
women (30-40 persons) in front of the entrance to the 
metallurgical combine (against the ecologically harmful 
equipment of the combine). 
  In September 1988 the Resurrection ["Vosrozhdeniye"] public 
committee was formed on the basis of the group for socioeconomic 
problems, the group to save the A. Nevskiy Cathedral, and some 
EKO members (problems areas were ecology, preservation of 
architectural monuments, and the like). 
  During the 1989 election campaign for USSR people's 
deputies, 
the club members together with the Resurrection group actively 
supported the candidacy of Kudrin, who was running in the 
national-territorial district, and organized meetings with the 
voters for him. 
  On 12 February 1989 they held a rally devoted to the city's 
ecological problems (800-900 persons participated). At the rally 
club activists called on voters to vote for candidates who were 
fighting for ecology. 
  V. A. Baklanova, member of the council of the Purification 
Club, was nominated as a candidate for USSR people's deputy from 
the Movement for Democratic Elections coalition (formed in early 
1989 by the Purification and Resurrection groups), but she was 
not elected. 
  On 11 August 1989 a drawing contest on asphalt for children 
was organized, with ecology topics, under the slogan: "Live, 
Land!" 
  In the course of 1988-1989, open meetings of the club were 
held weekly (15-70 persons participated) at the Yubileynyy DK. 
  Later the organization's activities in reality ended. In 
1990 
meetings began to be held once every 2 months, and then they 
stopped entirely. There was just one meeting in 1991. Only in 
January 1992 was an attempt made to revive the club; a new 
chairman (V. A. Baklanova) was elected and goals for further 
action were outlined. 
  The club is a member of the Social-Ecological Alliance (see 
article).

<H3>  Movement in Defense of Baikal ["Dvizheniye v zashchitu 
Baykala"] </H3>
  The movement originated in May 1987 among scientific 
associations in Akademgorodok and was registered in 1988. There 
were no more than 60 members at the end of 1988, primarily 
scientists, students, and engineering-technical personnel. They 
had five leaders. There were no by-laws or program. The movement 
had five branches (Angarsk, the Angara Ecology Movement, Baikal, 
Bratsk, and Ust-Ilimsk). 
  Goal--to defend Lake Baikal against harmful discharges and 
uncontrolled industrial construction. "The principal enemy is 
the pulp and paper combine" (the Baikal Pulp and Paper 
Combine--TsBK). 
  Forms of work: doing practical scientific research, 
organizing and holding ecology rallies, and others. 
  Among the movement's activists are Vera Sekerina, Anatoliy 
Sosunov, Viktor Madonov, and T. Amarkhanova. 
  They did not have a press organ. 
  The movement is a member of the Social-Ecological Alliance 
(see article). 
  In 1987-1988 the movement set up "Baikal defense posts" and 
organized several rallies. The first rally was held in the 
summer of 1987 (1,000 participants). On 20 June 1987 the first 
Baikal defense post was organized at the railroad terminal 
square. On 26 November of the same year a rally against the 
pipeline carrying waste from the Baikal TsBK into the Irkutsk 
River was held on Constitution Square (about 8,000 
participants); a demonstration with the same slogans was 
conducted in May 1988 (10,000 participants). From May 1987 
through June of the next year 107,000 signatures were collected 
against construction of the pipeline. After the spring of 1989 
the rallies were stopped. 
  "There were some incidents with the militia during public 
actions." 
  In 1988 they participated in social-ecological conferences 
in 
Moscow and Odessa and in the all-Union social-ecological expert 
study of Baikal in Listvyansk. 
  In October 1988 they nominated their own candidate for the 
job of chairman of the oblast nature protection committee, but 
official organs rejected it. 
  In early 1989 they collected signatures to protest against 
construction of the Volga-Chorgay Canal. Several thousand 
signatures were collected, and the USSR Supreme Soviet was 
notified of this by telegram. 
  The movement joined the Baikal People's Front. It 
participated in the 1989 election campaign for USSR people's 
deputies. Along with other groups belonging to the Baikal 
People's Front, participants of the movement supported the 
candidacy of economist G. N. Filshin, who was elected USSR 
people's deputy. 
  In April 1989 the movement was the initiator in 
establishment 
of the Baikal Foundation (see article), after which activities 
within the framework of the movement ceased.

preservation of forests and protection of the plant and animal 
worlds, as well as problems linked to the use of nuclear energy 
and the construction and operation of AES's and GES's. 
  It took actions against construction of the Karelian AES, 
the 
GES in Panayarvi, a branch of the Skorokhod Footwear Factory 
(the site was taken out of a nature protection zone), and deep 
dispersion of waste water from the Segezha Pulp and Paper 
Combine (together with the Segezha and Loukhi groups), supported 
establishment of the Vudlozerskiy National Park (Pudozhskiy 
Rayon), and stopped logging in the Kish preserve. They were able 
to get the presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Karelian ASSR

planned financing for the group's planning projects, but no 
money was appropriated. The association was not successful in 
the elections. 
  In January 1990 the society participated in the antinuclear 
rally against construction of AES's and nuclear weapons testing 
on Novaya Zemlya (about 1,000 participants). On 26 April 1990

  It was founded on 12 July 1988 and is registered. 
  Goals: formation of a permanently operating ecological 
monitoring system and solution of cultural and ethnic problems 
(in particular, Adygey issues). 
  The committee organizes rallies, engages in publishing, 
participates in planning withdrawal of land for summer homes, 
identifies violations in the application of toxic chemicals and 
in forest uses, is organizing the Safari Park, makes surprise 
inspections to clean up the beach, and so on. 
  "The nucleus of the future committee formed before 
celebration of the official anniversary, the 150th anniversary 
of the city of Tuapse, in May 1988. A letter (19 signatures) was 
sent to the Party Control Commission of the CPSU Central 
Committee in which they expressed their protest against dating 
the founding of the city 'from the beginning of the destruction 
of the Adygey people.' On 4 June 1988 at a round table at the 
CPSU gorkom a promise was made not to hold the anniversary, but 
rather just a 'city celebration,' but the promise was not kept. 
(In Sochi, founded in the same year of 1838, subunits of 
internal troops were posted in Adygey villages to prevent 
possible incidents)." 
  On 12 July 1988 (after changing the time twice) an ecology 
rally was held in Tuapse on the embankment by the monument to 
the destroyer Kerch (500 participants, including members of the 
Pilgrim Communard Club, the Acacia Garden Society, and 
participants in the Neburg school ecology expedition). Although 
representatives of official bodies interfered in the conduct of 
the rally, the participants adopted an independent resolution by 
a majority of votes. This resolution contained a point on lack 
of confidence in the six leaders of the city (including A. 
Grabovets, first secretary of the CPSU gorkom and interrayon 
procurator). The point was included in a draft resolution by a 
majority of votes of the members of the rally organizing 
committee. The resolution also contained a point on setting up a 
public committee for ecological monitoring. A list of committee 
members was submitted by the rally organizing committee. 
  During the election campaign in the spring of 1989, 
committee 
members distributed Academician A. D. Sakharov's "Decree of 
Power" and the co-report of the interregional deputy group. 
There was friction with the local leadership because they 
supported the candidacy of A. O. Karaulov for USSR people's 
deputy (he was victorious in the election). 
  The committee proposed Aleksandrov, director of a plant, as 
candidate for mayor of Tuapse (as of 25 January 1992 he still 
had not been appointed). 
  In April 1989 they conducted a volunteer work day to clean 
up 
the channel of the Pauk River (about 300 people helped, 
including the deputy chairman of the gorispolkom). 
  In June 1989 the ecology plans of the public committee were 
reviewed by the public nature protection council. The ispolkom 
of the city soviet and the CPSU gorkom rejected the plans. 
  They put together exhibitions on the "Window of Ecological 
Information" board. The Pilgrim Club, which belongs to the 
public committee, organized a communard labor camp, called 
Piligrimsk-8, in the summer of 1989. 
  Since early 1990 the committee has focused its activities 
entirely on the plan for Safari Park (the plan involves 
allocating a segment of the city woods for a park where animals 
would live in a semifree setting; the park would be open for the 
public to visit). After 2 years of work the committee was able 
to get land released for a park. The Moscow Institute of 
Structures for Culture, Recreation, and Public Health had 
developed and approved an official plan, the creation of Safari 
Park was announced, a logo was made, the directors of the 
botanical (V. Chernova) and financial (S. Smolyev) parts of the 
plan were appointed, and an account was opened in the bank. 
  In 1989 the committee aktiv (cochairmen) was 23-24 persons, 
and up to 50 took part in activities: members of the Pilgrim 
Club (commissar G. Chernovol), tourists, mountain climbers, and 
hunters. Their average age is 40, and office workers 
predominate. They have by-laws which envisioned an auditing 
structure, individual membership, membership cards and dues, a 
press, an emblem, and so on. 
  The committee is directed by eight cochairmen elected in 
1989: V. I. Yefimenko. V. P. and G. I. Chernovol, Yu. A. 
Garenkov (deputy to the gorsoviet), Ye. A. Gayenkova (sponsors 
ecological education of school children), S. N. Smolyev (an 
associate at the Nika NPKhO [expansion unknown] and commercial 
director of Safari Park), N. A. Tesheva, and B. P. Zaremba. 
  Their source of financing is dues. 
  The committee is a member of the Social-Ecological Alliance 
(see article). It collaborates with other organizations that 
belong to the SoES, with nongovernmental organizations of 
Krasnodar and Sochi, including ecology groups, and also with the 
Committee for Constitutional Supervision of Krasnodar Kray.

<H5>    Green World--Resurrection ["Zelenyy mir--vosrozhdeniye"] </H5>
  This is an ecology group that appeared as the result of 
conflict with the leaders of Green World (see article). The 
leader is S. Panov. They adhere to ethnocratic positions and 
consider it essential that the status of the Russian-speaking 
population be fixed in the Constitution as the "primary ethnic 
factor" of Russia. The group is oriented to alliance with the 
Orthodox Church and participated actively in organizing the mass 
baptism of local inhabitants. They plan, together with the 
Church, to move inhabitants of the Chernobyl zone to Krasnoyarsk 
Kray. 
  In January 1992 S. Panov declared himself cochairman of the 
Russian Greens Party (see article) for Siberia and tried to 
create a "patriotic" faction in the RPZ. But his membership in 
the RPZ was rejected by the party. In February 1992 ZM-V put out 
a newspaper GREEN PEACE in the name of the RPZ, which also 
elicited protest from the international organization of the same 
name (see article). 
  At a conference of ecology groups in St. Petersburg on 28-29 
February 1992, S. Panov acknowledged that he has no relationship 
with either RPZ or Greenpeace and gave a public apology for his 
actions.

<H5>    Bureau of Ecological Developments ["Byuro ekologicheskikh </H5>

razrabotok"] (BER) 
  It was organized in mid-1986. It has an aktiv of 4-10 
persons; about 200 persons (mainly specialists) collaborate with 
the BER. It operates on a cost accounting basis. 
  The bureau works in close contact with nature protection 
organizations and official organs. It performs ecological expert 
studies of economic plans and administrative decisions, develops 
alternative designs and technologies, and familiarizes the 
population with ecology law. 
  About 50 local ecological crises have been surmounted with 
the bureau's help. They were able to achieve stoppage of 
construction of the oil tanker terminal near Vyborg, formation 
of a cooperative to process TVTs [expansion unknown], a 
reordering of land use in the oblast, the rescue of parks within 
the city limits, and other things. 
  In 1986 BER participants published about 70 articles on 
ecology in the Leningrad press. In January 1988 the first issue 
of the collection of BER articles entitled "Zazerkalye" [Behind 
the Mirror] was published, 30 pages, and publication was halted. 
  On 8 August 1989 the bureau together with representatives of 
the city Red Cross committee, the city Charity Society, the 
Dezaurus and Femina groups, and USSR People's Deputy D. Granin 
participated in a trip to the city of Sosnovyy Bor, organized by 
the Christian Democratic Union of Leningrad. Their purpose was 
to study the population's living conditions. During the trip it 
was confirmed that there had been two accidents at the Leningrad 
AES and NITI [expansion unknown] in which there were human lives 
lost. From medical personnel they obtained information on a 
sharp increase in the number of congenital anomalies among the 
local population. Participants in the trip demanded the 
formation of a government commission to study living conditions 
in Sosnovyy Bor. The action was covered by Leningrad television 
and the press. 
  In May 1990 the bureau waged a cutting polemic with the 
Leningrad (St. Petersburg) Greens Party (see article); it arose 
mainly from personal factors. 
  In the fall of 1991 the BER was a key structure in 
organizing 
the Green Train, which collected information for the Brazil-92 
conference. 
  The bureau has existed at the Leningrad (St. Petersburg) 
Center for Creative Initiative since 1986; it is a member of the 
Social-Ecological Alliance (see article) and the Greens Movement 
(see article). 
  The director of the BER is Yu. S. Shevchuk, a participant in 
the nature protection movement since 1978 and author of an idea 
of geopathogenic zones according to which a number of cultures 
are moving toward environmental destruction because of their 
corresponding mentalities.

<H5>    Delta ["Delta"], Ecological Association </H5>
  This is an informal organization. It was formed in 1986, or 
on 12 April 1987. 
  Program goals: prevent ecological disaster, stop further 
destruction of the human habitat, and harmonize relations in the 
society-nature system. 
  Tasks: conduct of independent ecological expert studies, 
participation in social planning for the Leningrad and Baltic 
regions, and conduct of the necessary political activities to 
"incline the leadership of the city and country to immediate 
solutions of ecological problems." 
  Methods of work: organization and conduct of debates and 
round table discussions; organization of and participation in 
rallies and regional and international ecology conferences; and 
promotion of the appearance of operation of ecology-oriented 
political organizations, and the like. 
  The group's first action was conducting debates on the 
topic: 
"Ladoga, Neva, Gulf: Problems of Ecology" (4 June 1987). 
  On 17 May 1987 a citywide rally was organized under the 
title, "The Health of the City Is in the Hands of the 
City-Dwellers" (several thousand participants). 
  On 18 May 1987 a protest rally was held against the first 
version adopted of the "Provisional Rules on Conducting Rallies 
and Marches." 
  Since 1988 Delta has been a participant and one of the 
organizers of the annual international conference called, 
"Baltic-88," "Baltic-89," and so on. 
  Members of the association struggled against the Leningrad 
dike during its construction. They believe that the dike should 
be removed because it is harmful, not necessary. 
  The group took an active part in organizing and conducting 
ecology actions in Leningrad devoted to International Earth 
Day-90 (22 April). P. V. Kozhevnikov (leader of the group from 
1987 who was subjected to attacks from enemies of the group in 
the late 1980s) was ratified as coordinator of the international 
action on the Soviet side. On 21 April 1990 they, together with 
the Leningrad Christian Democratic Union, the Russian Christian 
Ecological Alliance (see article), and the Greens Alliance (see 
article), organized a rally (about 500 participants). Ecological 
and anticommunist slogans predominated at the rally. 
  At the initiative of Delta two new political organizations 
were formed: the Greens Party (October 1989, see article) and 
the Russian Christian Ecological Alliance (October 1989, see 
article). 
  Delta structures its work on the basis of its by-laws and 
program (approved on 12 April 1987). Membership is recorded. 
There is an aktiv of 20 persons. They are chiefly 
intelligentsia. The coordinating organ is called the provisional 
bureau. 
  Group member Pomogayev was elected a deputy to the Leningrad 
Soviet in 1990. 
  Delta is a collective member of the Ecology and Peace (see 
article) and Social-Ecological Alliance (see article) 
organizations; since 1987 it has been a member of the Leningrad 
Center for Creative Initiative.

Sankta-Peterburga"] </H3>
  This is a city organization. It was registered in March 1990 
by the ispolkom of the Moskovskiy Rayon Soviet of People's 
Deputies of the city of Leningrad. In January 1991 it was 
registered by the presidium of the Lensoviet. 
  In August 1990 there were about 150 persons in the party, 
and 
in August 1991 about 600. Among them were scientists, writers, 
and deputies of the Lensoviet and raysoviets. 
  The cochairmen of the party are Vladimir Aleksandrovich 
Gushchin and Ivan Blokov. 
  Party by-laws were developed and adopted, and they share the 
Declaration of the Russian Greens Party (see article). 
  Initial tasks--change the orientation of investment in the 
social development of the city, create conditions to attract 
tourists and thereby help the city, combat ecologically harmful 
production facilities, and fix up the city. To do this party 
members join into temporary groups based on interests. Later the 
groups became politicized. 
  Party members took part in conducting the Earth Day 
celebration. 
  The Greens Party strives to avert a possible disaster 
because 
toxic substances whose storage life in sea water is no more than 
50-100 years have been buried in the Baltic Sea. The bulk of the 
toxic substances were buried in 1946-1947 by the Allies in the 
anti-Nazi coalition--Great Britain, the USA, and the USSR. 
Burial of military toxic substances continued until the 1980s. 
The "critical time" is now approaching. The St. Petersburg 
Greens Party gathered this information and submitted it to the 
USSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the USSR Ministry of Defense, 
the president of the USSR, and the USSR KGB, suggesting that 
government structures establish precise data and make it 
available to the public. The Greens Party called the attention 
of Russian governmental organs and foreign organizations to this 
problem. 
  The Greens Party wages a struggle against illegal logging in 
the Karelian Isthmus. In April 1991 it began investigating the 
death of Nina Zuyeva, a volunteer nature protection inspector 
who was found hanged in the Priozersk City Division of Internal 
Affairs (see VOOP, Leningrad general staff of the VOOP 
inspection office). Two attempts have been made on the life of 
party cochairman V. Gushchin in connection with this case. 
  At the initiative of the Greens Party, a decision was 
adopted 
to move people out of a building on Kurlyandskaya Street where 
because of ecological factors mortality was significantly higher 
than the average for St. Petersburg. 
  In May 1991 the Leningrad Greens Party was one of the 
principal organizers of the founding conference of the Russian 
Greens Party. 
  In February 1992 the St. Petersburg Greens Party was one of 
the principal organizers of the conference of nongovernmental 
ecology organizations devoted to the conference in Brazil. 
  The party has far-reaching international ties; the closest 
ties are with the Greens Party of Finland. 
  The party includes the Eco-Rock youth groups. The party set 
up the Ekostroitel cooperative. Its program is to build and 
develop recreation centers for establishments and enterprises 
with minimal harm to the environment.

<H3>    Council for the Ecology of Culture ["Sovet po ekologii 
kultury"] </H3>
  This is an information and coordinating center. It expresses 
most fully the principles of the so-called ecological-cultural 
movement. 
  It was formed in late 1986. It has been registered at the 
Leningrad Branch of the Culture Foundation since March 1988. 
  Areas of work--information and coordination support for 
people working in the field of the ecology of culture. Forms of 
work--organization of meetings of representatives of groups that 
belong to the council for the purpose of coordinating their 
joint work, publishing, and the like. 
  The chief initiator in forming the SEK was the Salvation 
Group (see article). In addition to it, the Bureau of Ecological 
Developments (see article) has belonged to the council from the 
beginning, as have the Commune ["Mir"] volunteer association 
(association of non-professional historical restoration workers 
which has existed since 1986, restores structures on the islands 
of Kizhi and Valaam, and is registered with the Dzerzhinskiy 
Rayon Ispolkom in Leningrad--aktiv is 30 persons), and Club-81 
(information association of literary figures, named after the 
year of its origin). In January 1987 the SEK was registered at 
Club-81. 
  In the first, relatively peaceful period of its existence, 
the council organized several popular science seminars on 
history at the DK Iyicha. After the Angleterre events (they 
participated in the picketing to defend the Angleterre Hotel 
from demolition on 16-18 March 1987), they found themselves in 
stark opposition to city authorities, which demanded unity and 
the appropriate organizational formalities. 
  On 27 March 1987 the founding meeting was held (the local 
press responded to it); after it a program and by-laws were 
adopted which did not in fact operate. An attempt was made at 
this founding meeting to join with a number of new organizations 
such as TEII [expansion unknown], New World ["Novyy mir"] (a 
group of amateur historical restorationists, in existence since 
1987, it had separated from the Commune group and worked on the 
A. S. Pushkin Apartment Museum on the Moika and restoration of 
the Benua wing of the Russian Museum; aktiv--20 persons), Delta 
(see article), and a number of others. It soon became clear, 
however, that there were significant differences in the goals of 
the particular groups and their leaders, which led to a schism 
in April 1987. Some of the groups withdrew from the council and 
organized the council of the Epicenter Cultural-Democratic 
Movement (which collaborated with the SEK, being more 
politicized in nature). 
  On 21 March 1987 they conducted a rally in St. Isaac's 
Square 
to preserve monuments of culture; about 500-1,000 persons 
participated. 
  In mid-1990 SEK included the following ecology and 
ecological-cultural groups: the Salvation group, the Rural 
Commune volunteer association, Monument (see article), Friends 
of Ropshi, Battle of the Neva (an initiative group of historical 
restorationists formed in May 1987 which is engaged in 
restoration of the Aleksandr Nevskiy church, is registered at 
the Kolpinskiy Rayon ispolkom, and has an aktiv of 30 persons), 
Era, St. Petersburg (historical-cultural society, registered in 
1989 at the Leningrad city administration, interests include 
revitalizing sociocultural life among college students; aktiv 
2-5 persons), and the Artists Aid Society. 
  Because the program documents adopted at the founding 
meeting 
are not in effect, organizational work is structured on the 
basis of the "Statute on the SEK," which was adopted later. This 
statute was registered in the spring of 1988 by the presidium of 
the Culture Foundation. The Culture Foundation offered its 
premises for the weekly meetings of the SEK and sometimes gives 
financial help as well. 
  The council has set up: a scientific sector which conducts 
seminars; an artistic sector which organizes exhibitions and 
auctions; and a public sector which organizes people who are not 
included in stable groups. 
  Their print organ is VESTNIK SOVETA PO EK [Herald of the 
Council on the Ecology of Culture]. It has been coming out 
monthly since July 1987. The editor in chief is Mikhail Talalay, 
and members of the editorial board are S. Vasilyev, A. Kovalev, 
and V. Lurye. 
  One a month an oral presentation of VESTNIK would be held at 
the DK Ilyicha with an average of 100-150 persons participating.

<H3>    Salvation ["Spaseniye"], Group (GS, other name, Group To 
Save the Historical and Cultural Monuments of St. Petersburg 
[Leningrad] ["Gruppa spaseniya istoriko-kulturnykh pamyatnikov 
Sankt-Peterburga"]) </H3>
  It is involved in the ecology of culture. The group 
originated in 1986 during work to save the poet A. Delvig's home 
on Vladimirskaya Square from demolition. 
  There are 18 persons in the group, with higher education. 
Ages are 20-37 years. They hold various political views (some of 
them are supporters of syndicalist anarchism). Many do not 
engage in political activity at all. The group has supporters of 
active Christian enlightenment and non-believers. 
  There is no clearcut organizational structure. Goals: "To 
save historical and cultural monuments and promote change in the 
economic and political system in the direction of eliminating 
the factors that have a negative impact on the ecology of 
culture." In particular, the group "strives to change the nature 
of the ownership of buildings and the means of production in 
construction and historical restoration work." 
  Forms of work: rallies, picketing, volunteer work days, 
exhibits, expert counter-studies, and counter-plans. 
  The GS took an active part in the Angleterre events. They 
organized picketing on 16-18 March 1987 to defend the Angleterre 
Hotel from demolition. A public information post was operated 
until 1 June 1987. 
  The largest rallies (up to 1,000 persons) were devoted to 
city planning problems and preservation of old structures in 
various parts of Leningrad: Vladimirskaya Square, the Petrograd 
Side, Vasilyevskiy Island, and Rybatskoye. About 2,000 persons 
participated in the rally on Vladimirskaya Square on 19 March 
1988. On 14 June 1988 the GS together with other groups held a 
rally in Yusopov Garden in memory of the victims of Stalinism 
(about 3,000 participants). On 13 March 1988 the GS organized a 
rally against the "temporary rules for conduct of marches and 
rallies" (500 participants). 
  Results of the group's activities in 1987-1988: achieved 
cancellation of about 20 ispolkom decisions to demolish various 
buildings; promoted a several-fold reduction in the list of 
buildings to be demolished; and promoted a change in public 
opinion toward defending historical and cultural monuments and a 
change in the attitude of the city authorities toward the 
problem. Dozens of articles in the Leningrad and all-Union press 
were devoted to the group. 
  GS leader A. Kovalev was elected a deputy of the Lensoviet. 
The GS is collaborating with an analogous group, St. Petersburg. 
It is a member of the Leningrad Center for Creative Initiative 
(since August 1986) and is registered at the LTsTI [possibly 
Leningrad Center of Technical Information]. It was one of the 
founders and a constituent part of the St. Petersburg Council 
for the Ecology of Culture (see article). It is a member of the 
Greens Movement (see article). The group participated in the 
public committee to aid Armenia and collaborates with the 
Yerevan organization "Survival." 
  It is participating in publishing the Leningrad version of 
the journal OBSHCHINA [Commune]. 
  The group operates on a cost accounting basis. In 1990 the 
group's activity declined.

<H5>    Murmansk Oblast </H5>

<H5>  City of Murmansk </H5>
<H5>  Green Branch ["Zelenaya vetv"] </H5>
  Ecology club. It was formed in September 1989 at Murmansk 
Gymnasium-School No 51. The immediate reason for the club's 
formation was an abrupt worsening of the ecological situation in 
the microrayon. 
  Goal: "Instill ecological awareness in the inhabitants of 
the 
city of Murmansk and Murmansk Oblast and prevent an ecological 
disaster in the region." 
  Tasks: draw public attention to the ecological problems of 
the region; establish and strengthen contacts with international 
ecology organizations; influence local organs of authority to 
develop concrete policies to clean up the ecological situation 
in the region; organize ecological actions to clean up the city 
of Murmansk; and set up an "ecological nursery" in the city. 
  Forms of work: lectures, conferences and marches, collection 
of signatures, trips abroad by schoolchildren, and the like. 
  In September 1989 they prepared a survey (a photo album with 
attached materials) of the ecological state of their microrayon 
and gave it to the local organs of authority. They are proposing 
to do similar surveys each year. 
  In 1989-1990 they participated in development of the program 
of the international ecological action in Murmansk called "Next 
Stop." Together with members of a Danish ecology organization 
they took part in cleaning up after an accidental discharge of 
fecal waters from the Murmansk poultry factory. 
  In early 1990 some of the former members of the Christian 
Greens Movement (see article), which had fallen apart, joined ZV. 
  The club participated in the 1990 election campaign and 
joined the voter bloc formed by the city volunteer 
historical-educational society called Memorial. The Citizens 
Initiative Club, the city Democratic Platform Party club, the 
Union of Social Defense and Rehabilitation, the 
social-democratic society, and the oblast union of cooperative 
members also joined the bloc. 
  There was a coordinating center for the bloc's election 
campaign, and they organized duty watches at the voting 
precincts. As a result of the elections, about 30 of the bloc's 
candidates became deputies of the oblast soviet and about 20 at 
the city soviet. 
  In mid-May 1990 the club took part in an international 
ecology conference in Bergen, Norway. 
  They conducted protests during the debates in 1990 about 
construction of the Yokaganskaya AES and building new ships for 
the nuclear-powered fleet. 
  The organization is developing a model program of ecological 
education for secondary school and the pedagogical institute. 
They are conducting a regular class in School No 51, lecture 
work (for example, Professor Davydov, an associate at one of the 
Moscow institutes of the USSR Academy of Sciences, was invited 
by Green Branch and delivered lectures), seminars for oblast 
teachers (by January 1991 four seminars had been held), 
role-playing games, and the like. Ecology marches are 
increasingly infrequent and small (for example, 27 April 1991); 
they have collected signatures against construction of the 
nuclear-powered fleet and against deliberate contamination of 
the Barents Sea. 
  ZV collaborates with foreign ecology organizations (which is 
promoted by students at the gymnasium who study the English 
language). Contacts are maintained with 10 countries, including 
the following: 

  -  Norway: on 5-6 October 1991, a Soviet-Norwegian conference 
of ecology organizations was held in Murmansk. Ecologists from 
Murmansk and the oblast participated on the Soviet side; the 
Norwegians were represented by the Nature and Youth Association 
(the "sister" organization to Green Branch) and Stop the Death 
Clouds. ZV collaborates with the school of ecology at the Higher 
School in Alta (in December 1991 a group of 40 ZV members 
visited Alta); 
  -  Sweden: exchange of school classes (this cannot 
be considered a direct form of activity by Green Branch proper, 
but there are always ecologists in every group); 
  -  Great Britain: 
contacts with the Green organization Stop Hinckley A.F. (the 
fight against the AES in Hinckley), with a school in Nottingham, 
and with the Greens in Scotland; 
  -  USA: exchange with a school in 
Jacksonville; in August 1991 one of the secondary-school members 
of ZV participated in the annual conference held by Care Taken 
of Environment, an organization of ecology teachers (city of 
Cuzco, Peru); 
  -  Spain and Portugal: correspondence with schools 
that practice ecological education. 
  ZV has both individual members (mainly teachers and 
secondary 
school graduates, of whom there are 40) and collective members 
(the two oldest classes). At the October 1991 meeting, the 
council of six members was elected (G. A. Khoreva--geography 
teacher, Furman, Fanyushkina, Rogachev, Kreminskaya, and 
Pronkina) and a decision was adopted to submit documents for 
registration. (The R2,000 needed for registration is a problem.)

  In May-June 1988 activists of the group set up pickets 
(tents) at a small park which is a monument of park and garden 
architecture (it was to be razed to build the first metro 
station in the Nagornaya part of the city). About 20 persons 
participated directly in the picketing. Up to several hundred 
persons gathered around the pickets. Construction of the metro 
in the Nagornaya (historical) part of the city was suspended. 
  In January-April 1989 members of the council fought to 
preserve the mansion of the respected Nizhniy Novgorod citizen 
Yankin, a monument of 19th century architecture (Studenaya 
Street, Building 33a). As a result a commission from the RSFSR 
Ministry of Culture prohibited demolition of the monument and 
ordered a comprehensive study of the issue, but the mansion was 
demolished by the decision of the local authorities. Council 
activists prepared documents for a court hearing with the local 
authorities.

Section 
  The association emerged in 1985 from the radical part of the 
Volunteer Sobriety Society. It is registered. 
  The section conducts rallies. It has developed plans for 
alternative energy. Among other things, it is searching for an 
energy alternative to the GES proposed in Novosibirsk. On 7 June 
1988 the section, together with the Siberian Department of the 
USSR Academy of Sciences, conducted a conference on power 
engineering at which it presented and defended an alternative 
plan for development of the fuel-energy complex. 
  The leader is Bogdan Gavrilko. The total number of members 
is 
80. A majority of them are associates of the Siberian Department 
of the USSR Academy of Sciences; 20 percent are candidates and 
doctors of sciences, and about 20 percent are former CPSU 
members. 
  According to some evaluations, the members of the 
association 
initially held to a national socialist orientation, but since 
1990 anticommunists have dominated in the association. 
  In 1989 the section was admitted to the Social-Ecological 
Alliance (see article), which caused some participants in the 
SoES to protest.

<H5>  City of Omsk </H5>
<H3>  Green City ["Zelenyy gorod"], Social-Ecological Association 
(other name--Green World ["Zelenyy mir"]) </H3>
  It was founded in June 1988 based on a group at the NTTM 
[Youth Scientific-Technical Creativity] Center in Omsk. 
  The association has adopted by-laws. In 1989 30-50 persons 
participated in the weekly meetings at the Nature House. Since 
1989 meetings have been held in the Political Education House. 
The aktiv is 15 persons. The association's management organ is 
the council. 
  The association studies the condition of the air environment 
in the city, the level of its contamination, and the effect on 
public health. It makes observations of radiation discharges, 
conducts ecological expert studies, participates in the city 
debate tribune on ecology, holds conferences, organizes rallies 
and marches, and participates in political activity. 
  They have set up an information board in the center of the 
city. They worked to collect signatures against construction of 
the Southern Omsk Irrigation System and other undertakings 
without expert ecological studies. 
  In 1988 there was a conference on the issue of the state of 
the environment. 
  In December 1988 the association held a conference on 
questions of building a metro in the city. 
  In late 1988 they adopted an appeal to the citizens of the 
city concerning the ecological situation. Then they gathered 
about 6,000 signatures on it and in July 1989 sent all the 
signatures and an accompanying letter to the USSR Council of 
Ministers. 
  In 1989 they organized two major debates (several hundred 
people participated): on the eastern industrial center in the 
city, and about the plan to build a garbage-burning plant. 
(Representatives of the association spoke in favor of building a 
garbage processing plant, not a garbage-burning plant). 
  On 12 May 1989 they held a constituent meeting and adopted 
by-laws, a general conception of the ecology movement, and an 
appeal concerning the ecological situation in the oblast. They 
take part in sociopolitical actions together with other groups 
(preparation for the December 1988 rally and others). They took 
an active party in the 1989 and 1990 election campaigns. In the 
elections for USSR people's deputies, they supported A. K. 
Kazannik. In the summer of 1989 the association, together with 
the Dialog Club, collected signatures on a demand to transfer 
"nomenklatura" facilities--a dormitory, special polyclinic, the 
CPSU obkom dacha, and the like to the working people (by 
mid-August they had collected about 20,000 signatures). 
  On 13 August 1989, together with the Omsk sociopolitical 
club 
Dialog, the association participated in conducting a rally at 
DOSAAF Stadium with the title, "The Soviets and the Ecological 
Crisis" (2,500 participants). 
  On 18 June 1989 they participated in an information meeting 
of politicized "informal associations" of the city (in all about 
70 persons, 30 of them with full voting rights; 10 organizations 
were represented, including Dialog and Memorial). 
  On 3 June 1990 they conducted an ecology rally (300 
persons). 
Slogans demanding Russian independence rang out. 
  They took part in the conference of democratic movements of 
the city organized by the Omsk People's Front on 27 May 1990. 
Representatives of the Democratic Union, the Social-Democratic 
Party of Russia, Dialog, and the city voters club participated.

["Pegas"] Scientific Research Institute (or VNIIPIGAS). 
  Goal--to avert ecological disaster. Tasks--develop a program 
for ecological normalization of the region and re-equip harmful 
production facilities. Their primary work is directed against 
construction of the Orenburg combine to produce BVK. Forms of 
work: picketing and work by ZK representatives in soviets at 
various levels. 
  In early December 1988 they picketed with ecological slogans 
in front of delegates to the city party conference and passed 
out fliers to the delegates; on 16 December they picketed the 
oblast party conference. 
  The Green Committee took an active part in the 1989 election 
campaign for USSR people's deputy. Committee member V. A.

<H3>    Public Ecology Committee ["Obshchestvenno-ekologicheskiy 
komitet"] </H3>
  It originated after the newspaper VECHERNYAYA PERM in May 
1987 published an article about the ecological situation. They 
stepped up their work in early 1989 in connection with the start 
of surveying for construction of the Perm AES. 
  Goal: preserving habitat and averting an ecological disaster 
in the region and stopping construction of and rebuilding 
ecologically harmful production facilities. 
  Forms of work: rallies, collection of signatures, appeals, 
ecological monitoring, and participation in election campaigns. 
  In 1987 they collected signatures to an appeal by 
inhabitants 
of the city to the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Supreme 
Soviet demanding the creation of a government commission with 
broad powers to study the ecological situation in the city. 
Members of the Perm League of Communists participated in the 
committee's work. 
  In September 1987 they held a rally on ecological issues at 
the DK imeni Yu. A. Gagarin (about 700 persons participated). 
  Beginning in 1988 some participants of the OEK belonged 
concurrently to the ecology section of the Perm public political 
club Dialog. 
  In the last months of 1989, they conducted a signature 
collection campaign to hold a referendum in the city on the 
issue of building the AES. (The committee alone gathered about 
40,000 signatures. In all volunteer groups in the city collected 
80,000 signatures on appeals for a referendum or demands to 
reject construction of the plant.) As a result of the 
committee's propaganda activities and a series of mass actions, 
surveying work for construction of the AES was stopped. 
  They conducted surveys of public opinion and surprise 
inspections to monitor the nitrate content in food products. In 
late 1989 they compiled an ecological map of the city that made 
it possible to study the link between the degree of 
contamination in different parts of the city and the 
distribution of illnesses. 
  They participated actively in the election campaign. The 
results of the 1990 election of people's deputies of the RSFSR 
and local soviets showed that Yu. A. Shchipakin, the committee 
chairman, was elected deputy; in connection with this S. A. 
Mazein was elected the new committee chairman. 
  They have no by-laws or program. The aktiv in 1989 was 15 
persons. Ages are from 20 to 60. Social-occupational 
composition: scientific workers, blue collar workers, office 
workers, engineering-technical personnel. 
  Meetings were held twice a month in the DK of the Plant 
imeni 
F. E. Dzerzhinskiy. From May 1988 to the end of 1989 they 
published a bulletin (edited by Yu. Shchipakin, 1-3 pages, press 
run--from 50 to a few hundred copies). 
  In 1988 they put out the journal CHELOVEK I MIR [Man and the 
World]. They maintain ties with the Kirovskiy Rayon nature 
protection society and several employees of the epidemiological 
station. A few representatives of the committee are members of 
the Social-Ecological Alliance (see article). In 1990 the 
journal and bulletin were not published, and the committee 
practically ceased to exist.

  It was founded in February and officially registered in May 
1988 at the Geographic Society of the USSR Academy of Sciences. 
  Goal--harmonizing relations of man and nature. 
  Total members--50-100, aktiv--20. Coordinating council of 
seven members. They have by-laws and a program. The organization 
meets regularly in a building offered by the Geographic Society 
in the city of Vladivostok. It also operates in Arsenyev, 
Nakhodka, Dalnegorsk, Ussuriysk, and elsewhere. 
  It works on problems of defending the environment against 
the 
effect of nuclear energy. It protests against the construction 
of ecologically dangerous GES's and AES's in the Amur region and 
on the Iman and Ussuri Rivers (construction of a power plant on 
the Ussuri River was stopped in 1989). It fights against other 
forms of contamination of local bodies of water, including 
harmful discharges into the delta of the Amur River, and against 
logging the Ussuri taiga. It conducts surprise inspections to 
save the Amur Gulf resort zone and the Ussuri taiga. It favors 
conducting independent ecological expert studies. It conducts 
marches and rallies and publishes article in defense of the 
environment. 
  In 1988-1989 they held a series of rallies against 
construction of a GES in the Amur region. At the rally on 5 June 
1988 in a park in central Vladivostok, for example, about 1,000 
persons participated and about 3,000 signatures were gathered in 
support of their demand. In 1989 they opposed a visit to the 
Port of Vladivostok by the nuclear-powered lighter carrier 
Sevmorput. 
  Since 1989 they have participated in preparing deputy 
queries.

<H5>    Ecology Center ["Ekologicheskiy tsentr"] (ETs) </H5>

  It was founded in November 1988 and has 10 members. 
  Goal--participation in solving the ecological problems of 
the 
city and Maritime Kray. 
  Tasks--struggle against AES's and against visits to the port 
by nuclear-powered ships. 
  Forms of work: rallies, collection of signatures, seminars, 
debates, and information displays. 
  At the initiative of the Ecology Center, a campaign was 
organized to collect signatures against construction of the 
hydroengineering complex on the Bolshaya Ussurka River and 
against construction of an AES at any of three proposed 
locations (more than 5,000 signatures were gathered). Members of 
the group consider these structures inadvisable because of the 
uniqueness of the natural zone of Maritime Kray (the ETs 
proposes that these zones be declared national parks). 
Signatures were collected (more than 9,000 signatures) and a 
rally was held against allowing the nuclear-powered lighter 
carrier Sevmorput to enter the Port of Nakhodka. Together with 
the Glasnost political club, they gathered more than 2,000 
signatures to an appeal to the government against construction 
of a dock to load potassium salts and an oil bunker pier. These 
appeals with signatures were sent to the CPSU Central Committee, 
the party gorkom, and the Ministry of the Maritime Fleet. 
  Together with the International Maritime Fraternity Club, 
they conducted annual ecology and peace "peace watches" (in 
which a total of up to 500 persons took part). During these 
activities they put up displays with information on the 
ecological situation in Maritime Kray and the country as a 
whole, on the activities of "information organizations" in 
different parts of the USSR, and on other issues, and there were 
meetings with representatives of the city authorities. 
  Members of the club regularly give lectures on ecological 
problems. They organize debates on ecological and sociopolitical 
problems in the library of the Construction Worker DK. It was 
proposed to set up a permanently operating seminar (together 
with the International Maritime Fraternity Club). 
  In July 1989 the ETs, the International Maritime Fraternity 
Club, and the Glasnost political club came forward with a call 
to form the Organizing Committee of the Nakhodka Democratic 
Front. The organizing committee included 10 persons, members of 
these clubs and other citizens. 
  In 1989 the ETs had 5 permanent members and about 10 persons 
in support groups. They were chiefly young people--cadets, 
workers, and intelligentsia. The members of the ETs belonged to 
the Nakhodka Nature Protection Society. 
  The ETs has published an information bulletin (one page, 
21-30 copies) and the journal GRAZHDANIN [Citizen] (40-60 pages, 
7 copies) since May 1989.

involving specialists from the USSR Academy of Sciences, public 
representatives, and independent foreign ecologists. 
  On 3 September 1989 in Theater Square, the center, together 
with the Don People's Front, held an unapproved rally in 
connection with construction of the Rostov AES, formation of the 
front, and preparations for elections (300-400 participants).

<H5>  Green Wave ["Zelenaya volna"] </H5>
  Social-ecological group (movement). It was founded in June 
1988. Total members: 12-15, age: 25-37 years. Technical 
intelligentsia, teachers, college instructors, and workers. 
  It fought against construction of the Rostov AES and for 
shutting down the Volgodonsk Chemical Plant. It gathered 
information about the ecological consequences of different types 
of production (including information on harmful discharges) in 
the oblast and published the material gathered, in fliers at 
first. 
  ZV and the Rostov Ecology Center (see article) demanded an 
independent social-ecological expert study of construction of 
the Rostov AES involving specialists from the USSR Academy of 
Sciences, public representatives, and independent foreign 
ecologists. 
  On 22 June 1988 the group prepared the first mandate for 
people's deputies from Volgodonsk and the leaders of the city 
and the oblast concerning improving the ecological state of the 
city environment. The text of the mandate was given to the 
press. The group made these mandates regular. 
  ZV members participate in holiday marches on 7 November (in 
1988 for the first time) carrying ecological slogans. 
  They took part in the round table discussion of AES problems 
that was held in Rostov-na-Donu in November 1988, a few days 
after the march. Group members spoke over the Atommash Plant 
radio, and published fliers. 
  The group was criticized in the local and oblast press and 
twice lost their premises. In October 1989 the administration of 
the school where ZV activist Yelena Malaya worked notified her 
that she was fired. The city authorities refused to review this 
matter. 
  They participated in preparation of the sections devoted to 
questions of ecology in the programs of people's deputy 
candidates in each election. They work with the deputy corps to 
achieve joint solutions to the various questions of protecting 
nature in the rayon. 
  They participated in forming the regional citizens committee 
called "For Closing the Rostov Atomic Plant," which organized 
the rally in Volgodonsk on 2 June 1990 under the slogan, "We are 
defending our children" (about 10,000 persons from Volgodonsk, 
Dubovka, Tsimlyansk, Novocherkassk, Semikarakorsk, Volgograd, 
and Rostov-na-Donu). A resolution was adopted demanding an 
immediate stop to construction of the AES. 
  ZV has been a collective member of the sociopolitical club 
Democratic Perestroyka since 14 November 1988, the date of its 
founding meeting. One of the leaders of ZV, A. Golubenko, 
belongs to the Confederation of Anarcho-Syndicalists. 
Representatives of Green Wave participated in the founding 
congress of the Social-Ecological Alliance (see article) in 
December 1988 and ZV has been a collective member of the SES 
since that time.

<H5>    City of Novocherkassk </H5>
<H5>  Green Don ["Zelenyy Don"] </H5>
  An independent ecological movement. It formed in 1988 and 
was 
registered on 14 March 1990 by the gorispolkom. 
  Goal: preserve and restore the natural and cultural riches 
of 
the Don region. 
  Forms of work: rallies, marches, independent expert studies, 
collection of information about ecological stress points, and 
"exposure of the predatory activities of departments and 
mercenary scientists." 
  They organized rallies on 5 August 1989 and 26 April 1990 
dedicated to the consequences of the Chernobyl accident with 
collection of money for the Chernobyl telephone marathon fund 
and to the need to stop construction of the Rostov AES. They 
organized collection of signatures on a demand to conduct an 
official expert study of the plan of the AES. ZD has been doing 
independent expert studies since the fall of 1989. 
  Green Don participates in the fight against expanding the 
ecologically dangerous production of butane-diol at the 
Novocherkassk Synthethic Products Plant. 
  ZD maintains regular contact with the city authorities, and 
the heads of ecologically dangerous production facilities report 
on their activity periodically to meetings of movement 
participants. 
  In the election campaign for people's deputies, they got 
several people onto the city and oblast soviets. 
  The aktiv is up to 50 persons. Membership is individual and 
collective. Social-occupational 
composition--engineering-technical personnel, teachers, 
students, office workers, and others. There are no dues. 
  The primary work is done by territorial cells. The movement 
has formed a Green Patrol group of schoolchildren and the 
creative association Don, which works to revive the traditions 
of bygone days in the Don region. 
  The chairman of the movement is V. V. Lagutov. They have no 
press organ, but publish articles in the large local newspapers 
and put out fliers and "ecoflashes" for internal use by 
activists prepared from information received from the public.

<H5>    Ryazan Oblast </H5>
<H5>  City of Ryazan </H5>
<H5>  Fatherland ["Otechestvo"] </H5>
  This is a club with an ecological-cultural orientation. It 
was formed in early 1987 at the Red Banner DK. It is registered 
at the oblast All-Union Society for the Protection of Monuments 
of History and Culture (VOOPIK) (see article). On 3 January 1988 
a program and by-laws were adopted which envisioned dues and 
individual membership. In 1989 membership was 24. Social 
composition: college and secondary students, workers. There is a 
club council (10 persons), and club secretary is M. A. Kachayeva. 
  Forms of work: regional studies excursions, evening meetings 
on special historical topics (assemblies), volunteer work days 
to restore monuments, and the like. 
  They are fighting actively against destruction of the 
floodplain (in late 1987 a draft Master Plan for Ryazan was 
approved which envisioned construction of a northern bypass 
highway on the floodplain in the zone of a protected natural 
landscape and the preserve land of the city kremlin [cathedrals 
of the 17th-19th centuries], development of a river freight 
port, and installation of a pressurized sewer collector system). 
In addition, intensive sand quarrying is going on for 
construction needs on Bolshoy Borkovskiy Island in the Oka 
floodplain, where there are remnants of an archeological complex 
of settlements (beginning from the 10th century B. C.). For this 
reason the club has difficult relations with its founding 
organization and the oblast leadership. 
  They are working in cooperation with the 5th of June group 
(see article).

<H5>    5th of June ["5-ye iyunya"] </H5>
  This is an ecology group. It was formed on 5 June 1988. The 
initiative group had existed since February 1988. In 1989 the 
group had 15 members and an aktiv of 6. The leader is Aleksandr 
Gavrilov. 
  Forms of work: rallies, picketing, collection of signatures, 
and participation in election campaigns. 
  They were persecuted by the authorities. 
  On 5 June 1988, on Environmental Defense Day, they took part 
in a rally at the Ryazan Kremlin which was organized by the 
Green Squad in connection with the ecological situation in the 
city and the irrational plan for installing the city sewer 
collector system (about 400 participants). On 24 June 1988 they 
participated in the second ecology rally organized by the Green 
Squad (800 persons). 
  From 18 June through 28 August 1988, they organized weekly 
information posts at the city department store. The displays at 
the post offered ecological information and political material 
received from Moscow groups. More than 15,000 signatures against 
construction of the city collector system were gathered. 
  On 15 December 1988 at the Oil Workers DK, they, along with 
ecologists from other groups, met the city authorities about the 
grave ecological situation, which had been greatly aggravated by 
the activity of the Italian Concceris Gigolo Company, which 
built a new leather plant in Ryazan. Mutual understanding was 
not reached. The company representatives who were present at the 
DK did not take part in the debate. 
  They participated in the election campaigns of 1989 and 1990 
as part of the Voters Club. 
  The group joined the Federation of Socialist Public Clubs 
(FSOK). It held to syndicalist-anarchist orientation. 
  In June 1988 they began publishing the almanac-reporter 
called "5-YE IUNYA" [5th of June] (20 pages, 10 copies). 
  The group ceased to exist in 1990.

<H5>  Alternative ["Alternativa"] </H5>
  This is an ecological-political club. Involved in ecological 
and political activity; announced its formation in July 1988 at 
the first People's Front rally; registered in October of the 
same year at the gorispolkom. About 30 people. 
  In theory develops the idea of the "third path" (not 
capitalism and not state socialism); this presupposes the 
development of self-government, nonindustrial forms of living, 
and destatization. 
  The task is to organize permanent ecological monitoring of 
the work of installations which are potentially dangerous to 
nature and to develop the population's ecological sophistication. 
  Forms of work are lectures and propaganda, rallies, 
picketing, and protest camps. 
  Involved in commercial activity and the profits from it go 
for ecology programs. 
  On 1 May 1989 they marched in a separate column along with 
representatives of the People's Front, the Samara 
social-democratic club, and others (in all about 60 people); 
some of their slogans were directed against the CPSU. 
  In April 1989 (the anniversary of the accident at the 
Chernobyl AES) organized an authorized march in the city. 
  The club opposed the construction of a garbage burning 
plant. 
Supported the Social-Ecological Club's struggle against 
construction of the Volga-Chogray Canal, and other things. 
  The club participated in the conferences of the 
Social-Ecological Alliance (see article) and the Greens Movement 
(see article) in which preparations for creating the Greens 
Party (see article) began. Alternative and the Samara Greens 
Alliance became sponsors and initiators of the All-Union 
Ecological Conference held in Kuybyshev (Samara) on 24 April 
1989 (attending were representatives of ecology organizations 
from roughly 15 cities: Moscow, Arkhangelsk, Lipetsk, 
Chelyabinsk, Almaty, and others). One of the results of the 
conference was the organization of the Movement To Create a 
Greens Party. The conference showed the crisis in the purely 
ecological movement and the rapid politicization of ecology 
groups. 
  Participated in organizing picketing of the plant to destroy 
chemical weapons in the city of Chapayevsk in Kuybyshev (Samara) 
Oblast: thousands of leaflets, picketing, rallies, 
demonstrations, and two tent protest camps around the plant from 
5 August through 10 September 1989 in which 25 members of the 
club and another 200-300 people took part. During the constant 
blockade the movement grew to 7,000 people. On 10 September the 
directive of N. I. Ryzhkov (at that time the prime minister of 
the USSR) changing the plant's specialization into an 
educational center was published and afterwards the picketing 
stopped. 
  Puts out an information leaflet. Together with the Greens 
Party publishes the journal TRETIY PUT [Third Path]. 
  Member of the Social-Ecological Alliance (see article). Part 
of the People's Front of Samara (Kuybyshev). In November 1989 
the authorities accused the club of violating its charter 
activity in connection with involvement in business and denied 
registration; this caused a sharp internal conflict and 
dissolution of the club. Some of the members continued public 
activity in the Greens Party and the "Samarskaya Luka" Club (see 
article).

<H5>  Frigate ["Fregat"], Society </H5>
  Goal is to create the Kuril Islands Association: a regional 
alliance which unites people with different convictions and 
views of the past and the future of the archipelago. 
  Membership in the society and the future association is 
secured only by practical actions. One of them is organizing 
provincial parks to monitor the influx of tourists, put up a 
barrier to plunderers of nature, keep its monuments under 
protection, and organize and monitor ecology paths. The parks' 
activity will be based on cost accounting and a large part of 
the monetary receipts will remain in the rayon's budget. 
  The society also supports demilitarization of the Kurils, 
which will help preserve and improve the natural environment.

  The initiative group (IG KSP) appeared in the spring of 
1988. 
The priority area of activity is ecology. In April 1988 
organized two volunteer ecology work days (several hundred 
people participated in one of them in Salinsk Park). On 26 
September 1988 the first rally devoted to ecology issues was 
held on the square near the Drama Theater at the initiative of 
the IG KSP (about 300 people participated). The second rally was 
organized there in February 1989 (about 3,000 participants). The 
main demand of those at the rally was to hold a referendum on 
the question of building the Dalnevostochnyy AES. (There are 
unique natural objects in the construction region). The rally's 
resolution with the demand to hold a referendum on the question 
of the AES's construction on the day of elections to the soviet 
of people's deputies (2,300 signatures) was delivered to the 
city soviet. Collected in the following months were 18,000 more 
signatures which were passed on to the First Congress of 
People's Deputies of the USSR through People's Deputy of the 
USSR V. D. Desyatov. 
  The KSP was formed at the founding conference on 19-22 July 
1989 as a non-professional sociopolitical organization. 
  The goals of KSP activity are: "consolidation of democratic 
forces to create a system of genuine people's power and a 
democratic socialist state."

meetings, collection of signatures, and mass ecological actions, 
participation in the election process, work with people's 
deputies, and other things.

  Trying to stop the contract with firms of the DPRK 
[Democratic People's Republic of Korea] to cut timber in the 
rayon. The Korean timber procurement concession in 
Verkhnebureinskiy Rayon operates on the basis of an 
intergovernmental agreement between the USSR and the DPRK of 15 
March 1967. There are 10,000 Koreans working in the DPRK timber 
procurement enterprise No 1 and they fell trees in 10 of the 
rayon's timber procurement establishments. In May 1990 the kray 
soviet of people's deputies adopted the decision to stop 
contract relations. But the cutting of trees was not stopped. 
According to data of the rayon committee on ecology and nature 
use, the Koreans leave 40 percent of the wood as waste, ruin the 
soil, and poach. [On 18 March 1992 in the settlement of Tyrma in 
Verkhnebureinskiy Rayon Korean proletarians beat up Russian 
ecologists (including the chairman of the rayon committee on 
ecology and nature use, Vladimir Khudayev) and correspondents of 
the German magazine DER SPIEGEL. The Koreans used Druzhba 
[Friendship] chainsaws to damage the helicopter which flew the 
ecologists in to conduct the expert study.

<H5>    Nuclear Safety ["Yadernaya bezopasnost"], Movement </H5>

  The movement's activists demand: "stop the further 
technological nuclear experiments in the Urals and change the 
specialization of the activity of the Mayak Production 
Association (with its radioactive discharges into the Tekha 
River in Southern Urals) to the rehabilitation and 
decontamination of the territory and underground waters polluted 
with radionuclides as a result of the use of 'dirty,' 
incompletely developed technologies." 
  Nuclear Safety fights against the construction of the 
Yuzhnouralskaya AES in the Tekha River valley. Rallies have been 
held with the movement's participation and about 300,000 people 
signed petitions demanding that construction, which had begun, 
be stopped. But in late 1990 the Chelyabinsk Oblast Soviet of 
People's Deputies adopted the decision: "Demand that the USSR 
Ministry of Atomic Energy and Industry immediately resume 
construction of the Yuzhnouralskaya AES as an indispensable 
installation for... stabilizing the ecological situation in the 
region of the Mayak Production Association and later improving 
it." The Chelyabinsk City Soviet of People's Deputies took a 
different posture: hold a referendum for Southern Urals 
residents on this issue on 3 March 1991. 
  The movement's coordinator is Natalya Mironova, a people's 
deputy of the Chelyabinsk Oblast Soviet.

  Organized in reality on 20 January 1991 at the first 
republic 
congress of ecology movements. More than 40 people from 6 of the 
republic's rayons spoke at the congress. The main issues raised 
were preventing the construction of a polycarbonate plant in the 
republic, the pollution of the Volga River, ground waters, 
farmland, and food products with chemical substances, and the 
excessive cutting of the forests. The congress adopted the 
party's by-laws and elected the coordinating council. Election 
of a chairman was postponed to the next congress because of the 
lack of a quorum. At the end of the congress a record of the 
first members of the party was made. Joining it were 73 people. 
  In 1991 coordinating council meetings were held every month. 
  At first collecting signatures for registering the party was 
the main activity. Legally it was registered on 18 December 1991. 
  Members of the party conducted an action against 
construction 
of a phosgene-based polycarbonate plant in the city of 
Novocherkassk. During the action 6,000 signatures were 
collected. The issue was examined in the Cheboksary City Soviet 
and the republic's Supreme Soviet. Construction was suspended.

<H5>    Yaroslavl Oblast </H5>
<H5>  City of Yaroslavl </H5>
<H5>  Green Branch ["Zelenaya vetv"], Ecology Club </H5>
  A city organization. Founded in 1988. 
  Its goal is to turn the basin of the Volga River into an 
ecologically clean region. The club fights to reduce harmful 
emissions into the atmosphere and water and protests against the 
construction of AES's. 
  The cochairman of the club is Lidiya Baykova. 
  Green Branch is a member of the Social-Ecological Alliance 
(see article). 
  On 25 February 1990 the club participated in a march and 
rally (the organizer was the Yaroslav People's Front) in support 
of the candidates of the Democratic Russia bloc on Truda Square 
(about 20,000 participants). 
  Together with other ecology organizations of Yaroslavl as 
well as of Tver, Nizhniy Novgorod, Ulyanovsk, Cheboksary, 
Volgograd, and Astrakhan, the club formulated proposals for the 
state program for decontaminating the Volga-Caspian Region: 

  -  within a year of the day a Law on Nature Protection is 
adopted, obligate all organs of state power, all levels of 
soviets, ministries, and departments to stop increasing the 
number of industrial enterprises on the territory of the Volga 
River basin and allow renewal at old production sites, on the 
condition that no-waste technologies are created; 
  -  cut the 
amount of chemical production in half by abandoning toxic 
chemicals in agriculture and reducing the use of mineral 
fertilizers; 
  -  stop the operation of the Astrakhan, Tengizskiy, 
and Karachanaksiy oil and gas fields until no-waste production 
facilities are fully created; 
  -  prohibit construction of new and 
freeze existing nuclear power plants on the Volga; 
  -  do not erect 
more canals and cut off other attempts to withdraw water from 
the Volga, return the natural flow to all Volga dams, lower the 
water level in reservoirs, and completely dismantle the 
Volgograd GES; 
  -  power losses should be compensated by reducing 
the export of raw materials and fuel abroad and eliminating 
energy-intensive, especially dangerous chemical production 
facilities. 

    These proposals were examined at the Conference of Members 
of 
the RSFSR Supreme Soviet Committee on Ecology with 
representatives of ecology organizations of the land along the 
Volga no later than 11 July 1991. Deputies who attended the 
meeting made the decision to try to convince the rest of the 
members of the Ecology Committee and the RSFSR Supreme Soviet to 
single out a special Volga chapter in the Law on Nature 
Protection.

<H5>    "Zelenyy svit" (Green World) </H5>

  An ecological association. 
  The name "Zelenyy svit" is usually not translated into 
Russian and other languages in texts and the Ukrainian name 
remains in transliteration. 
  The association emerged at a meeting of primarily creative 
intelligentsia. The ZS was formed in December 1987 on the base 
of the meetings of creative intelligentsia alarmed at the 
ecological condition of Ukraine and the consequences of 
Chernobyl and was supported by the UkSSR Writers and 
Cinematographers unions. According to the by-laws, the founder 
of ZS is the Ukrainian Peace Defense Committee (UKZM). 
  The organizational center is in Kiev. The ZS has branches 
not 
only on the territory of Ukraine, including oblast and rayon 
branches and primary cells of the ZS at enterprises and 
institutions but also associated organizations and groups which 
in turn include collective members. Some of the groups which are 
part of the association, in particular those which participated 
in the First ZS Congress or joined the association later have 
their own names, including the Social-Ecological Initiative 
Association (Dneprodzerzhinsk) (see article), the Ecological 
Association "Zelenyy Rukh-Karpati" (Kalush, Ivano-Frankovsk 
Oblast) (see article), the Crimean Association Ecology and Peace 
(see article), and others. 
  In February 1990, according to the report of the ZS 
leadership, the number of branches reached 300. Large ZS 
branches exist in places where AES's exist or are being built, 
where ecologically dirty chemical industry enterprises and 
military installations are located, and in ecologically 
unfortunate large cities (Kiev, Kharkov, Odessa, and the mining 
centers). 
  Large organizations exist in Kharkov, where the movement 
emerged earlier than in Kiev. In Nikolayev in cooperation with 
the authorities the Greens prevented the expansion of the 
Yuzhnouralskaya AES. In Lvov and Ivano-Frankovsk oblasts, 
together with Rukh they are waging a fight against the North 
American enterprise Arnika and other ecologically dangerous 
objects. In Odessa they are protesting the expansion of the 
Southern Port to import African phosphates and are waging a 
fight against the transport of ammonia through Odessa by 
pipeline. The Crimean organization Ecology and Peace managed to 
get construction of the Crimean AES canceled. The 
Transcarpathian Greens oppose construction of the military radar 
station in Mukachevo. Large organizations also exist in Poltava, 
Kremenchug, Nikopol, Mariupol, and Gorlovka. 
  Neither the by-laws nor the program of the ZS adopted at the 
first congress make any mention of the language (or languages) 
of the organization. 
  The goal of the ZS is to combine the efforts of citizens and 
organizations of Ukraine in the cause of rectifying the 
ecological situation in the republic and ensuring the normal 
coexistence of man and the environment. 
  The by-laws envision individual and collective membership. 
Citizens who recognize the program and by-laws and participate 
in nature protection activity in one of the cells or an elected 
organ of the ZS may be members of the ZS. A ZS member is issued 
a certificate and a chest badge. The following may be collective 
members: 

  -  ecological associations (including cooperatives and 
scientific-technical centers); 
  -  ZS cells at enterprises, 
institutions, and organizations, as well as city and regional 
cells or centers of the ZS. 

    According to the report of the association's leadership, the 
size of the ZS at the time it was organized (January 1988) was 
27 people, but by January 1990 it had reached 160,000 members 
and--counting organizations which were collective members--up to 
500,000. 
  The highest body of the ZS is the republic congress convened 
once every 2 years. The congress adopts the by-laws and program 
of the ZS, introduces amendments and additions to them, elects 
the green council ("Zelena Rada"), the chairman of the ZS and 
his deputies, the secretariat, the managers of the executive 
organs, and the editor of the press organ. The green council is 
the main executive and representative organ of the ZS which 
coordinates ZS activity in the periods between congresses. The 
green council convenes the ZS congress, has the right of 
legislative initiative and the right to sue enterprises and 
institutions in connection with damaging the environment, 
represents the ZS in institutions and organizations of the 
republic and the USSR, and nominates candidates for deputies to 
the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine and local soviets of Ukraine. For 
the green council to adopt a decision, more than half of its 
members must be present. 
  The secretariat is the ZS standing organ which coordinates 
its activity in the period between meetings of the green council 
and handles routine organizing work. 
  The chairman of the ZS is People's Deputy of the USSR Yuriy 
Nikolayevich Shcherbak and the deputy chairmen are corresponding 
member of the UkSSR Academy of Sciences Dmitriy Mikhaylovich 
Grodzinskiy (on issues of science), Yuriy Anatolyevich Tkachenko 
(on issues of culture), Anatoliy Mikhaylovich Panov (on 
organizational issues), and Andrey Pavlovich Glazovoy (on issues 
of propaganda and information). 
  The ZS is a free association of fairly diverse groups and 
associations and collective members of the ZS. 
  According to the ZS by-laws, the regional ZS branches may 
elect their own secretariat and council to coordinate the 
activity of local cells. The organizational structure of the 
collective members (including the local ZS branches) is 
distinguished by diversity. For example, there are two 
cochairmen at the head of the Ternopol Territorial Organization 
of the ZS as well as a chairman of the executive secretariat, in 
an organization of 820 people (according to data as of April 
1990). In the Sumy Public Ecological Association of ZS, a 
council with 33 people was elected to organize general 
leadership, while 3 cochairmen with equal rights and a 
secretariat (3 people) were elected from the council for 
operational management of the work. 
  The charter forms of ZS activity are: organization and 
conduct of scientific conferences, seminars, lectures, contests, 
press conferences, picketing, rallies, marches, and other 
events; the creation of an information bank on the ecological 
situation in Ukraine; and conduct of public ecological expert 
studies; as well as active participation in peacekeeping and 
nature protection events of the Ukrainian Peace Defense 
Committee (UKZM). 
  The following are the basic stages of activity of the ZS: 
  March 1988--participation in a conference on problems of the 
accident at the Chernobyl AES. 
  On 25 April 1988 conduct, along with other organizations, of 
an unsanctioned march in Kiev in connection with the second 
anniversary of the Chernobyl accident. 
  On 25 April 1989 ZS was constituted at the All-Ukrainian 
Conference of Greens. Provisional by-laws were adopted. 
  On 28-29 October 1989 was the first ZS congress in Kiev. 
By-laws and a program were adopted and the green council and the 
secretariat were elected. Yu. N. Shcherbak was elected chairman 
of the ZS. The council of representatives, "Zelena Rada," and a 
board of experts were elected and an independent ecofund was 
created. There were more than 100 groups in the ZS. 
  Adopted at the congress were the resolutions "On the 
Ecological Crisis in the Crimea" and "On the Accident at the 
Chernobyl AES" and appeals to the Council of Ministers and the 
Supreme Soviet of the UkSSR in connection with Dzharylgach Gulf 
and the consequences of Chernobyl. 
  But charges were made against the documents adopted at the 
congress in some ecological information media. For example, the 
newspaper BLITS. VESTNIK DOP, No 2, for 1990 (publication of the 
Ozone Ecocenter in Kharkov) asserts that the congress itself and 
the documents adopted there bore evidence of haste. 
  ZS was dismissed from elections of people's deputies of the 
UkSSR, since the registration of the ZS by-laws at the State 
Nature Committee envisioned participation only in elections to 
the local soviets. As a sign of protest against discrimination 
against ZS during elections, Yu. N. Shcherbak withdrew his 
candidacy. Nonetheless, some people's deputies of Ukraine are 
members of the ZS. They are A. Kotsyuba and V. Shovkoshitnyy 
(from Kiev), M. Golubets (from Ivano-Frankovsk Oblast), V. 
Batalov (from Rovno Oblast), A. Gudima (from Volynia Oblast), T. 
Nagulko and L. Dorofeyeva (from Khmelnitskiy Oblast), B. 
Zadorozhnaya (from Zaporozhye Oblast), and V. Terekhov (from the 
Crimean Oblast). Yu. Shcherbak and L. Sandulyak are people's 
deputies of the USSR. 
  On 23 March 1990 was a meeting of the initiative group on 
creating the Greens Party of Ukraine (the future creation of 
this party was envisioned by a resolution of the first 
congress), which adopted the draft by-laws and program of the 
Greens Party of Ukraine (see article). 
  In April 1990 was participation, along with Rukh and other 
organizations, in measures related to the Chernobyl accident; a 
rally and a march on the streets of Kiev on 22 April 1990 (up to 
100,000 people participated) and the All-Ukraine Requiem for 
Victims of the Accident. 
  In April 1990 the first issue of the newspaper ZELENIY SVIT 
(or ZELENYY SVIT) envisioned by the by-laws of the ZS press 
organ, came out. The editor of the newspaper is Mikhail 
Prilutskiy. The initial print run was about 10,000. The 
newspaper comes out twice a month in eight pages in the 
Ukrainian language. 
  Thanks to the intervention of the ZS association among 
others, the burial of domestic and industrial waste near the 
village of Lesnaya Tarnovnitsa in Ivano-Frankovsk Oblast was 
prevented (RABOCHAYA GAZETA, Kiev, 8 June 1990). 
  On 12 December 1990 the green council adopted the decision 
to 
do an independent public investigation of the circumstances of 
the Chernobyl catastrophe and its consequences. The goal was to 
provide a legal evaluation of the facts related to the accident 
at the Chernobyl AES and prepare proposals to change existing 
legislation in order to reduce the likelihood of a repetition of 
the catastrophe. The group of independent jurists conducting the 
investigation obligated themselves to gather the materials, 
analyze them, and draw up a substantiated conclusion for a 
public hearing on the results of the investigation before April 
1991. In April 1991 the newspaper ZELENYY SVIT published a ZS 
letter with an appeal to the authorities, public organizations, 
labor collectives, editorial offices of newspapers, and 
individual citizens requesting them to assist the investigation. 
  No later than March 1991 the party along with the Greens 
from 
the Clamshell Alliance (United States) and the Children of 
Chernobyl Foundation (United States) began the action Project 
Vitamin to defend human rights in Ukraine. One of the methods 
for helping the victims of the nuclear accident is to ship 
vitamins or money to buy them to people who live in the zones of 
radioactive contamination. It is planned that several more of 
the world's ecology organizations will take part in the action. 
  The second congress of the association was no later than 
April 1991 in Ivanovo-Frankovsk. The congress approved the 
Ukrainian parliament's demand for an immediate and complete 
shutdown of the Chernobyl AES. The congress elected the 
governing board ("Zelena rada") and the executive organ of the 
association. Yuriy Shcherbak, a people's deputy of the USSR, was 
elected honorary chairman. His deputies are Leontiy Sandulyak 
(people's deputy of the USSR), Yuriy Tkachenko, Aleksandr Bagun, 
Anatoliy Zolotukhin, and Roman Stepanyuk. 
  Sources of financing are subsidies from the UKZM, sponsor 
contributions, and donations of citizens. 
  Membership and initiation fees are not envisioned by the 
by-laws. Membership fees are collected in some associated 
organizations, for example, the Dneprodzerzhinsk Association 
Social-Ecological Initiative--in the amount of R1 a month (with 
membership in the association at 78 people in early 1990). 
  ZS maintains permanent contacts with Greens organizations in 
the FRG and Scandinavian countries as well as in the Baltics, 
Belarus, Moscow, and the Transcaucasus (Georgia and Armenia). 
  Yu. Shcherbak and many other ZS activists are members of 
Rukh. 
  ZS has its own emblem and symbols (ZS by-laws, paragraph V, 
p. 27).

<H5>    Greens Party of Ukraine </H5>
  An ecological-political organization. 
  Preparations to create the party began at the congress of 
"Zelenyy svit" (see article) on 29 October 1989 with a 
resolution of 30 deputies on the need to create a Greens party 
(among them were deputies of the USSR Yu. Shcherbak and N. 
Sandulyak and deputy of the UkSSR Yu. Shovkovitnyy). The 
initiative group was created on 23 March 1990 . Its founding 
meeting was held in Kiev in the fall of 1990. 
  One of the founders of the party, Anatoliy Panov, 
characterized its goals and place in this way: "We see our party 
as a component of a strong left-centrist bloc. Our political 
credo is humanism and the priority of common human values over 
ideological dogma." 
  The party's goal is to demand that the nonnuclear principles 
of the Declaration on the Sovereignty of Ukraine be realized; 
that is to say, the freeing of the republic not only of nuclear 
weapons but of nuclear power and nuclear industry (other than 
medical). 
  Yuriy Shcherbak, writer and people's deputy of the USSR, 
headed the party. The chairman of the party's auditing 
commission is Vladimir Nikolayevich Timonin. 
  On 2 June 1991 at the second party congress, a resolution 
regarding the results of the inspection by IAEA [International 
Atomic Energy Agency] and a strategy for overcoming the 
consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe were adopted. The 
resolution expressed a lack of confidence in the IAEA which 
asserts, among other things, that "there are no grounds for 
considering that the deterioration of the health of the 
residents of Ukraine is related to radioactive emissions of 
Chernobyl." The resolution states that IAEA "as an agency for 
monitoring the spread of radioactive materials has become an 
agency for promoting atomic power engineering, in this way 
performing political tasks." 
  The general membership is about 5,000 people.

<H3>  Estonian Nature Protection Society ("Eesti Loodu Skaitse 
Selts [ELKS]") </H3>
  In 1989 the society was the central public organization 
coordinating nature protection work of Estonia. ELKS was founded 
in 1966. The number of founders was 124. There are two museums 
operating under the society: the nature protection museum and 
the regional lore museum. ELKS is not involved in commercial 
activity (1989). 
  ELKS works in two areas: 
  1. Ecological education and propaganda of nature 
protection ideas (lectures, people's universities, summer 
courses, walks, excursions, and statements in the mass 
information media). 
  2. Care of landscapes (planning, consultation, and conduct 
of republic competitions). 
  The following work is done: 

  -  lecture work in all divisions; 
  -  holding of people's nature 
protection universities in the republic (a maximum of 56 
universities); 
  -  designing and laying of nature trails in the 
republic; ELKS has more than 25 years of experience here and is 
the pioneer in this area in the USSR (ELKS published a monograph 
on methods of educational trails); 
  -  conduct of a republic 
competition for caring for landscapes as well as design and 
consultation in this area; the designers' cooperative "Nature 
and Architecture" is in operation; 
  -  conduct of nature summer 
schools for teachers of all disciplines and the aktiv of nature 
protectors in Lakhemaask National Park; 
  -  conduct of measures to 
propagandize the art of flower arrangement (ikebana) in Estonia; 
  -  building up of a specialized library on nature protection 
under 
ELKS to have 16,000 volumes by 1985; 
  -  exhibits (including 
international ones), photos, posters, and children's 
drawings. 

    The society publishes the bulletin "News of the Estonian 
Nature Protection Society." 
  Maintains close ties with the Estonian Greens Movement (see 
article) and other nature protection organizations in Estonia 
and outside its borders. Member of the All-Union Nature 
Protection Society (see article). 
  Annual budget--about R80,000. Resources are from membership 
dues--R1 a year, initiation fees--50 kopecks, and from juridical 
(collective) members--at least R50; revenue from contract work, 
especially in connection with work caring for landscapes, and 
the like. 
  History: 
  Since 1967 has been conducting summer schools for upgrading 
skills of teachers: four groups under the leadership of (major) 
specialists. Each participant who is a pedagogue must make up 
collections of plants, insects, and the like which will be used 
in school as visual aids. At this time 1,200 have completed the 
17 sessions of the summer schools. 
  In 1972 the first All-Union Conference on Problems of Caring 
for Landscapes was conducted. Has been conducting fall forest 
care days since 1972. ELKS participates in managing school 
forest areas. Organizes special camps and seminars for managers 
of school forest areas. 
  In 1977 together with the Cinematographers Union of the 
Estonian SSR, held a nature film festival. Flower arrangement 
(ikebana) courses began to operate under the society. 
  The East-European Committee of the IUPN [International Union 
for the Protection of Nature] has been operating on the base of 
the society since 1978. The president of the East-European 
Committee is D. Kh. Eylart. 
  In 1980 an International Symposium on Landscape Care 
Problems 
was conducted. The East-European Committee of the IUPN working 
on the base of ELKS is the "founder of the international A. Kh. 
Tammsaare model," which is delivered to organizations and 
prominent figures in the area of ecological optimization of the 
landscape. In 1981-1985 they included the "Edisi" Kolkhoz in 
Pyarnuskiy Rayon, the "Ara vete" in Paydeskiy Rayon, the "Kindel 
Tee" in Vilyandiyskiy Rayon, and others. 
  In the early 1980s there were 36 people's universities with 
2,124 students. 
  In 1983 at the symposium "Graphic Art and Photography as a 
Means of Nature Protection Education," the Tallinn Declaration 
and its slogan "Unity of Nature and Art in the Name of Peace 
Throughout the World" were adopted. School curricula were 
modified on its basis in some countries. 
  In 1985 all-Union nature film days were held. 
  In 1985 there were 18,500 members (including 193 juridical 
members and 211 contract members) and 48 local branches in the 
society. New branches were added: the A. Kitsberg branch in 
Vilyandiyskiy Rayon (chairman--R. Mingi) and the Yu. Liyv branch 
in Alatskivi (chairman--K. Elnen). 
  Organizational structure: The basic organizational link is 
the local branch. The creation of branches is determined above 
all by territorial necessity. If necessary and if there are 
activists in the branch, sections which either operate on the 
territorial principle or join together people with certain 
interests are opened. By 1985 there were 100 of them: the Piarnu 
Phenoclub, the Tukhalaskaya section, the labor veterans section, 
and others.
