  [Text] Kawasaki Heavy Industries will provide production 
and maintenance technologies for gas turbines to two Indonesian 
public corporations including BARATA, a steel skeleton 
construction and heavy equipment manufacturer based in Surabaya. 
The technological assistance is intended to promote the gas 
turbine market in the country where natural gas is abundant. The 
gas turbine is superior to the diesel turbine in terms of 
environmental factors and thermoelectric effects. Kawasaki Heavy 
Industries has decided to provide this technological assistance 
since interest in gas turbines, which create less pollution, has 
been increasing. 
  The assembly and maintenance technologics for the gas 
turbine 
will be provided to BARATA and IPTN, a government-owned aircraft 
and engine manufacturer based in Bandon. 
  In August, Kawasaki Heavy Industries received an order for 
an 
emergency gas turbine power generation facility for the 
Indonesian Science and Technology Agency's new building. The 
facility consists of four gas turbines with an output of 1,500 
kilowatts at a price of slightly less than &yen;400 million. 
Kawasaki Heavy Industries will commission the assembly and 
maintenance of the power generation facility to BARATA and IPTN 
as the initial project. The main parts of the facility will be 
exported from Japan by Kawasaki Heavy Industries. The facility 
is scheduled to be completed by the end of March 1994. 
  Kawasaki Heavy Industries has begun to expand its sales 
activities for the current fiscal year by increasing the number 
of sales representatives in Indonesia and Malaysia, which are 
rich in natural gas for use as gas turbine fuel. Although the 
same technologies have also been provided to Malaysia, Indonesia 
is the first country where technological assistance is being 
provided along with the receipt of an order. This will make 
seven cases of technological assistance in six nations, i.e., 
Germany, Canada, the United States, and Italy, in addition to 
the above two countries. Although the majority of demand for gas 
turbines is in Japan, the company expects that Asia will 
represent a growing market in the future due to its 
industrialization. 
  The demand for gas turbines is increasing in Japan due to 
such advantages as low noise, low vibration, compact design and 
the low level of soot and dust. Kawasaki Heavy Industries has 
set the FY93 sales target at &yen;26 billion, an increase of 13 
percent over the previous fiscal year. The company holds 
approximately 50 percent of the world market for small gas 
turbines with outputs of under 10,000 kilowatts.

  [Text] Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has added a new type to 
its line of turbo refrigerating machines for large capacity air 
conditioners by employing "HFC-134a," a CFC substitute, as the 
refrigerant. By adjusting the heat exchange cycle, the new 
machines can be used for heating up to 50&deg;C and for cooling 
to -10&deg;C. 
  HFC-134a has less impact on the environment than "CFC-11" 
and 
does not deplete the ozone layer. The turbo refrigerating 
machines using HFC-134a are the third type to employ a CFC 
substitute, following those with "HCFC-123" and "HCFC-22." 
  The new type consists of six models with different 
refrigeration capabilities ranging from 150 to 400 refrigerating 
tons and priced from &yen;39.5 million to &yen;56 million. Large 
capacity models of up to 7,000 refrigerating tons will be 
developed based on the sales conditions of the smaller models.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI) is planning to expand its assistance to developing 
nations in the area of the environment. It has already included 
the creation of the "International Environment Advisor System" 
in its initial request for the FY94 budget, which is under 
negotiations with the Ministry of Finance. MITI will also expand 
on-going cooperation projects for desulphurization technologies 
in China. The International Environment Advisor System certifies 
and registers "Environment Advisors" among "Managers in Charge 
of Pollution Control," designated specialists with knowledge and 
technical backgrounds, in the private sector based on their 
experience in developing nations and language ability. They will 
be sent to developing nations to organize seminars for pollution 
prevention and to provide assistance and advice based on 
requests from such nations. 
  Cooperation with developing nations through the dispatch of 
experts in environmental issues, such as pollution prevention, 
has already been implemented as part of private enterprise's 
social contribution. The International Environment Advisor 
System is intended to expand such efforts and establish a 
governmental system for human cooperation. 
  The technological cooperation for desulphurization in China 
is intended to establish several simplified desulphurization 
testing facilities for low- quality coal with a high level of 
sulfur to prevent air pollution by coal- burning thermal power 
plants. The construction of the first such facility began in May 
in Qingdao, Shandong, with the Chinese side recently agreeing to 
a second facility to be established in Taiyuan, Shanxi. The 
project is expected to be completed by the year 2000, with a 
total budget of &yen;7.3 billion. 
  MITI plans to promote international cooperation further 
since 
"Environmental issues are not confined to Japan, as in the case 
of technological cooperation with China for desulphurization as 
a countermeasure to acid rain in the East Asia region" 
(Industrial Location and Environment Bureau).

  [Text] Beginning in FY94, the Environment Agency will add 
seven acid rain monitoring stations over a two-year period to 
reinforce its network. Even though it is believed that serious 
effects of acid rain have not occurred in Japan, the acid rain 
recorded in Japan has been detected to have acidity equivalent 
to that in Europe, where serious effects of acid rain have been 
reported. The agency expects to monitor the conditions in detail 
by strengthening its monitoring system. 
  Although the locations of the new stations have not been 
finalized, they are expected to be established to improve the 
monitoring network in some urban areas, some mountainous areas, 
and areas on the coastline of the Sea of Japan and the East 
China Sea to monitor the effects from China. At the moment, 
there are 30 monitoring stations in major cities, on distant 
islands, etc., with 10 additional stations to be established 
during the current fiscal year. The increase of 7 more stations 
beginning in FY94 will make a total of 47 monitoring stations 
across Japan.

equipment received in July amounted to &yen;104.597 billion, a 
slight increase of 7.7 percent over the same month last year. 
This was a decrease of 50.7 percent from the previous month 
since the effects of the advance orders for public works were 
terminated. The orders for waste treatment equipment showed the 
smallest growth during the current fiscal year. 
  According to the breakdown by type of equipment, waste 
treatment equipment increased by 6.1 percent to &yen;54.986 
billion. Water pollution prevention equipment increased by 22.3 
percent over the same month last year to &yen;43.703 billion. 
Air pollution prevention equipment decreased by 36.8 percent to 
&yen;5.555 billion. The same three categories recorded decreases 
from the previous month by 64.2, 14.5 and 23.8 percent, 
respectively. 
  According to the breakdown of orders by category, 
governmental orders increased by 15.7 percent to &yen;98.302 
billion, representing a decrease, however, of 51.0 percent from 
the previous month. Concerning the private sector, 
non-manufacturing industries sharply decreased orders by 72.7 
percent due to the decline of exhaust gas desulfurizers for the 
electric power industry. The manufacturing industries also 
decreased orders by 32.4 percent due to a decline in industrial 
water treatment equipment for the machinery industry. In 
general, the effects of the restraint of facility investment 
continued.

  [Text] Nittetsu Chemical Industry (based in Minato Ward, 
Tokyo; president: Tadashi Hisatsune), an environment-related 
plant manufacturer in the Nippon Steel group, has developed a 
decomposition technology for fixed ammonia, such as ammonium 
sulfate and ammonium chloride, diluted in water. By decomposing 
ammonia with magnesium hydrate, magnesium sulfate, which can be 
disposed of in the ocean, is extracted as a by-product. Since 
fixed ammonia is subject to regulation by waste water standards, 
the company plans to promote plant sales based on the new 
technology. 
  Although Nittetsu Chemical Industry also examined a 
processing technology using inexpensive calcium hydroxide, 
magnesium hydrate was adopted instead since separation was 
difficult due to the gypsum generated when using calcium 
hydroxide. While treating the fixed ammonia, ammonia water and 
ammonium sulfate can be collected for recycling. The company is 
constructing a pilot plant which will begin operation soon.

  [Text] Ebara has formed a comprehensive partnership in the 
area of the environment with Lulugi (based in Frankfurt; 
president: Jan Peter Shaefer), a large engineering company in 
Germany. First, a subsidiary is expected to be established by 
the end of the year to decontaminate polluted soil in Japan 
using the technology provided by Lulugi. It is also planned to 
establish a subsidiary to burn waste plastic for power 
generation in Germany using Ebara's technology. 
Environment-related business is to be promoted collaboratively 
in Japan and Europe through the exchange of environment- related 
technologies of Japan and Germany. 
  The partnership between Ebara and Lulugi in the area of the 
environment consists of the establishment of subsidiaries, the 
cooperative development of new technologies, and mutual 
technological transfer involving their group companies. The new 
company to be established in Japan will remove hazardous 
materials in the soil using the technologies of Lulugi, which 
has been involved in decontaminating the soil at plant sites in 
Germany. Its capital is expected to be between &yen;100 and 200 
million, of which 51 percent will be financed by Ebara and 49 
percent by Lulugi. The new company will begin operation next 
year. 
  Another subsidiary will be established in Germany using 
Ebara's technologies and financed over 50 percent by Lulugi. The 
company will examine the construction of incineration facilities 
for waste plastic for power generation. 
  Ebara and Lulugi will promote cooperative research in the 
areas of waste sorting, energy collection by waste incineration, 
and the treatment of organic compounds, as well as on materials 
that are difficult to degrade. The companies have already begun 
to examine utilizing environment-related technologies already 
developed. Ebara plans to provide waste gas and water processing 
technologies. 
  Lulugi is an engineering company specializing in waste 
treatment as well as in the construction of chemical and 
metallurgical plants, with annual sales amounting to 2.5 billion 
German marks (approximately &yen;160 billion). 
  In the area of environment-related business, Mitsubishi and 
Mercedes-Benz, also Japanese and German firms, have formed a 
partnership for waste automobile recycling and plan to establish 
a subsidiary. Cooperation among companies of different nations 
based on the mutual use of their technologies will be

<F P=106> [Article on the Environmental Agency, part of the larger </F>
series entitled "Kasumigaseki at the Crossroads," by Masaki 
Kagoshima, Science and Technology Department reporter: "The 
Environmental Agency -- Environmental Administration Faces Tough 
Going"] 
  [Text] Global warming, ozone layer depletion, the acid 
rain phenomenon, etc. Environmental disruption is progressing 
quietly and steadily. Based on the current trend of increased 
emphasis on environmental administration, the Environmental 
Agency [EA] is trying to shift its policy to a global 
environment preservation- oriented administration concerned with 
the nation's overall policies from the current 
regulation-oriented administration which emphasizes pollution 
control and nature preservation. However, there is growing 
criticism within the EA and outside that the "EA has no clear 
policies," and that "it lacks the ability to work out plans." 
The path toward "breaking away from old traditions" is unlikely 
to be easy. 
<H5>  The EA Falls Behind the Ministry of Health and Welfare </H5>
  Recently, there is a growing "tense atmosphere" in the EA 
because the Ministry of Health and Welfare [MHW] has spelled out 
its plan to enact a new law designed to improve the water 
quality of rivers, lakes, and marshes which are the source of 
tap water. 
  Musty tap water in the metropolitan area and the Kinki area 
and the detection of cancer-causing substances from water are 
major problems. While tap water is under the jurisdiction of 
the MHW, public waters such as rivers, lakes and marshes, which 
are the source of tap water, are under the EA's jurisdiction. 
Some people believe one cause for the EA's tense atmosphere is 
the sense of crisis that "the MHW will make a raid into the EA's 
jurisdiction using the opportunity of the enactment of the new 
law." 
  There have been strident calls within the EA for some 
measures to be taken to deal with "unsavory and dangerous 
water." In response to the MHW revising water-quality standards 
for tap water in late 1992, the EA began studying comprehensive 
measures to improve water conditions through cooperation with 
various ministries and agencies. As the EA is about to work out 
water measures, the MHW is trying to take action by utilizing 
the enactment of the new law as leverage. It can be said that 
the EA was taken by surprise. 
  EA officials offered the excuse: "We have delayed coming up 
with measures due to staff shortages." However, it is a fact 
that many people were critical of the EA's slow moves, saying: 
"Despite mounting public expectations for environmental 
administration, the ministry failed to grasp it at an early 
date." 
  As global environment disruption is advancing, it is 
necessary to shift the emphasis of environmental administration 
to global environment preservation-oriented policies, which 
require wide- ranging measures on economy, international 
relations and other issues, away from pollution control policies 
centering on regulations. It can be said that the "tap water 
issue" between the EA and the MHW indicates that although the EA 
is trying to break away from old traditions in view of this 
trend, it needs to make additional efforts. 
<H5>  EA's Plans Are Leaked to Other Ministries and Agencies </H5>
  The EA was set up in 1971 for the purpose of centralizing 
pollution control administrations. From the beginning, the EA 
has faced two problems. One is that the EA is a mixed force 
comprised of officials who have been transferred temporarily to 
the agency from other ministries, and another is that other 
ministries and agencies, as well as industrial circles, are apt 
to regard the EA with enmity. 
  Since environmental preservation measures such as pollution 
control do not easily coexist with development and economic 
progress, it is hard for the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry and industrial circles to accept them. In 1981, the EA 
submitted to the Diet an "environment assessment bill" designed 
to make a pre-survey of the impact of development works on the 
environment, and to work out counter-measures. The EA faced 
tough going from the initial stage of working out the bill due 
to pressure from industrial circles and other ministries. When 
the bill was compiled at long last, the EA had made considerable 
concessions and the content of the bill was very different from 
its original idea. For example, the EA excluded power plants 
from the list of targets for environmental assessment. As a 
result, Diet deliberations became entangled and the bill was 
eventually scrapped. 
  Discord between career officials and officials temporarily 
transferred to the EA is noted in the agency. EA's career 
officials said in anger: "In some cases, EA's plans were 
demolished in advance because its strategy toward important 
projects were leaked to ministries and agencies to which 
transferred officials originally belonged." Takashi Kosugi, 
House of Representatives member (from the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP]) and former parliamentary vice-minister of 
environment, expressed criticism, saying: "As officials 
temporarily transferred from other ministries and agencies think 
their job at the EA is merely a stopgap, they tend not to tackle 
environmental administration in earnest. This is an abuse 
caused by a mixed force." 
  The term "the faithful of the environmental persuasion" is 
often used at the EA. This term refers to officials who entered 
the EA resolving to contribute to the preservation of nature as 
well as to solve pollution problems, and such officials show 
their intense enthusiasm for tackling environmental problems. 
They are irritated by the attitude of some transferred 
officials who pay attention only to ministries and agencies to 
which they originally belonged. 
  A senior official who had been temporarily transferred to 
the 
EA once fired subordinate officials, saying: "You have to work 
hard while keeping in mind there are not many companies that 
will accept so-called `Amakudari' [high government officials' 
landing a fat job in a semi-government or private corporation 
upon retirement] officials from the EA." The senior official's 
remarks indicate EA officials would be unlikely to secure future 
posts with private companies upon retirement unless they work 
hard because the EA does not have a long history. A career 
official who heard the story said in anger: "I entered the EA 
because I want to tackle environmental problems. Working for 
the sake of a future post means putting the cart before the 
horse." 
<H5>  No Strategy for Making the Next Move </H5>
  The EA's current greatest concern is a basic environment 
bill. At last the bill is likely to pass the current Diet 
session. The basic environment law is the so-called 
"constitution" concerning environmental administration which 
will enable the transformation from the current anti-pollution 
administration to an administration oriented toward preservation 
of the global environment. Enactment of the bill is the EA's 
long-cherished desire as all EA officials say: "Unless the bill 
is enacted, we cannot make the next move toward concrete 
measures to preserve the environment." 
  However, there is a view that even if the basic environment 
law is enacted, it will be difficult for the present EA to "make 
the next move immediately." This is because the EA has failed 
to establish a full-fledged, systematic strategy toward 
preserving the global environment. Kazuo Aichi, Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party] member in charge of policy affairs and 
former EA director-general, expressed his concern: "With the 
transformation to an environment preservation-oriented 
administration, the EA's policies will be entwined with various 
factors such as the economy, diplomacy and education. EA 
officials may be at a loss on how to deal with matters that they 
have not dealt with before." 
  Taking into consideration the increasing importance of 
environmental administration, Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the 
LDP's Policy Research Council, stated his recommendation: "The 
EA should be placed under the direct control of the prime 
minister so it can check policies of other ministries and 
agencies from the viewpoint of environment preservation." It is 
noticeable that other politicians who had shown little interest 
in environmental issues often comment on environmental issues, 
including environmental taxes. The number of "supporters" for 
the EA is steadily increasing. 
  Although EA Director General Wakako Hironaka was greatly 
respected as an expert in environmental issues, she has failed 
to make clear-cut statements on the issues. The director 
general intends to overcome the current economic recession by 
expanding environmental preservation investments. 
  However, it is reported that although she has urged sections 
in charge to embody the idea, there has been barely any 
response. It seems that Director General Hironaka's hope that 
the "EA will be able to make positive comments" has not yet been 
realized. One cause of this situation is the weakness of the 
mixed force which is apt to give consideration to other 
ministries and agencies. However, the main cause is that "since 
the EA itself has failed to put its views on environmental 
issues in order, its ability to work out plans is weak," (as 
stated by Shinseito's Aiichi). 
  Meanwhile, there are some merits in the mixed force. There 
is a view among career officials that, "thanks to efforts by 
transferred officials who are proficient in negotiating with 
other ministries," the basic environment law is about to be 
enacted despite the resistance of other ministries and agencies, 
(according to Toshiro Kojima, chief of the EA's Water Quality 
Management Division). To make utmost use of the trend of 
emphasizing environmental preservation, the EA should not grieve 
about the shortage of staff or the mixed force but take an 
attitude of changing its demerits into strengths.

  [Text] On 1 December, the government decided to seek a 
conclusion of an "environment protection cooperation agreement" 
with China in view of the serious environmental destruction due 
to the nation's rapid economic growth. In principle, the 
agreement will give the two nations equal standpoints to jointly 
cope with problems related to the global environment. In this 
sense, its approach is quite different from existing environment 
aid programs, which are one-sidedly given from Japan to China. 
  The agreement was proposed by China two to three years ago; 
however, some ministries have been opposing the proposal, noting 
"such an agreement may be used as an excuse for spending larger 
official development assistance (ODA) funds for China." The 
Japan-China agreement will become the first case in which Japan 
offers an equal position to a developing nation for cooperation 
in environmental protection. This is expected to contribute a 
lot to settling environmental problems affecting the two 
nations, such as acid rain from China. 
  The agreement's final draft consists of a preamble and nine 
articles. The preamble notes: "To protect the global 
environment, the two nations will work together on their common 
problems and further promote international efforts." 
  Article 2 lists nine problem fields the two nations should 
jointly cope with, and "acid rain and air pollution" is on top 
of the list. China has been insisting that acid rain caused by 
its air pollution is "nothing more than a domestic problem since 
its influence on Japan is not proven." However, the agreement 
is going to clearly note for the first time that China's acid 
rain is a problem not only for China but also for Japan. 
  Since Japan already has given environment aid to China under 
ODA programs, the treatment of existing aid programs has long 
been the biggest obstacle to the new cooperation agreement with 
China. The Foreign Ministry has been negative toward the 
agreement, saying "the agreement may be used as an excuse to 
concentrate allotment of ODA funds to China." The Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry also said the agreement may 
adversely affect its "Green Aid Plan," an energy aid program 
under way in China. Inter-ministry talks were held on this 
point, and ministries finally agreed with the government plan on 
the condition that "the agreement should not influence existing 
aid projects."

  [Text] Tirana, January 6 (ATA) -- During 1994 five per cent 
of Albanian territory will be under the protection of the 
government. According to Ilir Vesho, expert at the Environmental 
Protection Committee, the areas to be put under the protection 
of the state will include national parks, natural monuments, and 
others. 
  All lagoons will be declared fourth category under the 
classification of World Fund for Environmental Protection. 
Meanwhile the goal of the environmental committee during 1994 is 
to increase national parks and hunting reservations. The area 
under protection will increase from some 15 thousand hectares to 
150 thousand hectares. 
  Projects have been drafted in cooperation with international 
organizations for an effective exploitation of these areas in 
order to ensure foreign currency for population.

  [Text] Sofia, January 8 (BTA) -- At the end of his 
three-day visit to Bulgaria, Mr. Antony Baldry, parliamentary 
undersecretary of state at the British Department of the 
Environment, told the press that Britain will provide 250,000 
pounds sterling over three years for the implementation of a 
joint project for green tourism in the areas of Mount Rila and 
Mount Pirin (southwestern Bulgaria). 
  The Bulgarian-British Prest Project, unveiled during Mr. 
Baldry's visit, is intended to promote tourism in Bulgaria's 
protected wilderness tracts and national parks with guaranteed 
conservation of the natural resources. The project will be 
financed by the British Government's know-how fund for 
environmentally sustainable tourism in the countries of Central 
and Eastern Europe. The British assistance will consist mainly 
of equipment and experts. 
  Yesterday, Mr. Baldry met in Bansko with the mayors of the 
municipalities in whose territories the two mountains rise. 
  "The residents in the national parks' territory need not 
worry about the project," Environment Minister Valentin Bosevski 
said at Sofia Airport. According to him, people must be 
convinced that the implementation of a science-based and modern 
policy for the growth of national park tourism will lead to 
prosperity of the population in those areas. 
  Mr. Bosevski and Mr. Baldry discussed opportunities for 
joint 
waste management projects. Britain promised expertise and 
financial support for the organization of an environment 
ministers' conference which will be hosted by Sofia next year.

  [Text] Sofia, January 18 (BTA) -- Bulgarian Minister of 
the Environment Valentin Bosevski handed to Ambassador Thomas 
O'Sullivan, head of delegation of the European Commission to 
Bulgaria, the memorandum signed by himself and Romanian minister 
of water resources, forestry and the environment late in 
December last year. 
  Declaring their common position and their intention to 
assist 
each other fully in the application of coordinated environmental 
measures, Bulgaria and Romania make a request to the European 
Union [EU] to provide funds for the implementation of a regional 
project for the protection of environment along the lower 
Danube. A month ago the two ministers of the environment 
considered the development of the project stating that its 
implementation was only possible if the intellectual and 
financial aid was provided by the EU. The project envisages 
joint activity aimed to improve the quality of waters in the 
Bulgarian-Romanian section of the Danube, to raise the level of 
nuclear safety and protect the air against transboundary 
pollution. 
  Your request to the European Union is going to be the 
superstructure of good cooperation between us and your ministry, 
ambassador O'Sullivan said on accepting the memorandum. He 
described the EU cooperation with the Bulgarian Ministry of the 
Environment as an excellent model for all countries to follow in 
the implementation of operation PHARE [Economic Reconstruction 
Aid For Poland And Hungary] programmes. 
  Ambassador O'Sullivan promised further support for 
environmental protection activities, especially those aimed to 
resolve Bulgaria and Romania's common problems.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 10 (CTK) -- The Czech branch of the 
Greenpeace movement sent an open letter to U.S. President Bill 
Clinton asking him to obstruct guarantees by the U.S. 
Export-Import Bank for completion of the Temelin nuclear plant, 
Greenpeace spokeswoman Vera Frankova told CTK today. 
  The plant started to be constructed in 1986, and from the 
very beginning it has been strongly criticized by environmental 
organizations, especially in neighboring Austria. 
  The Czech Government approved the completion of the power 
plant last March, says the letter, handed to the U.S. Embassy to 
the Czech Republic. The American City Bank is willing to grant 
the relevant loan but it requires solid guarantees. According 
to Frankova, the guarantee of 16.2 billion Czech crowns ($540 
million) by the Czech Government was not sufficient, and the 
EX-IM Bank guarantees are also required. 
  The Czech Government decided to complete the Temelin, south 
Bohemia, nuclear plant although no study on its impact on the 
environment has been compiled, and no laws on liquidation of 
nuclear installations, storage of radioactive waste, or 
responsibility for damage caused in case of a nuclear accident 
have been passed, the letter claims. 
  Greenpeace believes that Clinton's move against completion 
of 
the Temelin plant would be entirely in line with the 
environmental aspects of his electoral campaign.

  [Text] Leonid Sergeyevich Sokolov, chief of the 
Geochemical Party of the Moscow Experimental-Methodological 
Geochemical Expedition of the Institute of Mineralogy, 
Geochemistry, and Crystalochemistry of Rare Metals (IMGRE), a 
specialist in geophysical and geochemical methods of prospecting 
for mineral ores and ecological-geochemical analysis of 
pollution of the environment with metals. 
  Yevgeniy Davidovich Astrakhan, candidate of 
Geological-Mineralogical Sciences, chief geologist of the same 
Geochemical Party. At the present time he is working on a 
geochemical study of pollution of cities with metals. 
  The results of human economic activity have begun to impact 
the environment so appreciably that it is simply impossible not 
to notice them. An extremely unfavorable situation has developed 
in many territorial industrial complexes of Russia, including 
the Moscow cosmopolitan area, which includes thousands of 
enterprises of Moscow and Moscow Oblast. 
  More than 15 million people live on the territory of this 
largest metropolitan area in the country. As a result of the 
multiple-profile industrial and agricultural production and also 
municipal service activity in Moscow itself and in the adjacent 
territories, a powerful pressure has formed which has a negative 
impact both on the environment and on people's health. 
  Among the most dangerous pollutants here, as in the majority 
of other territorial industrial complexes, are metals (more 
precisely, their compounds). In terms of the reaction to contact 
with metals, all components of the environment may be divided 
into two groups: migrational--which transport them, and 
depository, in which the metals are mainly accumulated. The 
migrational group includes surface and underground waters and 
also the atmospheric air. The depository group includes ores, 
bottom deposits, solid precipitates from the atmosphere, soil, 
and living organisms. 
  The two groups are closely related. The natural environments 
of the latter bear signs of the presence of metals in the former 
after a certain time lag. This makes it possible to study the 
dynamics of the technogenic pollution of the territory and 
evaluate the degree of danger of this kind of pollution for 
human health. 
  The situation was complicated, however, by the fact that 
until recently there has not been a single methodology for 
conducting evaluations of this kind. Last autumn the minister of 
environmental protection and natural resources, V.I. 
Danilov-Danilyan, approved an important normative 
document--"Criteria for Evaluating the Ecological Situation of 
Territories in Order To Reveal Zones in Which There Is an 
Emergency Ecological Situation and Zones of Ecological Disaster" 
(Moscow, 1992). A large number of branch and academic 
institutes, ministries, and departments participated in 
developing these criteria.

  Chemical pollution of the soils with metals, according to 
the 
proposed criteria, are evaluated in terms of the total indicator 
of chemical pollution Z&lt;inf&gt; c&lt;/inf&gt; . This indicator is defined 
as the sum of the coefficients of concentration of individual 
metals participating in the pollution: 
&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  where n--the number of metals determined, 
C&lt;inf&gt; i&lt;/inf&gt; --concentration of i polluting metal in the 
sample, S&lt;inf&gt; fi&lt;/inf&gt; --concentration of i metal in the 
background (pure) soil. 
  Maps of environmental pollution are compiled from the 
calculated total indicators. Example of such maps for Moscow are 
given in this article. 
  Through special experimental-methodological studies under 
the 
leadership of Yu.Ye. Sayet and B.A. Revich a scale was developed 
which reflects the danger to human health of pollution of soils 
with chemical elements (Table). This scale, on which the degree 
of pollution of soils was evaluated in the same amounts 
Z&lt;inf&gt; c&lt;/inf&gt; , was approved by the Main 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Administration of the USSR Ministry of 
Public Health. 
  With moderately dangerous pollution of the soil the 
incidence 
of disease among children increases, and the total incidence of 
disease of the population may increase up to 15 percent. With 
dangerous pollution there is a sharp increase in the number of 
children with chronic illnesses, and disturbances of the 
functional condition of the cardiovascular system appear. The 
total incidence of illness increases by 40 percent then. Highly 
dangerous pollution of the soils is accompanied by an increase 
in the total incidence of illness of 70 percent, the female 
reproductive function is disturbed, and many children are ill. 
  During the past 20 years associates of the Moscow 
Experimental-Methodological Geochemical Expedition [IMGRE] have 
been studying pollution of soils on the territory of Moscow. 
Utilizing the aforementioned composite indicator for evaluating 
pollution with metals not only of soils but also the snow 
cover&lt;sup&gt; 1&lt;/sup&gt; , (Footnote 1) (When there is snow, the 
composite indicator of chemical pollution is less stable (it 
depends on many natural factors, the method for taking and 
processing the samples, and so forth). Therefore this indicator 
was not included in the "Criteria...") they follow the dynamic 
of the pollution of the environment. 
  The spread of technogenic pollution over the area is 
established by means of ecological-geochemical 
mapping.&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  (Footnote 2) (For more detail see: E.K. 
Burenkov, I.A. Morozova, R.S. Smirnova, et.al. "Tasks and 
Methods of Large-Scale Ecological-Geochemical Mapping // 
Ecological-Geochemical Studies in Regions of Intensive 
Technogenic Impact." Moscow, 1990, pp. 4-15.) First the 
functional purpose of the territory is evaluated (residential 
area, industrial zone, and so forth), then a natural description 
of the soil and ground is compiled, weather conditions are 
evaluated, and finally, samples are taken. After they are 
analyzed for metal content, it is possible to calculate the 
composite indicator of pollution for each specific territory. 
The mapping is conducted with varying degrees of detail 
reflected in the density of observation points on a particular 
area. 






  The present article gives a study of the degree of pollution 
of the territory of Moscow (with a scale of 1:100,000) done in 
1986-1987. After that more detailed work was started in 
individual sections. The area covered by ecological-geochemical 
mapping was gradually expanded: It covered the forest park zone 
adjacent to Moscow, nearby rayons, and satellite cities. 
  When the pollution of soils with metals and solid 
atmospheric 
precipitates the snow was studied, the samples were taken with a 
density of one sample point per one square kilometer. The method 
for taking the soil samples could be called classical: Analogous 
methods are used in geochemical prospecting for ore deposits. 
The depth of the soil sample (0-5 cm) is based on the 
penetration of pollutant elements established during the process 
of experimental work. Each soil sample consists of five 
specimens with an overall weight of 200 g. The processing of the 
sample in general is quite simple: It consists in drying it, 
spreading it out, and putting it through a millimeter sieve. 
  Snow samples are taken in such a way as to characterize the 
amount of dust in the atmospheric air. When snow samples are 
taken, the area and depth of the hole in the snow are measured. 
The dimensions of the hole are established in keeping with the 
depth of the snow cover and a visual estimate of its pollution: 
It is necessary to obtain no less than one gram of settled dust. 
Usually the weight of the snow sample is about 15 kg. The 
melting is done at room temperature. A solid insoluble fraction 
is isolated by centrifuge and after drying, removal of outside 
impurities, and weighing, it is sent for analysis.&lt;sup&gt; 3&lt;/sup&gt; 
(Footnote 3) (The proportion of metals in dissolved form in this 
case is not high and therefore it can be ignored.) The snow 
samples are selected in the middle or at the end of the winter 
season. At that time the number of days that have passed since 
the snow began to remain on the ground is registered. 
  Samples of soils and solid precipitates from the atmosphere 
were analyzed by the approximate-quantitative spectral method 
with lithium, strontium, barium, titanium, manganese, chromium, 
vanadium, nickel, cobalt, copper, silver, zinc, cadmium, lead, 
arsenic, antimony, bismuth, beryllium, tin, molybdenum, 
tungsten, gallium, indium, thallium, germanium, mercury, 
phosphorus, scandium, yttrium, ytterbium, lanthanum, cerium, 
zirconium, hafnium, niobium, tantalum, and boron--a total of 37 
metals. The permissible margin of error for determining the 
concentration of each element does not exceed 30 percent. 
  The composite indicators of pollution for each specific 
section were calculated from these analytical data. The results 
were entered on a map and thus territories were singled out with 
varying degrees of pollution. 
  Our research showed that on almost 60 percent of the city's 
territory the pollution of the soil is creating an emergency 
ecological situation. The soil in the city was polluted to the 
point of a condition of ecological disaster within the 
Kamer-Kollezhskiy Val and also on the territory of 
Volgogradskiy, Lyublinskiy, and Proletraskiy Rayons. In the 
strongly polluted soils, silver, zinc, and tungsten had 
accumulated in the largest quantities. 
  On the indicated area in industrial zones and around them 
there are sections of maximally polluted soils. These sections 
are influenced by such extremely large industrial zones of the 
city as Lyublino-Pererva (here, in addition to the 
aforementioned metals in the soil, cadmium, chromium, and copper 
also accumulate) and ZIL (the quantity of lead and tin are 
greater in these soils). In the industrial zone along Pravda 
Street the soil is very strongly enriched with all of the 
aforementioned metals. Areas of intensive soil pollution were 
also revealed in Khinki--Khovrino (nickel, molybdenum), the 
industrial zone of Degunino (tungsten, copper, bismuth), 
Tushino--Trikotazhnoy (silver, zinc), Meyerovskiy Drive (silver, 
zinc, bismuth), at the Khromatron plant (cadmium, copper, 
chromium), and at the intersection of the Highway of the 
Enthusiasts and Moscow Ring Highway (tungsten, zinc). 
Incidentally, one can judge the type of production from the 
range of metals polluting the soil. 
  A significantly large area of severe soil pollution is 
linked 
to the industrial zone of the Prozhektor plant in Karacharovo. 
Such metals as zinc, cadmium, and chromium accumulate on its 
site. There is a special danger of soil pollution on the 
territory of Losinyy Island, where a considerable quantity of 
tungsten, nickel, and molybdenum have accumulated. 
  A different distribution of metals throughout the area of 
the 
city is typical of solid precipitates from the atmosphere in the 
snow. The largest territory where a considerable quantity of 
metals settle is in the northwestern and northern part of the 
city. It includes several industrial zones together: Tushino, 
Trikotazhnaya, Brattsevo, Koptevo, Vagonoremont, Aviamotornaya, 
Degunino, Altufyev Highway, the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy, 
Butyrskiy Khutor, Pravda Street, and Mitkovskaya Spur. Maximum 
precipitation of metals was noted in connection with the 
industrial zones of Tushino-Trikotazhnaya and Brattsevo-Koptevo. 
The main metals that accumulated were nickel, cobalt, tungsten, 
and vanadium. 
  Another section where the snowfall was polluted with metals 
was caused by another group of nearby industrial zones: 
Khapilovka, Meyerovskiy Drive, Kirpichnaya Street, Sokolinaya 
Mountain, the Prozhektor plant, Perovo, and Gayvoronovo. The 
maximum concentration of metals was near the northern part of 
this territory. In addition to the aforementioned metals there 
were also high contents of molybdenum and chromium here. 
  The third section that was strongly polluted with metals of 
solid precipitates from the atmosphere is located in 
Kuryanovo-Lyublino--Pererve-Chagino. The fourth stretches from 
the Poveletskaya industrial zone to Ochakovo. 
  Very strong and sometimes even maximum pollution of snowfall 
with metals is also associated with the industrial zones of 
Vorontsovo and Verkhniye Kotly. The strips with snowfall 
polluted with metal extend from Verkhniye Kotly to the Ring 
Highway. Solid precipitates from the atmosphere here are 
enriched with silver, tungsten, nickel, and chromium. 
  In addition to the aforementioned territories near 
individual 
industrial zones there were also local sections where dust 
falling out with the snow was strongly polluted by toxic metals. 
In the northern part of the city it is the industrial zone of 
Vagonoremont, in the center--Volgograd Avenue and Southern Port, 
and in the south--Biryulevo-Tsaritsyno. In all of the 
aforementioned zones there were high concentrations of nickel, 
tungsten, chromium, and cobalt. In the northern part of the city 
the snowfall typically also contains silver, and in the 
south--molybdenum. 
  What has caused the differences in the distribution 
throughout the area of the city of metals in the soil and solid 
precipitates from the atmosphere? It is linked to the varying 
nature of the accumulation of technogenic pollution in them: 
Soils are an indicator of many-year processes, and in solid 
fallout from the atmosphere one can register modern technogenic 
accumulations. 
  A comparative analysis of the maps of the distribution of 
anomalous concentrations of metals in the soil and solid fallout 
from the atmosphere with the snow makes it possible to reveal 
the specific nature of pollution processes. Here it is possible 
to delineate zones of stable, relict, and modern pollution, 
which is very important for predicting its further development. 
  Stable pollution is characterized by the same 
intensity of the accumulation of metals in the soil and the snow 
cover. As a rule, areas with this type of pollution are located 
near the sources that are operating up to the present time. 
  Relict pollution is registered with greater 
pollution of the soil cover than the snow cover. With this type 
of pollution the source of the metals has either ceased to exist 
or at the present time is not making a significant contribution 
to the pollution of the air basin. Being residual, relict 
pollution may present a danger as a source of secondary 
pollution of layers of atmospheric air near the land. 
  Recent pollution, which is accompanied by more 
intensive accumulation of metals in the snow cover than in the 
soil, is progressive in nature. Obviously it is linked to 
currently active sources of pollution of the territory with 
metals. 
  Using the proposed gradation one can try to evaluate the 
city's ecological condition in a new way. Relict accumulation of 
metals is typical of the largest part of the polluted territory 
of Moscow. It was noted within the Kamer-Kollezhskiy Val and in 
Volgogradskiy, Lyubinskiy, and Proletraskiy Rayons. Stable 
pollution of the territory is traced in the northwestern and 
northern part of the city and in places where solid particles 
enriched with metals precipitate from the atmosphere. Recent 
pollution is established in connection with the industrial zone 
of Vorontsovo, and also in the south of the Ochakovo industrial 
zone and on the territory from Ochakovo to Donskaya Street. 
Local sections of modern pollution are concentrated in the north 
of the city (Vagonoremont industrial zone), the northeast 
(Koloshino industrial zone), and in the south 
(Biryulevo-Tsaritsyno industrial zone). 
  The sizes of these severely polluted territories continue to 
grow, taking up ever larger spaces along the periphery of the 
city and beyond its borders. During the period from 1977 through 
1987 the territory on which the soil was severely polluted 
increased 10-fold, and the area where snow strongly enriched 
with metals falls has doubled. This is a serious sign of danger. 
When developing environmental protection, urban planning, 
social, and medical-health policy it is necessary, at least, to 
constantly keep track of this increasing pollution of the 
territory of the city. 
  The Moscow Experimental-Methodological Geochemical 
Expedition 
IMGRE is continuing its work on evaluating the modern condition 
of the city's territory. A prognosis of the degree of pollution 
during 1993-1995 has been prepared and it is planned to verify 
this prognosis with direct testing. At the present time research 
has been started on revealing the dependency between the degree 
of pollution of the soil with metal and the illness rate of the 
child population. This work will contribute to the creation of 
the ecological maps themselves.

  [Text] Vladivostok, 6 Nov -- Three weeks have passed since 
Russia dumped liquid radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan. 
The scheduled second instance of dumping was canceled. 
However, there are some decommissioned nuclear submarines which 
have been left untouched at a submarine repair base in the 
Russian Far East region. The base in is great need of facilities 
at which radioactive waste produced during the process of 
dismantling nuclear submarines can be processed and stored. 
Officials of the Maritime Kray Government cannot conceal their 
uneasy feelings about the possibility of "instances of nuclear 
pollution that can occur anytime." Today, we will report on the 
actual state of the dismantling of the nuclear submarines and 
the treatment of radioactive waste. 
  We drove two and half hours from Vladivostok, where the 
headquarters of the Russian Navy's Pacific Fleet is located. A 
harbor with repair and dismantling dock facilities came into 
sight as we passed a checkpoint at the entrance to Bolshoy Kamen 
city. Nuclear submarines were being dismantled in three dry 
docks. Dark hulls which had been aged by many long voyages were 
cut crosswise, and some people were working there to take out 
radioactive waste. 
  According to military officials and people who work at the 
Zvezda (meaning "star") dockyard, which is the largest submarine 
repair factory in Russia, and at Stella, which is a Russian-U.S. 
joint venture established last spring, jointly dismantle the 
nuclear submarines. About 50 submarines have already been 
retired from service. The submarines still possessing nuclear 
reactors were being left out in the harbor and on beaches, for 
the dockyard can dismantle only four submarines a year. About 
50 more submarines are scheduled to be retired from service by 
the year 2000. A simple calculation tells us that 25 years are 
needed to dismantle all these vessels. 
  Radioactive wastes are being separated into solid and liquid 
wastes. Solid wastes are buried underground, but many of the 
solid wastes remain piled up in the open air because they are 
being removed from the submarines faster than the workers can 
bury them. Liquid wastes are stored in two storage tankers, the 
Pechega (which has a 700-ton capacity) and the TNT (which has a 
900-ton capacity). The TNT was used to dump radioactive waste 
into the Sea of Japan. One thousand tons of radioactive waste 
are stored on the two ships; their remaining capacity is only 
600 tons. 
  According to reporter Pashko (age 30), who works for an 
organ 
of the same fleet, about five dumpings at sea were carried out 
each year from the end of the 1980's to 1991. Reportedly, 373 
tons of solid waste (with radiation levels of 6 trillion 
Becquerels) and 3,000 tons of liquid waste (with radiation 
levels of 925 billion Becquerels) were dumped into the Sea of 
Japan. The radiation levels of these wastes are far higher than 
that of the liquid wastes which were dumped last month. 
According to an already-made announcement, the radiation level 
of the liquid wastes dumped into the Sea of Japan last month was 
about 40 billion Becquerels. 
  Assistant Commanding Officer Maksimov (43), who belongs to a 
chemical unit of the same fleet, said, "With our current storage 
capacity, our facilities will be full in 18 months." 
  On the other hand, Maritime Kray Deputy Governor Stegnyy 
[name as published] (45) stated: "We need to build processing 
and storage facilities as soon as possible. This is the way to 
safety. We will call on the Japanese Government for its 
assistance."

  [Text] Moscow, 12 Nov -- On 12 November, the first general 
meeting between Japan and Russia was held in Moscow to discuss 
promoting bilateral cooperation in the disposal of nuclear 
waste. Edamura, Japanese ambassador to Russia, and Yegorov, 
Russian vice atomic energy minister, attended the meeting. 
  During the meeting, the two countries agreed that meetings 
of 
experts should be held to discuss the following issues: 1) the 
possible construction of storage facilities for fissionable 
materials from dismantled warheads; 2) the disposal of liquid 
missile fuel; and 3) the dumping of radioactive waste into sea. 
  The Japanese Government has already decided to appropriate 
$100 million to help Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Byelarus 
dismantle nuclear materials. The meeting was held to discuss 
details of Japan's aid.

  [Text] Vladivostok, 21 Dec -- High-ranking officers of the 
Russian Pacific Fleet Command have said that the Russian Navy is 
planning to resume dumping of radioactive liquids into the Sea 
of Japan in late December or early January. The Russian 
Government suspended the action after the last dumping, in 
October, was severely criticized by Japan and other neighboring 
nations. 
  However, the Pacific Fleet can no longer keep liquid waste 
stored as it is on tanker ships because it was recently found to 
have been leaking from an old tanker. According to the 
officers, the next dumping is likely to be carried out in the 
Sea of Japan and the waters off the Kamchatka Peninsula. 
  The officers said the Pacific Fleet held a meeting on 5 
December in consultation with officials of the Maritime Kray 
Government and the Russian Ministry of Ecology and Natural 
Resources to discuss the treatment of radioactive waste. The 
meeting reportedly discussed the possibility of purchasing new 
waste tankers and of obtaining government financial support for 
improving disposal facilities. 
  Nevertheless, they reached the conclusion that "resumption 
of 
dumping is inevitable" since there was no hope of immediate 
financial support from the government. 
  Pacific Fleet Commander Guriynov is already back in 
Vladivostok after his vacation in Moscow last week, and is 
expected to decide exactly when the next dumping will be made 
within this week. The officers believed said the most likely 
date would be late in December or in early January. 
  According to an ITAR-TASS report on 20 December, a chief 
negotiator of the Russian Pacific Fleet delegation at Danilyan 
hinted at the resumption of dumping before Japan-Russia 
negotiations on the radioactive waste problem, saying: "Russia 
will have to continue dumping radioactive waste into the sea for 
at least two years, even if Western nations help construction of 
our nuclear waste disposal facilities. In fact, our dumping in 
October was found harmless to the environment." 
  The high-ranking officers said Zvezda nuclear submarine dock 
in Bolshoy-Kamen Bay, which is located halfway between 
Vladivostok and Nakhodka, currently stores 2,700 cubic meters of 
radioactive liquids. Of these, 1,000 cubic meters are stored in 
the nuclear reactor of a submarine under repair, and the 
remainder are stored in two tankers -- "TNT-5" (900 cubic 
meters) and "TNT-27" (800 cubic meters). "TNT-5" is a 
superannuated boat which was built in the 1970's. It has leaked 
radioactive waste at least 14 times, and is no longer capable of 
cruising. In fact, "TNT-5" is currently used as nothing more 
than a floating tank. "TNT-27" is too old to undertake long 
cruises, and is not considered safe enough to handle the storage 
of radioactive liquids. 
  The high-ranking officers said the next dumping may be done 
near Russian territorial waters in the Sea of Japan. When that 
happens the liquid waste may well be sunk together with its 
container, the "TNT-5." The officers noted it was usual in 
Russia for solid and liquid waste to be sunk together with the 
old tankers holding it. 
  The officers said that, in addition, Russia's biggest 
submarine base in Kamchatka has 1,500 cubic meters of liquid 
waste which the Navy will dump into waters off the Kamchatka 
Peninsula in the near future. 
  Asked about the Japanese Government's reaction to reports of 
Russian plans to resume dumping nuclear waste in the Sea of 
Japan, Director Hiroshi Matsuoka of the Science and Technology 
Agency's Disaster Prevention and Environment Policy Office said: 
"It will be a big problem if the information is true. However, 
we cannot comment on the report because it is not an official 
statement by Russia conveyed by diplomatic channels."

<F P=106> [By reporter A. Portov; first paragraph is newspaper's </F>
introduction] 
  [Text] The Russian Pacific Fleet is likely to resume 
dumping into the sea liquid nuclear waste, the product repairs 
to nuclear-powered submarines. Despite Japan's emergency plan 
to stop the dumping, the resumption is likely to go ahead 
because Russia does not have enough nuclear waste treatment 
facilities and is being urged to promote the mass dismantling of 
nuclear-powered submarines in accordance with the second 
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II). Reporter Portov 
recently obtained information from several high-ranking Pacific 
Fleet officers about nuclear-powered submarines, nuclear weapons 
facilities near Vladivostok, and Russia's handling of nuclear 
waste disposal. 
  "The graveyard of holdovers from the East-West Cold War era" 
is now in a terrible condition and out of control. Portov 
reports on the current situation in an area of Russia which 
foreigners are still forbidden to enter. 
  Vladivostok -- The Bolshoy Kamen Bay, the Cape of Maidel 
[name as published], and the Strelok Bay are located between 
Vladivostok and Nakhodka. The Pacific Fleet's nuclear 
weapons-related facilities, such as nuclear-powered submarine 
bases, underground nuclear warhead storage sites, docks designed 
to handle nuclear- powered craft, and nuclear waste treatment 
facilities are concentrated in the area. Foreigners are 
prohibited from entering. 
  Nuclear waste yielded at Zvezda nuclear-powered submarine 
dock, which is located in the Bolshoy Kamen Bay, is the 
radioactive liquid at issue in Russian plans to dump waste into 
the Sea of Japan. About 20 nuclear-powered submarines are 
currently under repair in the dock. There are also four nuclear 
reactors in the dock from disassembled submarines. The reactors 
are known as "cigarette butts." 
  Many of the repairs are made upon the nuclear reactors 
involved. Repeated cleaning of the reactors' external circuits 
with cooling water produces a large amount of radioactive waste 
liquid. In addition, nuclear-powered submarines in the Zvezda 
dock are equipped with SLBM [submarine launched ballistic 
missile] launchers, the numbers of which are due to be reduced 
in accordance with START II. 
  As far as START II is concerned, Russia plans to dismantle 
eight of the submarines currently in the dock. Also, before the 
end of the year, it will move a 365-class nuclear-powered 
submarine equipped with a SLBM launcher from Russia's largest 
submarine base on the Kamchatka Peninsula to the Zvezda dock for 
dismantling. 
  There are two nuclear waste discharge ships in the Zvezda 
dock. They are "TNT-5" and "TNT-27." Both are currently full of 
radioactive liquids. 
  Another reason Russia is in haste to dump nuclear waste into 
the Sea of Japan and other waters is the delay in its 
procurement of new nuclear waste discharge ships. The 
procurement was proposed at a nuclear waste council meeting held 
at the Pacific Fleet headquarters on 5 December. Because the 
Russian Government is currently in difficult financial 
conditions and because such ships are built in Ukraine, 
immediate construction and procurement of the ships is unlikely. 
Nevertheless, a high-ranking Pacific Fleet officer at 
headquarters said: "If we have new ships, we can dump nuclear 
waste not only into the Sea of Japan but also into waters 
further away in the Pacific. But...." His remarks made it 
clear that the only option left to Russia was marine dumping of 
nuclear waste, which is banned under the London Convention. 
  Another reason is one that has greatly irritate officers at 
the fleet headquarters in charge of dumping nuclear waste. The 
Pacific Fleet owns at least 14 support ships, of which four 
could be refitted to become nuclear waste storage ships. 
However, to make money, all 14 have been leased to 
newly-established corporations by former Pacific Fleet Commander 
Furatov [name as published], who was dismissed from his post in 
the spring, and other high-ranking officers. The ships are 
currently being used for commercial purposes. 
  The headquarters' prosecution bureau is interrogating about 
15 former high-ranking officers, including Furatov, on suspicion 
of having "illegally leased the support ships." Nevertheless, 
because of the lease contracts, it will be impossible to refit 
them as nuclear waste discharge ships in the near future. 
  There is another nuclear-submarine dock at Chazima Bay [name 
as published] in the off-limits zone. Called No. 30 dock, it is 
currently closed, and falls under direct control of Russian 
Naval headquarters. In 1985 there was an accident at the dock 
which killed eight people. There was a blast from a nuclear 
reactor due to a rapid rise in the temperature of cooling water 
which occurred when the reactor was opened for repair. 
  It is believed that when Russia resumes nuclear waste 
dumping 
it will use ships at the Zvezda dock, such as "TNT-5," but will 
probably move them to No. 30 dock to elude the vigilance of 
other countries. It is thought the ships will then leave No. 30 
dock to dump nuclear waste or they will be scuttled in the near 
seas. 
  There is a solid nuclear waste dumping site and an 
underground nuclear weapons storage depot at the Cape of Maidel. 
This dumping site is also full of nuclear waste. It is said 
that Russia has many times dumped nuclear waste from the site 
into the Sea of Japan and other waters. 
  Reactors from dismantled nuclear-powered submarines 
represent 
the most troublesome aspect of handling solid nuclear waste. 
They are called "cigarette butts." 
  A high-ranking Pacific Fleet officer said: "The Northern 
Fleet has also disposed of cigarette butts in the waters off the 
Kolskiy Peninsula in the Barents Sea. If Russia dismantles more 
nuclear-powered submarines in accordance with START II, the 
Pacific Fleet may also have to start dumping its cigarette butts 
into the sea." 
  There is a nuclear-powered submarine base and an underground 
nuclear warhead storage center in Pavlovsk in Strelok Bay. The 
submarine base is the largest in the Maritime Kray. In the bay 
there are two abandoned sunken submarines.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Energy Technology: Debate Gathers </F>
Steam on Future of Thermie Programme"; as released by Brussels 
Euroscope EIS Database] 
  [Text] What is to be done about the European Community's 
Thermie [European Technologies for Energy Management] programme 
for the promotion of state-of-the-art energy technologies still 
awaits clarification, it emerged at a news conference marking 
the opening in Brussels on October 11 of the first Thermie 
Exhibition. EC Energy Commissioner Abel Matutes said that as the 
Maastricht Treaty would encourage closer ties between R&amp;D and 
the market, the Commission had proposed including the greater 
part of the Thermie programme within the proposed fourth 
Framework Programme on Research and Technical Development 
[CERT]. It remains unclear, however, which of Thermie's more 
industrially-oriented aspects will remain outside the Framework 
Programme. As far as figures are concerned, 570 million Ecus has 
provisionally been set aside for Thermie activities within the 
Framework Programme. Funding for the rest remains uncertain. 
  Claude Desama, the Chairman of the European Parliament's 
Committee on Energy, Research and Technology, expressed 
misgivings about Thermie's inclusion in the Framework Programme. 
On the one hand, the constraints of the Framework Programme's 
overall budget would limit Thermie's scope of action. On the 
other, there were Thermie projects which did not strictly fall 
into the category of R&amp;D and should not be included in the 
Framework Programme, he said. The European Parliament is also 
recommending that any Thermie II programme should not fall into 
the trap of trying to cover the whole of the energy spectrum, 
thus spreading itself too thinly and at the same time stepping 
on the toes of other R&amp;D programmes. When the CERT comes to 
study the Commission's proposals for Thermie II it is expected 
to recommend greater concentration on, and investment in, three 
priority areas: promotion of clean coal and transport 
technologies and the production of energy from waste. 
  As far as the Belgian Presidency of the EC Council of 
Ministers is concerned, continuation of Thermie is guaranteed in 
principle but questions still remain as to the wisdom of forcing 
it into the Framework Programme mould. Melchior Wathelet, the 
Belgian Deputy Prime Minister, stressed the importance of 
Thermie's strong links with industry (as compared to the 
complementary Joule programme on non-nuclear energy technology, 
which is heavily R&amp;D-oriented). Mr Wathelet wondered whether 
mixing it with too much R&amp;D would not dilute Thermie's direct 
industrial link. The Council of Ministers should begin to study 
the issue as of now, well ahead of Thermie's expiry in 1994, he 
said. According to the Minister, the Council was convinced of 
the need to strengthen all its CO2 reduction/energy saving 
instruments (Thermie, Joule [Joint Opportunities for 
Unconvention or Long-Term Energy Supply], SAVE [Special Action 
Program for Vigorous Energy Efficiency], ALTENER [Alternative 
Energy Development Program]) and impose a CO2/energy tax. 
  The CO2/energy tax option is not one dear to the heart of 
the 
Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederation of Europe 
[UNICE]. UNICE President Carlos Ferrer seized the opportunity of 
the Thermie exhibition opening to reiterate the lobby's 
opposition to the CO2 tax proposals. Praising the Thermie 
programme as one of the best examples of non-fiscal measures for 
controlling CO2 emissions, Mr Ferrer then went on to attack the 
fiscal option. A CO2/energy tax would push up fuel prices and 
undermine the competitiveness of European industry (the 
improvement of which is one of Thermie's main aims) and its 
ability to invest in energy efficiency.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Subsidiarity: Commission Proposes To </F>
Simplify EC Directives on Water"; as released by Brussels 
Euroscope EIS Database] 
  [Text] The European Commission is contemplating the idea 
of making a 25&percnt; cut in EC legislation so as to get rid of 
wastage and dispose of provisions that are surplus to 
requirements. This initiative meets the call made by EC leaders, 
at their EC Summit last December in Edinburgh, to make EC law 
consistent with the subsidiarity principle, which sets out the 
limits of the Community's area of business and leaves the Member 
States responsibility for matters better dealt with on a 
national basis. Amongst the list of Directives targeted for 
simplification feature the EC's Directives on water. The 
Commission plan will be worked up into a report to be presented 
to the institution's weekly executive board meeting on November 
10. This will then be forwarded for the imprimatur of EC leaders 
when they meet in Brussels, on December 10/11, for their 
end-of-year Summit meeting. 
  Proceeding in a highly practical manner, the EC's executive 
arm has undertaken to re-examine more than 30 years of EC 
legislation, leaving aside Regulations, Directives or Decisions 
less than two years old. As a result of this examination, the 
Commission has been able to arrange the pieces of legislation 
into three different categories: 
<H5>  1. Rules and Regulations To Be Recast </H5>
  The aim is to upgrade and tidy up EC legislation in certain 
policy areas. The category includes notably pharmaceuticals, 
competition rules and trade provisions for the sale or purchase 
of farm produce. 
<H5>  2. Rules and Regulations To Be Simplified </H5>
  This, the most important category, is designed to both 
streamline EC legislation and repeal excessive technical details 
that could be covered by national or regional measures or by 
international agreements which the EC has signed. The sectors 
pinpointed by the Commission comprise a set of existing rules 
and regulations referred to by EC leaders at their Summit in the 
Scottish capital, notably legislation on farm produce, the 
so-called "new approach" technical harmonisation Directives, 
legislation on water, air and animal welfare. 
  The Commission also intends to simplify and streamline 
existing legislation on water, as announced in its 1993 
legislative programme. The general idea is to set essential 
quality and health parameters at the EC level, leaving the 
Member States free to add secondary parameters if they see fit. 
The Commission has divided the future Directives on water into 
two groups: 
  Framework Directives (which will replace the current 
Directives) 
  -- a framework Directive on drinking water quality which 
would define general parameters (some technical parameters will 
be set at Community level, others at national level). "One of 
the thorniest problems here will be the question of pesticide 
residues," says the Commission's document. This framework 
Directive will ultimately replace the existing EC drinking water 
Directive and perhaps part of the Directive on surface water 
intended for the abstraction of drinking water. 
  -- a framework Directive on the ecological quality of 
surface 
water which will set geneal objectives to be fleshed out by 
national or regional authorities if need be (if this general 
approach is accepted, the existing Directives on fish and 
shellfish waters and on surface water for the abstraction of 
drinking water can be repealed). 
  -- a framework Directive on the quality of bathing water 
(here parameters need to be simplified and adapted to new 
scientific knowledge, and provision also needs to be made for 
subsequent revision). 
  -- a framework Directive on freshwater management and 
groundwater protection which would replace the existing 
Directive on the protection of groundwater from pollution by 
certain dangerous substances. This Directive would define 
guiding principles for the qualitative and quantitative 
protection of groundwater, integrating it into a geneal 
freshwater management policy. 
  Directives Designed To Control Pollution at Source (Which 
the 
Commission Insists Will Respect the Principle of Subsidiarity) 
  -- the Directive on the treatment of urban waste water 
  -- the Directive on the prevention of water pollution by 
nitrates from agricultural sources. 
<H5>  3. Rules and Regulations To Be Repealed </H5>
  In most cases, the sprucing up of EC legislation because of 
recasting or streamlining will result in a number of EC 
Regulations and Directives being repealed altogether (nearly 77 
solely because of the recasting of the customs code). In other 
cases, (these repeals will be the result of a ruling by the EC 
Court of Justice (particularly with regard to texts related to 
the freedom of establishment and freedom of movement for people 
providing services).

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Matutes Calls For a `Credible </F>
Strategy' for Cutting CO2 Emissions"; as released by Brussels 
Euroscope EIS Database] 
  [Text] Opening a conference organised by the European 
Commission in Athens on the theme "Energy and the Urban 
Environment in the Mediterranean Countries" on November 4, the 
EC Commissioner in charge of the energy portfolio, Abel Matutes, 
declared that it was high time the Community adopted a credible 
strategy for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). In his 
view, the idea of imposing a tax on polluting emissions of CO2 
even if decided by the EC, could not be applied in practice 
because of strong opposition from third countries. Mr Matutes 
was obviously referring to the Gulf Cooperation Council, which 
is strongly opposed to the EC Commission's proposal for an 
energy/CO2 tax and whose representatives were attending the 
Athens conference. The Commissioner also praised the United 
States' plan to cut CO2 emissions, by the year 2000, to their 
1990 level, describing it as a good approach. During the opening 
day of the conference, Michel Grenon (France) of the 
Mediterranean Energy Observatory, launched an appeal for the 
international community to support energy saving programmes in 
Mediterranean cities before their burgeoning development makes 
rational use of energy schemes even more difficult and costly.

Receives Euro-Tag"; as released by Brussels Euroscope EIS 
Database] 
  [Text] The CARIOCA project, an undertaking which aims to 
develop and commercialise a special buoy designed to measure CO2 
levels at the surface of the oceans, has been awarded the 
European R&amp;D designation EUREKA [European Research 
Coordination 
Agency], the Institut Francais du Petrole (IFP), one of the 
leading organisations involved in the scheme, announced on 
October 26. The buoy is expected to automatically carry out 
precise measurements in the middle of the ocean for a period of 
up to a year at a time, using the spectrophotometry technique. 
Buoys of this type could eventually form a worldwide 
ocean-monitoring network, under the aegis of the Global Ocean 
Observing System (GOOS) programme. 
  Studying levels of carbon dioxide absorption by the oceans 
is 
a sine qua non for a serious investigation of the Earth's 
climate. Atmospheric studies, which show a 25&percnt; increase 
in CO2 
concentrations, and the theoretical models which describe 
absorption of the gas by the oceans do not together fully 
account for the total estimated volumes of carbon dioxide 
released into the environment since the start of the Industrial 
Revolution. The discrepancy in the two sets of figures could 
well be due to the speed of CO2 absorption into the oceans.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Nuclear Waste: Russian Nuclear </F>
Submarine Consigned to the Depths"; as released by Brussels 
Euroscope EIS Database] 
  [Text] The Russian nuclear submarine, Komsomolets, is to 
stay where it came to rest in 1989, following an accident, at 
the bottom of the North Sea. The European Commission, which took 
up the case last May at the request of Denmark, has accepted the 
conclusions of a majority of experts who have been consulted on 
the subject, that neither the reactors, nor the nuclear heads 
with which its stock of torpedoes is armed, pose any threat to 
the environment under present circumstances, whereas any attempt 
to salvage the submarine could have unpredictable consequences. 
  In confirming the findings of over a hundred experts in the 
field of submerged nuclear waste, the group of specialists from 
the European Union and Norway who met recently under the 
auspices of the Commission's Joint Research Centre expressed the 
judgement that even assuming the most pessimistic scenario the 
Komsomolets did not appear to constitute a significant pollution 
risk. They agreed that radiological monitoring, studies on 
sea-current variations, or indeed a thoroughgoing analysis of 
the risks involved could be carried out if the need subsequently 
arose. 
  On the other hand, the specialists warned that any hasty 
moves would be more likely to worsen than to remedy the 
situation, a far from unwarranted remark, given that Moscow has 
been trying to obtain authorisation to salvage the wreck since 
1989. The Rubin company, which built the submarine, actually 
signed a contract with Dutch recovery experts, on behalf of the 
Russian authorities, but the Dutch firm later reckoned that the 
hull was too extensively damaged and abandoned plans for a 
refloat operation. Other possible solutions have been mooted and 
rejected: burying the sub in sediment, coating it in resin, 
dissecting it and salvaging the titanium hulls, etc. A 
confidential memorandum, confirmed by French and Norwegian 
military experts, contains the view that the Russians were 
particularly anxious to recover the torpedoes and their nuclear 
warheads, thereby incidentally eliminating the risk of pollution 
from the plutonium contained in the head cones. Given that this 
submarine is of an extremely advanced design, and that the 
torpedoes are also the result of the latest development, the 
memorandum concludes that the then Soviet authorities intended 
either to recover their equipment, or at least to prevent anyone 
else from getting hold of it. This thesis is strongly supported 
by Moscow's initial moves to refloat and transport the 
Komsomolets in the name of the former Soviet state, and the 
constant presence of Russian ships in the area of the wreck.

  [Text] Chamonix (ANSA) 29 Nov -- The measures that Italy, 
France, and Switzerland intend to adopt to reduce the air 
pollution caused by ozone, which is reaching ever more worrying 
levels, include road transport, chemical plants and products, as 
well as economic measures and research. The cause of the 
excessive concentrations of ozone are nitric oxide and volatile 
organic compounds (in practice hydrocarbon vapors) emissions. 
During a meeting held in Chamonix, the environment ministers of 
the three countries signed a joint statement in order to reduce 
these emissions by 70-80 percent (over 1980 levels) and to 
achieve a "substantial" reduction by the year 2000. 
Furthermore, other governments have been invited to sign the 
agreement. 
  In transport the committment is to: reduce in the volume of 
truck traffic by using trains (even high-speed trains at night) 
and rivers to transport goods over long distances; put a stop to 
the increasing horsepower of vehicles and limiting average fuel 
consumption to 5 liters per 100 km.; step up controls on 
automobiles and speed limits; improve the effectiveness of 
catalytic converters; promote public transport; perform studies 
to determine the possible harmful consequences of building new 
roads. 
  Measures concerning plants include establishing limits for 
nitric oxide and hydrocarbon vapor emissions, both now and for 
the future. For products instead, the use of organic solvents in 
paints, detergents, glues will be suppressed or at least 
limited; in addition products containing organic solvents will 
be required to bear a label indicating the percentage content. 
  The economic measures to be adopted include increased taxes 
(exise rate) on fuels and measures designed to progressively 
cover the total cost of heavy traffic. Finally, studies to 
assess the measures to be adopted after the year 2000 and better 
exchange of information on research being performed in the 
sector.

<F P=106> [EC press release No PRES/93/240: "Community Strategy on </F>
Climate Change -- Council Conclusions"] 
  [Text] The Council: 
  1. recalls one of the conclusions of the European Council of 
10 and 11 December 1993: "Fiscal measures possibly relating, 
inter alia, to the environment could be one of the means of 
offsetting a drop in social contributions, within a general 
context of stabilizing all statutory contributions and reducing 
the tax burden." 
  2. further recalls the conclusions of the Ecofin Council 
[Economic and Financial Council of Ministers] on 13 december 
1993, that the ad hoc group needs to continue actively the work 
on the Commission's proposal on energy/CO2 taxation in the light 
of the above conclusions. 
  3. declares that, in this context and in the light of the 
Community's commitment to stabilize CO2 emissions in the terms 
agreed by the joint Energy/Environment Council of 29 october 
1990, it is necessary to create a mix of additional various 
instruments at Community level and to conclude ongoing work 
taking account of the Commission's proposal on energy/CO2 
taxation as soon as possible, and at the latest by the end of 
1994. 
  4. requests the Commission to take, as soon as possible, the 
necessary decisions on the methodologies to be used for the 
national reports in the framework of the Council decision of 24 
june 1993 establishing a monitoring mechanism in order to have a 
good basis for analyzing national efforts, and to present an 
evaluation on the progress made towards reaching the Community's 
CO2 stabilization target, as required by that decision. 
  5. requests the Commission to report on the national 
instruments, in particular economic and fiscal instruments, of 
the member states, relevant to reaching the Community's CO2 
stabilization target, which have been implemented or which will 
be implemented shortly. 
  6. requests the commission to prepare and submit to the next 
Council meeting a plan that will ensure: 
  -- the submission by the EU and its member states of the 
reports required by the "Framework Convention on Climate Change" 
within six months of its entry into force; 
  -- demonstration in this report on how the EU and its member 
states will collectively reach, as set out in the conclusions of 
29 october 1990, 13 december 1991, 5 May 1992 and 26 May 1992, 
the objective of stabilization of CO2 emissions at 1990 levels 
by the year 2000 in the Community as a whole. 
  7. agrees in this context to adopt the proposal for a 
Council 
decision on the conclusion by the Community of the "Framework 
Convention on Climate Change," recognizing the importance for 
the community of ratifying the convention before it enters into 
force and alongside its member states, so as to aLlow the 
fulfilment of the commitment relating to the limitation of CO2 
emissions in the convention by the community as a whole through 
action by the Community and its member states, within their 
respective competences.

of Results From Last Week--Resumption 13 December for Packaging

Environmental Damage"; as released by Brussels Textline database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 6 Dec 1993 (AGENCE EUROPE) - Before the 
session was suspended on Friday afternoon, a good number of 
successes had been notched up : 
  (a) unanimous adoption of the decision allowing joint 
ratification, by 1 June 1994, and of the amendment to the 
Montreal protocol on the protection of the ozone layer; 
  (b) unanimous common position on a regulation providing for 
acceleration of the calendar to eliminate HCFCs 
[hydro-chlorofluorocarbone] and methyl bromide in the Community; 
  (c) unanimous agreement at first reading on a compromise to 
allow the introduction, on 1 January 1996, of more stringent 
norms to limit polluting emissions from motor vehicles; 
  (d) unanimous political agreement on a proposal modifying 
the 
directive relating to dangerous waste, which allows the 
Commission to establish a uniform list that is as comprehensive 
as possible of this kind of waste; 
  (e) substantial progress on the main provisions of the draft 
directive on packaging and packaging waste as well as on the 
Community strategy to combat climatic changes, but nevertheless 
without definitive agreements (which explains resumption next 
Monday). 
  Regarding the other issues discussed on Friday by the 
Council, the Presidency noted the following results: 
  1. Dumping of waste. The Council has reported on the 
advancement of work relating to this issue which has progressed 
to such an extent under the Belgian Presidency that it could be 
closed, under Greek Presidency, during the first half of 1994. 
It also noted a first overview of results of the cost/profit 
analysis of this directive as far as certain Member States are 
concerned. The full Commission report is expected early 1994. 
  2. Elimination of PCB [polychlorinated biphenyls]/PCT 
[polychlorinated triphenyls]. "Good progress" was noted in the 
evolution of technical work on this directive. The Twelve 
reportedly came close to consensus on the coefficients and 
technical norms as well as on the calendar for controlled 
harmonisation. The Commission felt that technical work should 
focus on elimination on the run up to 2010 and on the limit of 
concentration. 
  3. Green Paper on civil liability for environmental damage. 
At a public session, the Council held a full round table 
discussion on this document which has already been discussed by 
public and professional circles. In his introductory speech to 
the debate, Commissioner Paleokrassas pointed out that only two 
Member States so far have formally submitted their comments on 
the Green Paper and that the European Parliament has been 
associated in a "very fruitful" public hearing. He felt that it 
was too early, at this stage, to imagine that the state of the 
environment did not justify measures in this area. Ministers 
replied by indicating major directions for reflection. They 
raised questions on several major themes such as: prevention, 
framework measures that could be justified at Community level, 
insurance. By way of conclusion, the Commissioner stressed that 
the subject is a tricky one and requires very serious 
examination before any decision is taken. He said he felt that 
the White Paper and/or formal proposals could be presented 
before next year. Between now and then, a certain number of 
points should be specified: 
  (a) the scope, that is, the categories of damage to be 
considered; 
  (b) the sharing of responsibilities between the Union, 
Member 
States and other levels of responsibility; in this connection, 
Mr Paleokrassas felt that "even if we depend upon national 
legislations, we must ensure that we are within a coherent 
Community framework that does not cause competition distortion 
between Member States;" 
  (c) the main aim of the legislation should be prevention. 
  4. Implementation of Community legislation. In comments on 
the report recently presented by the Commission, Mr Paleokrassas 
stressed the "unsatisfactory state" of the situation: many 
directives have not been transposed into national legislation by 
Member States or have been transposed incorrectly (directive 
relating to the assessment of environmental impact). In 
addition, "the practical application of Community environmental 
legislation to individual cases often seems inadequate, if one 
measures the growing number of violations and complaints (about 
one thousand each year)," he pointed out. The Council has held 
an in-depth discussion on the means to be implemented to reverse 
this trend. On this subject, Mr Paleokrassas welcomed the 
initiative aimed at establishing, within the framework of the 
Vth Programme, a network of Community authorities to ensure that 
environmental legislation is applied. In his view, this 
represents a "major contribution to the development of common 
approaches from the technical and procedural aspects of 
implementation and execution." The setting up of the Environment 
Agency should, for its part, allow the EC to have the means 
necessary to improve the situation. 
  5. Follow-up of results of Unced [United Nations Conference 
on Environment and Development] in Rio. The Commissioner 
announced the preparation of the Community report to be 
submitted to the second session of the UN Committee on 
Sustainable Development in May 1994 and regretted that the 
Community was not formally participating and that the specific 
terms of the fund for LDCs [less developed countries] had not 
yet been implemented. Several Ministers were concerned about the 
lack of visibility of Community action and the risk that the 
commitments made in Rio had not been executed. Finally, the 
Council appealed to national and European decisionmakers so that 
part of the loan foreseen for the large European networks 
suggested by Mr Delors be allocated to environmental initiatives 
such as the clean-up of polluted soil, the restoration of 
natural parks, prevention of damage caused by bad weather.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EC: Ecofin Council Defines a </F>
Strategy and Procedure on the Problem of CO2"; as released by 
Brussels Textline database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 17/12/93 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- In the light 
of the Conclusions of the Brussels Summit and the Ecofin Council 
over the CO2/Energy tax, the Environment Council defined a 
strategy enabling it to iron out the difficulties relating to 
the Community's concluding the UN Convention on climate change. 
Indeed, the Council approved conclusions by which it: 
  -- recalls the conclusions of the Brussels Summit which 
admits the possibility of "fiscal measures which could, inter 
alia, relate to the environment" (to compensate for the drop in 
social contributions); 
  -- recalls that the Ecofin Council of 13 December invited 
the 
ad hoc group to continue examining the project of a CO2/Energy 
tax; 
  -- declares that, in this context and in the light of the 
Community's commitment to stabilize CO2 emissions in the terms 
agreed by the joint Energy/Environment Council of 29 October 
1990, it is necessary to create the mix of additional various 
instruments at EC level and to conclude ongoing work taking 
account of the Commission's proposal on energy/CO2 taxation as 
soon as possible, and at the latest by the end of 1994; 
  -- requests the Commission to take, as soon as possible, the 
necessary decisions on the methodologies to be used for the 
national reports in the framework of the Council Decision of 24 
June 1993 establishing a monitoring mechanism in order to have a 
good basis for analyzing national efforts. At the same time, the 
Commission is requested to present an evaluation on the progress 
made towards reaching the Community's CO2 stabilization target; 
  -- requests the Commission to report on the national 
instruments, in particular economic and fiscal instruments, 
which have been implemented or which will be implemented shortly 
by the Member States to attain the aim of stabilization; 
  -- requests the Commission to prepare and submit to the next 
Council meeting a plan showing how the Community and its Member 
States will be able to attain the goal of stabilizing CO2 
emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000; In this context, the 
Council agrees to adopt the decision relating to the Community's 
concluding the Convention on climate change, recognizing the 
importance of the Community (and its Member States) ratifying 
this Convention before it comes into force so as to the 
fulfilment of the commitment relating to the limitation of CO2 
emissions through action by the Community and its Member States, 
within their respective competencies.

<F P=106> [EC press release No IP/93/1226: "Air Quality for the Year </F>
2000--European Commission Welcomes Industry Programme on Car 
Emissions"] 
  [Text] [European Community] Commissioners [for Industrial 
Affairs] Martin Bangemann and [Energy and Euratom Supply] Abel 
Matutes today met senior members of the European Automobile 
Manufacturers Association (ACEA) and the European Petroleum 
Industry Association (Europia). They discussed the progress made 
so far in the European programme on air quality, emissions, 
fuels and engine technologies (EPEFE/Auto/Oil programme). 
  The programme, carried out in collaboration with 
ACEA/Europia, was initiated by the [EC] Commission in the 
context of its new approach of a multifaceted, coherent strategy 
towards vehicle emission reduction measures for and beyond the 
year 2000. This strategy will include the development of air 
quality objectives and an assessment of the cost-effectiveness 
of the different measures. 
  All parties acknowledged the important contribution that the 
programme will make to providing scientific data for an emission 
policy in the European Community for the year 2000, through its 
investigation of the effects of fuel specifications and engine 
technologies on vehicle exhaust emissions. The Commission 
confirmed its commitment to develop air quality objectives and 
to assess future trends in air quality for a range of pollutants. 
  The two industries reiterated the programme's aim of 
providing the European Commission with the necessary information 
for it to propose emission limit values for passenger cars, 
light duty and heavy duty vehicles as well as motor fuel 
specifications (both gasoline and diesel) for the year 2000. The 
commissioners emphasized the need for the expeditious conclusion 
of the tripartite programme in the light of the Commission's 
legislative timetable. 
  The commissioners, speaking also on behalf of Mr Yannis 
Paleokrassas [EC Commissioner for Environment, Nuclear Safety, 
and Civil Protection], welcomed the industries' concern about 
the need to continue to improve the environmental performance of 
their products. The three parties each expressed their 
appreciation of the degree of trust which has been built up 
through the on-going tripartite (Commission/ACEA/Europia) 
consultations since autumn 1992.

<F P=106> [EC Information Memo No 93/59: "Launching the European </F>
Environment Agency--European Commission--DG XI, EEA Task Force"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  The Decision </H5>
  The 29th October 1993 brought the long awaited decision on 
the location of the seat of the European Environment Agency 
(hereafter EEA). It shall be established in Denmark in the 
Copenhagen area. The [European] Council regulation (Footnote 1) 
(Council regulation 90/1210/EEC of 7 May 1990 on the 
establishment of the European Environment Agency and the 
European Environment Information and Observation Network. OJ No 
L 120, 11.5.1990, p. 1.) is now in force which means that steps 
can be taken to ensure the EEA is up and running in the shortest 
time possible. 
<H5>  Immediate Steps Being Taken To Establish the EEA </H5>
  To make the EEA operational it is first necessary to convene 
the management board. This will consist of one representative of 
each member state, two representatives of the Commission 
(Footnote 2) (Laurens-Jan Brinkhorst (director-general DG 
[Directorate General] XI) and Jean-Pierre Contzen 
(director-general JRC [Joint Research Center]), and 
respectively, as alternatives, Thomas Garvey (deputy 
director-general DG XI) and Yves Franchet (director-general 
Eurostat).) and two designated by the European Parliament. The 
first meeting of the board will take place on Friday 17 December 
1993. The meeting will tackle the immediate business needed to 
bring about a speedy start to the EEA's work, including: the 
procedure and schedule for appointing the executive director; 
interim arrangements to start the EEA's operation; provisional 
budget matters; and, appointment of the nine member scientific 
committee. The preparations made towards a draft work programme 
will also be tabled at the meeting, together with a report on 
the activities of the EEA task force between 1990 and 1993. 
  The appointment of the executive director by the management 
board is of prime importance. The Council regulation requires 
the Commission to submit a proposal of candidature to the 
management board which will be done in consultation with them. 
  Pending the entry into service of the first executive 
director, it is vital that the scientific and technical aspects 
of the work be actively pursued. Interim arrangements will 
therefore be adopted at the first management board meeting to 
ensure the smooth transfer of knowledge and expertise and the 
continuity of ongoing projects. These arrangements will include, 
in particular: the appointment of a 'mandataire' to act as 
executive officer until the executive director begins work; the 
steps to be taken to prepare the multiannual work programme; 
and, appropriate measures concerning an interim team and its 
tasks for the transition period. The Commission will provide the 
necessary assistance for financial and administrative matters 
(in particular, preparation of staff recruitment, staff status 
and budget). 
<H5>  Background and Mandate </H5>
  The creation of the EEA should be seen against the 
background 
of the aims of environmental protection laid down in the Treaty 
of Rome as amended by the Single European Act, by successive 
Community action programmes on the environment, and now by the 
Maastricht Treaty. UNCED [UN Conference on Environment and 
Development], and in particular Agenda 21, now provide the 
international framework for fostering cooperation on the 
environment. 
  The EEA, and the `European Environment Information and 
Observation Network', which it will coordinate, are intended to 
provide the Community and the member states with objective, 
reliable and comparable information at the European level to 
enable them to take the measures necessary to protect the 
environment, as well as to be able to assess the results of 
these measures. Equally important is the aim to ensure that the 
public is properly informed about the state of the environment. 
For all these purposes the EEA will also provide the necessary 
scientific and technical support. 
  The management board will decide how the EEA is to be 
organised. However, it is clear from the Council regulation that 
the EEA will be the hub of a decentralised, distributed, network 
making the maximum use of resources already existing in member 
states. 
<H5>  Building Blocks </H5>
  A number of major building blocks are required to enable the 
tasks of the EEA to be carried out: 
<H5>  Information and Observation Network </H5>
  The European Environment Information and Observation Network 
will consist of: 
  - component parts of the existing national information 
networks; 
  - a national focal point nominated by each member state; 
  - institutions contracted by the EEA to work on specific 
subjects of particular interest, often referred to as `topic 
centres' or `thematic centres.' 
  Within 6 months of the entry into force of the Council 
regulation, member states have to inform the EEA of the main 
components of their national networks, including, if desired, 
national focal points, as well as candidates for topic centres. 
<H5>  Multiannual Work Programme </H5>
  Within 9 months of the Council regulation coming into force 
the first multiannual work programme must be adopted by the 
management board. 
<H5>  Topic Centres </H5>

  In approving the multiannual work programme the management 
board will have to decide specific tasks of topic centres. The 
Council regulation does not explicitly specify a deadline for 
the actual designation of the topic centres nor their thematic 
or geographic orientations. 
<H5>  Work Areas </H5>
  The principal activities will cover all those areas of work 
necessary to enable the EEA to describe the present and 
foreseeable state of the environment from the point of view of: 
  - the quality of the environment; 
  - the pressures on the environment; 
  - the sensitivity of the environment. 
  Priorities in supplying environmental information which may 
be used directly in the implementation of Community environment 
policy, the EEA in its first years will give priority to the 
following areas: 
  - air quality and atmospheric emissions; 
  - water quality, pollutants and water resources; 
  - the state of the soil, of the fauna and flora, and of 
biotopes; 
  - land use and natural resources; 
  - waste management; 
  - noise emissions; 
  - chemical substances which are hazardous for the 
environment; 
  - coastal protection. 
  Special consideration will be given to transfrontier, 
plurinational and global phenomena, and the socioeconomic 
dimension shall also be taken into account. 
  Possible future tasks within two years of the EEA coming 
into 
operation, the Council shall decide on further tasks for the 
EEA, in particular, in the following areas: 
  - Associating in the monitoring of the implementation of 
Community environmental legislation; - Preparing environmental 
labels and criteria for their award to environmentally friendly 
products, technologies and services etc; - Promoting 
environmentally friendly technologies and processes; and, - 
Establishing criteria for assessing the impact on the 
environment. 
<H5>  Cooperation With Other Bodies </H5>
  Community bodies the EEA shall actively seek the cooperation 
of other Community bodies and programmes, and notably the Joint 
Research Centre (JRC), the statistical office (Eurostat) and the 
Community's environmental research and development programmes. 
  The JRC will have an essential role in research and such 
areas as: 
  - harmonization of environmental measurement methods; 
  - intercalibration of instruments; 
  - standardization of data formats; 
  - development of new environmental measurement methods and 
instruments; 
  - other tasks as agreed between the executive director of 
the 
EEA and the director-general of the JRC. 
  On request of the EEA, the JRC will be able to provide 
scientific support in specific fields of competence and 
technical support in areas such as informatics and networking. 
  Coordination with Eurostat is expected to lead to the supply 
of data on human activities (necessary to assess pressures on 
the environment), on economy-environment relations, and on basic 
territorial characteristics (topography). 
<H3>  Participation of Non-Community Countries and International 
Organisations </H3>
  In parallel with its cooperation with external bodies, 
participation of third countries in the work of the EEA is 
clearly important since environmental problems and challenges 
are not confined by national frontiers. This has been envisaged 
from the outset, and provisions for their involvement is covered 
in Article 19 of the Council regulation. Considerable interest 
has already been shown by EFTA (European Free Trade Association) 
member states, as well as by countries of Eastern and Central 
Europe. 
  Participation of international organisations the EEA will 
also develop working relations with relevant international 
organisations, with bodies such as the Organisation for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD), the Council of Europe and 
the European Space Agency, and those of the United Nations 
family, particularly the United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP), the World MeteorologicaL Organization and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. The participation of 
non-governmental organisations is equally important. 
<H5>  The Inheritance </H5>
  The EEA is the logical successor, in particular, of the 
Corine programme. Corine was an experimental project (1985-1990) 
to determine the need and practice for collecting, coordinating 
and ensuring the consistency of information on the state of the 
environment and natural resources within the Community. Its 
pilot projects concentrated on land cover, biotopes, and 
emissions to the atmosphere (see below). 
  The Corine programme led to three types of complementary 
results: (i) relevant data bases for several priority 
environmental concerns; (ii) methods and nomenclatures adopted 
at Community level and internationally; and, (iii) networks of 
experts from all member states used to pooling their knowledge 
for environmental objectives. 
  The techniques, data bases and networks established under 
the 
Corine programme will provide a significant contribution to the 
work of the EEA. 
  The conclusions of the Dublin, Dobris and Luzern Ministerial 
Conferences, (June 1990, June 1991 and April 1993 respectively) 
emphasised the importance of integrating environmental 
information systems throughout Europe. Many non-EC countries 
have already expressed a keen interest to take part fully in the 
EEA's programme and to integrate into the network. In 
particular, the EFTA countries have stressed the importance of 
the role of the EEA as an instrument of cooperation on a 
European scale. Since that time, many non-EC countries have 
undertaken work in this respect. 
  Beginning in January 1990, the EEA task force has worked to 
maintain and utilise the data and expertise built-up during the 
Corine programme, and to handle the many and diverse initiatives 
arising out of the decision to establish the EEA. In order to 
limit the damage caused by the absence of a decision on the seat 
of the EEA, this has increasingly meant becoming involved in new 
activities on behalf of the EEA, without compromising future 
decisions of the management board. The main areas of the task 
force's activities, in the period 1990 to 1993, are outlined 
below. 
<H5>  Preparatory Activities for the EEA </H5>
  Work programme - in the light of many discussions between 
the 
Commission and a high-level group of member state national 
experts, the EEA task force has prepared a first draft 
multi-annual work programme. A systematic analysis of the data 
needed to implement the programme has been started, based in the 
first place on the objectives of the 5th Community Action 
Programme on the environment, 'towards sustainability'. The 
information needed to support the reporting requirements 
established in the UNCED Agenda 21 have also to be considered. 
<H5>  Network </H5>
  Work is underway to develop a network architecture for the 
EEA to ensure inter-operability of the various elements of the 
'European Environment Information and Observation Network'. This 
is taking into account issues of security, secrecy and legality, 
in line with common rules developed through the DG III 
programme, IDA (Interchange of Data between Administrations), 
whose aim is to encourage and stimulate such data exchange. The 
approach focusses on the requirements for communication and the 
exchange and access to data and information systems. 
<H5>  Data Bases </H5>
  A `data-model' is being prepared to serve the needs of 
current and expected future data holdings, including, in 
particular, those arising out of European environmental 
legislation. Development of a strategy for coding data, and 
standards needed to improve and facilitate data exchange, are 
included. 
<H5>  Catalogue of Data Sources </H5>
  A report has been completed on the needs and possible 
solutions for a 'meta-database' for the EEA. This is a system 
that records details of data holdings, data sources, 
institutions, activities and other environmental related 
information needed for the EEA's work. The main characteristics 
of the system have now been defined and a standard 'data-model' 
is being developed. Plans are also being laid for the 
preparation of a multi-lingual thesaurus of environmental terms 
to use in connection with the catalogue. 
<H5>  Updating and Completing Corine Data Bases </H5>
  Land cover - the cartography of land cover on the scale of 
1:100 000 has been completed for almost half of the territory of 
the European Community. This is continuing with the support of 
Community regional policy, with a view to completion of the 
inventory in 1994- 95. In addition, the application of Community 
methodology has begun in the PHARE (Footnote 3) (countries of 
Central and Eastern Europe in receipt of EC economic aid 
according to the terms of Council regulation 89/3906/EEC) 
countries, as well as in several EFTA member states and in 
countries in the southern part of the Mediterranean basin with 
LIFE (Footnote 10) (Council regulation 92/1973/EEC of 21 May 
1992 establishing a financial instrument for the environment 
(LIFE). OJ No L 206, 22.7.92, p. 1.)/MEDSPA (Footnote 11) 
(Council regulation 91/563/EEC of 4 March 1991 on action by the 
Community for the protection of the environment in the 
mediterranean region (MEDSPA). OJ No L 63, 9.3.1991. p. 1.) 
support. 
<H5>  Biotopes </H5>
  The data base has been updated and supplemented to serve the 
needs of Community nature conservation policy, and in particular 
the application of the `habitats' directive. The PHARE countries 
and certain EFTA member states are carrying out the inventory 
according to the Community methodology. Work continues in 
collaboration with the Council of Europe and the principal 
international nature conservancy organisations. 
<H5>  Corinair 1990 </H5>
  An inventory of pollutant emissions is being carried out for 
1990 as an update of the 1985 inventory. The work is being 
performed in cooperation with the United Nations' Economic 
Commission for Europe (UNECE), all of whose European member 
states currently apply the Community methodology `Corinair.' The 
inventory includes greenhouse gases, and the results will 
provide the European contribution to the OECD-IPCC 
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) programme in this 
field. The inventory also meets the needs for the supply of data 
connected with the Council directive on large combustion plants. 
A feasibility study has been completed which confirms that the 
Corinair methodology should be extendible to other environmental 
media to build an integrated multi-media inventory of emissions. 
<H5>  Preparation of the Report Europe's Environment Conference </H5>
  At the European Environment Ministers' Conference at Dobris 
Castle in the former Czechoslovakia (21-23 June 1991), the 
Commission received a mandate to prepare the first report on the 
state of the environment for the whole of Europe (including EC, 
EFTA and Central and Eastern European countries). The report 
will facilitate the development of an 'environmental programme 
for Europe' in the lead-up to the next Ministerial Conference to 
be held in Sofia in 1995. It will be equally useful as a tool to 
inform the public and raise awareness about environmental 
problems. 
  The report is being prepared by the EEA task force in 
collaboration with the UNECE and other international bodies 
(Council of Europe, IUCN, OECD, UNEP, WHO). The report is an 
assessment of the state of the whole European environment and of 
the pressures caused by human activities, and provides an 
analysis of prominent environmental problems of concern for 
Europe. Publication is scheduled for early 1994. The report will 
be accompanied by a joint data compendium, being prepared with 
Eurostat, OECD, UNECE and WHO. Other products are also envisaged 
including, for example, an environmental atlas and a popular 
version. 
  The preparation of the report has proved a unique 
opportunity 
to explore the possibilities for cooperation with non-EC 
countries and other bodies--international organisations and 
non-governmental organisations. The work has contributed to 
building a framework for environmental monitoring and assessment 
at a pan-European scale. Lessons learnt during the course of 
this project will be useful for preparing the tasks of the EEA. 
Particularly valuable has been the experience of collecting, 
processing and interpreting data under conditions where much 
relevant data is missing and with problems of accessibility and 
comparability for the data which does exist. The constitution 
and use of expert networks has been especially important for 
helping to resolve these problems. Furthermore, the exercise has 
contributed to bringing together the statistical activities of 
Eurostat, OECD, UNECE and WHO. The need for regular reporting on 
the environment at the pan-European level is confirmed by the 
results of this work.

Should Be Allowed To Maintain Their Advanced Environmental 
Standards"; as released by Brussels Textline database] 
  [Text] By adopting the Brigit Bjornvig Report (Dk, Rbw) 
[expansion unknown] Parliament's Environment Commission 
supported the "legitimacy" of the requests by Sweden, Austria, 
Finland and Norway to be authorized to maintain their advanced 
standards in environmental protection following their accession 
to the European Union. The Committee stressed that these 
countries: 
  a) would soon be bringing a significant contribution in 
strengthening the EU's environmental legislation; 
  b) must, as far as possible, be authorized by the Council 
and 
Commission to maintain their current environmental standards in 
those fields where the "acquis communautaire" is less advanced. 
She also hoped that these two institutions would begin revising 
this acquis as soon as possible with a view to the harmonization 
of the environmental regulations of an enlarged Europe at the 
highest level.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Claude Oppeneau: "Biotechnology and </F>
Environment"] 
  [Text] There is no shortage of examples of the contribution 
biotechnology has made to solving environmental problems. New 
markets are opening up to these technologies which have already 
been used in the treatment of water, waste or, contaminated 
land. However, organisms converted by genetic engineering 
require vigilance and reflection by both researchers and 
manufacturers in terms of their security and ecological impact. 
A balance must be found between economic competitiveness and 
respect for the environment. 
  Biotechnologies are taking an increasingly important part in 
solving environmental problems. The fungus Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium, for instance, secretes enzymes which can damage 
lignin. The phenomenon is well known, but less well known are 
the results of recent research which show that this fungus can 
also degrade certain herbicides, heavy oils, or toxic products. 
It is also thought it may be used to treat hydrocarbons which 
have accumulated in the ground. This could enable the 
rehabilitation of certain contaminated sites, a crucial problem 
today. These hopes have captured the interest of many 
companies, notably in the United States, and have resulted in a 
race to select hyperproductive lines with a view to 
optimization. The use of fungi seems promising for the future 
because these organisms can colonize vast regions while bacteria 
develop in more limited zones. 
  There is also increasing talk about biomass combustion and 
the use of biofuels. Although wood combustion is used 
relatively little in France, other countries have no hesitation 
about using it regularly and, in Denmark, new incinerators burn 
hay. Despite its critics, biofuels continue to be tested and 
the comparative eco- audit between rapeseed and diesel does not 
condemn vegetable diester. Other options exist such as wheat 
and beetroot for the production of ethanol and oxygenated 
components for lead-free gas or wood for the production of 
methanol, for example. Not forgetting the latest developments 
by English researchers who are experimenting on power supply for 
diesel engine generating units using an algae which feeds on the 
liquids used for reprocessing sewage water. This green monocell 
algae, chlorella, has an extremely rapid growth rate and the 
carbonic gas resulting from combustion is recycled to improve 
the output of photosynthesis even further. 
<H5>  New Markets </H5>
  Biology opens up whole new technological areas for processes 
and products. Because they are young these have the specific 
characteristic that they can benefit from studies on risks 
parallel to their development. This has been a rare occurrence 
throughout history. It was remarked that this was a growing 
problem during discussions on the presentation of the bill on 
genetically modified organisms (GMO's) at the National Assembly. 
In economic terms, a recent American report "Biomarkers 93: 
Forecast for High Growth Markets" puts forward several 
interesting figures. The use of ground bacteria (indigenous or 
exogenous) to treat contamination should grow to the tune of 20 
to 30 percent per year between now and the end of the decade. 
It is estimated that the market for microorganisms capable of 
desulphurizing carbon will rise to several billion dollars a 
year around the year 2000. For the recuperation of metals in 
waste using biological processes, this estimate rises to nearly 
two billion dollars in 1998. 
<H5>  Living Mechanisms </H5>
  We are entering the age of "worker microbes." True, 
sauerkraut or Roquefort cheese were already made with their 
help. The use of microorganisms for industrial production is, 
when all is said and done, ecologically satisfactory. As living 
beings, they require more "natural" or "softer" working 
conditions than traditional industrial processes. Factories 
using them will essentially be more hospitable than those using 
machines. Temperature, pressure, acidity, etc., will not create 
areas of danger as threatening as those in chemical or nuclear 
environments. However, some regulations on their production and 
utilization need to be enforced. 
  The Environment Ministry is very concerned by the industrial 
use of microorganisms and prior research. There will be 
extraordinary progress in their utilization at the beginning of 
the next century and this will lead to drastic changes in 
life-styles. This is one of the reasons why it is so important 
to initiate an in-depth deliberation on the effects of this 
progress, on the impact of genetic engineering, and to lay the 
foundations of a policy centred on precaution and ethics while 
encouraging innovation and research and providing guarantees for 
a controlled evolution. Progress is fast moving in this field. 
There are many patents and production authorizations in the 
world and France does not always take the lead on these issues. 
<H5>  Water and Biotechnology </H5>
  The biotechnology-environment twosome have already come 
along 
way together. Important research programs have enabled 
processes to be developed and some of these are operational 
today. In terms of water, whether for the production of 
drinking water or the purification of waste water, the use of 
microorganisms in an aerobic or anaerobic environment is 
inevitable. For drinking water, the excess of dissolved 
biodegradable organic carbon undergoes biological treatment 
using the properties of bacteria fixed on active carbon and 
biological nitrification or denitrification is often used. The 
treatment of waste water frequently requires a biological 
process which includes lagooning, and, if a higher level of 
purification needs to be achieved, treatment on bacterial beds 
or the use of activated muds. Today, however, in order to 
overcome certain difficulties linked to mechanical procedures, 
the development of biofilters, which lead to increasing the 
biomass activated by the use of cultures of microorganisms fixed 
on a fine granulated environment, is indispensable. For the 
treatment of residual industrial waters, the use of membrane 
bioreactors could be advantageous. 
  Similarly, the biological dephosphatization of water is an 
interesting option. The diversity of usable biotechnologies 
today and the capacity to discover new approaches for the future 
will enable current techniques to be improved considerably. 
<H5>  Waste Too </H5>
  The outlook is the same for the treatment of waste. We know 
about the methanization of silage, slaughter house residue, 
brewery dregs, etc., but also of household waste. We know how 
to develop rudimentary mechanisms, perfectly adapted to 
developing countries. In this respect, the remarkable experience 
of the treatment of residue from the Thies slaughterhouse in 
Senegal should be mentioned. This process enabled the 
elimination of solid and liquid residue through methanization 
and lagooning with water hyacinths which supplied the energy 
required to operate the slaughterhouse. Furthermore, it 
transformed the substrate and yielded a protein-rich material 
capable of increasing the production of marsh cultures for a 
lower than usual cost. In other respects, bioleaching and 
biofixing are subject to increasing research for the treatment 
of waste which is rich in heavy metals. 
<H5>  Cleaning Up Contaminated Land </H5>
  Rehabilitation treatment for contaminated land is another 
field of investigation undergoing rapid development. The 
problems this poses for the substrata and in relation to ground 
water or future exploitation are such that it is absolutely 
necessary to clean up these lands. But the cost of doing so can 
reach excessive levels if the most suitable process is not 
chosen. The biological solution is often the most acceptable. 
This question is central to many programs around the world. 
Some EUREKA projects were recently launched focusing on the 
different possibilities and certain results look promising. 
<H5>  From Air to Biosensors </H5>
  Another important area of biological cleaning covers the 
reduction of atmospheric pollution, the desulphurization and 
denitrification of smoke, the elimination of toxic products such 
as organochlorinates and deodorization. Biological sensors 
provide one example of the usefulness of microorganisms for the 
development of new instruments. In environment-related 
applications, systems using fluorescent bacteria or bacteria 
which are sensitive to certain types of pollutants in measuring 
sensors enable the quality of waterways to be controlled or 
alerts to be raised. Biotechnologies have not yet ceased 
surprising us in the fight against pollution. Who would have 
thought we would be able to use these technologies to recuperate 
precious metals in minerals in which traces of these are present 
and for which traditional processes generated pollution? 
<H5>  Agriculture and the Environment </H5>
  Genetic engineering is now also at the service agriculture 
and again relations with the environment are far from 
negligible. There are currently many joint programs between the 
National Agronomic Research Institute [INRA] and the Environment 
Ministry. 
  Obtaining plants capable of resisting insects and fungi 
could 
liberate farmers from the overuse of chemical products which 
would greatly benefit both the land and animal life. 
Entomophagous insects could also be used which would have the 
effect of limiting the use of pesticides. Once again, the 
limits of these applications would have to be studied and 
in-depth work undertaken on the biological resistance 
phenomenon. We should keep in mind the proliferation of insects 
in Venice or the case of crickets in Africa. Other inventions, 
such as plants with protein reserves, salt resistant plants... 
could be a godsend to developing countries. 
<H5>  Genetically Modified Organisms </H5>
  Opinions vary on the subject of genetically modified 
organisms (GMO's) introduced into the environment. Some say 
they are monsters created in laboratories which stand no chance 
of survival and which will be ruthlessly eliminated by natural 
selection processes. For others, they will invade the 
environment, all environments indiscriminately, and will 
therefore drive out other microorganisms and create other 
problems. It is indeed possible that they possess different 
properties than those planned by their inventors and, most of 
the time, we ignore their capacity to adapt to different 
environments. We should remember that undesirable species 
easily invade whole continents while man often has difficulties 
introducing species he would like to propagate. The debate is 
vast. 
  It seems obvious that the necessary and adequate conditions 
for the survival or the rapid multiplication of GMO's are the 
responsibility of ecology specialists because information 
resulting from in vitro culture alone will not provide the 
responses required. This is why the use of these organisms 
should be accompanied by research on their ecological impact. 
The effects of the introduction, whether deliberate or 
accidental, of various organisms (the problems of myxomatosis, 
killer bees, elm disease) are well known. 
  Transgenic plants also merit further reflection. Introducing 
a foreign gene into a plant, with ulterior exploitation motives, 
requires reflection on the possible consequences before the 
choice of the different elements which constitute the 
construction chain--the plasmid vector, the transformation 
system and the plant to be transformed--are even made. This is 
not about being alarmist but being equipped with the best 
possible knowledge of the genetic content of the material about 
to be developed. This could avoid difficulties at the time of 
field testing or during homologation processes. 
<H5>  Biodiversity </H5>
  In some respects, biotechnology can aggravate genetic 
harmonization--and the reduction of genetic diversity is a 
fundamental problem today. Paradoxically, it can also help 
provide solutions. Genetic erosion can be combatted by 
constituting stocks of genes through developing tissue cultures. 
In Mali, for example, peasants imported potato tissues from 
Belgium. They succeeded in importing a more disease-resistant 
vegetable material while economizing on the transportation cost 
for plants. 
  Ecological research must be strengthened to test the 
evolution that blind development in genetic engineering could 
bring about, and particularly in the plant world. Nature is 
being increasingly moulded by man, but biodiversity is certainly 
an indispensable advantage for its survival, notably if we are 
entering a period of galloping demography. This is why an 
approach where the use of biotechnologies is controlled and 
regulated is needed. 
<H5>  Necessary Scientific Vigilance </H5>
  Biotechnologies are no less abstract than other modern 
industrial processes. Escherichia coli, a famous bacteria, 
despite its presence in our intestines, is no more familiar than 
carbon 14 or any other isolated molecule, although its use is 
growing, and under many different guises. So are we not dealing 
with them regularly. So "artificial" bacteria need not be 
experimented more commonly than plutonium or dioxin. Creating 
it, watching over it and using it will be the task of 
specialists for a long time to come and not that of ordinary 
mortals, other than exceptionally. This is why scientific 
vigilance is capital, as it is important to evaluate the 
ecotoxicological consequences on different environments. 
  At the beginning, techniques calling on microorganisms, 
which 
some people said had been used since antiquity, did not seem to 
be at the source of any particularly great risk. But the 
appearance and utilization of genetic engineering techniques 
have completely changed this conviction. These techniques, 
which enable the potential of microorganisms to be transformed, 
and even new capabilities to be brought about by modifying the 
genome, have given rise over the past decades to questions based 
on both ethics and security. The experience we have to date of 
their utilization and industrial application is not yet 
sufficiently advanced in a certain number of sectors to enable 
all the doubts we have encountered to be removed completely. 
<H5>  Reconciling Contradictions </H5>
  The approach is directed, like for a number of other 
activities, by a search for an indispensable balance between two 
levels which can, in certain cases, seem contradictory, namely, 
economic competitive activities and the lives of people. So if 
preventive and regulatory activities must be introduced, 
scientific research must bring light to bear on potential risks, 
and researchers must adopt a practically simultaneous attitude 
of vigilance in relation to the future impact of their results 
on the environment from the very launch of a project. This is a 
golden opportunity, for once, to develop new techniques having 
taken their consequences into consideration from the very 
beginning

<F P=106> [Article signed Annette Millet: "ADEME: Between Politics </F>
and the Environment"] 
  [Text] The biotechnology research work backed by the ADEME 
[Environment And Energy Use Agency] attempts to find a 
compromise between protection of the environment and new 
openings for agricultural production. The creation of a 
scientific interest grouping [GIS] for the economic development 
of energy crops could provide the ADEME with fresh impetus. 
  The multidisciplined vocations of the ADEME include backing 
and coordinating research projects. Hit by the 1994 budget 
which shaved some 30 percent off its research and development 
funding, the young agency will no longer be able to meet the 
aims of its research program for the 1992-1996 period. It will, 
however, maintain its effort to finance scientific theses and, 
in the agroindustrial field, it hopes to receive fresh impetus 
from the creation of a GIS for the economic development of 
energy crops. 
  During the restructuring program carried out last year, the 
ADEME -- created in 1992 from the merger of the French Energy 
Use Agency [AFME], the National Agency for the Recovery and 
Elimination of Waste [ANRED], and the Air Quality Agency 
[AQA]--began to work in four major sectors: industry, the 
habitat and renewable energy sources, transport, and agriculture 
and bioenergy. Its research budget for 1994 took heavy cuts in 
the number of programs it could authorize from two of its parent 
ministries, Industry and Research (the Research Ministry cut its 
program authorizations by 30 percent while payment 
appropriation, abnormally low since 1991, rose by 20 percent). 
Globally, agency funding remained more or less stable, thanks 
to an increase in funds from the tax levied on waste products. 
This money, however, must be spent on research into household 
and normal industrial waste, and atmospheric pollution from 
large installations, leaving by the wayside certain of the 
priorities set out in the research and development program for 
1992- 1996: energy use, the restoration of contaminated sites, 
and research into untaxed air pollution. These are all areas 
that are liable to suffer from the reduction in ADEME funding. 
  Of the three bodies merged into the ADEME, only the AFME 
received research credits for the financing of its work, the 
creation of support networks, and enabling it to work with 
public and industrial research laboratories. In the 
biotechnology sector, the AFME was active in three main areas. 
Firstly, solar bioenergy, with the joint creation in 1982 with 
the Atomic Energy Commission [AEC] of the Association for 
Research into Solar Biotechnology [ARBS]. Participants from 
industry included Rhone-Poulenc, Total, and Elf. This 
association worked for six years researching into a way of 
producing hydrogen or hydrocarbons from plants and 
photosynthesizing bacteria. The ARBS was then integrated into 
an AEC laboratory. The second line of research was the 
methanization of industrial effluent, slurry, and household 
waste. One of the agency's functions in this area was to 
support the research and development stages of the Valorga 
process. The third line of research was in replacement fuel 
sources from the biomass. The AFME's finest achievement in this 
domain (and the most expensive) was the financing of the 
Soustons platform (southwestern France), originally designed 
around the "green refinery" concept and which is currently 
operated by an industrial company (SAF-Isis). 
  Over the years, the changing socioeconomic context has 
altered the purpose of the work financed by the agency. Thus, 
research into methanization, which was commenced with the aim of 
achieving energy independence, now aims at environmental 
protection, for example with the treatment of food industry 
effluent. With the creation of the ADEME, biotechnology 
reasserted its role of serving the environment, already 
established with biomass and cellulolysis research. New avenues 
were explored, such as biomatter, food, and pharmaceutical 
constituents (flavorings, colorings, texturing agents, and 
enzymes), bioprocesses applied to effluent and solid waste 
treatment, etc. This clarification of issues is particularly 
well-defined in the ADEME policy on cofinancing thesis grants. 
  Currently financed research is split equally between 
environmental protection and energy use. Given the severe 
cutback in funding, the ADEME has fallen back on the hard core 
project of cofinancing, with industrial companies or local 
communities, thesis students working in priority areas. 
Awarding thesis grants allows a certain freedom of action since 
it is thus possible to examine more adventurous subjects or 
subjects whose results are less certain. 
  Between 1988 and 1993, the field of biological engineering, 
for example, was the subject of 21 theses. In 1993 these 
included work on the microbial production of surface active 
agents (cofinanced with the French Petroleum Institute [IFP]) 
and the enzymatic alteration of cellulosed materials (cofinanced 
with a laboratory of the National Scientific Research Center 
[CNRS]). Biological engineering does not completely dominate 
biotechnology work, however. In 1993, the Impact and 
Environment Research Service [SRIM] financed theses on the 
development of a biosensor for the prevention of accidental 
pollution (air and waste) and on the bioevaluation of polluted 
soil, researching toxicity biomarkers in rats (sentinel 
animals). Biotechnology still accounts for just 15 percent of 
the 80 thesis grants cofinanced by the ADEME each year. 
  In the field of biotechnology, research could take off again 
thanks to the creation of the agency for the economic 
development of energy crops. Announced in December 1992 and 
confirmed by Hubert Curien at the Agricultural Show of March 
1993, this agency should become operational in the first quarter 
of 1994. The project will initially take the form of a GIS 
controlled by the ADEME and based on a contractual agreement 
between different partners: the ADEME, the national agronomy 
research institute [INRA], and the IFP, working closely with the 
ministries of agriculture, research, and industry. The Industry 
Ministry would also like to involve industrial groups. The 
fields of operation of this national research and development 
project are fully in line with the recommendations of the Levy 
report on biofuels--to develop research to improve the 
competitiveness of biofuels. They are defined in terms of 
product lines. Under examination will be: lipidic plants (rape, 
proteaginous species) and their possibilities for producing oils 
and methylic esters; lignocellulose plants that are sources of 
biofuel; and carbohydrate plants (wheat, beetroot, corn, and 
sorghum), producing ethanol and ethyl tertiobutyl ether (ETBE). 
A fourth program will aim at finding new uses for agriculture 
producing neither food or energy, but biopolymers, biodegradable 
surface active agents, vegetable lipochemistry, etc.). A fifth, 
cross-disciplinary program will be dedicated to the economic 
aspects and environmental impact of new products being studied. 
The idea is to be able to one day make concrete proposals to 
farmers offering them a choice of production systems. The 
public expenditure set aside for the GIS should amount to some 
40 million French francs in its first year. 
  Current ADEME research projects therefore operate according 
to a double logic: stimulating protection of the environment and 
finding an answer to the problems posed by agricultural policy.

<F P=106> [Article signed Paula Ceccaldi: "A New Generation of Water </F>
Treatment Plants"] 
  [Text] Space-saving, 10 times more efficient, 10 times 
faster and what's more, European -- that is the definition of 
the rapid waste water treatment process developed by the 
Corporation for the Treatment and Economic Development of Water 
[OTV], a subsidiary of the Compagnie Generale des Eaux [CGE]. 
The process is the result of the joint work done by its 
research center and two European partners, one Danish and the 
other Swiss. 
  Grassed over at Antibes, buried in Monaco in the basement of 
an apartment block, or integrated into a building like at Cergy 
(near Paris), the water treatment plant for the year 2000 is 
already operational. The Cergy plant, designed to purify the 
effluent of a town of 200,000 inhabitants, daily treats some 
40,000 cubic meters of wastewater. 
  The standards laid out in the European wastewater directive 
of 1991 set new limits for nitrogen con10t (less than 10 mg/l) 
and phosphorus con10t (less than 1.5 mg/l) of urban wastewater, 
and the conformity of treatment results -- 95 percent must 
comply at any given time. 
  Existing processes could only achieve these results with 
great difficulty. Firstly, it would be necessary to multiply by 
at least four the surface area of existing plants operating 
using activated sludge, such as the one at Acheres which treats 
the wastewater of Paris and its region. This is unimaginable in 
its urban location. Secondly, the control method would have to 
be changed to a process of continual analysis: until now 
results have been expressed as a daily average. 
  In 1990, in order to meet these new pollution removal 
thresholds, the CGE (OTV and Anjou Research) teamed up for three 
years in a Eureka [European scientific research program] project 
with the Danish company Danfoss, specializing in sensors, and 
with Eawag, the Swiss water institute, expert in modeling 
bioprocesses applied to water. 
  Chris10ed Simbiose (scientific improvements of biofilters 
and 
sensors), the aim of this project was to reply to the European 
water treatment standards with new, high-speed treatment 
processes. Taking up only small areas, they would simplify the 
integration of treatment plants in urban areas. Moreover, the 
use of continuous sensors would make it possible to control the 
system automatically and would give a water quality permanently 
in line with the above- mentioned European standards. The total 
cost of the project was 70 million French francs [Fr], Fr30 
million of which came from France -- Fr20 million from the CGE 
and 10 million from the French government. Frank Rogalla, 
deputy director of the CGE's research center, noted with 
satisfaction that "the program was completed in June 1993, and 
most of the aims were met." 
<H5>  Useful Experience Gained </H5>
  To meet the esthetic requirements where the environment is 
concerned and to resolve the problem of more restricted space in 
and around towns, OTV had already implemented new pollution 
removal systems. In this way the company acquired experience 
with a process using fixed bacteria beds that concentrated the 
biomass and thus removed the need for clarification equipment. 
As early as 1982, its Biocarbone process had coupled biology 
and phase separation in the same reactor. Here the biological 
purification of water is done by downward percolation through a 
fixed submerged bed, with air injected in the lower section. 
Already five times smaller than traditional, activated sludge 
reactors, it does however require two units for complete 
purification of wastewater in accordance with the new nitrogen 
removal standards -- one for the anoxic stage and the other for 
the aerobic stage. It is also necessary to clean the filters 
from time to time. 
<H5>  The New Generation of Biofilters </H5>
  The process developed in the Simbiose project, chris10ed 
Biostyr, made the disadvantages of Biocarbone appear negligible. 
  Expanded polystyrene balls are used instead of the mineral 
support. Since they float, they are kept down by a board. 
Frank Rogalla stressed: "The choice of a synthetic material 
enables us to retain tight control over the physical parameters 
(density, granulometry, etc.) and to alter the selected 
characteristics to suit the required treatment performance." 
  The pollution flows through the filter from bottom to top. 
The wastewater is pumped to a higher level and injected in by 
gravity flow. The two zones, aerobic and anoxic, are thus 
brought together in the same reactor. The air is injected into 
the middle of the bed, meaning that the anoxic zone is in the 
lower section and the aerobic zone is in the upper section. 
Backwashing by gravity flow is a sufficient washing technique. 
  Ten times less space is needed for this type of installation 
than for a conventional plant. Re10tion time has also been 
divided by 10, reduced from 24 hours to just two to three hours. 
<H5>  Miniaturization of Sensors and Automated Control </H5>
  This new generation of high-performance biofilters, however, 
was just one part of the Simbiose project. The other two parts 
dealt with sensors and the automated control of this new 
generation of water treatment plant. 
  The sensor part was the responsibility of the Danish company 
Danfoss. It was charged with designing equipment to continually 
measure nitrogen and phosphorus levels. Work was based on 
existing sensors using colorimetric methods, which Danfoss then 
improved and miniaturized. A prototype sensor is now being 
tested. The installations currently being produced by OTV will 
use conventional sensors until the miniaturized versions become 
available. Bioreactor and automated process management modeling 
is still at the experimental stage. 
  The Simbiose project time has been ex10ded to ensure the 
achievement of all the aims set out in 1990. The European 
directive requires all existing installations and processes to 
be brought in line with the standards, with all towns of more 
than 2,000 inhabitants complying by 2005.

  [Text] If radioactivity is released in the event of an 
accident in a nuclear plant, accurate information as to the 
amount and spread of radiation is extremely important. 
Radioactivity knows no frontiers, so monitoring systems must 
operate on an international scale. The Russian Federation is 
acquiring a system of this type, integrated into a system 
already in place in Germany. 
<H5>  Data Exchange Via Satellite </H5>
  Rapid, standardized, transregional radioactivity data 
exchange is of particular importance in the event of an accident 
and requires a modern information and communications 
infrastructure and regular practice in operating it. There have 
been several facilities in Russia measuring radioactivity to 
date, all working on their own, but a unified information system 
for recording and assessing the data acquired will now improve 
cooperation among them. The Federal Ministry of the 
Environment, Nature Conservation, and Reactor Safety (BMU) has 
commissioned German Aerospace AG to install a modern 
radioactivity metering and information system. IRIS (integrated 
radioactivity information system) is being set up for the 
Russian Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources. In 
the first phase of the project, parameters collected and tested 
in the area surrounding the nuclear power station near Smolensk 
will be transferred to a central post in Moscow, where they will 
be processed and used to draw up radiological maps. As Germany 
has an interest in obtaining accurate information as early as 
possible in the event of accidents at Russian nuclear plants, 
the data will be transmitted to the Federal Republic via 
satellite and fed into the German information system. The IRIS 
metering network planned for Russia is based on the IMIS 
integrated metering and information system in Germany. After 
the Chernobyl reactor disaster, the BMU commissioned Dornier 
GmbH to create the user software for the system in 1988. 
<H5>  Radiation Metering System for Europe </H5>
  IMIS is an early warning system designed to minimize 
exposure 
to radiation following incidents involving the release of 
radioactivity. A program system that uses models to calculate 
the level of contamination in the water, soil, and air has been 
incorporated to assess the impact on the population. The 
calculations are used in conjunction with a catalog of measures 
from which the appropriate recommendations and instructions may 
be derived. The system comprises the following main functions: 
  -- measurement of radioactivity in environmental samples; 
  -- monitoring of environmental radioactivity in the air, 
soil, and water over large areas; 
  -- compilation, presentation, and assessment of 
radioactivity 
parameters; 
  -- dispatch of instructions and recommendations to the 
authorities concerned, and 
  -- information exchange among the authorities responsible. 
  The methods of linking and coordinating different metering 
facilities and networks devised for IMIS can be used for other 
environment protection operations, primarily waterway monitoring 
and soil conservation, as well. 
  Cross-border environmental problems call for information 
technology solutions using supraregional systems. Being of a 
decentralized nature, the integration of heterogeneous networks 
run by different organizations constitutes an ideal model for an 
integrated European environmental information system. IMIS 
systems of this type are already undergoing trials in the Czech 
and Slovak republics.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Aid for Environmentally-Friendly </F>
Techniques in German Companies"; as released by Brussels 
Euroscope EIS Database] 
  [Text] The European Commission has approved regional aid 
to MAN Nutzfahrzeuge to underwrite investment in 
environmentally- friendly techniques in this firm located in 
Salzgitter, Germany. The project provides for the expansion of 
facilities and the installation of new machines, with the aim of 
increasing production of buses and bus parts at the Salzgitter 
site. Environmentally- respectful techniques will be used to 
enlarge the painting workshop. The project runs from 1991 to 
1994 and will cost a total of 92.2 million DM (48.1 million ECUs 
[European Currency Unit]), of which 89.8 million DM (45.6 mECUs 
[million ECU]) are eligible for regional aid. The number of 
people permanently employed at MAN will grow from 3,914 to 4,534 
by 1994 and capacity will increase to 900 units per year. The 
aid proposed will take the form of a three million DM (1.6 
mECUs) grant, to be disbursed in 1994 and 1995, the equivalent 
of an aid intensity of 2.8&percnt;. In approving this state aid, 
the 
Commission concluded that the project met regional criteria for 
state aid to the motor industry. 
  The Commission has also decided not to raise any objections 
to a proposal by Bavarian authorities to help a pulp plant in 
Kelheim maintain production until December 31, 1993. This plant 
belongs to Bayerische Zellstoff GmbH, which is facing 
bankruptcy. In 1992-1993, the plant switched from a 
sulphite-based process to an organocellular one developed by the 
Technocell group, to which Bayerische Zellstoff belongs. This 
production method does not use sulphur or chlorine and is 
therefore less harmful to the environment. A planned 350 million 
DM investment in this plant eventually cost twice this much due 
to technical problems. The temporary aid offered by Bavarian 
authorities will take the form of a credit guarantee in the 
amount of 17.5 million DM and a bank loan for the same sum. The 
Commission feels that the form and limited duration of this aid 
meet its general conditions for an exemption from the EC's ban 
on anti-competitive state aid.

  [Excerpts] Rome, (ANSA) 10 Dec -- Obtaining an energy 
source that is an alternative to traditional sources, that is 
renewable and inexhaustible such as the sun, and clean. These 
are the three objectives of a research project for the 
production of hydrogen from microorganisms funded by the 
Japanese Ministry of Trade and Industry (MITI), with the 
participation of Eniricerche as the only "foreign" partner. 
Rather than being clean, the energy that it is hoped to develop 
under the project for the production of biosolar hydrogen can be 
defined as being a "cleaner." The fundamental steps of the plan 
(which is being managed by the semigovernment Japanese agency 
NEDO) include the recycling of refluent water and solid waste 
that become raw materials before the process. In addition, the 
choice of hydrogen as the fuel to be produced using 
microorganisms is part of a more wide-ranging MITI initiative 
for safeguarding the environment. The ministry's program is to 
obtain, by means of a series of coordinated measures, a 
reduction in carbon dioxide emissions which are considered to be 
one of the major causes of pollution on earth (greenhouse 
effect), at international level. Hydrogen produces water, not 
carbon dioxide, when it burns. 
  Eniricerche is taking part in the project as a member of 
RITE 
(Research Institute for Innovative Technology for the Earth) 
which manages the consortium. The other partners are all 
Japanese and include: IHI, Kubota, Tokyo Gas, Fuji Electric, 
Kajima, and NIBH (National Institute of Bioscience and Human 
Technology). Indirect and marginal participation comes from the 
University College of London, and Tokyo Agricultural University. 
Each partner is carrying out part of the project in its own 
laboratories. Eniricerche's studies focus on genetic 
engineering to improve the efficiency of hydrogen production by 
photosynthetic organisms. (passage omitted).

<F P=106> [Interview with Alberto Meomartini, managing director of the </F>
Italian national gas corporation, by Fabio Pavesi; place and 
date not given: "Methane Candidates Itself as the Sourcer for 
the Year 2000" -- first six paragraphs are L'IMPRESA AMBIENTE 
introduction] 
  [Text] Since there are abundant resources of natural gas 
and it is a versatile fuel, it is now in first place in the 
Italian energy portfolio. Nearly 50 billion cubic meters are 
consumed and this covers 25 percent of the national energy 
requirement. It holds a place of honor after petroleum, that 
has been won over 20 years of continual progress. The demand 
has in fact increased to its present level from 13 billion cubic 
meters in 1970. 
  Further leaps ahead are foreseen for the immediate future. 
According to forecasts made by SNAM [National Gas Pipeline 
Company], at the turn of the century about 75 billion cubic 
meters should be available to meet the domestic requirement. 
  The growth in the use of this source of energy has been 
determined by its characteristics of flexibility and high 
efficiency. It should not be forgotten that the environmental 
variable, which has become ever more important, has been one of 
the factors that has contributed to both the success and the 
multiplicity of uses of natural gas. In fact the combustion of 
methane liberates neither sulfur dioxide nor particles and 
assists in reducing (for the same amount of energy used) the 
emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile 
organic compounds. Although three quarters of the consumption of 
methane in Italy is destined to civil and industrial use, the 10 
years from 1980 to 1990 have seen the use of methane for the 
generation of electricity triplicate, and this is the sector 
where the environmental advantages of the fuel should open up 
further new opportunities for development. 
  The opportunities for the future use of methane in the road 
transport sector should also be stressed. Last July Fiat and 
SNAM signed an agreement for the perfection of an engine that is 
exclusively powered by methane. 
  The agreement, which provides for an initial funding of 10 
billion lire, assigns the definition of the logistic and 
organizational aspects of the operation to the corporation that 
forms part of the ENI [National Hydrocarbons Corporation] group. 
The medium-term goal of the operation is that a quota of 
vehicles for personal and public transport should have methane 
engines. 
  In short, there are many initiatives underway that will lead 
to a further increase in the demand for gas. 
  L'IMPRESA AMBIENTE discussed these subjects with SNAM 
Managing Director Alberto Meomartini. 
  Pavesi: Let us start with the methane automobile. 
The largest national producer of automobiles, and the public 
corporation that essentially manages methane throughout Italy, 
have formed an alliance to create a revolutionary engine. Is 
the gasoline era coming to an end? 
  Meomartini: No, without a doubt. There is no 
risk that gasoline will become obsolete, neither at present nor 
in the future. It would be better to say that from now on 
methane-powered vehicles will no longer be confined to the 
realms of utopia. This is the real meaning of the agreement 
that we have stipulated with Fiat. It is the signal that there 
are spaces in elected areas, in this case urban traffic, where 
the use of methane could provide an excellent concrete answer to 
environmental problems. In fact, the combustion of methane 
means increased efficiency and therefore energy saving and 
contained levels of polluting emissions, such as in the case of 
carbon monoxide, or no emission, as for sulfur dioxide and 
particles. 
  Pavesi: Is this valid for all road vehicles? 
  Meomartini: Theoretically, yes. However, it is 
necessary to go ahead gradually. It is clear that for 
automobiles and private transport in general, there are some 
rigid elements that are not easy to overcome, such as refueling, 
and autonomy over a distance. The agreement with Fiat focuses on 
public transport, starting with taxis and company fleets as far 
as automobiles are concerned, and also buses, of course. Iveco 
already produces buses that are exclusively powered by methane. 
We do not think that it is as important to talk about large 
numbers today as it is to talk of the high symbolic value that 
is behind this initiative. And even if we should quantify the 
phenomena, let us not forget that public transport has 
noteworthy incidence on the global level of pollution within the 
city. 
  Pavesi: I suppose that the costs of these 
prototypes are not competitive. 
  Meomartini: The cost of the vehicles will 
initially be higher. If however we look into all the dynamics 
of costs-benefits we discover that this is a half truth. On the 
other side of the balance we must put the high energy efficiency 
of the methane engine and the low cost of this fuel, as well as, 
obviously, the lower costs for the environment, that we should 
all be taking into account at last. They are all positive 
variables within the complete management plan. At Ravenna, 
where five methane-powered buses are already circulating, the 
verdicts of the administration and the population on this first 
experiment are more than flattering. 
  Pavesi: Are you working on anything else? 
Meomartini: A series of contacts with the public 
administrations are underway. We are thinking of an agreement 
between Iveco and SNAM and the Emilia Romagna Region on a 
significant substitution, within a specified time, of the entire 
fleet of buses in circulation. The biggest mistake in this case 
as in other cases is to think that public opinion is the only 
retarding force against the introduction of innovative products 
onto the market, such as methane-powered vehicles. 
  Results are only obtained by starting with a constant 
comparison in which the public sector party, who is the real 
manager of the initiative, is not left alone. 
  Pavesi: Let us come to the traditional uses of 
methane. How much has the environment contributed to the 
increase in consumption of this energy source? 
  Meomartini: If, by the environment, we do not 
only mean minor pollution, but also the saving of resources, I 
would say that this variable has had a very important influence 
on the development of its uses. In the past natural gas was 
often considered and used only as a substitute for other fossil 
sources. In the course of the years, research has produced a 
great improvement in efficiency and energy output. 
  And this is a plus that has been appreciated more and more. 
If we add to this a combustion process that produces levels of 
pollution that are lower than those of other energy sources, the 
circle is completed. 
  Pavesi: What form will the scene take in the year 
2000? How will natural gas compare with other energy sources? 
  Meomartini: Italy has reserves of over 300 
billion cubic meters and produces between 16 and 17 billion 
cubic meters a year, which forms the basis, this quantity not 
having varied for many years. We are counting on being able to 
increase the flow of gas coming from abroad, that today accounts 
for about 70 percent of the total requirement. This, thanks to 
an increase in the availability of gas from Algeria following 
the installation of a second gas pipeline across the 
Mediterranean that will allow an increase in the supply from the 
present 13-14 billion cubic meters to 19 billion cubic meters in 
1995, which becomes 23 billion when the gas purchased directly 
by ENEL [Italian Natini] The development of the consumption of 
natural gas is a worldwide characteristic. However, we cannot 
imagine that our projects can grow without limits. The entire 
energy market must have its own equilibrium, represented by 
balanced relationships between the various sources. Methane is 
to be used where it is economical and technologically more 
convenient. 
  In this balanced view, the greatest obstacle is that of 
fiscal politics, which through the multiplication of levies, 
weighs heavily and therefore penalizes. Another problem that 
arises during the laying of gas pipelines is that of the 
environmental norms. We are still not formally subject to an 
evaluation of the environmental impact. Despite this, the 
network of norms in our country is particularly complicated and 
bureaucratic, so much so that sometimes it really slows work 
down. It is a pity, because we in SNAM have a great and 
consolidated tradition of environmental conservation. It is 
enough to think of the gas pipeline for importation across 
countries such as Austria, the Netherlands, Germany and 
Switzerland, that as far as environmental severity is concerned 
are definitely second to none.

<F P=106> [Article by Nick Nuttall, Environment Correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Millions of people may be breathing hazardous levels 
of pollution because government information bulletins conceal 
the truth. 
  Concentrations of ozone, a gas produced by car and 
industrial 
fumes, routinely break World Health Organisation guidelines, a 
study of environment department data discloses. 
  The department, which issues air quality warnings on a 
telephone service, said ozone levels broke health limits on 23 
days last year. The true figure was more than 230 days, 
according to a study by Friends of the Earth. 
  Natural ozone at high altitudes protects the Earth from 
damaging ultraviolet light, but at lower levels the gas is being 
linked to an increase in asthma cases, lung damage, eye 
irritation and smog. Studies in America indicate that up to 10 
per cent of healthy adults could be ozone sensitive, 
experiencing tight chests and nose, eye and throat irritation. 
  In cities, ozone pollution is aggravated by other exhaust 
fumes, including nitrogen dioxide and sooty particles, 
scientists claim. High ozone concentrations occur on still, 
sunny days through a reaction between carbon monoxide, 
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide. The effects can be felt 
hundreds of miles downwind of busy cities. 
  The environment department claimed that there were no days 
in 
Stevenage last year when ozone air quality was poor. But an 
analysis of the official data shows that ozone levels in the 
Hertfordshire town broke WHO guidelines on 13 days. 
  A similar pattern emerges across the country from many of 
the 
21 stations monitoring ozone pollution. In Birmingham city 
centre, levels broke health guidelines three times, yet no 
official warnings were given. At two sites in London -- 
Bloomsbury and Victoria -- there were potentially hazardous 
ozone levels on two occasions, but officially there was a clean 
bill of health. 
  Fiona Weir, senior air pollution campaigner at Friends of 
the 
Earth, accused the government of massaging the figures. Air 
quality bulletins are issued only when ozone levels peak at 90 
parts per billion for more than an hour. Until May 1992, the 
figure was 100 parts per billion. Both limits are at the upper 
end of the WHO's one-hour guideline, whose lower limit is 76 
parts per billion. 
  The WHO also sets limits for ozone levels of 50-60 parts per 
billion over an eight-hour exposure period. Ms Weir said that 
the government had ignored this, despite a European Community 
directive which recognises that the eight-hour exposure limit is 
a health risk. 
  Some scientists and environmentalists are also concerned 
that 
Britain has two few monitoring stations.

<F P=106> [Article by Polly Ghazi: "New Cancer Fears Raise Ministers' </F>
Doubts on Thorp"] 
  [Text] Anxiety among Ministers over the hundreds of cancer 
deaths that Britain's new nuclear reprocessing plant is expected 
to produce is jeopardising its future. 
  The Government's radioactive waste advisers have received 
urgent instructions to review alarming new estimates by 
Government and independent scientists of likely worldwide deaths 
from the Thorp plant at Sellafield in Cumbria. 
  The move follows meetings between Environment and Health 
Ministers who fear the health risks from Thorp may scupper 
Government plans to approve the plant's operation within the 
next few weeks. 
  A senior Government source said last week that the issue of 
public dose levels was now regarded as `very serious' and 
'potentially fatal' to the plant's future. 
  The effects of discharges from Thorp into the air and sea is 
causing increasing concern among both the British public and 
foreign governments. Last week, the Health and Safety Executive 
confirmed that childhood leukemia levels 10 times the national 
average found in the village of Seascale nearby could be partly 
caused by radiation from Sellafield. 
  Environment Minister Tim Yeo last week instructed the 
Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee to advise the 
Government on the validity of calculation methods for radiation 
doses and subsequent worldwide deaths. 
  The move follows the forwarding to Ministers this month of 
an 
alarming new report by the Government's official radiation 
watchdog, the National Radiological Protection Board. 
  The report estimates that radiation doses afflicting the 
global population from the nuclear complex will almost quadruple 
after Thorp begins operating. 
  The new worldwide levels, which would cause around 200 
deaths 
for every year of Thorp's operation, are also more than three 
times greater than the previous highest totals, reached in 1975. 
Ministers have repeatedly stated that public radiation doses 
will not be allowed to return to such levels. 
  These official figures are much higher than recent estimates 
produced for Greenpeace by radiological expert Dr David Sumner 
of Glasgow University that provoked widespread public concern. 
He estimated that the first 10 years of Thorp's operation would 
sow the seeds of 600 cancer deaths worldwide from Sellafield. 
  The protection board report partly blames the steep rise in 
worldwide doses on proposed Thorp emissions of two very 
long-lived cancer-causing radionuclides, iodine-129 and 
krypton-85, which `circulate globally and therefore irradiate 
large numbers of people.' 
  However, the report claims less than a quarter of future 
total Sellafield doses will originate from Thorp. And it 
stresses that the accuracy of its dose estimates are 
`questionable' as they are based on radiation effects over 
10,000 years, during which new technology may greatly reduce 
risks. 
  Nevertheless, the protection board figures will boost 
opponents' demands for a wide-ranging public inquiry before 
Thorp is allowed to operate. 
  `However small the doses may be, people will die as a result 
and it will be very hard to justify allowing the 1970s levels to 
be breached,' said Dr Sumner. 
  Officials fear these new concerns over Thorp's health 
effects 
could unravel the Government's entire case for approving the 
plant. Under the Radioactive Substances Act 1960, every new 
radioactive discharge must be justified by demonstrating that 
economic gains will outweigh the damage to human health. 
  But the original economic justifications for Thorp have now 
largely disappeared. Not only will the plutonium it will produce 
be largely redundant because the new generation of fast-breeder 
reactors it was meant to fuel have never been built, but foreign 
customers are now expressing doubts about the plant's viability.

<F P=106> [Article by Lisa Buckingham and Roger Cowe: "CBI Costs </F>
Pollution Clean-up at &pound;40 Billion"] 
  [Text] The Confederation of British Industry [CBI] has 
warned that the cost of cleaning up all industrial-contaminated 
land in the United Kingdom could be as much as &pound;40 billion. 
  Responding to European Community [EC] clean-up plans, the 
CBI 
says this cost should not be borne wholly by industry. 
  Admitting that putting a figure on the extent of 
contamination is difficult, and putting a price on 
rehabilitation even more problematic, CBI experts have 
calculated that as much as one tenth of United Kingdom land 
could be defined as polluted to some extent. 
  The industry body's submission to the EC calculates that 
assessing the scale of contamination could cost as much as 
&pound;600 million and that merely containing the problem may 
cost 
&pound;20 billion. 
  If all the main polluted sites were to be completely 
rehabilitated--fit to be used for any purpose and not just for 
industry--the total bill could rise to an astronomical &pound;40 
billion, the CBI says. 
  But the submission highlights problems caused by the 
Government's failure to pursue plans for a register of 
contaminated land. It says the biggest impediment to better 
clean-up is a lack of agreement on what constitutes 
contamination and what then constitutes adequate cleanliness for 
the intended purpose. 
  Despite the growing hysteria in some business circles, the 
Confederation cautions against scaremongering over the potential 
scale and cost of the clean-up. "After centuries of economic 
activity in Europe much of it is contaminated. But the areas of 
real risk are much more limited," it says. It reckons only about 
2 per cent of all polluted sites need urgent remedial action. 
  The EC issued a consultative Green Paper earlier this year 
on 
environmental damage and who should be held liable for the costs 
of cleaning it up. British industry is worried that it will be 
exposed to much greater liabilities than at present. 
  Of particular concern is the possibility that a strict 
liability regime might be introduced, laying business open to 
paying for pollution even if its operations conform to accepted 
standards. Banks and insurance companies are also alarmed that 
the notion of joint and several liability could come into force, 
meaning that any organisation with an involvement in a polluted 
site could be liable for the entire clean-up cost. 
  Industry is also adamant that retroactive liability would 
lay 
it open to huge claims for past pollution which met standards 
then in force. 
  "Business people need to know that actions which are lawful 
when they are taken will not become unlawful in the future 
because of improved science or the introduction of higher 
environmental standards," the CBI states. 
  The organisation supports other businesses lobbying to 
prevent pressure groups being able to take legal action against 
polluting companies. The CBI believes the right to take legal 
action should be restricted to those who suffer damage or to the 
statutory authorities. "To do otherwise is to invite the use of 
the law to achieve environmental improvements," it says. 
  Friends of the Earth spokesman Andrew Lees said this would 
give the Government a "monopoly on conscience." He added: "It is 
fundamental to any concept of citizens' rights that 
organisations such as ours should be able to fill the action 
gap." 
  Mr Lees also argued that it was necessary to have strict, 
retrospective joint and several liability. He said that lenders 
who can influence management should be liable for companies' 
pollution and that environmental contamination had such a wide 
impact on society that it should stand apart from other issues 
in the way it is dealt with by the law. 
  "We need to have a proper integration of the environment and 
the economy," he said. "It can't be just a bolt-on extra. It has 
to be one of the pillars of the way we organise society."

"Sellafield Nuclear Discharges `200 Times the Levels Stated'"] 
  [Text] Plutonium 239, the most dangerous radioactive 
substance, has been showered over the Cumbrian countryside for 
the past 40 years in far larger quantities than previously 
admitted, according to a report compiled by British Nuclear 
Fuels. 
  The report, produced for BNFL last year but kept secret, 
shows that in some years the people of Cumbria have unknowingly 
had more than 200 times the quantity of cancer-causing plutonium 
vented into the atmosphere around them than previously 
acknowledged. 
  Scientific knowledge about the reasons children contract 
leukaemia is still uncertain, but the only known cause is 
plutonium, which when ingested, even in tiny quantities, is 
attracted to bone and attacks the bone marrow. 
  The report detailing the excessive discharges is revealed 
today in a Granada Television drama documentary Fighting For 
Gemma, the story of Gemma D'Arcy who died just before her 
seventh birthday of chronic myeloid leukaemia. The programme 
traces her story and the so far unsuccessful fight by the small 
team of solicitors who took on the state-owned company to gain 
compensation. 
  The plutonium has been discharged routinely through a large 
number of stacks on the Sellafield site while the company 
reprocesses spent fuel to extract the metal for nuclear weapons 
production and for future use as reactor fuel. 
  Calculations made for the company by scientists, using soil 
samples from Cumbria and BNFL's own data from chimney filters, 
show that in the 1950s and early 1960s more than 200 times the 
previously revealed level of plutonium was routinely put into 
the atmosphere. 
  Until now the amount of plutonium in mud samples and in dust 
in Cumbria has been attributed to the half ton or so of the 
metal which the company discharged into the sea over the same 
period. It now appears that some of it at least has been 
fall-out from the plant's chimneys. 
  The programme will embarrass the company and the Government 
at a time when the decision on whether to go ahead with the new 
Thorp re-processing plant at Sellafield is still awaited.

<F P=106> [Article by Nick Nuttall, Environment Correspondent: </F>
"Britain Steers Clear of Ban on Dumping Nuclear Waste at Sea"; 
first paragraph is THE TIMES introduction] 
  [Text] President Clinton has refused to ask Britain to halt 
nuclear-processing at Sellafield, while making known his 
displeasure. He rejected a request from 33 members of Congress 
that he try to block the Thorp plant in Cumbria but told them 
the continued production of plutonium was not justified. 
  Britain defied international public opinion yesterday by 
refusing to support a worldwide ban on dumping nuclear waste in 
the sea. 
  The decision to abstain, also taken by France, Belgium, 
China 
and Russia, came at a meeting of the International Maritime 
Organisation, a UN body based in London. 
  Britain could now resume dumping radioactive material at any 
time. 
  Officials at the agriculture department, which spearheaded 
the government's stance, insisted there were no immediate plans 
to resume dumping defunct nuclear submarine reactors or waste 
from power stations, hospitals and research laboratories. 
However, they said they wanted to keep open such options. 
  Ministers at the defence, environment and agriculture 
departments now have 100 days in which formally to reject the 
ban, otherwise they will be automatically bound by the majority 
decision, despite abstaining. 
  More countries could join the boycott. About 30 signatory 
nations ignored the meeting and, like Britain, can register 
their opposition within 100 days. 
  Last night there was every sign that Britain is prepared to 
defy the agreement. While a spokesperson for the agriculture 
department said: "We will now carefully consider our response," 
official sources said the government's position remained the 
same: Britain argues there are good scientific reasons for 
having the option to resume nuclear dumping at sea rather than 
keeping it on land, particularly for bulky items such as pieces 
of submarines. 
  Critics claim radioactive substances in the sea respect no 
territorial boundaries and that monitoring and retrieving leaky 
containers is significantly more difficult from oceans than from 
land-based stores. 
  Yesterday's vote, supported by 37 members of the 
International Maritime Organisation, including America and 
Japan, replaces a ten-year voluntary ban that was broken by 
Russia recently when it dumped radioactive wastes off Japan. 
  Before the voluntary ban, Britain had dumped about 74,000 
tonnes of low and intermediate level waste at 15 locations. 
Currently, Britain has six radiation contaminated submarines 
awaiting disposal at naval dockyards. 
  Russia said earlier in the week that it could not support a 
ban at the moment as it had no other option for dealing with its 
radioactive wastes from its fleet of nuclear submarines. 
  Dick Trump, a Dutch official who chaired the meeting, said 
yesterday: "I would have been much happier if we would have 
adopted the resolution unanimously." 
  "We will have to look to the future," he said, referring to 
the 100-day response time. 
  Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group whose lobbying 
in the early 1980s led to the preliminary ten-year voluntary 
ban, initially reacted with delight to the vote. 
  As it became clear that several key nuclear powers might 
ignore the ban, Remi Parmentier, an adviser in the political 
division, said: "It would be a public outrage if France, the UK, 
Russia and Belgium filed a declaration of non-acceptance. It is 
about time these governments realised that no one wants to see 
the oceans become a radioactive waste garbage site. It is about 
time they joined the ranks. The oceans belong to everyone, not 
Her Majesty's government or the French Republic."

"Europe To Give Ecolabelling Higher Priority"] 
  [Text] Environment Minister Baroness Denton today welcomed 
the award of the first European Community ecolabel to a major 
British manufacturer. 
  The ecolabels, which are awarded to products which satisfy 
cradle to grave environmental criteria, will provide clear and 
reliable guidance to consumers on which products are least 
harmful to the environment. 
  Speaking at the UK Ecolabelling Board, Lady Denton said: "I 
am delighted that the first EC ecolabel is being awarded and 
that the award is to a washing machine produced by a major UK 
manufacturer. This is an important milestone in the history of 
the scheme." 
  "Hoover are to be congratulated, as are the UK Ecolabelling 
Board who developed the criteria, which were the first to be 
adopted by the European Commission. It is the UK which appears 
to be setting the pace on this scheme." 
  "My pleasure at being able to participate in this event is, 
however, tinged with disappointment at knowing that there is 
still no early prospect of building up the level of momentum we 
would like to see with the addition of further products." 
  "Despite the enormous efforts of the UK Ecolabelling Board, 
the many delays there have been in getting the scheme into 
operation mean that it so far covers only washing machines and 
dishwashers." 
  "Now that the first labels have been awarded I hope that the 
Commission will give the work greater priority and that those 
member states who have as yet made no contribution to the Scheme 
will be drawn into playing an active part in it. We will 
continue to exert pressure on them at all levels to do so." 
<H5>  [Notes to Editors] </H5>
  The European ecolabelling scheme was agreed by Environment 
Ministers in December 1991 and set up under Council Regulation 
(EEC) 880/92 of 23 March 1992, published in the Official Journal 
of the European Communities on 11 April 1992 (L99 Volume 35). 
The Regulation has direct effect on UK law. 
  The scheme is a voluntary one. The purpose of the scheme is 
to identify products which are less harmful to the environment 
than equivalent brands across the whole of their life cycles. 
The aim is to encourage the design, production, marketing and 
use of such products and so achieve a real environmental gain. 
The scheme applies to all consumer goods except for food, drink 
and pharmaceuticals. The scheme will offer advantages for 
industry and consumers, especially with the introduction of the 
Single Market. Criteria for labels will be valid across the EC. 
  UK Regulations which came into force on 1 November 1992 
established an independent body, the United Kingdom Ecolabelling 
Board, to administer and promote the scheme nationally. Experts 
from wide range of relevant backgrounds were appointed to the 
Board. The Chairman, Dr Elizabeth Nelson, was appointed on 5 
March 1992.

<F P=106> [Bronwen Maddox report: "Five Countries Query Legality of </F>
Thorp Permit"] 
  [Text] The government has received inquiries from the 
European Commission and other European governments about the 
legality of licensing the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant in 
Cumbria, it emerged yesterday. 
  Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, told the Commons in a 
written answer that, since the start of the second public 
consultation on Thorp in August, the government had received 
letters from the Irish Republic and Denmark about the 
application of the European directive on environmental impact 
assessments to Thorp. 
  He added that Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands had also 
written to the UK about Thorp and the environmental impact 
assessments required under international marine pollution 
recommendations. Ministers are expected to announce within days 
whether they will give the go-ahead to the 2.8 billion pound 
plant. They have already said that they are "minded" to grant a 
licence. British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner, has said 
that the alternative of launching a public inquiry could delay 
start of operation by months and would undermine its 
profitability. 
  Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, 
said 
yesterday: "It would be nonsense for the government to give the 
plant the nod only for the European Court to rule it illegal 
later." 
  Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group whic has 
mounted 
court challenges to the government's handling of the Thorp 
decision, said yesterday it believed that full environmental 
impact assessments should be carried out before a decision was 
made.

<F P=106> [Article by Sean Ryan, environment correspondent: "Toxic </F>
Cocktail Killing North Sea Dolphins"] 
  [Text] The wildlife of the North Sea, one of Europe's most 
diverse habitats, is under increasing threat from a build-up of 
pollution that is killing dolphins, seals and countless birds. 
  The most comprehensive study of the sea, undertaken by 
leading scientists from the eight countries surrounding it, has 
found that concentrations of toxic chemicals are high enough to 
cause tumours and breeding failures across a wide range of 
species. 
  Ministers from all the countries concerned meet in 
Copenhagen 
this week to consider the conclusions of the Quality Status 
Report of the North Sea, which took six years to complete and is 
regarded as a conservative analysis of the impacts of pollution. 
  They are expected to respond with measures to curb illegal 
dumping of oil from ships, pesticide pollution and over-fishing. 
  Conservationists warned that marine wildlife was facing 
disaster in "a synthetic soup of chemicals" because governments 
had failed to meet anti-pollution targets set three years ago. 
Dr Sian Pullen, of the World Wide Fund for Nature, said action 
so far had failed to reverse decades of deterioration. "The 
commercial and environmental losses are enormous," he said. 
  The study, to which Britain contributed more than &pound;5m, 
says mammals are particularly at risk from thousands of 
industrial chemicals that accumulate in body fat after getting 
into the sea from rivers, waste tips and the air. Some, 
including polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), are thought to 
suppress immunity to disease and damage ovaries. 
  Poisonous waste metals such as mercury have attacked the 
kidneys and livers of minke whales, bottle-nosed dolphins and 
grey and common seals. Tens of thousands of sea birds are also 
dying each year in oil slicks from rigs and ships' tanks. Dr 
Nancy Harrison, of the Royal Society for the Protection of 
Birds, said: "Accidents make headlines, but chronic oil 
pollution is the biggest danger to wildlife and the health of 
the sea." 
  Some of the most startling impacts have been recorded in 
fish. Contamination by tributyl tin, a highly-toxic component of 
paints used on ships' hulls, has triggered sex changes in 
whelks, often miles from shipping routes. 
  Vast numbers of cod have developed tumours on their gills 
because of general chemical pollution and food and poisoning 
from shellfish, including mild paralysis, is on the increase: 
the report blames sewage. 
  Dr John Huthnance, a leading British oceanographer, said the 
North Sea was especially vulnerable to pollution because it was 
largely landlocked. Chemicals that might disappear in six weeks 
in other seas could linger there for two years. 
  The study warns that fertilisers seeping into the sea from 
rivers and underground channels have contributed to high levels 
of phosphorous and nitrogen, which have fed blooms of toxic 
algae. 
  The Thames Humber, Tees and Tyne are all identified as 
important sources of industrial pollution. Metals swept 
downriver sink into sediments where they are absorbed by tiny 
organisms and gradually work their way up the food chain. 
  Britain's pollution record has been fiercely criticised by 
other North Sea countries, particularly in Scandinavia, who 
pride themselves on their environmental performance. They are 
expected to complain this week that Britain has fallen behind 
targets set for curbing several pesticides. The use of 
dichlorvos -- one of the most toxic chemicals -- to deal with 
lice on fish farms was due to be cut by half between 1985 and 
1995, but has so far increased. 
  In Copenhagen, however, Britain is expected to accuse 
Denmark 
of taking grossly excessive catches of fish. The report says 
that up to 40&percnt; of all commercial species by weight are 
hauled 
out of the sea each year. More than half the adult cod and 
haddock in the North Sea were netted between 1986 and 1990, a 
rate described as impossible to sustain. 
  Tim Yeo, the environment minister, said he regarded 
excessive 
spraying of pesticides on roadsides and railway embankments as 
one of the priorities for the conference. "We are committed to 
reducing their use to the absolute minimum," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Polly Ghazi and Nick Gillies: "Aldermaston Leaks </F>
`20 Times Safety Level'"] 
  [Text] Land close to villagers' homes in Berkshire is 
contaminated with radioactive plutonium from the Aldermaston 
nuclear weapons plant at levels 20 times the regulatory minimum. 
  Analysts at Manchester University's chemistry department 
have 
detected highly radioactive soil around two manholes from a 
hazardous waste disposal pipeline leading from Aldermaston to 
the Thames. 
  At the first site, opposite a row of houses between the 
villages of Tadley and Padworth -- and within 500 yards of the 
plant -- they detected plutonium levels 20 times above the 
Government's radioactive waste threshold of 400 becquerels per 
kilogram. At the second roadside site, next to an equestrian 
centre and a few hundred yards from Padworth, plutonium levels 
were 12 times the minimum. 
  The monitoring, commissioned by Greenpeace, undermines 
previous claims by the Ministry of Defence-owned plant that 
`low-level' leaks from sections of the pipeline had only 
released radioactivity `slightly above the regulatory 
threshold.' Tomorrow Chris Smith, Labour's environment 
spokesman, will demand that the MoD reveal all the contaminated 
sections of pipeline in the interests of public safety. 
  Aldermaston has previously refused to reveal the sites, all 
of which are on land with public access, claiming they pose `no 
danger to landowners or to the public.' By contrast, the plant's 
neighbour, Blue Circle Cement, which is suing the MoD over the 
separate contamination of its property, has fenced off the 
polluted area and put up public warning signs. 
  The Greenpeace report, to be published tomorrow, is the 
latest in a series of safety scares to plague the ageing 
Aldermaston plant, which makes the warheads for Britain's 
Trident missiles. 
  Earlier this year The Observer revealed how nearly 
100 employees had been killed, badly injured or contaminated in 
the course of more than a thousand accidents and at least 252 
separate fires. 
  Two more serious incidents have occurred in the last few 
weeks. On 3 September, the Health and Safety Executive ordered 
the plant to shut down equipment in the A45 facility, where the 
warheads are manufactured, after radiation leaked into waste 
receptacles. The HSE enforcement stated that `all necessary 
steps to restrict ... exposure of employees to ionising 
radiation have not been taken.' 
  Then, on 11 November, the plant's liquid water treatment 
plant was temporarily closed after high levels of radiation were 
recorded in a sludge tank. 
  An MoD spokesman stated that official monitoring of the 
pipeline was `comprehensive' and only very low levels of 
radioactivity had been detected.

  [Text] The Minister for Health, Mr Joshua 
Angatia yesterday warned that in future, Aids patients will 
have to be catered for by their families because the Government 
could not afford to maintain them in hospitals. 
  He said if all Aids patients were to be admitted to 
hospitals, then it would mean that patients suffering from 
curable diseases would not get hospital beds. He said Aids 
patients in the country were 35,000 while HIV positive cases had 
reached 800,000. 
  The Minister, who was moving a motion seeking the 
&pound;109,986.945 for the year 1993/94 said if the Government 
continued admitting Aids patients in hospitals, then it meant 
that those suffering from the common diseases would have to die 
in their homes. 
  Mr Angatia, who is also the Malava MP, said health care 
programmes had been introduced and that district health 
management boards will now be allowed to use 75 per cent of 
money collected in the cost- sharing to purchase medicines. 
  He said the Government was advising the Nairobi City Council 
on step to take to run its clinics on a 24-hour basis, to avoid 
congestion at Kenyatta National Hospital. 
  He disclosed that Pumwani Nyayo Wards will be opened soon 
and 
that the Infectious Diseases Hospital commonly known as IDH will 
be converted into a district hospital. 
  Seconding the motion, the Minister for Labour, Mr 
Philip Masinde, said too much money was being used in 
maintaining ambulance vehicles. He cited cases where a battery 
could go down in a car leading to its grounding. 
  He said the cost of medical attention had shot up and that 
Kenyans could no longer afford to get sick. He said some 
hospitals were demanding as high as Sh16,000 admission fee.

<F P=106> [Article by Alibosit Vincent: "Meningitis Hits Buwekula"] </F>
  [Text] Fourteen people have died in Kibalinga, Buwekula 
areas in Mubende district recently. According to the medical 
report issued by the Medical Superintendent, Mubende Hospital Dr 
Ngobi, the cause of death was meningitis. 
  The disease has reportedly claimed many lives in various 
areas of Mubende district but the worst hit being Kibalinga, 
Kasana in Buwekula areas. Only a few cases have so far been 
reported to the District medical authorities. 
  The District Medical Officer, Mubende Dr Bagambisa George 
revealed it was a strain of malaria parasites which was 
difficult to treat using ordinary malaria drugs. He attributed 
the escalating number of deaths to the ignorance of the people 
about the prevailing outbreak of the disease. He said normally 
during dry periods meningitis is common among the people and 
claims a lot of lives. 
  He also conceded he had received reports of the disease in 
the district. 
  Meanwhile, a source who talked to The New Vision 
and asked for anonymity, disclosed a district team headed by the 
District Medical Officer, Dr Bagambisa is soon to go around the 
district educating people about the causes of these rampant 
deaths.

<F P=106> [Article by Yunusu Abbey: "20 Sudan Refugees Dead in Arua </F>
Camp"] 
  [Text] Over 20 Sudanese refugees have so far died after 
contracting meningitis and measles at two transit camps here. 
Many more are down from the same causes. 
  The dead comprise mainly old men and women as well as 
children living under squalid conditions at the camps, four 
miles from Koboko town along Moyo-Koboko road. 
  The death occurred between last week and mid this week, 
according to Red Cross workers at the camps. "Between five to 
six people are dying here daily," said a Red Cross volunteer 
from Arua who is involved in the operation. 
  On Monday August 16 alone, nine people died in one camp. 
Four 
others had died the previous day while another four died on 
Tuesday. The adults are mainly dying of meningistis while 
children are dying of measles. 
  Aid workers however expressed fear that the death toll might 
rise because of the unhygienic and poor sanitary conditions at 
the camps. 
  By Thursday the 30,000-plus refugees living in the two 
camps, 
had no toilets. Pit latrines had not been dug. They were also 
faced with an acute water shortage. The British charity 
organisation Oxfam, was still surveying nearest possible source 
of water for them. 
  Besides, refugee families are crammed in poorly built 
grass-thatched huts, while others are sleeping under trees. 
Tents have been given out to some but many have not yet received 
any. 
  RC officials distributing the food say though the bombing 
had 
ceased at the southern Sudan border town of Kaya, more refugees 
were still coming in. Four truck-loads arrived at the Koboko 
camps mid this week. 
  The refugees are mainly of the Kakwa ethnic group of 
southern 
Sudan. Their dialect is almost similar to that of Uganda Kakwas 
in Koboko. But they complained that SPLA [Seychelles People's 
Liberation Army] fighters, mainly Dinka, confiscated and looted 
their property as they fled to Uganda. 
  Sudanese Anglican Bishop Semmey Solomon has also sought 
refuge at Koboko. He is now staying with some Ugandan priests at 
Nangilia parish.

  [Text] More than 730 cases of tuberculosis were reported at 
Harare City Council's two infectious diseases hospitals between 
January and March this year, an average of 243 a month or almost 
3,000 a year. 
  Of the cases reported, 70 percent were male. A report from 
the Director of Health Services, Dr Lovemore Mbengeranwa, tabled 
before the council on Thursday said that 264 of the cases had 
been diagnosed as sputum positive pulmonary TB and 42 as sputum 
negative pulmonary TB. 
  A total of 676 notifcations were received and investigated, 
and TB accounted for 544 of them, the director said. 
  There was a decrease in the number of sexually transmitted 
diseases cases reported at primary care clinics compared to the 
same period last year. The 20 to 34 age group, however, remained 
the high-risk group. 
  Meanwhile, 12 cholera cases were reported during the same 
period and measures were taken to prevent the spread of the 
disease.

  [Text] The Minister of Health and Child Welfare, Dr Timothy 
Stamps, yesterday confirmed recent Press reports that over 20 
members of staff had contracted tuberculosis at Chiredzi 
District Hospital. 
  Dr Stamps told reporters in Chiredzi that 20 nurses and six 
general hands had contracted TB but neither confirmed nor denied 
that four nurses had died of the disease. 
  "They did not die of TB, we all know what they died of," he 
said. 
  Investigations to establish the cause of the outbreak were 
underway while efforts to protect staff from TB were being made, 
he said. 
  Dr Stamps said precautions being taken to prevent the 
recurrent of such incidents included proper disposal of TB 
positive Sputum, the use of masks by staff, proper changing of 
bed linen and thorough cleaning of hospitals. 
  "TB is a big problem in Chiredzi, you should put in place 
extra precautions to reduce the risk of TB spreading," he said. 
  He, however, said staff also had a duty to protect 
themselves 
but did not guarantee a "non-risk situation." 
  Dr Stamps said in 1992 Masvingo recorded 377 deaths 
resulting 
from TB of which 144 were from Chiredzi. He said at least 200 TB 
cases were reported every three months in Chiredzi.

  [Text] At least 223 people have died in Zimbabwean prisons 
since January, 130 of them of Aids-related diseases, the 
Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, Cde 
Emmerson Mnangagwa, told Parliament yesterday. 
  The grim statistics show that not less than 15 prisoners 
have 
died each month in Zimbabwe's gaols since the beginning of the 
year. 
  The highest number was 43, who died of various ailments in 
July. 
  Of the Aids-related illnesses, the lowest number of deaths 
was seven in April, while the highest was 30 for May. 
  Responding to a question by Chief Edgar Musikavanhu, who 
asked what measures were being taken to improve living 
conditions in Zimbabwe's prisons, Cde Mnangagwa said most of the 
deaths occurred after a short stay in prison. 
  "We are made to understand from a medical point of view that 
these illnesses, particularly those which are HIV-related, could 
not have been contracted in prison on account of the short 
period of incarceration." 
  "It is true that there is an increase in the number of 
prison 
deaths. It should, however, not be forgotten that this is a 
phenomenon which is not peculiar to the prison system only. 
Hospitals countrywide are reporting increasing numbers of 
deaths," he said. 
  The longest period of stay in prison of those who died was 
31 
months and the shortest was 14 days. 
  Cde Mnangagwa said there had been an increase in the number 
of deaths in prisons over the past five years with a 
corresponding increase in HIV-related deaths. 
  "On the other hand, it should also be noted that with the 
increase in the prison population figure the number of deaths is 
likely to increase," he said. Zimbabwe's prison population rose 
from 15,000 in 1989, to the present figure of 19,600. 
  In 1992, there were 20,600 people in jails, but the number 
came down following a general amnesty earlier this year. 
  Cde Mnangagwa denied that deaths in prison were due to the 
living conditions or to alleged outbreaks of diarrhoeal diseases. 
  A committee had been set up to look into the issues related 
to deaths in prisons and a comprehensive report would be 
submitted to the ministry in "due course." 
  A report by the Catholic Commission for Justices and Peace, 
which described conditions in Zimbabwe's prisons as "horrible," 
lacked detail and did not give a balanced picture. 
  The report alleged rampant sexual abuse, food shortages, 
poor 
health facilities, diseases, overcrowding and assaults by prison 
officers.

<F P=106> [By Reporter Zhong Weining (6988 5898 1337): "The Beijing </F>
Association for Prevention and Curing of Venereal Disease and 
AIDS Is Established"] 
  [Text] AIDS [acquired immune deficiency syndrom] cases 
occurring before 1 December, World AIDS Awareness Day, have 
again sounded the alarm for us. 
  According to the report published by the municipal 
sanitation 
and antiepidemic department on 25 November, ever since the 
advent of AIDS in Beijing in 1985, 55 persons have been found 
infected with the virus -- 32 are foreigners, 11 are from other 
provinces and municipalities, and 12 are residents of Beijing. 
Beijing ranks third in the country in the number of persons 
infected with the AIDS virus. The first reported case of AIDS 
in our country was in Beijing; the first veneral disease patient 
infected with the AIDS virus was found in Beijing; and the first 
overseas laborer infected with the AIDS virus was also 
discovered in Beijing. 
  In addition, venereal disease which had basically been 
eliminated in Beijing in the middle of the 1960's has revived. 
It is reported that about 800 new persons have suffered from 
venereal disease each year. Moreover, we have already found 
cases in which children and infants are born infected with the 
venereal disease. 
  On the one hand, analysis of the reason why Beijing ranks 
third in the country in the number of persons infected by AIDS 
virus is an indication of the seriousness of the threat imposed 
by AIDS in Beijing. On the other hand, it also shows that the 
attention of municipal government, economic input, and advanced 
technology have made Beijing's AIDS discovering rate higher than 
average. According to the analysis of the sanitation and 
antiepidemic specialists, Beijing is a low AIDS-infected 
epidemic area. 
  To prevent and control the spread of AIDS and venereal 
disease in an even more effective manner, Beijing took the lead 
in the country to set up the Beijing Association for the 
Prevention and Cure of Venereal Disease and AIDS on 25 November. 
Thus far, more than 70 units of 17 trades, including medical 
prevention and curing, tourism, press, and civil administration, 
have joined this AIDS prevention organization.

<F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan] </F>
  [Text] China has set 1995 as the target year to eradicate 
polio but its efforts have been hampered by the country's large 
size and an increasingly mobile population, an official said 
yesterday. After a cheque presentation ceremony in Hong Kong 
yesterday, Guo Xianzhi, a deputy director of the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, said another problem 
was insufficient vaccine production capacity. "The Chinese 
Government is making every effort to achieve the eradication of 
polio by the year 1995 ... That's the guarantee made by the 
Chinese Government not only to children in China but also to 
children of the world," said Mr Guo. 
  The Ministry of Public Health estimated China would need 
about $530 million to eradicate polio. As much as $460 million 
will be used to purchase vaccine. Mr Guo said although 
impressive results had been achieved in the fight against polio, 
the next two years would be critical. "From several thousand 
cases down to 1,000 cases is a little easier. However, for the 
last few hundreds, if you consider China's large area and 
population ... it could be no easy job." 
  China has reported a steady decline in polio in the past 
three years. In 1990 it registered over S,000 cases of polio 
and the figure dropped to 1,191 last year. However, it is 
believed cases of polio could be many times higher than those 
reported. 
  Under the present plan a nationwide polio eradication 
campaign will be launched in early December, when every child 
under the age of four will be given one pill of vaccine. A 
second pill is to be administered early next spring. "At the 
moment we have about 100 million children who are under four 
years old, so you can imagine the efforts, the cost and 
resources involved in this are very immense," Mr Guo said. 
  In addition, the Government also needs to provide vaccine 
for 
the 20 million newborn babies each year. By 1989 China had 
received over $150 million from the United Nations to improve 
its vaccine storage facilities.

<F P=106> [Report by John Kohut in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] About 100 million children in hundreds of thousands 
of villages and towns across China will be inoculated against 
polio beginning on Sunday in the biggest mass immunization 
programme the world has ever seen. The two-day immunization 
blitz, which will be repeated on January 5 and 6, is part of an 
effort by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Chinese 
Government to eradicate the polio virus from China by 1995. 
  The strategy behind the mass immunization campaign was "to 
just smother the whole population with oral polio vaccine, and 
hopefully wipe out the dangerous virus," said Dr Kingsley Gee, 
the WHO representative in China. WHO hopes to wipe out the 
polio virus worldwide by the year 2000, and believes China is 
well within reach of eradicating it within two years. "If China 
does it, we hope it will set a faster pace in the rest of the 
world," Dr Gee said. 
  So far this year, China has reported 430 incidents of polio. 
However, without a mass immunization programme, the country is 
still vulnerable to the possibility of another upswing in polio 
cases. About two million doctors, health workers and support 
staff will be involved in the immunization drive, aimed at 
inoculating all children under the age of four. 
  The serum has cost U.S.$7.3 million (H.K.$56.37 million), 
half of which was paid for by China and the remainder of the 
bill being paid by outside donors. This round of immunization 
should wipe out the virus in most provinces, but a repeat 
programme would probably be needed next year in Guangdong, 
Guangxi, Guizhou and Hainan, Dr Gee said.

<F P=106> [Commentator's Article: "A Major Event in Protecting </F>
Children's Health -- Polio Immunization Program Begins 5 
December"] 
  [Excerpts] With State Council approval, urban and rural 
areas across China will take unified action today to start a 
polio immunization program for children under the age of four. 
This is an important measure adopted by the Chinese Government 
to protect children's health and improve the quality of the 
Chinese population, as well as an important event in the history 
of public health in China. [passage omitted] 
  Western Asia, in which China is located, has set a 1995 
deadline for the elimination of polio.[passage omitted] 
  The Chinese Government all along has attached importance to 
children's issues, and has regarded concern for children's 
healthy growth as a basic major issue in national construction. 
In 1965, China succeeded in developing a live polio vaccine, 
which has been applied in various places in China since that 
same year. In the "10-Year Plan for National Economic, and 
Social Development and the Program for the Eighth Five Year 
Plan," which China adopted in the early 1990's, planned 
immunization was listed as an important measure for protecting 
children's health. In 1991, Premier Li officially signed, on 
behalf of the Chinese Government, the "Declaration on the 
Subsistence, Protection, and Development of Children" and the 
"Plan of Action" for implementing this declaration, thus making 
a solemn commitment to the whole world. In 1992, the State 
Council officially promulgated the "Program and Plan for the 
Development of Chinese Children in the 1990's," and included the 
elimination of polio by 1995 as an important goal for the 
protection of children's health. 
  To eliminate polio and cut back on the handicapped 
population 
is of great significance today. On the basis of achieving a 
planned polio immunization rate of 85 percent, China in recent 
years has adopted a series of measures -- based on provinces and 
counties as units -- to accelerate the elimination of polio, and 
it has achieved pleasing results in the past few years. The 
incidence of polio has fallen with each passing year, and no 
cases have occurred in the urban areas of some cities, whereas 
the incidence of polio has approached or achieved the lowest 
level in history. This situation has won the universal 
admiration of the international community. However, because of 
China's vast territory and huge population, as well as the great 
differences between various places, the development of the 
planned polio immunization among children is imbalanced, and 
weak links continue to exist. Regarding the absolute figure in 
the incidence of polio, China still accounts for around 
one-fifth in the world, ranking top among the 35 countries 
(regions) in Western Asia. Should we fail to take unified 
action in unfolding a polio immunization program, it would be 
very difficult to achieve the goal of eliminating polio. This 
being the case, China has decided to take the current nationwide 
immunization program as a crucial measure for eliminating polio, 
and is ready to seize the favorable period between now and 
January 1995, when the spread of polio virus is comparatively 
weak, to unfold polio immunization programs twice each year so 
as to upgrade children's organic resistance to the virus. 
  The immunization program, which involves approximately 100 
million children, is unprecedented in China. To make the 
program successful calls for the active participation of the 
whole society and the close coordination of various departments.

medicine for treating iron-deficiency anemia has been developed 
by a health care products factory in Zhanjiang City in south 
China's Guangdong Province. 
  Nearly 1,000 clinical tests showed that the drug was 98 
percent effective. 
  The medicine, "Weixue Chongji," which is taken mixed with 
boiling water, is made from traditional Chinese medicine 
ingredients. 
  It is said to be more easily absorbed and to have no 
side-effects on the stomach or intestines, making it an 
improvement on medicine made from ferrous sulfate that 
iron-deficiency anemia patients in China use at present, said 
medical experts at a symposium on women and health care held 
here. 
  Iron-deficiency anemia is a disease with high incidence 
worldwide, said the experts. In China, the incidence of this 
disease is about 40 percent among children and 20 percent among 
women.

  [Text] Hefei, December 9 (XINHUA) -- In the countryside 
chronic diseases are closely connected with patients' 
occupations and the their working and living environment, 
according to a large-scale investigation now being conducted in 
east China's Anhui Province. 
  The investigation is part of a co-operative research program 
between Anhui Medical University and the Medical College of 
Harvard University in the U.S. 
  The research into chronic and non-infectious diseases, which 
started in May this year and will continue for 20 years, aims at 
clarifying the role of occupation- and environment-related 
factors that cause chronic diseases. 
  Since the 1970s the death rate from infectious diseases has 
been effectively curbed worldwide because of the introduction of 
effective vaccines and antibiotics. However, not much research 
has been done on the relationship between the environment and 
occupations, and chronic diseases such as tumors and heart 
disease, which are now major causes of death. 
  The two institutes chose the Yingjiang district of Anqing 
city, Yijin town in Jiyang County and Haikou town in Huaining 
County, all in Anhui, as the focus of their field work. 
  A four-month investigation of 52,000 of the total 60,000 
population in the three areas has already been concluded, 
covering 2,378 items, including chronic respiratory ailments, 
the influence of pesticides on health, female fertility and 
medical services in the countryside. 
  An investigation of the urban population in the same areas 
will soon be carried out. 
  These surveys will be repeated at five-year intervals, and 
the information will be fed into computers.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhu Baoxia: "Parasites Infect Most of </F>
Nation's Population"] 
  [Text] Parasitic diseases have infected more than 
62&percnt; of 
Chinese residents and have become a major threat to public 
health, especially in rural and ethnic areas. 
  Some medical specialists suggest that central and local 
governments include parasitic disease control in their social 
and economic development programmes and increase budgets for 
parasite eradication. 
  Ministry of Public Health experts, who recently completed a 
nationwide survey exposing the problem, hoped that extensive 
publicity and education could raise the public's awareness 
regarding parasitic illnesses. 
  The survey found that of the 62&percnt; of Chinese infected 
with 
intestinal parasites, some 43&percnt; had two or more species of 
parasites. Some persons had as many as nine species. 
  The rate of infection is even higher among farmers and 
ethnic 
people because of their agricultural activities and dietary 
customs. 
  Most are infected with roundworm, pinworm, and whipworm. 
  It is estimated that some 531 million people in the country 
have round-worms. 
  Each year, the central and local governments spend some 150 
million yuan (about $26 million) treating people infected with 
such soil transmitted parasites as roundworm, pinworm, whipworm, 
and hookworm. 
  The national survey, the first and the largest of its kind 
in 
Chinese history, lasted for eight years from 1988 to 1992 [years 
as published]. 
  The Ministry of Public Health and local governments spent 
more than 5.2 million yuan (over $900,000) for the survey which 
involved about 8,000 technicians and medical specialists. 
  The survey selected 2,848 pilot sites in 726 counties, and 
some 1.5 million persons were surveyed by fecal examination. 
  A total of 56 species of parasites were detected on the 
mainland. Of those, three species of trematodes detected in 
Anhui and Fujian provinces are the first recorded in humans on 
the mainland. Another species, also found in Fujian Province, 
is the first instance of infection in a human. 
  The highest infection rate--nearly 95&percnt;--was reported 
in 
South China's Hainan Province. The lowest--17.5&percnt;--was in 
northeastern Heilongjiang Province.

  [Text] Beijing, December 20 (XINHUA) -- China is to use 
legal means to avoid new births of inferior quality and heighten 
the standards of the whole population. 
  The measures include deferring the date of marriage, 
terminating pregnancies and sterilization, according to a draft 
law on eugenics and health protection, which was presented to 
the current session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
(NPC) Standing Committee. 
  Explaining the law to participants at an NPC session that 
opened here today, Minister of Public Health Chen Minzhang said 
that the measures will help prevent infections and heredity 
diseases and protect the health of mothers and children. 
  Under the draft law, those having such ailments as 
hepatitis, 
venereal disease or mental illness, which can be passed on 
through birth, will be banned from marrying while carrying the 
disease. 
  Pregnant women who have been diagnosed as having certain 
infectious diseases or an abnormal fetus will be advised to halt 
the pregnancy. Couples in the category should have themselves 
sterilized, the draft says. 
  China is in urgent need of adopting such a law to put a stop 
to the prevalence of abnormal births, Minister Chen explained. 
Statistics show that China now has more than 10 million disabled 
persons who could have been prevented through better controls. 
  The draft also stipulates that organizations that are 
engaged 
in pre-marital checks, eugenics, pre-birth diagnosis or 
sterilizations should be approved by the authorities at the 
county level and above. 
  Personnel involved in this area should be subjected to 
strict 
training, Chen said. 
  The minister of public health called on medical authorities 
at various levels to establish a comprehensive network for the 
implementation of the law. 
  The draft does not state whether China will adopt euthanasia 
to eliminate congenitally abnormal children, saying that the 
international community has not come to a conclusion on that 
issue. 
  The draft also does not touch on the issues of artificial 
fertilization or test-tube babies because the effects of these 
techniques have caused some disputes and because it's too early 
to put any limitations into law, Chen said. 
  Minister Chen said the government should strengthen its 
control and supervision of these techniques. He called for the 
Ministry of Public Health to work out tentative management 
measures of control.

  [Text] Beijing, December 13 (CNS) -- There are now an 
estimated 250,000 drug addicts in China with the trend spreading 
from Yunnan Province to other areas in Guizhou, Sichuan, Gansu, 
Shaanxi and Guangxi, affecting some 700 counties in 17 
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in all, the 
Minister of Public Health, Mr Chen Minzhang, said. 
  Speaking at a inaugural meeting on the prevention of drug 
abuse, Mr Chen said that most drug addicts were teenagers with 
the drugs used ranging from opium to refined heroin. Crimes 
resulting from drug addiction are now on the rise and include 
burglary and robbery, murder, fraud and the kidnapping of women 
and children for sale. 
  About 60 percent of AIDS cases in China were due to 
intravenous heroin injection. 
  As publicity on the dangers of drugs is still inadequate, 
drug abuse is now quite serious in the country. 
  Mr Chen said he believed that with economic prosperity, the 
pharmaceutical industry had mushroomed with the appearance of 
serious drug abuse and the administration of drugs had become an 
arduous task. 
  The ministry had adopted a number of measures to strengthen 
drug administration and guide the production and marketing of 
drugs. As drug abuse is a complicated social problem, it 
requires a massive input from various sectors to deal with it. 
An association whose aim is to prevent drug abuse was formally 
set up today with the approval of the Ministry of Public Health 
and the Ministry of Civil Affairs with the Vice Chairman of the 
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Mr Fei 
Xiaotong, as its honorary president and Mr Chen as its president.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhu Baoxia: "Call For New Drive To Beat </F>
Drug Abuse"] 
  [Text] A senior government official yesterday called for a 
nationwide publicity campaign to fight drug abuse. 
  Public Health Minister Chen Minzhang was speaking as a new 
body, the Chinese Association for Drug Abuse Prevention and 
Treatment, was founded in Beijing. 
  Chen, who was elected chairman of the association, said it 
would be a great help in the government's battle to control and 
treat drug addiction. 
  The association is composed of medical experts and officials 
from relevant State departments. 
  It will carry out publicity campaigns warning of the dangers 
of drugs, treat addicts and abusers and guide medical units in 
the clinical use of narcotics. 
  Narcotics are indispensable as effective painkillers, Chen 
said, but their random use could be harmful. 
  A sample survey in Beijing found three in every 1,000 people 
are dependent on drugs. 
  China now has 250,000 registered drug addicts, most of them 
young and middle-aged men, in 17 provinces across the country. 
But experts say the actual figure must be higher. 
  Most of the addicts, reliant generally on heroin and opium, 
are concentrated in the south and northwest of the country. 
  Drug abuse has become the major channel for the spread of 
HIV, which leads to AIDS. 
  Among the 1,159 HIV carriers reported from China's mainland, 
about 60 percent got infected through intravenous injection of 
narcotics. 
  Drug abuse, according to World Health Organization (WHO), is 
the excessive use of narcotics, tobacco, alcohol and medicines 
which may lead to addiction.

  [Excerpts] Jakarta, Monday [13 December] -- Indonesia will 
not carry out an anti-AIDS campaign that encourages the use of 
condoms, as in Western countries, because this would be 
tantamount to legalizing free sex [preceding two words in 
English] and prostitution. 
  "As an Eastern country with our own culture, traditions, and 
strong religious upbringing, we will not employ such methods," 
Health Minister Suyudi told reporters after meeting with 
President Suharto at Bina Graha Palace on Monday, 13 December. 
  Criticism has recently been heard from ulemas, who question 
the methods of the anti-AIDS campaign and the recommendation 
that people who frequently service women use condoms. They 
believe that such tactics are tantamount to legalizing 
prostitution. [passage omitted] 
  According to the minister, condoms should be used to prevent 
the spread of AIDS, but society only approves of this method 
being employed by people who are already infected with AIDS so 
that the disease will not be transmitted to others, such as 
their wives or spouses. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Fukui, Dec. 11 KYODO -- Japan is surrounded by 
countries affected by AIDS, Health and Welfare Minister Keigo 
Ouchi said Saturday [11 December]. 
  "All the countries around Japan are AIDS countries," Ouchi 
said. 
  "With the exception of Japan, the units that go on United 
Nations peacekeeping operations from other countries all come 
back infected with AIDS." 
  Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), 
made 
the comments in response to questions from participants at a 
seminar on party policy he attended at the invitation of the 
prefectural branch of his party in Fukui. 
  Ouchi said he would not name countries, but added that "many 
people are going overseas recently and AIDS is on the increase 
especially among young women." 
  "Japan aims to be an advanced country when it comes to 
medical treatment and we must conquer AIDS," Ouchi concluded. 
  One participant, who requested anonymity, said he thought 
Ouchi's comments might have "gone too far as health minister." 
  On November 25, the ministry's AIDS surveillance committee 
released its latest figures indicating that Japan had a total of 
1,356 people who were either human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
carriers or had developed AIDS symptoms. 
  The figure does not include people infected through blood 
transfusions.

  [Text] Tokyo, Dec 23 KYODO -- Japan will allow overseas 
AIDS patients and HIV carriers to enter the country to attend an 
international conference on AIDS to be held in Yokohama in 
August 1994, government sources said Thursday [23 December]. 
  The Health and Welfare Ministry and the Justice Ministry 
will 
permit those who have been infected with the human 
immunodeficiencey virus (HIV) to come into Japan to attend the 
conference, the first in Asia of its kind. 
  However, if attendants are proved to have once had a hand in 
prostitution, the ministries will refuse them entrance, the 
sources close to the ministries said. 
  About 1,000 AIDS patients and HIV carriers are expected to 
take part in the 10th International Conference on AIDS to be 
held from August 7 to 12 in Yokohama. 
  Organizers expect over 10,000 people from more than 140 
countries to attend. 
  Japan's immigration law grants the government a right to 
refuse entrance to those who are infected with a virus and run a 
risk of spreading the virus among people. 
  The ministries, however, decided to allow HIV carriers to 
enter the country because their purpose of participating in the 
conference is clear, the sources said. 
  The law also enables the government to stop the entrance of 
those who have a background of prostitution even if they are to 
make speeches at the conference. 
  However, they can apply for special permission for entrance 
with the Justice Minister if they wish, they said. 
  Nongovernment organizations overseas have urged Japan not to 
shut the door to participants who have engaged in prostitution. 
  All previous conferences were in Europe or North America, 
but 
the organizers hope for greater Asian input next year because 
statistics shows AIDS cases will explode in Asia toward the end 
of the decade. 
  In Japan, there are currently over 3,000 people with AIDS, 
or 
infected with HIV, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry.

  [Text] A Seoul court has ruled that the authority which 
supplies blood with the HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is 
responsible for the infection and not the state or hospital 
involved. 
  The landmark ruling, made yesterday by the Seoul District 
Civil Court, is expected to have a critical impact in 
legislating laws and regulations pertaining to AIDS (aquired 
imminodeficiency syndrome). 
  In the ruling, the court found the Korea National Red Cross 
(KNRC) responsible for causing the fatal infection of a 
21-year-old man identified only by his surname Yi who committed 
suicide after realizing that he acquired AIDS through a blood 
transfusion. 
  The infection has been confirmed to have occurred in January 
1987 while Yi was undergoing a blood transfusion during surgery 
at the Seoul National University Hospital. He killed himself in 
April last year. 
  Following his death, Yi's family filed a civil suit against 
the government, the hospital and KNRC which processed and 
supplied the blood used in the transfusion, demanding 
compensation of 330 million won. 
  KNRC's Blood Processing Center is responsible for processing 
virtually all domestic blood products. 
  In handing down the ruling, presiding judge Kim Mok-min said 
neither the state nor the hospital is responsible for the 
accident and ordered KNRC to pay Yi's family 12 million won in 
compensation. 
  "Since the discovery of HIV here in December 1985, the 
government has made diligent efforts to ensure that the spread 
of the deadly disease is prevented," Kim noted. 
  He cited that the government issued strict directives for 
related authorities to administer stringent tests on all donated 
and other blood to screen it for HIV infection. 
  The judge went on to say that there are grounds to believe 
that the hospital eliminated detailed tests on the blood before 
the transfusion only on the basis of the fact that Yi was in 
serious condition.

cabinet yesterday approved the proposal by the Foreign Ministry 
for the provision of medicine for tuberculosis treatment worth 
500,000 baht for Cambodia. Such assistance is provided on 
humanitarian grounds as requested by the Cambodian Government 
under a bilateral basis. It will also help strengthen 
relations between the two countries. 
  The Cabinet yesterday also approved the sending of a Thai 
military team to join the United Nations military liaison

  [Excerpt] In its 17 December issue, NHAN DAN carries an 
appeal by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet at a ceremony to launch a 
national vaccination campaign against polio and tetanus for 
chidren. The appeal says that the child vaccination work is a 
very important part of our activities for the protection and 
care of our people's health. 
  After reviewing vaccination activities in the past five 
years, the appeal continues: 
  On behalf of the government, I heartily welcome the 
governments at all levels, people in the entire country, 
ministries, and mass organizations -- especially the public 
health sector, the Vietnam Women's Union, and the Red Cross 
Society -- for their great efforts in carrying out this 
significant campaign. I thank all international organizations 
and foreign governments, especially UNICIEF and WHO, for their 
efficient assistance in this national program. 
  This campaign is not carried out on a large scale, but it 
also has a special importance to ensure good health for our 
young generations who will bear the responsibility of bringing 
beauty to our country and happiness to our people. In that 
meaning, the elimination of polio and tetanus in infants and the 
prevention of blindness in children should be carried out 
thoroughly with the best quality. 
  I urge the patriots in the entire country, especially 
mothers 
living in mountainous and isolated areas, to actively take part 
in this campaign by giving their children the full course of 
vaccination. [passage omitted] The government at all levels 
must heighten its responsibility in providing health care to the 
people and directly supervise this vaccination campaign. The 
public health sector is carrying the main responsibility in 
providing speciality equipment to ensure the success of this 
campaign with good quality and results. 
  I suggest that the Vietnam Women's Union, the Ho Chi Minh 
Communist Youth Union, the Red Cross Society, the Peasants 
Association, the Vietnam General Federation of Trade Unions, and 
other organizations actively encourage mothers to give 
vaccinations to their children. The mass media agencies will 
widely propagandize so that everybody can understand and 
enthusiastically partake in this campaign. I suggest that 
national and international organizations, especially UNICEF and 
WHO, continue providing assistance to the annual vaccination 
campaign for Vietnamese children's health and for Vietnamese 
people's happiness.

  [Text] Tirana, November 2 (ATA) -- Thus far official 
records in Albania report two persons affected with AIDS. Blood 
tests in 1,000 people proved to be negative, according to 
statistics of the Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology. 
  Albanian TV broadcast on December 1, the international day 
of 
fight against AIDS, a program on the theme "It Is Time To Act" 
organized by Action Plus, calling on the public, state and 
non-state organizations to take preventive action and fight 
against AIDS, Memo Boci, coordinator of AIDS national program at 
the Ministry of Health, told an ATA reporter. 
  The risk of disseminating the disease increased over the 
last 
three years because of Albania's opening to the world. A modern 
laboratory operates at the Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology 
for quick and accurate blood tests.

  [Text] Sofia, November 23 (BTA) -- According to statistics 
of the National Centre for Preventive Medicine, there are 121 
HIV carriers registered in Bulgaria, 24 of them have developed 
the symptoms of the disease in full and 18 already died. There 
are 11 children born by HIV-positive parents but only one of 
them tested HIV-positive. These are data released at today's 
press conference devoted to December 1, World AIDS Day. The 
national coordinator for combating AIDS, Dr. Stanislava Popova, 
presented a programme for the prevention and control of AIDS. 
The first steps would be the holding of seminars aimed to work 
out the principles of a general national strategy for fighting 
the disease. The first one, intended for journalists writing on 
the problems of AIDS, opens tomorrow. 
  AIDS tests have been provided through the Ministry of Health 
and the World Health Organization, preventive research on those 
lines is also conducted. Condoms produced by leading companies 
are regularly supplied with the assistance of the World Health 
Organization and a number of health-care institutions and 
foundations. The National Centre for Preventive Medicine will 
insist before the government on the allocation of 140 million 
leva through the 1994 budget for the purchase of AIDS testing 
products and medical preparations for the treatment of the 
disease.

The social security reform will be postponed for next year 
since the National Assembly is unlikely to pass the bills that 
have been introduced, Iliyan Shotlekov, deputy chairman of the 
parliamentary Labour and Social Affairs Committee, told a news 
conference on the committee's work in 1994. The funds budgeted 
for social and health security in 1994 will constitute 17 
percent of the GDP [gross domestic product], according to 
committee's Deputy Chairman Nikola Koychev. [passage omitted] 
  Minister of Health Tancho Gugalov and World Health 
Organization's coordinator for Europe Keis Hoos opened today in 
Bankya (near Sofia) an international conference on the problems 
of drug trafficking and drug addicts in Central and Eastern 
Europe. The conference gathered experts from 11 countries and 
observers from Britain and Greece. They will discuss the 
establishment of a common control system, BTA learned from 
Associated Professor Filip Lazarov who chaired today's sitting.

  Higher frequency of viral hepatitis has been identified in 
some parts of Bulgaria, particularly in the Kyustendil 
(southwestern Bulgaria) and Vidin (northwestern Bulgaria) 
regions. Cases with viral hepatitis totalled 38 in the November 
1-December 15 period, as during the past week only their number 
in the Vidin region reached 6. The competent authorities have 
undertaken measures to curb the outbreak. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sofia, December 8 (BTA) -- A total of 96,522 
Bulgarians were born in 1992 and 138,705 abortions were 
performed over the same period, statistics of the National 
Health Prophylaxis Centre show. The results of a related survey 
were made public yesterday, TRUD writes. 
  There are 2.169 million Bulgarian women of a child-bearing 
age, the survey specifies, but the number of those willing to 
have a child is on the decrease. A total of 1,443 abortions 
were performed per 1,000 live births, or 500 up on 1991. 
  Infant mortality is very high. In towns it was 15.4 per 
1,000 population in 1992, that figure being 17 in villages. 
  Statisticians hold the Bulgarian nation dwindles not by the 
year but by the month.

  [Text] Kosice, east Slovakia, Dec 17 (CTK) -- The 
explosive epidemic of jaundice is the result of mass 
contamination of food, a member of the district 
anti-epidemiological unit said today. 
  The total number of patients receiving treatment for 
hepatitis A symptoms this morning was 380. 
  The range of food stuffs under suspicion is narrowing, 
epidemiologists says. The contagion is no longer thought to 
have originated from Kosice's water, dairies, bakeries, or from 
poultry, meat or fish producers. Public health officials are, 
however, examining produce sold at market. They will not yet 
name the producers under suspicion for fear of unjustly harming 
their trade. 
  In view of the rapid spread of epidemic the City Council 
closed all primary and secondary schools on December 15.

  [Text] Prague/Kosice, east Slovakia, Dec 14 (CTK) -- A 
jaundice epidemic has broken out in Kosice, where currently 150 
patients with hepatitis symptoms are being treated in the town's 
clinic. A Ministry of Health specialist told CTK, however, that 
there was no risk of epidemic in the Czech Republic. 
  "The situation is ominous," Bartolomej Magyar, a senior 
consultant at the infection clinic of the Louis Pasteur Hospital 
in Kosice told the east Slovak daily SLOVENSKY VYCHOD today. 
  In the week from December 6-13, 98 people suffering from 
jaundice were recorded in the Kosice region and yesterday 150 
patients were being treated in the infection clinic, the daily 
reported. 
  "We experienced a similar jaundice epidemic in this town 
fourteen years ago," he said, adding that certain departments 
had to be closed to free beds for the treatment of hepatitis 
sufferers. 
  In Prague, the director of the Hygiene Department of the 
Ministry of Health, Jana Foltinova, moved to calm fears of a 
similar occurrence in this country. She said the number of 
hepatitis patients was not growing. This year 698 cases of 
hepatitis A have been recorded, compared to 626 last year and 
690 the year before. There have so far been 551 cases of 
hepatitis B, fewer than last year (673) and the year before 
(756). 
  Foltinova described the outbreak in Kosice as a local 
phenomenon and said that a Czech public health officer was 
studying the situation in Slovakia and would officially report 
to the press on Thursday [16 December]. 
  The precise cause of the Kosice epidemic has not been 
determined but it is assumed to be water. However, since a high 
proportion of entrepreneurs and the better-off figure among the 
patients, some speculate that the cause might be expensive 
foodstuffs, SLOVENSKY VYCHOD reports. 
  All primary and secondary schools in the Kosice region will 
be closed as from tomorrow, the Town Council decided today in 
response to the rapid spread of hepatitis A. According to local 
public health officials a total of 227 cases of jaundice had 
been recorded until this morning. Since the infections 
departments of the Louis Pasteur Faculty Hospital and at the 
Children's Hospital have no more beds to spare, light cases are 
now being treated in the dormitory of the secondary nursing 
school.

  [Text] Prague, Nov 29 (CTK) -- No physical or mental 
problems have been detected among the Slovak soldiers who had 
been involved within the Czechoslovak anti-chemical unit in the 
1991 Desert Storm operation, Chairman of the Slovak Army health 
service Stanislav Pirosik said today. 
  He reacted to the information published in Czech media on 
the 
damaged health of the Czechoslovak anti-chemical unit troops. 
He said that his statements were based on evidence from direct 
participants of the operation according to whom the unit had 
measured low levels of unspecified chemical substances.

  [Text] According to the official records, up till today, 
10 cases of AIDS and 11 seropositive cases have been registered 
in Macedonia. Of them, seven died with the various clinical 
manifestations of the virus and three died not as a result of 
the virus. 
  Sixteen of them are males and five females. Six are from 
various towns throughout Macedonia, while the rest are from 
Skopje. 
  With the exception of one hemophiliac, the rest got the 
virus 
through sexual contacts, through already seropositive parents, 
or through needles while using drugs. 
  The largest number of them obtained the virus outside of 
Macedonia even though there are cases where some were infected 
with the virus in Macedonia.

  [Text] Krusevo, 16 November--Today, the Health Home in 
Krusevo informed us that in eight township settlements 31 
children had contracted contagious hepatitis. Since March, the 
epidemiological service has recorded cases of hepatitis in the 
following settlements: Pusta Reka, Dolno Divjaci, Zitose, 
Sazdevo, Borino, Norovo, Bucin, and Krusevo. The most important 
factor contributing to the spreading of the disease in the

  [Text] This year, 11 citizens contracted the disease, 
while veterinarians destroyed 139 head of contaminated 
cattle. 
  Kicevo, November--Once again, the Kicevo livestock breeders 
are disturbed by the outbreak of brucellosis, a contagious 
disease. Tests conducted so far have confirmed that the disease 
has already spread to several herds of sheep in Zajas and Kolari 
villages. In the last 10 months, 11 cases of brucellosis in 
humans have been recorded in the Kicevo township, while 
veterinarians have destroyed 139 sick sheep. 
  The spreading of brucellosis in the Kicevo area is confirmed 
by Ace Delovski, director of the veterinary station in Kicevo. 
According to him, brucellosis is destroying the Kicevo herds. So 
far, the Kicevo veterinarians have tested 16,429 sheep in the 
township, and all contaminated sheep have been destroyed. He 
stressed that the township veterinarians have declared war on 
this disease, which threatens human health as well. According to 
Delovski, a special program has been formulated to block the 
spread of the disease, requiring coordinated veterinary efforts. 
Wherever the disease is detected the cattle is destroyed and its 
owners are compensated on the basis of market value. 
  According to Mirce Lazeski, head of the epidemiological 
service of the Kicevo Medical Center, all contaminated 
individuals are livestock breeders who in direct contact with 
the animals.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "208 Victims of Contagious Diseases in </F>
Kosova Within This Year" -- issued by the Democratic League of 
Kosova] 
  [Text] The Prishtina-based Serbian newspaper JEDINSTVO 
reports in its today's edition that during this year only, some 
18,836 persons in Kosova have suffered contagious diseases. 
Some 30 epidemics and 8 contagious diseases have been 
prevailing amongst the population causing thus 208 deaths. 
These figures present only the cases registered in the public 
health care (Serb run, KIC) institutions, whereas the real 
figures may be five-fold higher as the vast majority of the 
population gets treated at private medical centers and homes, 
says the newspaper. 
  The most frequent diseases the Kosovars have been suffering 
are jaundice, tuberculosis, measles, hepatitis, pleurisy, infant 
palsy, scarlet fever etc., with children being hit mostly.

year. 
  Part of the needed mandatory immunization vaccines arrived 
yesterday, provided by the European Union. According to the 
Ministry of Health, the amounts received will be sufficient to 
meet requirements for the balance of the year for diphtheria and 
tetanus vaccines, administered to children over eight, who were 
not vaccinated so far for a variety of reasons. Furthermore, it 
is expected that part of this aid will meet the need for 
tuberculin tests for the last quarter of the year, used for 
children in the first and eighth grades, who received the BCG 
vaccine. The test will establish whether they will have to be 
revaccinated. 
  The vaccines are to be distributed in the next few days 
among 
the medical centers, based on their requests. As to the other 
vaccines in short supply, for mumps, smallpox, and whooping 
cough, the Ministry of Health expects their arrival by the end 
of the month.

agreements in practice is best illustrated by the bullet of the 
Republican Institute for Health Protection for the past week. 
  The aggressors killed 60 and wounded 167 citizens of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in the past week. Despite the fact that they 
signed agreements, the aggressors from both the east and the 
west are not allowing the food convoys to pass through. The 
most endangered regions are still Tesanj, Maglaj, Gorazde, 
Mostar, Olovo, and Gornji Vakuf. In addition to food, they need 
clothing, footwear, and facilities for accommodating refugees 
and the displaced persons. 
  The epidemiologic situation on the territory of the Republic 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina remains (?unfavorable). In the first 10 
months of this year, 26,261 persons were registered to have 
infectious diseases.

<F P=106> [D. Minic report: "The Winter -- a New Challenge"] </F>
  [Text] This winter the Yugoslavs will experience the 
sanctions in their full harshness, while our health will be the 
first to suffer the consequences of the sanctions. The experts 
of the Belgrade Institute for Health Care anticipate an 
increased number of those suffering from the infections of the 
respiratory organs, because of inadequate clothing and bad 
heating. 
  Influenza, a respiratory infection, whose spreading is 
particularly benefited by closed rooms, such as are usually 
found in firms, is this year assisted by some new circumstances: 
A new sort of virus, but also a new sort of closed room -- the 
vehicles of public transportation. Only a small step divides 
influenza from pneumonia, which is the major complication, 
particularly in the case of the elderly, who chronically suffer 
from such diseases.... 
  Flu Contracted on a Bus [subhead] 
  Epidemiologists forecast that the overcrowding of schools 
and 
institutions of collective accommodation will result in an 
increase in cases of streptococcus infections, as well as of 
food poisoning, because, in the meantime, the systematic control 
of the production, transportation, and conservation of food 
supplies has ceased. An insufficient and low-quality nutrition 
brings about a general deterioration of the immunity of citizens. 
  Some bleak forecasts have already come true: In the last two 
years in our capital there has been a growing number of mental, 
contagious, and so called insufficiently defined diseases, that 
is to say, cases without diagnosis. 
  "In the period prior to the sanctions, that is from 1986 to 
1990, the number of those who died of contagious diseases was 
213 on average, two years later it was 272 (27 percent more), 
while in the first quarter of this year as much as four times 
more cases of death have been reported, relative to last year. 
The reason for worry lies with the fact that people are even 
dying of diseases that are normally quite curable if a correct 
therapy is implemented. This is to say, the main problem is the 
lack of medicines," Professor Dr. Svetislav Ristic, head of the 
Epidemiologic Department at the Federal Institute for Health 
Care, says. 
  Prof. Dr. Teodor Bakovic, director of the aforementioned 
institute, says that the number of newly registered patients 
suffering from active tuberculosis has increased by 8.6 percent, 
as well as the number of those suffering from psychosis, which 
has increased by 3.8 percent. This figure refers only to the 
cases registered by general practitioners. 
  The analysis of autopsy reports in the period prior to the 
imposition of the UN sanctions and after it, speaks convincingly 
for how endangered the health of Yugoslav citizens is. 
  "The cases of infections have considerably increased in the 
time of the sanctions, particularly cases of pneumonia and 
sepsis as causes of death. In the period before the 
implementation of the sanctions, there were 20 percent of such 
cases, while after the implementation, the number of such cases 
has jumped to 42 percent. Before the embargo, infections as 
causes of death were reported in 31 percent of all death cases, 
while afterwards in almost 58 percent of cases," Prof. Dr. 
Vladimir Kanjuh from the Institute for Pathology with the 
Faculty for Medical Sciences, says. 
  Diagnosis -- Unknown [subhead] 
  Since the sanctions were implemented, the number of accurate 
diagnosis has sunk considerably. Until the end of 1992, 42 
percent of diagnosis were correct, 39 percent were partly 
correct, while 19 percent were incorrect. With the 
deterioration of the conditions in the health care institutions, 
only 27 percent of diagnosis have been proven correct, 38 
percent partly, while as much as 35 percent have been proven 
incorrect! 
  There are many reasons for that: The reduced number of 
regular medical checkups, the lack of diagnostic instruments and 
medicines, problems in the field of disinfection and 
disinfestation.... 
  Among the most frequent causes of death, apart from 
"traditional" diseases, the violent forms of death (suicides, 
murders, accidents) have also found their place on the scale. 
After a long time, anemia (poor condition of blood) has 
reappeared as one of the most frequent diseases, as a 
consequence of inadequate nutrition. We are no longer safe from 
diseases that can be prevented (by a vaccine), because the 
number of children immunized by the DI-TE-PER [against 
diphtheria, tetanus, and periostitis] has dropped from 88 to 70 
percent, while those vaccinated against chicken pox have dropped 
from 88 to 76 percent, partly because of the shortage, partly 
because of malfunctions, and partly because of the difficulties 
of transport. 
All age groups are endangered, without distinction, while the 
prospects for the future are even worse. The study worked out 
by Dr. Viktorija Cucic stresses, among other things, that the 
conditions for carrying out scientific research will be reduced 
by 64 percent, the possibilities for specialization will drop by 
61 percent, the chances for providing basic medicines by 46 
percent, while conditions for keeping up the 
hygienic-epidemiologic level in health care institutions will be 
reduced by 38 percent. The consequence of these changes will be 
a decline in the birth rate, an increase in the infant 
mortality-rate, an increase in cases of cardiovascular diseases, 
ulcers, mental disorders, diabetes, tuberculosis.... 
  The conclusion is quite unambiguous: Either the sanctions 
are lifted in the field of medicine, or we shall die out.

  [Text] Belgrade, Nov 25 (AFP) -- Sanctions imposed against 
the rump Yugoslavia in 1990 have proved highly damaging to 
health care, according to a Health Ministry statement published 
in the daily BORBA. 
  The death rate in hospitals has risen by up to 30 percent 
since the introduction of sanctions, the statement said. 
  Statistics from the Yugoslav Institute for Preventative 
Medicine showed that cases of chicken pox had risen from 694 in 
the first half of last year to 14,940 in the same period this 
year, of which 44 were fatal. 
  Belgrade's Tirsova Children's Hospital, which operated on 
500 
children with heart defects last year, could this year manage 
only 150 operations. Clinic Director Dusan Scepanovic said: 
"Children will die waiting for their turn." 
  Infant mortality has risen from 1.4 percent in 1991 to 1.7 
percent during the first six months of this year, the statement 
said. 
  By April, Serbia was spending annually only 20 dollars per 
resident on health care compared to 150 dollars in 1983.

  [Excerpt] The government confirmed on 19 November that 
before the end of the year a pilot test will be held to study 
the efficiency of the Cuban vaccine against meningitis in our 
country. 
  The test will be made on 100,000 volunteers younger than 
six. 
The test possibly will concentrate in La Pampa, the province in 
which the disease has caused more deaths so far. The tests will 
begin in a few days after the arrival of the vaccine shipments 
from Cuba. The vaccines already have been approved in other 
countries like Chile. 
  Moises Spitz, director of the Malbran Institute, which is in 
charge of making the tests, told CLARIN: "Blood samples will be 
taken first from those who will be vaccinated, who will be 
children younger than six for the most part, who are the most 
badly affected group. There are more doubts about the efficiency 
of the vaccine at this age. Youths up to 14 years old also will 
be vaccinated." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bridgetown, Barbados, Nov 26, CANA -- Barbados, 
trying to control an outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease 
dengue fever, has 13 confirmed cases, senior medical officer Dr. 
Ronald Knight reported Friday. 
  Dr Knight told CANA at least 100 people have been tested for 
the disease. He added that over the past week, one or two 
persons have been coming forward daily to be tested. 
  "We have already had 100 cases for confirmation and out of 
that 100, we have had 13 confirmed cases. The people that are 
coming forward are those who feel they are displaying symptoms 
of the disease and are requesting confirmation of the disease," 
Dr Knight said. 
  The senion medical officer said that while there have been 
general reports of the disease around the island, the outbreak 
is increasingly being reported in larger heavily populated areas. 
  "Generally, the majority of cases are being reported in the 
areas of St. Michael, St. James, and to a lesser extent Christ 
Church, and these areas will obviously be the focus of the 
eradication programme," he said. 
  Against this backdrop, Dr Knight said the Ministry of Health 
was stepping up its eradication and control programme to stem 
the spread of the disease. 
  He said: "We are targetting households in those affected 
area 
with the objective of cleanin up those areas where the 
mosquitoes are likely to breed. We are also stepping up our 
public education drive to sensitise the general public about the 
disease." 
  The senior medical officer expressed optimism about 
controlling the outbreak. 
  "I am very optimistic, that we will be able to control this 
outbreak and that it will not last for very long," he said. He 
added that Barbados had had previous outbreaks of the disease 
which did not last very long. 
  Dr. Knight attributed the outbreak to some extent on the 
"rainy season," noting that an outbreak of dengue fever and 
other communicable diseases often coincide with the rainy season

  [Text] Belize City, Nov 25, CANA -- Belize and Mexico this 
week signed a memorandum of understanding on health. The 
memorandum relates to medical emergencies and high-complexity 
illnesses. 
  The memorandum was signed at the start of a meeting of 
health 
officials from Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. The memorandum 
states that the general hospital in Chetumal, Quintana Roo, 
Mexico will be made available to Belizeans who need emergency 
medical care. 
  Under the agreement, the health care for medical emegencies 
and high complexity pathologies to persons referred by the 
Belize Ministry of Health will be delivered according to the 
physical capacity of the general hospital. 
  Belizean patients, the memorandum stated, will be charged 
according to their socioeconomic capacity and will be 
responsible for costs and expenses incurred for lodging and 
boarding while being treated in Chetumal. Persons unable to pay 
for the medical attention would still have access to the 
treatment and the Mexican Governmnt would take on full 
responsibility for the payment of the treatment. 
  The Belizean and Mexican health officials agreed that if a 
Belizean patient cannot be attended at Chetumal's general 
hospital, he will be referred to other health facilities in the 
state of Quintana Roo or other hospitals in Mexico. 
  Speaking at the start of the meeting, Belize's prime 
minister, Manuel Esquivel, said his government's health policy 
recognises health as a basic human right and a fundamental part 
of the development process. 
  "The policy accepts that it is government's responsibility 
to 
ensure that every Belizean has access to the best level of 
health care available, appropriate for his or her health needs, 
regardless of ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status. and 
political or geographic distinctions," Esquivel said.

  [Text] Sao Paulo--Nearly 20 percent of North American 
children of mothers carrying the AIDS virus are born infected 
with the disease. In Brazil, this rate is almost 35 percent, 
resembling that in the African countries. However, it is known 
that half of all the children infected worldwide contract the 
virus at the time of delivery. Based on this information, 
researchers are attempting to reduce the number of pediatric 
AIDS cases. 
  "If we succeed in obtaining a method to prevent transmission 
of the virus, the result will be good, because these children 
are still developing their immune system, and hence have less 
resistance to the infections caused by the disease." This 
statement was made by the Indian physician, Savita Pahwa, an 
immunologist at North Shore University Hospital, in New York. 
She arrived in Sao Paulo yesterday to participate in the First 
National Meeting on Pediatric AIDS, from 1 to 3 December, 
sponsored by the Association To Assist Child Carriers of HIV. 
  According to Doctor Pahwa, there are, basically two clinical 
types of children carrying HIV: those who show symptoms of the 
disease during the first months of life, and die by age two; and 
those who more easily resist infections, and even survive up to 
age 12. She explained: "We are studying the immune systems of 
those children to learn the differences between them, and why 
some manage to live longer." 
  Concurrently, the researchers on her team are attempting to 
solve what they call the virus "envelope." It consists of a 
layer of protein covering the virus, which determines the type 
of attack that the latter will make on the immune system of 
infected patients. According to Pawha, approximately 1,200 
children have already been infected by the virus in the United 
States. 
  The principal treatments used in Brazil are not much 
different from those in the developed countries, which use AZT 
alone, or combined with two other more modern drugs called DDI 
(dideoxynosine, in English) and DDC (dedeoxycytidine). This 
system changes the date for starting the use of AZT, as well as 
its dosage. 
  According to Doctor Marinella Della Negra, from the Emilio 
Ribas Hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil was the first developing 
country admitted to the protocol for Penta I research (the 
acronym for the accord regarding the European Economic 
Community's Pediatric AIDS Studies). That accord includes 
collaborating institutions in Italy, Portugal, Belgium, France, 
and Germany. 
  The doctor claims: "That is one of the most modern European 
studies, and from now on we shall be able to gain access to its 
reports." Currently receiving seven new pediatric AIDS cases per 
week, she comments: "Three years ago, the average was two per 
week."

  [Text] Yesterday, during a ceremony marking the World Day 
To Combat AIDS, Health Minister Henrique Santillo announced 
that, during 1994, funds totaling $160 million would be released 
to combat and prevent AIDS. The funding is from the World Bank 
(IBRD), and the Brazilian Government's matching contribution 
will be $90 million. The program will have a duration of four 
years. 
  Santillo reported that agreements are being signed with 
states, some municipalities, and nongovernmental organizations 
for the new phase of the program to fight AIDS in Brazil. 
  Every day, nearly 5,000 persons in the world are infected 
with the HIV virus. The disease has already afflicted 14 million 
people, and of that total over 2 million show signs of the 
infection. With more than 43,000 cases recorded during the past 
11 years, Brazil is the fourth-ranking country for numbers of 
victims. As of last month, deaths caused by AIDS reached over 
18,000. 
  The ministry is distributing 18 million condoms to the 
population. The total cost of the campaign was $100,000.

  [Text] The AIDS virus has now stricken 13 million adults 
and a million children worldwide: 2.5 million people have AIDS. 
World Health Organization (WHO) projections indicate that, by 
the end of the 1990's, there will be 43 million infected people 
in the world. Moreover, 10 million children will be left orphans 
of parents who were victims of the disease. "AIDS is one of the 
most serious problems confronted by the human race," declared 
Lair Guerra de Macedo, coordinator of the Health Ministry's 
Program To Fight AIDS, yesterday. She spoke during the course of 
the World Day To Combat AIDS program, in which health ministers 
have participated since 1985, when the program was created. 
  In Brazil, the statistics from 1980 until 30 October of this 
year show an accumulation of 43,964 AIDS cases, revealing that 
41 percent of those infected have already died. There are 
420,000 Brazilians with HIV. It is expected that, during the 
next two years, 87,000 new cases will appear, and that there 
will be 85,000 deaths resulting from the disease. According to 
estimates, within the same period the government will spend $875 
million on patients in an advanced stage alone. Lair claimed 
that the government will attempt to reduce the infection levels 
over the next three years, based on a comprehensive AIDS control 
program financed by the World Bank. The program cost is $250 
million, with $90 million in matching funds from the Brazilian 
Government. 
  According to Lair Guerra, a striking feature in Brazil is 
the 
spread of the disease among various population groups, such as 
women and young people. The expert warned: "The use of 
injectable drugs is playing a preponderant role in the spread of 
the disease among the youth." In 1980, there were 28 cases among 
adolescents; and in 1991, 261 cases were recorded, with 50 
percent infected through drug use. During the government's 
informational campaign disseminated by radio and television, it 
had been planned to air a video instructing the drug user on how 
to disinfect needles and syringes, but the film was banned. Two 
films will be aired promoting the use of condoms, and there will 
be two radio spots providing information on the disease.

  [Text] During November, the cases of meningococcal 
meningitis in Rio exceeded the maximum limit anticipated. 
According to the Municipal Health Secretariat, 48 cases were 
reported, representing 37 percent more than the 35 cases of the 
disease expected for the month. The number of fatalities during 
November rose to 12 with the death, on the night before last, of 
the child J., aged one year, who was confined in the Salgado 
Filho Hospital. According to the Secretariat, the baby's parents 
live in the shantytown of Jacarezinho. 
  Despite the spread of the meningococcal disease in Rio, the 
Secretariat denies the existence of an epidemic, because he does 
not believe that there has been a significant change in the 
number of reports of the disease compared with previous years. 
Most of the cases of meningococcal meningitis in Rio have been 
caused by the Type B meningococcus, characterized by a slow 
spread. It is unlike types A and C, which are capable of causing 
very intense epidemics within a short period of time. 
  Compared with last year's reports, however, the figures on 
the meningococcal disease in Rio indicate an abnormal rise in at 
least five months: February (increase of 50 percent); March (105 
percent); April (43 percent); September (56 percent); and 
November (37 percent). Nevertheless, during August and October 
the number of cases was nearly 30 percent lower than that 
recorded for those months in 1992. The total number of cases 
reported to date has already exceeded that of last year's cases: 
392 by November, compared with 328 last year. 
  For this reason, the Municipal Health Secretariat requested 
of the Health Ministry authorization to administer the vaccine 
against type B meningococcal meninigitis in Rio. The 
effectiveness of that vaccine is a controversial topic among the 
experts. 
<H5>  Deaths From January to November Total 142 </H5>
  The State Health Secretariat's data indicate that by 
November, in the state as a whole, the meningococcal meninigitis 
cases exceeded the total reported in 1992. To date, the 
Secretariat has recorded 725 cases of the disease, compared with 
702 last year. This represents an approximate increase of 3 
percent, not counting the figure for the month of December. The 
disease, which killed 153 persons in 1992, caused 142 fatalities 
among its victims by November of this year. 
  When added to those of other types of meningitis (such as 
the 
ones caused by Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococcus, and 
viruses), the total cases this year number 2,209, versus 2,422 
last year. Yesterday, in Rio, the Municipal Health Secretariat 
recorded another case of type A meningococcal disease. The 
victim, L., aged 11 months, lives in Jacarepagua, and is 
confined in a private clinic.

  [Excerpt] In the past year, we opened 12 general hospitals 
and 215 first aid clinics. This means that during my 
administration we inaugurated a new hospital every three weeks 
and a first aid clinic every day during my five years in 
government. Following the expansion and refurbishment of the 
20 de Noviembre Regional Hospital in Liste, it has become a high 
specialty hospital center, which will have the most modern 
medical equipment. 
  Last year I reported that the vaccine program was able to 
inoculate 95 percent of the Mexican children under the age of 
five with all vaccinations. To maintain the high coverage 
levels attained, we applied more than 88 million doses in 1993. 
During National Health Week, last October, a total of 22 
million children received the measles vaccine. Some 8 million 
children received treatment against parasites, and vitamins were 
given to 1 million children under the age of five, which is a 
very important step for their physical development. Since 
October 1990, we have not had a single case of poliomyelitis. 
We will shortly obtain international recognition for the 
eradication of this disease. 
  The last case of diphtheria was recorded in 1991. Measles 
and whooping cough are showing significant reductions of 80 and 
75 percent, respectively, when compared to 1988 levels. I 
reiterate that these results are unprecedented in Mexico's 
public health history. We also have been able to make progress 
in the achievement of the goals set for the year 2000 at the 
World Children's Summit. All of this is the result of the work 
and coverage achieved by our health institutions, as well as by 
the great sense of responsibility shown by Mexican families. 
  AIDS has become one of the primary causes of death among the 
male population between the ages of 25 and 34. It is necessary 
to insist that there is no vaccine against AIDS or treatment to 
cure it. He who contracts AIDS is condemned to death. This 
dramatic fact forces us to intensify even more our education 
campaigns, the dissemination of messages, and the verification 
of blood banks to prevent it from spreading. I reiterate we are 
going to double our prevention campaigns. 
  In 1993, less than 8,000 cases of malaria were reported as 
compared to the more than 16,000 cases the previous year. No 
deaths for this cause have been reported. The new National 
Council for the Prevention and Control of Diarrhea conducted 
educational campaigns in the media, a total of 40 million oral 
rehydration doses were distributed, and efforts in the clean 
water program were intensified. Some 94 percent of drinking 
water was chlorinated. In addition, a total of 150,000 health 
facilities were built. 
  All of these actions have helped reduce the rate of 
mortality 
from diarrhea in children under the age of five by more than 30 
percent since 1990. We have been able to get cholera under 
control, even though we still have to periodically treat 
isolated outbreaks.

  [Text] New Delhi, Nov 16--The Health Ministry will get a 
Rs. 300 crore soft loan from the World Bank for its national 
leprosy eradication programme. With this, the Government hopes 
to bring all of its yet-to-be-covered 66 endemic districts under 
multi-drug therapy and focus on the need for the rehabilitation 
of cured patients. 
  Giving this information at the annual meeting of the 
voluntary organisations and state leprosy officers, the Union 
Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Mr B. Shankarananda, 
said an increase of 35 per cent in the grant-in-aid would be 
given to the voluntary organisations involved in the programme. 
As many as 285 voluntary organisations and NGOs are enlisted for 
this programme. 
  Of the 201 districts in the country which have been 
identified as endemic for leprosy having more than five cases 
per 1000 population, 135 districts have been brought under the 
multi-drug therapy. Besides, there are 77 districts which are 
moderately endemic having two to five cases per 1000 population. 
  While opening the two-day conference here, the Minister 
admitted to "having miles to go" before achieving the target of 
eradication of leprosy by 2000, even though there are about one 
million leprosy cases in the country which is one-fourth of 
1981-82. Though the discharge of cured patients is more than 
twice the number of new cases, each year another three to four 
lakh new cases are being added. 
  Rehabilitation problem: On rehabilitation, he 
called upon voluntary agencies to play a more active role. "As 
more and more patients are being treated, the problem of their 
proper rehabilitation in society is becoming more visible and 
acute. It is therefore essential to work out and initiate an 
appropriate rehabilitation programme. For the leprosy afflicted 
patients of the poor sections of society, social rehabilitation 
has little meaning unless accompanied by economic resettlement." 
  The Health Secretary, Mr. R.L. Misra, said several good 
projects in rehabilitation were not accepted in the past because 
of the confusion on whether rehabilitation was the 
responsibility of Ministry of Welfare or Health. Since Mr 
Shankarananda's taking over in July 1993, it has been decided to 
entrust rehabilitation to the Health Ministry. 
  Dr A.K. Mukherjee, Director-General of Health Services, said 
it was possible to reduce the incidence of leprosy by 41 per 
cent in the last decade due to the multi-drug treatment which 
had shortened the duration of treatment. 
  India has been playing an important role in developing and 
testing immuno-therapeutic and immuno-prophylactic agents for 
leprosy eradication. Leprosy vaccine is a distinct research goal 
and an area of high research priority.

<F P=106> [Article by Naresh Fernandes: "Poultry Epidemic in </F>
Country: Consumers To Bear the Brunt"] 
  [Text] Bombay, November 7--Four months after "Gumboro 
disease" ravaged India's poultry industry, killing over 13 
million chickens and forcing shut an estimated 40 per cent 
poultry farms nationwide, the epidemic is beginning to hit 
consumers in the pocket. 
  Though the disease has now been wrestled into submission by 
a 
new vaccine, it has decimated breeding and laying stock in 
several production centres, resulting in losses of around Rs 50 
crores and widespread panic in the poultry industry. 
  The epidemic has left in its wake a severe shortage of eggs 
and chicken that has sent prices soaring; industry observers 
reckon that it will be at least eight months before the 
situation returns to normal. 
  Isolated instances of infectious bursal disease (popularly 
called Gumboro disease, because it was first detected in a town 
of the name in Delaware, U.S.) were first noticed at the 
beginning of the year in farms in the east. Though farmers 
routinely vaccinate their birds against this disease, the 
outbreak proved resistant to available medication. 
  "We found that our birds were dying in very large numbers, 
even though we had vaccinated them," said Mr M.P. Merchant. He 
is among the more cautious, since the first outbreak ever 
recorded in India occurred in 1978, on his Vasai farm. 
  Veterinarians soon realised that they were battling a new 
strain of the birnavirdae virus. "The disease is like AIDS," 
said Dr Sangeeta Dasgupta, a consulting immunologist at a 
Nashik-based farm. "It attacks the bird's bursa, the organ which 
gives immunity against infection." 
  Thus, the birds are as likely to die from other poultry 
killers as Raniketh disease as from Gumboro disease itself. She 
hastened to add the Gumboro disease was not communicable to 
humans. "No poultry disease, besides salmonellosis, can affect 
human beings," she said. 
  While the old strain of the virus usually killed between 8 
per cent and 12 per cent of flocks, the 1993 variety led to a 
mortality rate of between 75 per cent and 90 per cent. 
  "Only later we realised that we were dealing with a more 
dangerous form of the virus," explained Dr V.S. Narsapur of the 
Bombay Veterinary College. The new strain was identified as VVIB 
(very virulent infectious bursal disease) which caused great 
damage to Europe's poultry stock last year. 
  As scientists struggled to cope with the threat, the mutated 
virus travelled aboard trucks carrying eggs, chicken and feed, 
wreaking havoc in every poultry pocket in the country when the 
epidemic peaked in August and September. 
  Losses were most extensive in the three southern states of 
Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which accounted for 
around 9 million of the 13 million poultry deaths reported 
nationwide. 
  Speaking to this newspaper from his farm in Hyderabad, 
India's largest supplier of parent birds, Mr Sheikh Imam, said: 
"At least 5 million chickens have died in this area." Experts 
estimate that the 100-km area around Hyderabad city had a 
poultry population of around 14 million before the disease 
flared up. 
  The Namakal area of Tamil Nadu's Salem district was also 
badly hit, losing 3.5 million of its 9 million birds. 
  In Maharashtra, the first signs of Gumboro were detected in 
Yavatmal, in February. "The virus spread to Ahmednagar and, in 
no time at all, we found that it was all over the state," said 
Mr G.R. Naik, the deputy director of poultry in the directorate 
of animal husbandry. 
  He estimated that at least 2.5 million birds had fallen prey 
to Gumboro disease in the state, losses being especially heavy 
in Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur districts. 
  After several weeks of heavy losses, a team from the 
livestock health surveillance division of the department of 
animal husbandry and dairying in New Delhi extensively toured 
the affected areas. 
  "We found that overcrowding and improper disposal of 
carcasses was contributing to the high mortality rate," said Dr 
Lal Krishan, one of the members. In its report, the Central team 
recommended that sanitary measures on hatcheries be improved, 
the hatcheries be properly registered, that a proper vaccination 
schedule be followed, and that the quality of the vaccines be 
checked. 
  The virus was finally reined in by October, after a new 
pattern of vaccination was introduced. "We now recommend that 
our farmers vaccinate the birds three times, at the age of eight 
or nine days, with simultaneous doses of `live' and `killed' 
vaccines; then a fortnight later with `killed' vaccine again," 
said Dr P.G. Chowdhury, technical director of a Pune-based 
Venkateshwara Hatcheries, the largest producer and supplier of 
vaccines in the country. 
  He said that his company had to develop a new form of 
vaccine, incorporating the virulent strain of the virus.

  [Summary] The deputy for health affairs at the Ministry of 
Health, Treatment, and Medical Education, Dr. Malek-Afzali, in a 
news conference on the threshold of World AIDS Day, spoke about 
the instances of the disease in Iran. 
  According to the deputy health minister, the first instance 
of AIDS observed in Iran was in 1366 [year beginning 21 March 
1987] in a one-year-old child. This resulted from imported 
blood products, he said. He announced that all blood received 
from donors by the Blood Transfusion Organization is being 
examined meticulously and no blood is being imported. Imported 
blood products are also being carefully tested, so there is no 
likelihood in Iran of AIDS being transmitted through blood. The 
number of AIDS victims that has been identified in Iran so far 
is 270, and of those, 62 have died.

  [Text] Tehran, Nov 28 (AFP)--Blood transfusions are no 
longer the main source of AIDS in Iran and most HIV-positive 
patients caught the virus through sexual intercourse, a senior 
health official said Sunday [28 November]. 
  Deputy Health Minister Hoseyn Malek Afzali said 60 percent 
of 
the people who caught AIDS in 1992 were exposed to the virus 
through sexual intercourse. 
  He said 269 people were known to have caught the disease in 
Iran, of whom 62 people had died and 85 had developed full-blown 
AIDS. 
  However, the number of Iranians infected with the virus 
could 
be as high as 5,000 nationwide, Afzali said. 
  Although the subject of sex is considered taboo in Iran the 
government has stepped up a campaign to prevent the spread of 
the disease. 
  The authorities launched an AIDS awareness campaign two 
years 
ago and the use of condoms is allowed, although sex before 
marriage is forbidden.

  [Text] Yazd, Dec. 1, IRNA -- Two haemophiliacs infected 
with AIDS have been identified in this central province, 
director of the local health department, Dr. 'Ali-Asghar Farshad 
announced here today. 
  Speaking to a one-day seminar on AIDS campaign, he said that 
one of the two succumbed to the disease at the age of 12, while 
the other a 10-year-old child, has been hospitalized in Tehran. 
  He put the number of HIV positive patients in Iran at 269, 
one of the lowest in the world, and said most of them were 
infected with the disease through blood products and 
contaminated syringes. 
  Farshad quoting statistics said nearly 300,000 AIDS patients 
have so far died, and 3 million more are predicted to loose 
their lives by the next two years. 
  The first AIDS patient in the world was identified in 1981, 
however, an estimated 14 million AIDS carriers exist in the 
world now.

  [Excerpt] In relation with the government's new policy on 
privatizing industry, many of the country's industries--both 
heavy and light--have been put up for sale or have been sold. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Khomeyni Hospital in Tabriz, which is affiliated with 
the 
Tabriz University, was reportedly bought for 650 million tumans 
and privatized by several bazaar merchants. The public sector 
is operating only a small part of the hospital at a very low 
cost. It is said that there are no specialists or doctors in 
this public sector, which is being run by interns, and that when 
a patient in the private ward complains about costs, he is sent 
to the public ward, where prices are low. 
  [passage omitted] 
  Recently, the sale of kidneys in Iran and in the provinces 
has increased. In relation with this, children are sometimes 
kidnapped and their kidneys removed and sold. In some cases, 
children have been killed and in others, a child is kidnapped 
for a week and released after one of his kidneys has been 
removed. This has resulted in great insecurity for children, 
particularly in Tehran, where parents must take their children 
to and from school.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "AIDS is Coming, Fast"] </F>
  [Text] The estimates vary. The causes are hotly debated. 
But one thing is very clear -- Asia is likely to take front 
seat in the plunge towards an epidemic of AIDS by the turn of 
the century. What is even more chilling to realise is that 
Pakistan is sleeping as disaster approaches. 
  According to the Asian Development Bank, only one of several 
institutions to have predicted a grim future in this regard, the 
number of AIDS cases in Asia is expected to surpass those in 
Africa in the next couple of years. By the year 2000, Asia will 
be home to more than half of the people of this world who are 
infected with HIV, the virus that inevitably leads to AIDS. 
These estimates are based on the current rate of growth of the 
incidence of infections in this part of the world, and the 
attitudes that prevail in countries towards the disease. For 
the most part, governments' reaction in Asia range from complete 
apathy and ignorance to hostility towards the disease and its 
victims. This is further based on the perception that AIDS is 
limited to certain groups of people, those that Asian societies 
keep at arms length. Some individuals believe that AIDS is 
God's way of dealing with such people, and some think that it is 
God's wrath descending on western immorality. 
  Pakistan for one is reacting very slowly to the AIDS crisis, 
its authorities and society perhaps believing that the borders 
of the country will keep out the full scale assault that is 
currently underway in neighbouring countries. India is 
estimated to have about one million HIV infected people today, 
though given the fact that most of these people are unaware of 
the time bomb within them, they are probably spreading the 
disease more rapidly than can be calculated with any certainty. 
Suffice to say that the situation is very serious. Belatedly, 
Indian authorities are waking up to the realities, and AIDS 
awareness campaigns are being pursued with some sense of 
urgency. The biggest hurdle in the way is ignorance, which 
makes information dissemination difficult is a society where 
taboos don't allow candid exposure to such issues. Not 
surprisingly, the problem is even greater for Pakistan. Though 
we have only a few hundred reported cases, they are growing 
rapidly, and most HIV infections are unreported or unknown even 
to the infected people. 
  Much of the world is observing AIDS week currently, to focus 
attention on the issue and spread awareness of the danger. In 
most of Asia the awareness effort has been limited almost 
exclusively to the more affluent and more liberal segments of 
society, with walks and high level seminars putting in their 
usual token show. The most vlunerable sections of the populace, 
the proverbial masses, as always remain untouched by such 
publicity stunts. Ironically, they will be the first to be 
touched, indeed knocked down, by the virus. 
  It is not simply a matter of physical health that confronts 
us here. For developing countries like Pakistan, it would be 
devastating to be burdened by the heavy costs, both human and 
financial, that would follow a full scale spread of the disease. 
AIDS right now is spreading among all creeds, classes and ages, 
and both sexes, simply because those who carry the virus don't 
know that they do, and those who catch it from them are unaware 
of the precautions that they must take for their own safety. In 
its wake, AIDS is leaving a devastating trail of human 
suffering, and it is only the fault of ignorance. Unless 
Pakistan acts now to curb the unpending assault, the costs later 
on will put out of our reach not only physical health, but also 
any economic prosperity that may be appearing on the horizon 
today. 
  Our health authorities have so far failed to make any impact 
in spreading AIDS awareness to where it is needed most. It is 
frightening to know that almost all donated blood in the country 
is unscreened for the HIV virus, which means that hospitalised 
patients all over the country who may need blood transfusions 
are at risk of contracting the virus. This indicates the gross 
apathy of the concerned authorities towards the health of the 
people. No doubt, the individuals assigned to the task are 
fully aware themselves, and genuinely concerned about the 
immediate threat, but they have so far failed to initiate even 
those safeguards that would minimise the risks for unsuspecting 
patients. Why? 
  We need an action plan, something perhaps on the line of 
National Conservation Strategy and the environmental mass 
awareness programme, to impart education about AIDS. Perhaps it 
can be combined with family planning, since that too is dealing 
with some generally taboo subjects. What is important to 
understand is that our illiterate masses are not going to be 
able to read about the disease, they must be told about it. It 
will take a major grass roots and multi-media effort, and it 
can't wait.

<F P=106> [Valeriy Ivanov report: "Influenza Passed By"] </F>
  [Text] Only one case of influenza was registered last week 
in Moscow, while the week before there were several cases, 
Nikolay Malyshev, Moscow's chief infection specialist, told 
INTERFAX. From what he said, the overall level of cases of 
influenza does not exceed the normal level. The number of cases 
is not increasing, but decreasing. According to N. Malyshev's 
prediction, in the near future you can scarcely expect a big 
surge in the number of cases of influenza. By way of preventive 
measures, he recommended that the inhabitants of the capital 
should toughen themselves up, take fresh air, plenty of fluids, 
lemon, and honey, and by way of medicines -- Dibasol. 
  At the same time, according to Moscow's main infection 
specialist, "I find diphtheria a far greater headache." N. 
Malyshev reported that between the beginning of this year and 25 
November 2,001 patients with diphtheria have been registered in 
Moscow, including 458 children. In the same period of time, 86 
people have died of diphtheria. 
  A total of 316 new people suffering from diphtheria have 
been 
registered in November alone, including 188 children. The 
number of people with diphtheria has trebled in comparison with 
the same period last year. Fatalities from this disease are 
increasing even more. "The only effective preventive measure is 
vaccination," N. Malyshev stressed. 
  According to figures from the Russian Federation State 
Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision, the 
level of intestinal diseases has risen again since June 1993 
following a number of very favorable years in Russia. In 1992, 
for instance, the lowest level of cases of dysentry was recorded 
in the whole period of the official registration of this disease 
(since 1970). 
  However, in the first eight months of this year, the number 
of people suffering from dysentry has risen in the Russian 
Federation in comparison with the same period last year by 21.2 
percent. The greatest increase was in the northern and 
northwestern regions. In all, during the eight months, 
information about 30 outbreaks has come to the attention of the 
Russian State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological 
Supervision. 
  Cases of cholera have also been registered. In July-August, 
11 Russian citizens who returned from India, Pakistan, and 
Turkey were diagnosed as having cholera. Two cases have been 
identified in Dagestan and Stavropol Kray.

  [Text] Vladivostok, 5 Dec -- The number of Tuberculosis 
[TB] cases in the central city of Maritime Kray is growing at a 
threatening pace. Compared with last year, the number of 
victims of this dangerous disease has increased by more than 40 
percent. 
  If in the past TB was thought to be a disease of the poor, 
now the TB lists have representatives of all sections of 
society. The city's medical workers have been particularly 
alarmed by a high number of cases at Vladivostok's higher 
educational establishments. According to the medical workers at 
the city TB clinic, alongside students' traditional untidiness 
and their unwillingness to undergo regular checks, low living 
standards and overcrowding in hostels are aggravating the 
situation. 
  Foreigners who have literally flooded Vladivostok have 
become 
a special risk group. Thousands of citizens of Korea, Vietnam, 
and especially China who arrive here for seasonal work do not 
have preliminary medical checks. And the city's markets, 
overcrowded by them, have turned into places of scandalous 
anti-sanitation.

<F P=106> [Besik Pipiya report: "Diphtheria in St. Petersburg"] </F>
  [Text] It seemed that Russia's doctors had eradicated this 
deadly infection once and for all back in the seventies. But 
diphtheria has now resurfaced and dragged democratic Russia back 
to the early fifties. St. Petersburg has surpassed Kaliningrad 
and Moscow to take the lead in the number of people infected 
with disease, a fact which is a cause of shame as we approach 
the end of the century. 
  The number of diphtheria victims is tripling annually as is 
the number of deaths. How can this uninvited guest be removed? 
Mayor Sobchak's instructions -- demands along the lines of 
protect, register, and inoculate -- have proved ineffective to 
date. The main reasons are the population's low level of 
information about the imminent danger and about the need for 
compulsory inoculation, as well as the shortage of vaccine.

City Administration: "Diphtheria Is Taking Lives"] 
  [Excerpts] Dear fellow-citizens! The Health Care 
Department is appealing to you in view of the emergency 
situation that has developed in our city due to cases of 
diphtheria among adults and children and an outbreak of an 
epidemic. [passage omitted] 
  Over the first 10 months of this year, 110 adults and 
children were taken sick with diphtheria, and 237 were 
registered as carriers of toxigenic viruses of the diphtheria 
pathogen. Serious cases of this disease were reported among 27 
patients, four of whom died -- three adults under 50 years of 
age and a child of two years. 
  Among all sick persons, 58 patients had not been vaccinated 
against diphtheria, including all the death cases. [passage 
omitted] 
  The State Hygiene Center for Epidemic Prevention has adopted 
a resolution on the obligatory immunization of all city 
inhabitants. Most of the people have already been vaccinated. 
However, about 100,000 persons have not yet been immunized, and 
they are boosting the spread of diphtheria in the city. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Signed] V. Gadasyuk, chief of the Health Care Department at 
the Kaliningrad City Administration.

  [Text] Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, 23 Dec -- Practically the whole 
of Sakhalin is in the grips of diphtheria. The disease has been 
observed in the absolute majority of rayons on the largest 
island in Russia. Fifty-eight people have been admitted to the 
hospital to date. The first fatalities were in the port of 
Kholmsk, where two people have died. 
  In the opinion of doctors, the source of the infection was 
from newly arrived conscripts or convicts in prison camps on the 
island. 
  The situation is complicated by the absence of vaccine for 
inoculations and medicine for those who are already ill. An 
ITAR-TASS correspondent was told by the head of the oblast 
public health department Aleksandr Moshenskiy that the last 
reserves of vaccine for inoculations are to be used exclusively 
on children.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Zagorskiy, chief of the Kaliningrad </F>
Oblast Epidemiology Service, by Zh. Azarova; place and date not 
given: "The Whys and Wherefores" -- first paragraph is 
KALININGRADSKAYA PRAVDA introduction published in boldface] 
  [Text] The Kaliningrad Oblast Administration has adopted a 
comprehensive regional program for epidemiological protection of 
the oblast population in 1993-1996. 
  We have asked N. Zagorskiy, chief of the oblast epidemiology 
service, to comment on this issue. 
  Zagorskiy: It is hard to overstate the 
significance of this program. Everything it envisions is 
connected with concrete problems crucial to the health of the 
people. Unfortunately, the number of these problems is growing. 
This is the reason behind the concern of the epidemiology 
service and its goal-directed resolutions for overcoming an 
array of alarming situations. Some of these situations require 
immediate acting, some do not, however, all of them are equally 
important. By the way, the program prepared by our specialists 
falls in line with the program for socioeconomic development of 
our oblast in many aspects. 
  Azarova: Could you outline the most important 
aspects of the program? 
  Zagorskiy: There are no unimportant aspects of 
epidemiological protection of the people. For example, water 
supplies and the quality of water. Everyone knows that the 
quality is very poor. It is enough to see the inside our 
kettles covered with scale. It is necessary to boil water 
before drinking. Additionally, there are norms for drinking 
water specified by the State Standardization Office. Our water 
does not comply with these norms, particularly in the cities of 
Neman, Bagratinovsk, Pravdinsk, Ozersk, and Baltiysk. The 
situation in rural ares is even worse in some cases. 
Contamination of the water system is very dangerous. The 
September events in the village of Petrovo, Gurev Rayon, where 
17 people were infected with viral hepatitis, may serve as an 
example. Also alarming is the situation in recreational areas 
polluted with sludge, waste, and sediment. Construction of new 
water treatment facilities have been postponed almost 
everywhere. The program provides, among other measures, for the 
completion of these projects. 
  Azarova: One can have the impression that there 
is one big dumping ground around: You go to enjoy nature, but 
instead you see garbage everywhere. The same situation exists 
in cities and villages. One can feel disaster in the air. 
  Zagorskiy: One such disaster is already under 
way. It is no secret that there is no facility for reprocessing 
solid wastes. There are only dumping grounds that spread disease 
and breed rats. Sometimes, dumping grounds self-ignite, such as 
the one in the village of Kosmodemyanskiy. Additionally, we 
should build a facility for utilizing toxic industrial waste 
currently dumped in forests, open fields, and water intakes. 
The Yantar factory was requested to conduct construction of 
such a facility. The program also provides for similar projects 
in various cities and rayons. 
  Azarova: Recently, the issue of protection 
against electromagnetic radiation has appeared... 
  Zagorskiy: We addressed this issue long ago, 
however... Currently, our specialists have managed to convince 
appropriate authorities that this is a very acute problem. For 
example, according to the program, the construction of the 
Kaliningrad television tower is to be moved outside the city 
limits in 1995. The issue of resettling people who live in zones 
with increased electromagnetic radiation is currently being 
examined. Permanent radiation control is being introduced at 
all border checkpoints of the Kaliningrad Regional Customs 
Office. 
  Azarova: Nikolay Nikolayevich, what does the new 
program provide for protection against contagious diseases? 
According to your statistics, the epidemiological situation has 
deteriorated due to an array of diseases that, we thought, had 
disappeared forever... 
  Zagorskiy: The reappearance of those diseases is 
connected with many reasons: migration of people, appearance of 
street markets, socioeconomic hardships, exacerbation of 
hygiene... Each of these reasons has generated its own 
consequences. Nowadays, we can observe increasing cases of 
pneumonia and sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis 
and viral hepatitis. The lack of appropriate hygiene has caused 
the spread of mycosis and itch. Regarding the latter, it would 
be expedient to return to the methods applied in the 1930's, and 
to reintroduce special medical subunits for treatment of this 
disease. Diphtheria has also been a big surprise to us. We are 
trying really hard: We vaccinate the people, even in their 
homes, however, there are still many who have not been 
vaccinated. 
  The program provides for a complex of measures such as 
construction of a contagious diseases hospital in Kaliningrad, 
opening of a convalescent spa for those infected with pneumonia, 
or allocating special places for burying infected cattle. 
Nonetheless, the most important thing is to encourage the use 
of prophylactics among the people. Everybody must change his or 
her attitude today, and realize that they are the only ones 
responsible for their health. We will introduce obligatory 
health insurance and a massive vaccination campaign. The media 
could be very helpful in propagating our initiatives. The most 
important thing is that we are all healthy to work for ourselves 
and Russia's prosperity.

<F P=106> [Article by Ye. Vladykin; "Alarm! There's the Smell of </F>
Plague in the Air"; first paragraph is URALSKIY RABOCHIY 
introduction] 
  [Text] A dramatic rise in the number of rodent-borne 
diseases has been noted in the oblast. 
  According to data of the Oblast Sanitary and Epidemiological 
Oversight Center, 148 cases of pseudotuberculosis (including 4 
outbreaks in children's preschool institutions) and 56 cases of 
intestinal yersiniosis in the first 6 months of this year. Let 
us note, for the sake of comparison, that 8 and 15 cases of 
these diseases, respectively, had been reported for the same 
period last year. Fresh vegetables that stored for some time at 
rat-infested warehouses of trade bases and stores are 
increasingly often the source of infection. 
  As we know, rodents are also involved in the spread of 
tick-borne encephalitis. Fortunately, there is still no 
tularemia, God forbid, or plague, yet these most dangerous 
diseases are also transmitted by rats and mice. 
  Wherein lies the cause of the unprecedented surge in 
morbidity? Specialists believe that it is not a matter of 
natural growth of the rodent population (in this sense, the 
situation is quite usual this year), it is simply that people 
have virtually stopped controlling this long-tailed filth. 
  Deratization, i.e., extermination of rodents, has been 
always 
the concern of disinfection and prevention stations and 
departments, which are paid for their work on a contractual 
basis. At present, many enterprises have more important things 
to think about than rats, and for this reason all the necessary 
conditions for reproduction and improved diet are provided for 
these animals. And the disinfection and prevention service is 
falling apart before our eyes, people are quitting because of 
the low wages, there are not enough modern poisons, 
transportation, needed materials and bait. 
  Payment for rodent extermination work from the local budget 
is the logical solution for this situation. After all, the 
Moscow city council adopted a decision that provides for 
comprehensive, regularly scheduled deratization (rats must be 
exterminated everywhere, in the residential sector, developed 
areas, and who is to pay the expense?). The authorities in the 
capital have allocated considerable budgetary funds, and have 
made it incumbent on all enterprises, regardless of forms of 
ownership, to conclude contracts with disinfection-prevention 
stations; they have implemented a number of measures to furnish 
this service with everything it needs, as well as for 
technical-engineering protection against rodents. 
  Moscow was the first to come to its senses. But the people 
of 
the Urals are maintaining an aloof calmness: they are not 
worried, so be it....

  [Text] Some 61 million people living in the Volga River 
basin in Russia are forced to use highly contaminated drinking 
water, which is making increased chlorination necessary, thus 
damaging the health of the population. 
  This was stated at a joint session of the Russian Ecology 
and 
Natural Resources Ministry collegium and republic State 
Sanitation and Epidemiology Inspectorate. According to the 
collegium's data, no territory in the Volga area has health and 
hygiene and microbiological standards for the quality of 
drinking water. The ecological situation has become most 
unsatisfactory in the Cherepovtsy, Nizhniy Novgorod, Samara, 
Saratov, Volgograd, and Astrakhan industrial centers, where 
there is a high level of pollution due to petroleum products, 
phenols, and other compounds.

Prokofyeva, S. Chekalin, V. Belousov, identified by caption] 
  [Text] [Prokofyeva over shot of garbage dump] It is a 
golden fall in the Baltic region -- the smell of the sea and 
autumn leaves. Except for here, that is. This is the infamous 
garbage dump near Kaliningrad. My colleague Stanislav Chekalin 
reported on it back in the days of perestroyka. And that old 
footage in no way differs from today's. In recent times an 
increase in intestinal illnesses has been noted in Kaliningrad. 
Local experts and experts brought in from Moscow believe that 
the garbage dump is largely responsible for this. 
  [Unnamed interviewee] The water from the Pregel river is the 
reason for the outbreak of illnesses. Untreated effluent not 
only from this garbage dump but also from the entire municipal 
sewage network, and most importantly of all particles from pulp 
and paper plants, are discarded into the river. 
  [T. Grunicheva, Kaliningrad's chief hygienist, identified by 
caption] Documentation was sent to the prosecutor's office. A 
lot of documentation, whole volumes of it. But all we got was a 
terse reply -- just a few lines -- telling us that given the 
absence of a corpus delicti the matter was being returned to us. 
  [V. Cheburayev, representative from Russia's State Committee 
for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision, identified by 
caption] There is no material evidence of a crime. What they 
mean is that our laws do not work. Our most fundamental 
principle is the principle that the polluter should be made to 
pay -- but it doesn't work anywhere. 
  [Chekalin] It's true. The laws do not work, and nor do the 
purification facilities, whose construction began back in the 
socialist era a quarter of a century ago under the requirements 
of the International Convention of the Baltic Countries. 
Hundreds of millions of rubles went to waste in every sense of 
the word -- the construction projects were never finished. The 
Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision and the 
municipal administration have worked out and approved a program 
to protect Kaliningrad's population against epidemics. [Video

  [Text] Belarus has recorded 98 cases of the HIV infection, 
with 69 of them in Minsk. Each fourth case is the so-called 
stage of the clinical AIDS development. Six patients have 
already died (five died of AIDS, while in one patient the HIV 
infection was an accompanying sickness). Three victims were 
from Minsk. The key mode of transferring HIV infection is 
sexual. The largest part of the virus carriers is between 20 
and 40 years of age. The actual number of people infected with 
HIV in Minsk is estimated at 900-1,200. 
  We obtained this information from Valentin Bykovoy, 
epidemiologist of the Belarusian AIDS Prevention Center.

  [Excerpts] The dire socioeconomic situation in which 
Belarus has fallen of late -- constant price hikes, falling 
production, the specter of mass unemployment -- are threatening 
our very well-being. I am convinced that we will overcome the 
economic carnage, but it will be more difficult to overcome the 
aftermath of the Chernobyl accident. 
  I have invited Natalia Masherova, chairman of Public Fund 
for 
Chernobyl Issues, to comment on this problem. 
  [Begin Masherova recording, in Russian] [passage omitted] 
Belarusian children are the ones who have suffered most from the 
Chernobyl catastrophe. I am addressing the Belarusian 
legislature: It is easier to convince the international 
community than our state financial structures that we are going 
through a critical period. In Belarus, we have witnessed a 
dramatic increase in (?aggressive) thyroid cancer among 
children. Currently, Ukraine and Russia are lagging behind in 
these statistics. These statistics demonstrate that currently 
0.1 percent out of one million children suffer from thyroid 
cancer. In Belarus, in Gomel Oblast in particular, this figure 
is 13 percent. Why do we keep silent about these tragic 
figures? In my opinion, all the work of our legislature and the 
government should stem from the addressing of Chernobyl issues.

  [Text] More than 2.3 Mn krones (about $170,000) have been 
spent for the struggle with AIDS in Estonia over the last year. 
This was announced to BALTFAX by a physician of the Tallinn 
Merimetsa Hospital's AIDS Center, Jaan Martin. 
  As many as 29 AIDS victims currently live in Estonia. As 
many as three of the infected left Estonia and two AIDS victims 
died. A total of 5 more AIDS victims were discovered this year. 
The first AIDS victim was discovered in Estonia in 1987.

<F P=106> [Ketino Kakhiani article: "AIDS in Georgia: The Forecasts </F>
Are Not Encouraging"] 
  [Text] It has been declared that 1 December will be World 
AIDS Day. However sad it may be, Georgia has compiled its own 
statistics for this day: Sixteen persons infected with the 
virus, 11 of whom are citizens of the republic. 
  This figure is, as yet, not high, a fact that was made 
public 
at the recent European regional convention of persons 
coordinating the AIDS problem that was held under the aegis of 
the World Health Organization in Berne, Switzerland. During the 
work of the conference, doctors came to the conclusion that the 
main obstacle to the spread of AIDS in our republic (and, 
incidentally, this is characteristic of almost all the republics 
of the former Soviet Union) was the highly effective work of the 
epidemic surveillance service; it has not been possible to 
achieve this in the United States or in other foreign countries 
where the number of AIDS cases is huge. The compulsory 
screening of persons infected with the virus and those who have 
been in contact with them is viewed as a violation of human 
rights in these countries and, consequently, in the struggle 
against the disease, emphasis is given in the main to 
large-scale anti-AIDS propaganda. 
  "In our country, the screening and control of those carrying 
the virus are also not compulsory," said Tengiz Tsertsvadze, 
senior doctor at the Republican AIDS and Immunodeficiency 
Center, who represented Georgia at the conference in Berne. 
"While their number is still not high, we manage to maintain 
close contact with them and convince them of the expediency of 
undergoing individual screening, though on a voluntary basis." 
  "In general, we consider the present practice abroad to be 
too liberal and feel that it could do more harm than good. In 
spite of the extremely unfavorable working conditions, we are, 
at the moment, succeeding in preventing the occurrence of new 
cases and in maintaining the epidemic at a comparatively low 
level." 
  "Nevertheless, all this does not mean that we should be 
complacent and do nothing more. The forecast given by experts 
is very alarming: Unless radical measures are taken immediately 
in the struggle against AIDS in Georgia, the number of cases 
will reach 20,000 by 2000 and several hundred thousand by 2010." 
  "There are two principal factors that will contribute to the 
spread of the disease in this country: Drug addiction, which is 
already acquiring terrifying proportions, and the dire shortage 
of disposable syringes and other medical instruments and the 
means to sterilize them." 
  "Speaking of radical measures, I mean by this, first and 
foremost, the creation of a material and technical base and 
necessary conditions for normalizing the work of anti-AIDS 
services, in particular our center, which is, at the moment, the 
only one in Georgia that is concerned with this problem. It is 
essential that we have here, in the center, all those 
specialists who can take care of precisely those persons who 
have the AIDS virus." 
  "If, in 1990, we were able to screen 400,000 persons, this 
year, we have managed to screen only 105,000 on account of the 
fact that there has been no money to purchase test kits. We 
hardly have enough even for blood donors. Correspondingly, it 
is probable that the figure for the number of persons infected 
with the AIDS virus is inaccurate and there are more than those 
who have been registered." 
  "We should copy the experience of the West regarding 
large-scale anti-AIDS propaganda and public health education 
among the population. Those powerful [publicity] campaigns, 
which are conducted there in all the mass media and which are 
supported by sponsors, charitable organizations, and public 
figures, including those carrying the AIDS virus, are shaping 
social awareness and thereby creating a big barrier to the 
spread of the disease." 
  "We hope that our mass media will help us, particularly 
television. Meanwhile, in this respect, the one thing that we 
have been able to create ourselves in our center is a department 
for preventive measures against AIDS that will be in contact 
with the mass media."

<F P=106> [Report by Zilvinas Pekarskas: "No Kidding With Blood"] </F>
  [Excerpts] On Wednesday [2 December], the Lithuanian AIDS 
Center held a press conference devoted to the AIDS World Day -- 
1 December. A man infected with the AIDS virus appeared before 
the public for the first time in Lithuania. [passage omitted] 
  AIDS Center Director S. Caplinskas said that the slogan of 
this year's AIDS World Day -- "Time for Action" is slightly 
ironic, because the world learned about the epidemic 10 years 
ago. Nevertheless, the director urged the nation to rally its 
forces at least now in order to change its behavior. 
  L. Stribinskiene, chief of the AIDS Center laboratory, 
familiarized the audience with the recent story of AIDS-infected 
donor blood in Germany. [passage omitted] 
  By the way, Lithuania began to test the blood of its donors 
with perfect "Abbott" systems only a year ago. TIESA's readers 
may remember the scandal when the virus of jaundice 
(fortunately, not the AIDS virus) was found in the blood of 
almost all donors in Vilnius. 
  According to S. Caplinskas, the blood of Lithuanian donors 
is 
now being tested with the most reliable systems. 
  S. Caplinskas presented the following statistics: Of 19 AIDS 
carriers identified in Lithuania, one is a woman, 14 are men who 
have had homosexual contacts, and 10 persons have families with 
13 children. The wife of one infected man is expecting a child. 
No member of the carriers' families have caught the AIDS virus. 
The age of the patients ranges from 19 to 40 years. There are 
only two persons with unfinished higher education, six of the 
patients are serious businessmen, and one is a representative of 
bohemian circles.

the AIDS virus has increased to 20 in Lithuania, the national 
AIDS Center said. 
  A blood sample from a hospital in the seaport of Klaipeda 
has 
tested HIV-positive. The center said the infected person is 
male, but there is no information about his sexual orientation 
and occupation. 
  The center also reported that one of the AIDS-infected 
people 
registered in Lithuania recently died abroad and one more AIDS 
carrier was killed at a hospital in 1988 by a mentally disturbed 
patient.

BASA Victor Benu, leader of this trade union. "There is no 
medicine and medical equipment in the hospitals, 50 percent of 
the sanitary equipment does not function, and only 40 percent of 
means for health protection were allocated in the 
October-December period," states the appeal. The trade union 
demands an increase of wages by 15 percent. "The medical trade 
union will wait a month for the president's answer, then, if it 
is negative, the trade union will start protest measures," 
stated Benu.

  [Text] In Odessa Oblast, which, unfortunately, continues 
to be Ukraine's leading region regarding the number of persons 
infected with the HIV virus (more than 100 persons, or more than 
one-half of the total number of cases in the country), another 
three carriers of the deadly disease have been revealed. They 
are young sailors from a fishing vessel that returned to the 
Illichivsk port from overseas. The disease was detected 
accidentally: One of the sailors had been hospitalized 
following an entirely different diagnosis. He was examined for 
AIDS and tested HIV-positive. As a result, the entire crew of 
the vessel was examined and another two carriers of the virus 
were revealed. Medics are now conducting difficult searches for 
those who had contacts with the HIV carriers.

  [Text] The number of diphtheria cases in Kiev continues to 
grow. At present, 523 such cases have been recorded. This 
fearsome infection has also struck 53 children. The number of 
diphtheria cases is particularly high among workers in the trade 
sphere, medical institutions, public catering, and transport. 
Quite a number of other infectious diseases, among them many 
exotic ones, brought from other countries, can also be observed. 
  As Lyubov Nekrasova, the city's chief sanitary-epidemiologic 
doctor, stated at a news conference, this does not conclude the 
list of misfortunes that have afflicted and continue to afflict 
Kievans. From the middle of November, the number of acute 
respiratory diseases has risen. In the doctor's opinion, this 
is due to the unsatisfactory heating of offices, production 
premises, and schools, and also to the fact that people have to 
spend much time at stops of public transport due to the 
deterioration in the public transportation sphere. 
  As predicted by the Ukrainian Influenza Center, in the first 
quarter of the next year, an epidemic of flu is expected not 
only in Kiev, but also throughout Ukraine. In the capital, the 
epidemic will rage in January and February. 
  The city state administration is trying to influence such a 
development of events and to take preventive measures. 
Presidential representative in Kiev Leonid Kosakivskyy signed a 
directive meant for improving the sanitary-epidemiologic 
situation. However, the situation continues to be complex. The 
shortage of medicines and vaccines makes itself felt. There is 
not enough money to procure them. For example, there are not 
enough antidiphtherial preparations for vaccinating teenagers, 
conscripts, students, and persons from risk groups. A sum of 
$12,500 is necessary for purchasing them. 
  It only remains to rely upon the enthusiasm and ingenuity of 
those people who remain on the alert and are ready to protect 
citizens' health.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] According to official 
estimates, foreign citizens currently residing in Kiev include 
1,100 individuals from Afghanistan and Pakistan, 1,000 
individuals from Vietnam, and 139 individuals from Angola, who 
came from Russia. Incidentally, one of them is sick with AIDS in 
the hospital, but cannot be sent back home if only because no 
one has $3,000 to pay for the trip. 
  The uncontrolled stay of foreigners in Kiev triggered an 
outbreak of different "exotic" contagious diseases -- the last 
thing that we need after the Chernobyl catastrophe. This year, 
123 cases of malaria were reported in Kiev, compared to 9 in 
1991. There is no need to emphasize what consequences this 
might have for a city with 3 million inhabitants. In Kiev, 92 
individuals were reported to have AIDS, of which 27 are Kiev 
residents and the rest foreign citizens. [Shestomatoz], a 
highly unusual disease in Ukraine, also appeared in the country. 
The spread of skin and venereal diseases has recently grown at 
a particularly alarming rate -- their number tripled over the 
past 10 years. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EC Biotechnology Policy"] </F>
  [Text] It is generally agreed that biotechnology is a 
vital key to future industrial competitiveness and strength, but 
the EC Commission is concerned that Europe is lagging badly 
behind the United States in this very important field. 
  This was the major point made by the Commission speaker at a 
well attended IETT [Institute of European Trade and Technology] 
conference on the subject in London on November 9th. The 
speaker was Dr. Maurice Lex, who, before moving to the CEC's 
[Commission of the European Community] Biotechnology Unit in 
Brussels, was Acting Director of SERC's [Science and Engineering 
Research Council] Biotechnology Directorate. He went on to list 
what the Commission sees as Europe's chief weaknesses in the 
area. These are: 
  -- Lack of consensus on the scientific objectives to be 
aimed 
for; 
  -- The relative isolation of academic research; 
  -- A complex regulatory system which many find hostile to 
research; 
  -- Under development of the SME sector; 
  -- A poor and declining public perception and understanding 
of biotechnology. (This Dr. Lex identified as perhaps the most 
significant weakness. Even a small amount of negative coverage 
on TV, he said, can have a powerful effect on public opinion, 
even putting students off deciding to specialise in the subject). 
  It was sad to see European companies moving their research 
activities to the United States where regulations are easier, he 
commented. 
  So far, Member States had come together in joint projects as 
part of CEC programmes. More collaboration is needed. 
  But Europe does have its strengths, too: 
  -- Biotechnology is given reasonable priority in the Member 
States; 
  -- There are substantial investments in R&amp;D by large 
companies, mainly chemical, agro-chemical, seed and 
pharmaceutical companies; 
  -- Collaborative behavior has been stimulated by previous EC 
programmes; 
  -- There is strong involvement of a large cross-section of 
industry in horizontal activities -- CEFIC [European Council of 
Federations of the Chemical Industry], SAGB [Senior Advisory 
Group on Biotechnology], National Biotech Associations, 
Industrial Platforms etc.; 
  -- High expectations from various parts of society for 
various reasons. 
  There would be a very significant increase in the funds 
available for supporting biotechnology research in the fourth 
framework programme, Dr. Lex told the conference. He also 
referred to three recent reports issued by the industrial R&amp;D 
committee (IRDAC) of the EC on the life sciences programmes -- 
covering in particular biomedical research, and agriculture, 
biochemical and food, with reference to the fourth Framework 
Programme. 
  IRDAC calls for more industrial participation in all 
projects, and identifies a number of lateral issues which merit 
special attention including training, productive systems, safety 
regulation, intellectual property and education. Copies of 
these reports can be obtained from Dr. Lex, Fax: Brussels 
296-4322. 
  As previously reported, there is a third call for proposals 
under the current CEC Biotechnology programme with a deadline of 
12.1.94. An information pack may be obtained from: E. Magnien, 
DGXII-E/1. Fax: Brussels 295-5365.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "AIDS Information To Be Extended"] </F>
  [Excerpt] "The best vaccine is information that leads to a 
change of behavior," Health Minister Michael Ausserwinkler 
stated on Monday [29 November] on the occasion of the upcoming 
World AIDS Day on 1 December. He announced plans to 
considerably expand information activities and to coordinate the 
individual measures in Austria to a greater extent. Thus, 18 
million schillings will be available for a broad information 
campaign on AIDS in 1994 (10 million in 1993). The funds for 
AIDS relief organization and other institutions will be 
increased from 31.8 million (1993) to 35 million schillings. 
  The minister described the current situation as follows: "By 
the end of November a total of 1,077 persons had developed AIDS, 
and 667 thereof had died. The number of those infected with the 
HIV virus in Austria is estimated at 10,000 to 15,000. It is 
assumed that one to two persons are newly infected every day." 
There is no complete therapy for those who have developed the 
disease. Realistically, one must proceed from the premise that 
there will be no vaccine against AIDS by the year 2000. The 
minister estimated the costs for the treatment of a person who 
has developed AIDS at 1 to 1.5 million schillings. [passage

  [Text] BMFT [Federal Ministry of Research and Technology] 
funding of research on infectious diseases to date has shown 
that basic research has attained world level, whereas there is 
still ground to be made up in, primarily, applied, 
patient-oriented research. The new "Infection Research" funding 
scheme, which is being launched under the "Health Research 2000" 
program, will take account of this experience. It will bring 
together and continue existing BMFT funding measures on AIDS, 
tropical medicine, and other infectious diseases. In future, 
priority will be given to funding projects with particular 
potential for enhancing clinical research structures in this 
area. It is initially intended to fund the scheme with 
approximately 35 million German marks [DM] a year. The following 
individual topics will be covered: 
  -- The AIDS pandemic has made everyone aware of the health 
hazard to the population posed when new pathogens appear. With 
an estimated 60,000 to 70,000 patients infected in Germany alone 
since the outbreak of the pandemic, AIDS-related topics will 
continue to require an enormous amount of work. However, topics 
such as infection via tick bites (Lyme's borreliosis) and the 
much-debated possibility of the transfer to humans of what is 
popularly known as "mad cow disease" are also worth mentioning 
in this connection. These examples illustrate the need to create 
sufficient research capability to meet new challenges 
effectively. 
  -- The rapid increase in salmonella cases in recent times 
has 
shown how known pathogens spread: The number of new infections 
has doubled in only 10 years to over 90,000 cases a year. The 
constant rise in the number of infections contracted in 
hospital, which constitutes a growing problem for our health 
system, is also a major issue here. 
  -- The phenomenon of resistance to antibiotics has been 
known 
for a long time but has recently become a greater hazard with 
the advent of multiresistances in tuberculosis pathogens and the 
progressive development of resistance in the malaria tropica 
pathogen. 
  The transition of findings from research into practice is 
still being hindered by a lack of cooperation between basic 
research and clinicians. One of the reasons why this is so in 
Germany is that infectious diseases have low priority as a 
clinical specialization, which, indeed, is absent from most 
university clinics. Three funding channels designed 
specifically to remedy these shortcomings will therefore be used 
to continue existing BMFT funding of research into infectious 
diseases: 
  -- The funding of joint research is intended to foster 
local, 
regional, and national interdisciplinary cooperation. The 
funding authority specifies no particular topics, so all areas 
of applied research into infection are eligible. 
  -- In order to place the study of infectious diseases on a 
firmer institutional footing, structural aid for university 
research facilities and funds for redirecting existing 
facilities will be granted. This offer of financial priming 
over a limited period is designed primarily to stimulate and 
support research work in faculties of medicine, which has 
largely had to give way to routine health care work over recent 
decades. 
  -- A grants scheme will be available to attract trainee 
scientists to this field. This scheme follows on from the 
established AIDS grant scheme, which will cease to be exclusive 
to work on AIDS in the future. As a rule, funding will be 
provided for a two-year term spent at a research facility of 
international renown followed by a post at a German institute 
for a maximum of three years. 
  The BMFT is currently funding infectious disease research 
under four main headings: 
  -- AIDS: Shortly after the first cases of the disease were 
reported in Germany, the BMFT issued an initial annoucement on 
research funding at the end of 1983. 1984 saw the beginning of 
the first projects financed by the BMFT. Since then, 138 
medical and natural science research projects, 34 social science 
research projects, and nine clinical research consortia (in 
Berlin, Frankfurt (2), Hamburg, Hannover, Heidelberg, Munich 
(2), and Wuerzburg) have been funded and 58 grants awarded. 
Overall, approximately DM165 million have been spent to date on 
AIDS research. In the initial stages it was necessary to fund 
AIDS research under a single program to react rapidly to a new 
health policy challenge. German AIDS research has attained a 
high standard, although a solution to the AIDS problem cannot be 
expected in the short term. The topic will therefore remain a 
major area for funding. 
  -- Tropical medicine: The BMFT intended this program to 
provide targeted funding for research on tropical medicine in 
areas where the funding could be expected to promote long-term 
structural improvements. The first measure introduced was the 
comprehensive restructuring and reorientation of the Bernhard 
Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, on which DM8.7 
million have been spent since 1992. 
  -- Diagnostics of infectious diseases: The primary goal here 
was to improve and extend the available range of methods for 
detecting pathogens or pathogen components and antibodies in 
viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasite infections. Grants 
totaling about DM17 million were awarded to 46 projects between 
1981 and 1991. 
  -- Infectious diseases: This heading covered the whole range 
of research from fundamental principles to diagnostic and 
therapeutic advances and vaccine development. Between 1987 and 
1992, a total of 54 individual projects, 10 consortia, and one 
case of structural aid (for Wuerzburg University's Infectious 
Disease Research Center) were funded for an approximate total of 
DM67 million. 
  Further information on the Infection Researh funding scheme 
may be obtained from the BMFT's Health-Related Research Project 
Manager, German Aerospace Research Institute, Suedstr. 125,

<F P=106> [Article by Geraldine Collins: "Tourists Warned of Big Rise </F>
in Malaria Cases"] 
  [Excerpt] Increased Irish tourism traffic to the tropics 
for exotic and adventure holidays has dramatically raised the 
number of malaria cases detected here in recent years, some of 
them fatal. 
  Three Irish people have died of the disease in the past two 
years and this year more than 60 cases have been diagnosed and 
treated in Ireland. 
  Not only are more Irish people visiting malaria-endemic 
regions, but many do so with neither the administration of the 
necessary drugs nor knowledge of how to protect themselves. 
  There is no vaccine against malaria which kills up to 2m 
annually, far more people than AIDS. The medical battle against 
the disease is severely hampered by the fact that the mosquito, 
which transmits the malaria parasite from person to person, is 
becoming increasingly resistant to insecticides. 
  The mosquito could be "the most dangerous animal in the 
world" according to Dr John Dalton, senior lecturer in molecular 
parasitology at Dublin City University, in an article in 
Technology Ireland. 
  Research shows that 97pc of British travellers to Africa 
receive some advice on the malaria risk before departure but 
only three-quarters understood the disease is transmitted by 
mosquitoes and of these only one-third were aware of their 
night-biting habits. 
  Dr Dalton says that while no statistics are available for 
Irish tourists, one can presume they behave similarly to the 
British of whom only 46pc take the drugs prescribed before, 
during and after their holidays.

  [Text] The highest episode of pneumonia in young cattle 
ever is being reported by veterinary surgeons in practice, 
according to a statement yesterday from the Irish Veterinary 
Union. 
  Vets are recommending that susceptible animals be vaccinated 
pre-sale and certified accordingly. This approach would add to 
the sale value of animals and reduce the incidence of pneumonia. 
  The IVU has approached a number of marts on the issue and 
they are fully supportive. According to a statement, the primary 
viruses responsible are IBR, P13 and RSV. 
  While these viruses have been at low levels in the cattle 
population, the IVU maintain that the current high levels of 
imports is adding to the problem. 
  A preventative vaccination programme is recommended as there 
are no drug therapies to combat these viruses, although 
treatments for secondary infections are available.

<F P=106> [Article by Lene Skogstrom: "Norwegian-Developed Cancer </F>
Vaccine"] 
  [Text] Pronova has secured for itself the sole right to 
develop and sell a cancer vaccine that is now being tested at 
the National Hospital. 
  The Norwegian pharmaceutical firm Pronova has entered into 
an 
agreement to develop and sell the cancer vaccine that has been 
developed at the Institute for Transplantation Immunology (ITI). 
  If the results of the therapeutic vaccine are as promising 
as 
the scientists believe, great possibilities may open up on the 
world market for the Norwegian pharmaceutical firm. 
  The state company Medinnova at the National Hospital has 
negotiated the agreement. It includes 10 million kroner for 
further basic research at the Institute for Transplantation 
Immunology. In addition, there are possibilities of license 
earnings in the future. 
  "We have collaborated with the Institute for two to three 
years already. The cancer vaccine project is extremely 
interesting, but it is a long way off," says Sven Arild 
Andersen, administrative director of Pronova. 
  The Norwegian scientists at ITI and the doctors at the 
National Hospital are the first in the world to test this type 
of cancer vaccine on humans. 
  The cancer vaccine is supposed to help the patient's own 
immune defenses to attack the cancer tumors. If the results are 
as the scientists hope, the vaccine can help approximately 
one-fourth of all new cancer patients each year. This pertains 
to a part of the patients who get cancer of the colon, lungs, 
pancreas, and thyroid, along with leukemia and malignant 
birthmark tumors. 
  "Without the cross-professional and very competent milieu at 
the Institute for Transplantation Immunology we would never have 
been where we are today," says Gustav Gaudernack, leader of the 
group of scientists behind the cancer vaccine project and senior 
scientist at the Norwegian Cancer Society. 
<H5>  Five Patients </H5>
  In the research project, five patients at the National 
Hospital with cancer of the pancreas are involved in testing out 
the first vaccine. 
  An operation or other treatment is not appropriate for these 
patients. 
  For the moment, the vaccine has not been shown to produce 
side effects. It is too early to say anything about results. If 
this first test goes well, the research group will seek 
authorization to test the vaccine on colon cancer patients by 
spring. 
  Not all patients can take part in the experiments. The 
vaccine is supposed to awaken and work as a team with the 
patient's own immune defenses and, therefore, it is important 
that the immune defenses are functioning well. Patients whose 
immune systems have been suppressed after cell poisoning or 
radiation therapy will probably react poorly to the vaccine and 
are not appropriate for treatment. 
  "Therefore, we want to introduce the vaccine as early as 
possible," Gaudernack points out. "The idea is that the vaccine 
will prevent remaining cancer cells from developing further 
following an operation or other treatment. In the future, the 
vaccine can also be used as a preventive vaccine if we can 
identify persons at risk by gene testing and begin the vaccine 
before the cancer has broken out." 
<H5>  "Tailor-Made" </H5>
  The vaccine is tailor-made to each individual patient. 
  Cancer tumors are produced when changes occur spontaneously 
in some of the body's genes, so-called mutations. One gene 
family, which is called "ras," is important from the point of 
view of the cancer cell--a sort of "cancer cell Achilles heel." 
The cancer cell needs this gene in order to grow. 
  "We have found out that three mutations in ras genes are the 
most frequent. In the pilot study we are testing out these 
three. We must therefore find patients who have precisely such 
mutations in their genes," Gaudernack relates. 
  In order to chose the right patients the scientists at ITI 
have developed an extrasensitive gene test, for which an 
international patent has been sought. 
  Many scientists around the world are testing "rougher" types 
of cancer vaccines. But the Norwegian vaccine is special because 
it takes aim precisely against a specific gene mutation that has 
been identified within the patient. "Therefore, we avoid 
subjecting patients to treatment that in any case would not do 
any good," Gaudernack says. 
  In a few years, the research team at the National Hospital 
will know much more about the cancer vaccine's potentials. 
Gaudernack will not indicate when the vaccine may go into 
commercial production. 
  "This can take time, depending upon what sort of response 
the 
patients have to the vaccine--and whether the effects will be 
different for different types of cancer," he says. "We are 
breaking new ground and it is important to do the job properly 
before talking about offering the cancer vaccine as a part of 
the treatment of cancer patients." 
<H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  How the Vaccine Works </H5>

  -  A tissue test of the tumor shows whether the patient has 
the appropriate gene mutation that the vaccine will work against. 
  -  A blood sample is taken from the patient--white blood 
corpuscles are drawn out. 
  -  Specially suited vaccines--so-called peptides--are 
transferred 
to the white blood corpuscles drawn from the patient. 
  -  The "new" white blood corpuscles are injected back into the 
patient. 
  -  The "new" white blood corpuscles rouse the other white 
corpuscles to an attack against the cancer cells. 
  -  The cancer tumor is beaten back.

<F P=106> [Article by Kerstin Hellbom: "New Virus Among Drug </F>
Addicts"--introductory paragraph in boldface as published] 
  [Text] Another virus infection affecting mostly 
intravenous drug users has now been discovered in Sweden. It is 
the HTLV virus, closely related to HIV, and it has been found in 
blood samples. The National Board of Health and Welfare has 
therefore decided that all blood testing will now have to 
include a test for the HTLV virus. 
  "The virus is now present in our country, but the risk of 
infection is very small," says Assoc. Prof. Aud Krook, chief 
physician at the infectious disease clinic at Huddinge Hospital. 
At the doctors' convention early in December, she will present 
the results of her study of the incidence of HTLV in blood 
samples from intravenous drug users. 
  She found HTLV in 10 out of 134 blood samples. All 10 
subjects had had hepatitis A, B, and C and jaundice, and seven 
of the 10 were also HIV- positive. 
  "The incidence of HTLV was surprisingly high. In every case, 
the virus was present in addicts who had been exposed to a great 
deal of infection." 
  In another study, this one involving blood samples from Lund 
and Malmo, that will also be presented at the doctors' 
convention, eight HIV-positive cases were found, while a third 
study, conducted by the Infectious Disease Control Institute, 
turned up 14 cases. 
  Exactly like HIV, HTLV belongs to the family of 
retroviruses, 
meaning that one of its peculiar features is that it does not 
disappear from the body's cells once it gains entry. It can 
remain there for years without giving any sign of its presence, 
but then suddenly it strikes and causes serious symptoms of 
illness. It is spread in the same way as HIV--that is, through 
blood and blood products, by sexual contact, and from mother to 
child during pregnancy or breast-feeding. 
  In the early 1980's, the virus that causes AIDS was named 
HTLV-3, but it turned out that the AIDS virus belonged to a 
different branch of the retrovirus family, so it was renamed 
HIV-1. HIV belongs to the lentivirus branch, which attacks the 
immune system, while HTLV belongs to the oncovirus branch, which 
among other things can cause leukemia. 
  HTLV has its own offshoots: type 1 and type 2. In most 
cases, 
the virus discovered in blood samples in Sweden is HTLV-2. Types 
1 and 2 can both cause leukemia and a disease known as TSP 
[?Tropical Spastic Paraparesis], which paralyzes the body from 
the waist down. 
  "Those diseases are very rare even among people infected 
with 
the virus. HTLV is not as `efficient' as HIV: It can remain in 
the cells for decades without presenting any symptoms," says 
Krook. 
  She also feels that the risk of infection is extremely 
small. 
Contaminated blood from blood donors would probably have been 
discarded since in most cases, the infected donors also have 
jaundice or HIV. Blood products supplied to hemophiliacs have 
been processed to kill HIV, thereby killing HTLV as well. 
  Retroviruses remain in the cells and can cause disease after 
many years. Oncoviruses (HTLV-1, HTLV-2, STLV-1, and others) can 
cause cancer. Lentiviruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, SIV, and others) 
weaken the immune system.

<F P=106> [Article by Anna Angstrom: "Last Week at Sabbatsberg </F>
Emergency Clinic"] 
  [Text] Where was the clamor, the whimpering, the howling, 
and the ambulances? It gave one a strange feeling to walk into 
Sabbatsberg, Stockholm's main emergency clinic, on a Tuesday 
afternoon and find the personnel gathered in the coffee room. A 
box of chocolates--a gift from a grateful patient--was being 
passed around. 
  "Things used to be hopping around here, but now we jump if 
the telephone rings," head nurse Soren Carlsson joked. 
  Humor was mixed with bitterness and anger. Because lying 
around everywhere were yellow slips of paper confirming that the 
end was near: The emergency clinic will shut down on Friday. 
When that happens, the telephones will stop ringing for good, 
and the empty ambulance garage, where the personnel have set up 
a temporary "therapy corner" with good and bad papier-mache 
figures (one of the bad figures has been christened Ralph 
Ledel), will be demolished. 
  People commonly referred to as the victims of society's dark 
side--knifing victims, traffic victims, and heroin abusers--will 
be taken to other emergency rooms: at St. Goran, Caroline, and 
Huddinge Hospitals. It is not just Sabbatsberg's emergency room 
that will disappear: The entire hospital will be closed on 15 
December and reopened after the first of the year as a local 
hospital operated by M&amp;M Medical, Inc., with from 40 to 50 
employees. Sabbatsberg's 1,600 employees are being scattered 
around among various places. The building contractor is already 
busy making alterations to the former alcohol detox unit. 
  "We were not supposed to close before the end of November, 
but everything is being speeded up. Even though it is not 
possible to close down a hospital in two months," said an 
indignant Carlsson. 
<H5>  Politicians in the Toilet </H5>
  He was not alone in his feelings--or his humiliation over 
the 
politicians' decision, which seems to be anything but well 
founded economically. Among other things, the brand-new 
operating rooms are being put "in mothballs." 
  "We have a palace that we have to leave. Everything works 
perfectly--it is easy to operate," said a nurse in the operating 
unit. She laughed when SVENSKA DAGBLADET's photographer Jurek 
Holzer caught sight of a little monument on the wall: a chamber 
pot the bottom of which was decorated with two pictures of 
politicians responsible for the change. 
  "That was put up when feelings were at their peak," said the 
nurse, who was unwilling to have her name printed in the 
newspaper. 
  To some extent, anger has given way to resignation. Several 
gaps can be seen in the list of scheduled operations. The number 
of patients has fallen off, and so has the number of personnel. 
Most of the employees know where they will go after the end of 
the year, but there is still anger over the way the assignments 
were made. 
  "We received notices to indicate our interests last spring, 
but then the answers were a long time coming. And when they did, 
we had only one week in which to answer or become unemployed. 
For mothers of small children, that was tremendously difficult." 
  Sabbatsberg has a specialist clinic for jaw operations. 
Surgeon Hans Bystedt will perform his final operation on 8 
December. The decision as to where the clinic will move to will 
be made the following day. That decision has already been 
postponed once, and Bystedt does not seem fully convinced that 
it will be made on 9 December either. 
<H5>  Want To Go to Soder Hospital </H5>
  "We will probably be relegated to some shack," he said with 
a 
laugh. Then he became serious and talked about finances and 
cooperation with the plastic surgeons and ear, nose, and throat 
specialists at Soder Hospital. 
  "We want to go there, but the administration wants to move 
us 
to Caroline Hospital. The most important thing is to keep the 
waiting list from growing longer. Most of our patients are 
young, and for them, a six-month wait is an eternity." 
  There was an atmosphere of leave-taking in the air, even 
though work was proceeding as usual. 
  In the newly renovated X-ray department--the city's best, 
said department head Anders Tyden proudly--one could hear a 
statement that is common at Sabbatsberg these days: 
  "So long! I'm off to take a look at my new job." 
  And in the emergency unit's coffee room, Asa, Maj-Britt, and 
Soren were already talking about memories of the years at 
Sabbatsberg. 
  "I'll never forget the guy who escaped and smashed up the 
cars in the parking lot." 
  "Do you remember the meadow just outside? And the cafe 
across 
the street where we used to buy pastry?"

"Health Targets Have Failed Says Bottomley"] 
  [Text] Virginia Bottomley, the Health Secretary, will admit 
tomorrow that the Government's Health of the Nation strategy is 
failing to have any effect on three of its key targets. 
  Releasing the first year's progress report, Mrs Bottomley 
will acknowledge the target figures have either increased or 
remained the same for suicides, obesity, and teenage smoking. 
  Health of the Nation aims to reduce the overall suicide rate 
by at least 15 per cent and the suicide rate of the severely 
mentally ill by 33 per cent by the year 2000. Instead there has 
been an overall increase from 1989-91 to 1990-92 of 0.9 per cent. 
  The target for obesity is a six per cent reduction in the 
number of men who are seriously overweight and an eight per cent 
reduction among women by 2005. In men, obesity numbers have 
nearly doubled from eight per cent to 13 per cent and in women 
from 12 per cent to 15 per cent since 1986. 
  There has been no movement in the aim to reduce the 
prevalence of smoking among 11 to 15 year olds by at least 33 
per cent by 1994. 
  Mrs Bottomley said that overall, there had been "impressive 
progress" in establishing the strategy's foundations. "This is 
not a coercive, nannying approach. It is to enlist the willing 
co-operation of the public." 
  But of particular concern to the Health Secretary are the 
suicide figures, which she said account for one in 100 deaths, 
more than for road traffic accidents. 
  "Think of the effort we put into the Christmas drink driving 
campaign to reduce avoidable deaths on the road," Mrs Bottomley 
said. 
  "It gives some measure of the energy in turn to put into 
combating suicide." 
  To turn the figures around, the Health Department is 
spending 
&pound;1 million on a public information campaign and working 
with 
GPs to improve their ability to identify mental illness. 
  It is thought that as many as 40 per cent of those who take 
their lives had contacted their GPs within the week before they 
died. It is also estimated that 89 million working days are lost 
each year on mental illness. 
  "In 1979 we lost 29 million days on industrial action and as 
a nation we decided this was outrageous," Mrs Bottomley said. 
  Dr Kenneth Calman, the Government's senior medical officer, 
said that suicide was a complex issue but was a good marker for 
mental illness as a whole. He also said it was preventable if 
people could be helped through their "bad patch," but that it 
was important to look at the accessibility to the means, such as 
guns or drugs. 
  But Dr Colin Brewer, a psychiatrist who has studied suicide 
patterns, was dismissive of the Government's efforts and said 
pamphlets would have little effect. Instead, Dr Brewer suggested 
changes in prescribing habits away from toxic antidepressants to 
newer drugs that do not kill people in overdose.

  [Text] On the occasion of 1 December, World AIDS Day, the 
Croatian Society of Victimology [Hrvatsko Zrtvoslovno Drustvo] 
will send a demand to the United Nations and the World Health 
Organization to have UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] personnel 
undergo medical checkups, Zvonimir Separovic, president of the 
society, has disclosed at a news conference. 
  In addition to other calamities, the UN peace-keeping 
operation has brought Croatia an AIDS epidemic. This was 
confirmed by research done by pathologists belonging to the 
American Mobile Army Surgical Hospital after the death of 
several members of UNPROFOR's Kenyan battalion and a statement 
by the peace-keeping forces' spokeswoman, Shannon Boyd, that 
symptoms of this disease have been discovered in the blood of 
several UNPROFOR soldiers from East Europe, Separovic said. 
  Thirty-six persons have died from this terminal disease in 
Croatia so far and some 60 have been infected, but the real 
figures are certainly much higher.

  [Text] Zagreb, Nov 30 (AFP) -- A Croatian jurists' group on 
Tuesday said it will call for all U.N. Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) staff to have AIDS tests, after several cases of the 
disease were reported among U.N. forces. 
  Former foreign minister Zvonimir Separovic, who heads the 
Croatian Victims Society, said he would make the request 
officially to U.N. officials and the World Health Organization 
(WHO) on Wednesday, World AIDS Day. 
  Separovic said that the U.N. operation has ``contributed, 
among other misfortunes, to the extension of AIDS,'' in Croatia. 
He said authorities had to ``protect everyone who could be 
under threat, not only sick people.'' 
  Zagreb said last month that four U.N. workers serving in 
former Yugoslavia had died of the killer disease this year. 
  UNPROFOR spokeswoman Shannon Boyd declined to confirm the 
figure, but said that a small number of cases had been 
registered among the tens of thousands of U.N. forces in the 
Balkan region. 
  According to official statistics, 53 people have been 
registered as suffering from AIDS in Croatia since 1986, of whom 
36 have died.,

  [Text] Budapest, 30 Nov (MTI) -- AIDS has so far claimed 
81 lives in Hungary. There are 140 patients on record with 
full-blown AIDS, and 360 people are known to have the virus. 
However, estimates put the number of HIV cases at about 
2,000-2,500, many of them foreigners living in Hungary. 
  The above figures were reported at a press conference in the 
Ministry of Welfare in Budapest on Tuesday, held to mark World 
AIDS Day, December 1. 
  AIDS in Hungary most frequently afflicts men, mainly 
homosexuals and bisexuals. 
  There are relatively few hemophiliacs among the HIV positive 
patients, and the number who received the virus through blood 
transfusions or through drug use are also low. 
  The 20 to 39 age group is the most endangered. 
  Most of the HIV positive patients live in the vicinity of 
Budapest. However, many infections were noted in the country's 
western and north-eastern parts.

  [Excerpt] Warsaw, Nov. 30 -- The 2nd national conference on 
AIDS, held on World AIDS Day, on Tuesday mapped out the 
directions of actions to prevent and fight the disease. Sexual 
education was recognized as the most important task. 
  Summing up the conference Krzysztof Dziubinski, the health 
minister's commissioner for AIDS said the promotion of healthy 
lifestyle and education for health should be conducted not only 
by the Ministry of Health, but also educational authorities, the 
church, media and television. The National Coordinating Bureau 
for AIDS Prevention was created recently to help training 
specialists for health education. 
  The conference pointed to the need to immediately amend the 
old laws on drug abuse of 1985, and on combatting infectious 
diseases of 1963. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kosice, east Slovakia, Dec 15 (CTK) -- Almost 300 
people have already been hospitalized in Kosice with viral 
hepatitis A, city health officials said today. 
  On Tuesday the number of patients was reported to be about 
150. 
  Most of the victims are men aged 15 to 35 and children aged 
ten to fourteen, of which there are 64. 
  Individual cases of jaundice have also been reported in the 
Kosice-Venkov district among people who daily commute to Kosice. 
  Because of the large number of cases, several clinics in two 
hospitals had to be used temporarily as infectious disease 
wards, and the dormitory of the Central Health School had to be 
turned into a temporary hospital. 
  The cause of the epidemic has not yet been determined, but 
health officials do not think it was caused by contaminated city 
water or by products of the local dairy. 
  The chairman of the Kosice District Council has closed all 
basic and secondary schools in Kosice. Large gatherings have 
also been forbidden. Fish and packaged groceries sold in public 
places are subject to strict health regulations. 
  In 1979, 3,000 people in Kosice were afflicted by jaundice.

<F P=106> [A. Brkic report: ``Increased Number of Jaundice </F>
Sufferers''] 
  [Text] We have learned from the appropriate 
epidemiological services that the number of jaundice sufferers 
in Serbia has increased in comparison to the number in previous 
years. The situation is not alarming because the number of 
sufferers is not large, but it is worrying that this disease has 
appeared in schools, so that there is the possibility of it 
spreading through a chain reaction, the epidemiologists say. We 
are talking about Type A infectious hepatitis, an infectious 
intestinal disease, which is also called the dirty hands 
disease. It is caused by a virus and is transferred by dirty 
hands, food, and water. This is stressed by epidemiologist 
Veljko Djerkovic, assistant director for epidemiology and 
microbiology in the city institute for health protection, and 
Dr. Svetislav Zonjic, deputy director of the republican 
institute for health protection. 
<H5>  The Virus is the Culprit </H5>
  According to Djerkovic, jaundice sufferers have been found 
in 
37 schools in Belgrade. Of these, 32 are primary schools and 
five high schools, while the disease has been reported in 
several Belgrade kindergartens. Djerkovic stresses that this 
situation is not alarming at the moment because there are no 
more than five or six sufferers in all these institutions apart 
from two. The problem is that this is an infectious disease 
that spreads through a chain and the financial situation in the 
schools is such that many of them do not have the money to 
maintain the necessary level of hygiene. It is a good thing 
that the winter vacation is approaching. This will probably 
stop this disease spreading, Djerkovic hopes. 
  In comparison to September and October last year, an 
increase 
in other acute infectious diseases, not only hepatitis, has also 
been registered, which was expected. This is because, for 
example, the Type A viral hepatitis (an infectious intestinal 
disease) is a consequence of a reduction in the body's 
resistance, a fall in the quality of food, and worse sanitary 
conditions, as well as a cyclical course, Zonjic and Djerkovic 
explain. 
  That is to say, the aforementioned type of hepatitis has its 
own cycle so that ``a certain rise in the number of sufferers'' 
appears at specific intervals even under normal conditions, 
Zonjic explains. 
  Djerkovic says that in the Belgrade schools in which the 
jaundice has appeared deficiencies have been noticed in hygiene 
and sanitary conditions and the condition of the buildings and 
equipment. The schools have been ordered to solve these 
problems and to take measures to improve general and personal 
hygiene and to carry out a so-called on-going disinfection, that 
is to say, clean and wash all toilets and kitchens and places 
where food is prepared. After that there is a final 
disinfection which, on the order of the city institute for 
health protection, is carried out by the institute for 
disinfection and insect and vermin extermination. 
<H5>  Signs of Infection </H5>
  However, difficulties arise when it comes to what the 
schools 
should do. They have generally not performed their part of the 
task either for personnel or practical reasons, Djerkovic 
explains. Most often for practical reasons because they do not 
have any money. 
  According to Zonjic, there are no precise figures on the 
incidence of jaundice in schools in other towns in Serbia, but 
``there has been a certain increase in this disease in Serbia.'' 
  So that even the layman can detect the Type A viral 
hepatitis 
in time, Djerkovic explains the symptoms thus: nausea, 
vomiting, exhaustion, loss of appetite, and, in the later stage 
of the disease, dark-colored urine and light-colored stool and 
yellowness in the white of the eyes and on the skin. 
  At the same time, Djerkovic warned of the problem of 
trichinosis. He therefore advises everyone who buys pig's meat 
from private traders to first take it for a veterinary 
examination before cooking it.

<F P=106> [Article by E. Kamberova: ``Treatment in Wrecked Premises''] </F>
  [Text] Patients who must be treated in a sterile 
environment are being treated in humid areas. Health inspectors 
demand improvements in the overall condition of the clinic. 
  For several months, the Hematology Clinic of the Skopje 
School of Medicine has existed in a situation bordering on the 
absurd. Patients who must be hospitalized and treated in sterile 
premises are being treated in hospital rooms that not only are 
not properly sterile, but are in ruins. They are perennially 
humid and quite frequently the sewage pipes leak. 
  The Hematology Clinic of former Yugoslavia was one of the 
top 
clinics in terms of technology and personnel, says Docent Doctor 
Nikola Siljanovski, its director. Currently, it can boast only 
of its personnel who, he claims, meet all requirements of 
contemporary hematology and bone marrow transplants. This is the 
only Macedonian institution to treat blood and blood generating 
organs (erythrocytes, leucocytes, thrombocytes...). More than 60 
percent of hematological diseases of the blood consist of 
malignant hemopathies. Patients suffering from such afflictions 
become immunodeficient, Doctor Siljanovski explains. They lack 
white blood cells, which protect the body. This means that the 
very methods for the treatment of such patients, at a specific 
phase in the development of the disease, requires specific 
conditions, such as treating them in separate wards, isolated 
and sterile, thus ensuring a high degree of protection from 
infections. In the past, in the good old times, the proper 
conditions were observed and the personnel treating such 
patients were thoroughly protected with special masks. 
Unfortunately, this is now part of the past. Today there is 
moisture everywhere, particularly along the walls, broken tiles, 
and water seeping, most probably from sewer pipes. The premises 
smell of moisture and rot and, in general, hygiene in the 
premises is exceptionally poor. The treatment standards are 
below all standards. Under such poor conditions for treating 
patients, the logical consequence is worsened health and 
increased cases of hospital infections. Most of the findings of 
the inspectors confirm that the sanitary and hygienic conditions 
of the Hematological Clinic are poor. The inspectors have 
repeatedly pointed out that the overall working conditions in 
the clinic, particularly in the test laboratories, must be 
improved. The inspectors issue their orders to the clinic, which 
is unable to resolve the problem for the simple reason that such 
improvements require funds. 
  In addition to the ``communal'' problems, the work of the 
Hematology Clinic is also made more difficult because of the 
obsolete equipment, long years of failure to invest in equipment 
and in building repairs, and the frequent shortage of reagents, 
substrata, and markers required in genetic methodology. 
  I believe, Doctor Siljanovski said, that hematology has been 
unfairly neglected. It must be considered part of internal 
medicine and developed the same as all other medical 
disciplines. The current inadequate handling of it compromises 
the exceptionally complex treatment of blood diseases.

has especially focused on the elimination of brucellosis in 
people. Unlike last year, when more than 400 cases were 
recorded, this year there have been only 11. This proves that 
the regular information given to the citizens on how to protect 
themselves from that disease has begun to yield results. 
  Furthermore, teams of experts regularly check the herds in 
the private and public sectors and conduct examinations, after 
which any animal suffering from brucellosis is destroyed 
immediately.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on regional health and epidemiology developments 
monitored through 26 November. Source is cited in parentheses 
following each item. 
<H5>  Colombia </H5>
  Luis Alfonso Ante Benitez, sectional chief of health of 
Risaralda Department, has reported that one of the 35 cases of 
symptoms of bleeding dengue fever has tested positive in 
Dosquebradas, Risaralda Department. Ante said cases have been 
reported since October, but only one has tested positive thus 
far. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 19 Nov 93, p 11B) 
  The Health Ministry has reported that 3,953 persons have 
developed AIDS. According to statistics, 7,730 persons have 
been infected with the said virus since 1983, although over half 
of them have not developed the illness. A total of 243 persons 
have developed AIDS in 1993. However, unofficial numbers 
indicate that the number of ill persons, healthy carriers, and 
victims of AIDS is much higher than the official numbers. 
(Madrid EFE in Spanish 2157 GMT 23 Nov 93) 
<H5>  Costa Rica </H5>
  Health authorities in Guatuso Canton, Alajuela Province, 
have 
reported that three cases of cholera have been confirmed. With 
these three new cases, the number of cholera cases in Costa Rica 
increases to 26. (San Jose LA NACION in Spanish 17 Nov 93, 6A) 
  The Health Ministry has reported that 20 cases of malaria 
have been confirmed in the town of Jaco, on the Costa Rican 
Pacific coast. The authorities have added that the majority of 
the persons infected are Nicaraguan workers who are now being 
treated. As of 24 November, 4,701 cases of malaria were 
detected in the country, 80 percent of them on the Atlantic 
coast. Besides this epidemic, there has also been an outbreak 
of dengue fever with over 5,000 cases registered over a period 
of two months. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1850 GMT 26 Nov

been hospitalized, and 279 have died. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in 
Spanish 2224 GMT 22 Nov 93) 
  Doctor Carlos Cordova, chief of the Public Health Ministry 
in 
the Alta Verapaz Department, has reported that three AIDS cases 
were recently detected among indigenous communities of the area. 
Dr. Cordova added that the problem with detecting the advance 
of AIDS is that the indigenous peoples refuse to allow medical 
authorities to take blood from them. (Guatemala City PRENSA 
LIBRE in Spanish 25 Nov 93 p 131) 
<H5>  Honduras </H5>
  Health authorities reported on 24 November that WHO 
estimates 
that approximately 60,000 Hondurans are carrying the AIDS virus.

there have been a total of 3,193 patients, of which 751 have 
died. (San Pedro Sula TIEMPO in Spanish 24 Nov 93 p 12) 
<H5>  Nicaragua </H5>
  A report from the Epidemiology Observation Office of 
Nicaragua stated that 74 new cases of cholera were registered 
over the weekend of 20 November and that two of the patients

epidemic because all cases are under control. (Panama City EL 
PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 23 Nov 93 p 1A) 
  A report from the Technical Epidemiology Division of the 
Health Ministry indicates that a total of 340 persons have died 
of AIDS in Panama since the first case was detected in early 
1984. The report adds that there are another 580 registered 
cases and that scientific studies indicate that there must be 
approximately 30,000 carriers of the HIV virus without symptoms. 
(Panama City EL SIGLO in Spanish 24 Nov 93 p 12) 
<H5>  Peru </H5>
  Health authorities have reported that over 15 persons have

<H5>  Colombia </H5>
  Although Health Ministry figures indicate the are no more 
than 60,000 AIDS cases in the country, Social Security says the 
figure totals 120,000. Moreover, 70 percent of the patients 
range in ages from 24 to 44. The largest number of cases are 
reported in San Andres, Quindio, Risaralda, and Antioquia 
Departments and in Santa Fe de Bogota. (Santa Fe de Bogota 
Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 1730 GMT 1 Dec 93) 
<H5>  Costa Rica </H5>
  National AIDS Commission Director Guisella Herrera has 
reported 100 cases of AIDS have been registered so far this 
year, raising to 500 the number of persons who have this 
disease. She also noted there are at least 10,000 AIDS carriers 
in the country. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 2011 GMT 1 Dec 93) 
<H5>  Cuba </H5>
  Dr. Manuel Santin, national epidemiology director at the 
Health Ministry, has stated there are 970 HIV carriers in the 
country, of which 226 have developed AIDS. He added that 143 
AIDS patients have died. According to this official, the 
incubation period was extended to 10.5 years. The percentage of 
cases in the population is 0.007 percent Santin noted. (Havana 
Radio Havana Cuba in Spanish 0000 GMT 2 Dec 93) 
<H5>  Ecuador </H5>
  Statistics indicate 586 persons have been infected with or 
are ill with AIDS in Ecuador. The most cases are reported in 
Quito and Guayaquil. (Quito Voz de los Andes in Spanish 1200 GMT 
1 Dec 93) 
<H5>  El Salvador </H5>
  Dr. Licida Bautista de Mejia of the Pan American Health 
Organization has revealed that, since the first case of AIDS was 
reported in the country in 1984, 1,345 persons have died of this 
disease. It is estimated that 1,123 may be infected with the 
virus. So far in 1993, 18 persons have died of it. (San Salvador 
LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 2 Dec 93 p 4) 
<H5>  Guatemala </H5>
  According to recent disclosures by the health and social 
welfare minister to a congressional health commission, the 
spread of AIDS in Guatemala is reaching alarming levels. 
According to recent Health Ministry data, at least 31,000 
cholera patients have been reported of which 75 percent have 
received medical treatment. The same data indicate that 249 
cholera patients have died so far. With respect to AIDS, 430 
cases and 420 HIV positive cases have been reported. Most of the 
AIDS cases have been in the 22-29 age group. (Guatemala City 
PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 29 Nov 93 p 4) 
  Miriam Cobar Aguilera, head of the National AIDS Control and 
Prevention Program, PNPCS, disclosed that 1,002 AIDS cases had 
been recorded between 1984 and October 1993. She also indicated 
that this represented a 16.7 percent growth rate with respect to 
1986. The PNPCS official explained that 467 cases have been 
confirmed, while 535 cases are recorded as asymptomatic carriers 
and are virtual transmission agents without being aware of this 
fact. According to PNPCS data, 142 men and 36 women have died of 
AIDS related causes. On the other hand, Mireya Gularte, 
director of the Orientation Center for Sexually Transmittable 
Diseases and AIDS Prevention, CODETS, stated that the number of 
AIDS cases in Guatemala could be greater than 50,000 because 
most men and women evade normal control tests. (Guatemala City 
PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 1 Dec 93 p 8) 
<H5>  Honduras </H5>
  A recent health authority study points out that more than 
3,000 proven AIDS cases, and 60,000 HIV positive cases have been 
recorded in Honduras. The study also reports that for every 100 
Central American AIDS cases recorded, 57 are Hondurans. 
Although Honduran health authorities attribute the spread of 
AIDS to poor information with respect to risks involved in 
contracting the disease, some sectors link the epidemic's rapid 
growth to the presence of U.S. troops in the country. (Paris AFP 
in Spanish 1147 GMT 27 Nov 93) 
  Health official Dr. Felicito Montalvan pointed out recently 
that the number of AIDS related deaths recorded in the country 
could be greater than the 3,193 cases reported to date by the 
Health Ministry. According to Dr. Montalvan, Health Ministry 
data could be underestimated because some AIDS-related deaths 
are not reported. (Tegucigalpa EL HERALDO in Spanish 2 Dec 93 p 
5) 
  Health authorities reported on 2 December that 11 new 
cholera 
cases had been recorded which brings the total number to 3,201 
cases and 81 deaths since first recorded in October 1991. 
According to the health authorities, 2,077 cases were reported 
during 1993 and the most affected regions include Choluteca 
(1,206), San Francisco Morazan (295), and Valle (250). (San 
Pedro Sula TIEMPO in Spanish 3 Dec 93 p 2) 
<H5>  Nicaragua </H5>
  Health Ministry sources in Managua reported that 35 people 
have died of AIDS so far, while 47 others are infected. They 
added that there are 111 HIV carriers and, although there is no 
precise figure, they believe that as many as 15,000 Nicaraguans 
have been infected in all. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1148 GMT 1 
Dec 93) 
<H5>  Panama </H5>
  Health authorities released a report stating that there have 
been 123 cases of AIDS reported this year. Nationwide, since 
the disease was first reported, there have been 587 cases 
treated, 500 of which were men and 87 women. It is believed 
that there are between 11,000 and 14,000 carriers. On the 
sadder side of these statistics, there are eight children who 
were reported as HIV positive during 1993. (Panama City EL SIGLO 
in Spanish 28 Nov 93 p 29) 
  Livestock association leaders have warned of rabies among 
cattle that could be transmitted to humans. There have been 10 
cases of bovine rabies up to now, and Health Minister Guillermo 
Rolla announced that a team of specialists has been sent to 
eastern Panama province to investigate and determine control 
measures. (Panama City EL SIGLO in Spanish 1 Dec 93, p 12) 
  Three new dengue cases were recorded in the San Miguelito 
district which could be the beginning of an epidemic according 
to reports disclosed by Health Minister Guillermo Rolla 
Pimentel. He also stressed the fact that the three new cases 
were recorded in the same area where the first three cases were 
uncovered less than six weeks ago. (Panama City EL PANAMA 
AMERICA in Spanish 3 Dec 93 p 5a) 
  Dr. Marcel Peina, head of an AIDS research group, has 
pointed 
out that the number of AIDS carriers in Panama could range 
between 11,000 and 14,000 persons. According to Dr, Peina, 
these persons represent a real threat since they are unaware 
that they are HIV positive and the health authorities have no 
record of their whereabouts. Dr. Peina also disclosed that AIDS 
has now been recorded in every province in the country but 
mostly in Panama City and San Miguelito district. At least 587 
cases have been recorded in Panama, and 536 deaths. (Panama 
City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 3 Dec 93 p 10A) 
<H5>  Peru </H5>
  According to Health Ministry data, approximately 30,000 and 
40,000 Peruvians are believed to be HIV positive without being 
aware of it. Since 1983, when the first AIDS case was recorded, 
up until October 1993, at least 953 cases have been recorded. 
Of the total number of cases recorded, 84.58 percent are men. 
(Lima Global de Television Network in Spanish 0100 GMT 2 Dec 
93) 
  Aids was first recorded in Peru in July 1983; since then 153 
cases have been reported, but the number of estimated 
individuals believed to be HIV positive totals 100,000. Of the 
total number of cases recorded in Peru, 91.6 percent include 
men, while 8.4 percent are women; nevertheless, considering that 
the contagion index among heterosexuals is increasing 
dramatically, the risk to women is greater with each passing 
day. In 1989, for example, for each 12 cases of AIDS among men, 
only one AIDS case was reported among women. During 1993, the 
proportion increased to such an extent that now there is one 
case among women for each eight cases among men. Of the total 
number of cases, 33.4 percent are in the 20- to 29- year-old 
group, and 36.2 percent are in the 35-year-old bracket. 
  According to the Health Ministry, there are 3,000 AIDS cases 
in Peru, and 73 percent of those cases are in Lima. The 
dramatic spread of the epidemic in the provinces indicates that 
it is spreading rapidly throughout the country. Health data 
show that the following numbers of cases have been reported 
throughout Peru: six cases in Cusco; 16 cases in the Trujillo 
regions of La Libertad and 55 in La Primavera; 23 proven cases 
and eight deaths in Tumbes; 35 cases in Iquitos; 42 confirmed 
cases in Chiclayo; 58 cases in Arequipa. (Lima Panamericana 
Television Network in Spanish 0200 GMT 29 Nov 93) 
<H5>  Venezuela </H5>
  Recent AIDS statistics in Venezuela reveal the following 
trend up until 30 September 1993: total number of cases--3,100; 
number of deaths--1,690; reported cases among men--2,853; deaths 
among men-- 1,556; cases among women--241; deaths among 
women--132. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 1 Dec 93 p C2) 
  According to figures released by Dr. Luis Echezuria, Health 
and Social Welfare Ministry epidemiology director, during the 
current year approximately 7,600 dengue cases and 14 related 
deaths have been reported throughout Venezuela. The most 
affected regions include Tachira, Barinas, Aragua, Miranda, 
Lara, and the Federal District. (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in 
Spanish 27 Nov 93 p. 2-16)

following each item. 
<H5>  Colombia </H5>
  In the 10 years that AIDS has been reported in Colombia, it 
has officially caused 1,800 deaths. Nevertheless, according to 
the National Survey on Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices 
Related to Sexually Transmitted Diseases, 121,000 people may be 
infected with the virus in Colombia. The survey was carried out 
among 18,000 people and was contracted by the Social Security 
Institute. It found that 20.3 percent of the men tested positive 
while 1.3 percent of the women tested positive. That means that 
out of the total population, 118,093 men and 3,538 women might 
test positive. This would be equivalent to 35 out of every 
10,000 Colombians. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 1

poisoning of vampire bats in the area of San Martin where there 
has been an outbreak of rabies among cattle and horses. It has 
also restricted the transfer of slaughtered cattle in the area.

  [Text] Authorities from the Cochabamba Health Unit said 
that as of the end of the year they had covered more than 80 
percent of children under five years old, protecting them 
against poliomyelitis, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, and

  The Health Unit's head of Epidemiology, Dr. Jorge Flores 
Ramirez, said that next Friday will conclude the third and final 
infant vaccination campaign in the district, which is part of 
the national health plan coordinated by the under secretary of 
that branch. 
  The campaign currently under way, which uses the method of 
home visits, that is, house to house vaccinations, began last 25 
October and will end on Friday, the 12th of this month, with 
results that so far have been acceptable, he said. 
  ``We are prioritizing the outlying urban areas where 
coverage 
still needs to be improved within the age group comprised of 
children under five, with some exceptions in neighborhoods where 
the presence of disease is feared, where we seek even children 
of up to 10,'' he said. 
  According to Flores Ramirez, this last campaign of the year 
is intended to achieve at least the same level of coverage as 
the previous year, which was good, with the intention of 
exceeding 80 percent coverage for children under one, for a 
third dose of the three vaccines. 
  He said that next week they would hold a national evaluation 
of the Extended Immunization Program in La Paz, for which he is 
preparing an extensive report on the successes achieved so far. 
  ``This year we achieved coverage of 57.34 percent for 
poliomyelitis; 51.05 percent for diphtheria, tetanus, and 
whooping cough; 56.6 percent for measles, and 66.6 percent for 
tuberculosis, even though the latter was not part of this 
campaign,'' he said, in advance of his report. 
  He reiterated that these figures demonstrate that good 
progress was made in the district, since by the end of the year 
it will be possible to conclude the work with coverage of 
greater than 80 percent of the overall total. 
  The house-by-house campaign will conclude next Friday and an 
evaluation by area and by sector will immediately be performed, 
and in accordance with the data collected in that evaluation, a 
new sweep will be made in the areas with low coverage rates, to 
increase the level of protection among children. 
  In the current campaign, which so far has had a positive 
response from parents, approximately 2,000 people participated, 
including employees of the Under Secretariat of Health and other 
institutions that customarily cooperate in these areas. 
  According to data from the Health Unit, it was calculated 
that during the campaign 68,000 children under five were 
vaccinated with all the vaccines. No evaluation has yet been 
carried out, because according to those measures, a sweep will 
still have to be performed in areas where the anticipated 
coverage has not been achieved. 
<H5>  Cholera </H5>
  In addition, Flores Ramirez mentioned the problem of cholera 
in the district, reporting that by week 43 of the epidemic, a 
total of 1,849 cases had been reported over the course of the 
year, which means less than 50 percent of the 1992 level. 
  ``Despite this low rate, we believe that it must be presumed 
that with the coming of the rains we will be due for an 
outbreak, for which reason we have to continue following the 
instructions issued by the Anti-Cholera Commission, and the 
population bears the greatest responsibility for preventing high 
risk situations from emerging again,'' he said.

  [Text] National health sector authorities contemplated the 
historical and social importance of the Workers Hospital, one of 
the first medical centers that continues to serve the poorer 
sectors of the population, and which has recorded yet another 
anniversary since its founding. 
  Some 30 planned surgical operations are performed at the 
Workers Hospital on a daily basis, with an additional six on an 
emergency basis. Last year there were 6,485 surgical 
interventions performed there, ranging from minor up to the most 
complex pathology (kidney and cornea transplants, cardiac 
surgery, laparoscopy, oncology, microsurgery of the ear, and 
ophthalmic neurosurgery, burn reconstruction, trauma, 
orthopedics, and others). 
  In 1992, 36,116 patients were recorded for 225,290 
laboratory 
examinations, an average of 700 examinations per day. A total of 
83,902 external consultations were performed and each year an 
average of 10,000 patients are admitted. In addition, that 
hospital has progressed greatly with respect to diagnostic 
equipment such endoscopy, radiology, angiology, and others. 
<H5>  Integral Training </H5>
  But the Workers Hospital's greatest concern is the integral 
training of its human resources, from highly specialized 
professionals to service workers, for which reason it 
periodically sponsors medical conferences, seminars, workshops, 
refresher courses, and other educational activities prepared by 
the Department of Teaching and Research. 
  Internally, medical seminars are held annually, with a view 
to disseminating knowledge and scientific experience. 
<H5>  Background </H5>
  Yesterday the Workers Hospital in the city of La Paz 
celebrated 38 years of life and service to the country's 
insureds and beneficiaries. 
  The primary hospital center was founded in 1955 during the 
administration of Victor Paz Estensoro, for the purpose of 
providing public services in internal medicine, surgery, 
rehabilitation, laboratory, and external consultations. 
<H5>  Body of Work </H5>
  The health facility currently has 500 beds and 800 
employees, 
including professionals, paramedics, and administrative and 
service workers, of which 160 are high-level specialists, who 
rose to their positions of responsibility in merit of their 
qualifications.

  [Text] La Paz--This Sunday the 7th (yesterday), four 
hospital centers run by the National Armed Forces began their 
modernization, thanks to a $7.5 million credit recently 
disbursed by the Spanish Government, as reported to LOS TIEMPOS 
by Corporation for Military Social Security [COSSMIL] General 
Manager Gen. Juan Vera. 
  The health facilities in La Paz, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, and 
Beni began receiving the necessary materials for their 
operations, which will soon provide ``valuable social services'' 
to the population in those districts of the country, General 
Vera said. 
  He added that to this end, TAB (Bolivian Air Transport) 
planes and Army transport vehicles have left La Paz within the 
last few hours, carrying the materials acquired under Spanish 
aid, and destined for the aforementioned departments. 
  In the Military Chief's view, the modern health facilities 
will, within 15 days at most, begin providing medical services 
to civilians, through which they will seek to contribute to 
improving health benefits in Bolivia and bring down medical 
costs. 
  ``We will provide our insureds and the rest of the 
population 
with an efficient and professional service,'' the COSSMIL 
manager said. 
  He emphasized that the start up of the Military Hospitals in 
the country's medical treatment available to all social 
sectors.'' 
  Finally, he announced that next 18 November, in celebration 
of the founding anniversary of Beni, the Corporation for 
Military Social Security will inaugurate a new Hospital Center 
in Trinidad, within the context of the Armed Forces' stated 
objective of putting their sanitary facilities into operation in 
the country's main corridor.

  [Text] La Paz--The only department in the country whose 
inhabitants do not face malaria problems is Oruro, according to 
a report by the National Maternal-Infant Health Directorate. 
  The report states that according to data from Epidemiology, 
some 800,000 square kilometers of the country's territory has 
been affected by this illness and are classified as malaria zone. 
  The report adds that some 2,500,000 persons live in this 
zone, many of whom have contracted the illness, and the majority 
are in a state of risk. 
  The malaria zones are in the departments of Santa Cruz, 
Beni, 
Pando, and Cochabamba; there are also malaria zones north of La 
Paz and Potosi, and in areas of Tarija. 
  With respect to Oruro, the report indicates that this 
district is free of the disease, due to its being surrounded by 
areas of other departments that do not have the disease. 
  In recent years, 2,559 infants have been recorded as having 
the disease, but they are the only sector of the population 
counted because they are treated for one thing or another in 
health centers. 
  The campaigns making vaccination of infants almost 
obligatory 
have facilitated such records, which is not the case for adults. 
  In many cases, he added, adults who have suffered from 
malaria and recovered or died, have not been reported to the 
health centers or authorities so that this could be recorded.

  [Text] Cobija--At least two persons have died of malaria 
since an outbreak of that disease was officially declared in 
various provinces of Pando a month ago, the Health Unit in that 
district confirmed today. 
  The first two fatalities, for which no further data was 
provided, were confirmed while the local health authorities are 
already on the verge of desperation because the promised 
equipment and insecticides have not arrived from La Paz to carry 
out a new fumigation campaign against the mosquito that 
transmits the virus. 
  Meanwhile, according to new reports collected by local radio 
stations, there are high rates of incidence of malaria in the 
communities of Puerto Rico, Nueva Esperanza, and Santa Rosa de 
Abuna, with the affected provinces being Manuripi, Abuna, 
Federico Roman, and Madre de Dios. 
  Pando Health Unit Director Juan Cayoja reported that a 
commission from the National Health Secretariat is expected to 
arrive within the next few days, and will bring a new 
insecticide that the rural fumigation brigades will use. 
  It is precisely the lack of that insecticide--to replace the 
old DDT which is no longer used because it damages the 
ecosystem--that was blamed in early October as the reason for 
the suspension of the fumigation activities, which resulted in 
the malaria outbreak. 
  Now the insecticide INCON will be used, which does not 
damage 
the environment, Cayoja said. 
  He added that in addition to the two deaths, approximately 
one thousand people throughout the department are infected with 
malaria, and more deaths are feared from lack of resources to 
assist them in a timely fashion. 
  Cases of malaria have also appeared in the poorer 
neighborhoods of Cobija, inhabited primarily by farmers. 
  According to Cayoja, the health alert will be in effect 
during the entire rainy season, which recently began.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Jorge Perez, director of Santiago de las </F>
Vegas Sanatorium and deputy director of medical care at Pedro 
Curie Institute, by Roberto Cavada; date not given; all figures 
as heard -- recorded] 
  [Text][Cavada] Doctor, I think it would be good 
to give the current number of seropositive cases. 
[Perez] Currently, we have 979 patients who are 
seropositive to the Human Immunodificiency Virus [HIV] in Cuba; 
of these, 71 percent are males, and 29 percent females. Of this 
group of patients, 230 have developed Acquired Immunodificiency 
Syndrome [AIDS] since 1986; of these 230 patients, 144 have died. 
[Cavada] We have been told, and other sources we have 
consulted have told us, that there are only slightly over 80 
patients in Cuba right now. 
[Perez] Yes. If you subtract the 145 deaths from the 
230 AIDS cases, the result is exactly 83 patients. That is the 
number alive today. 
  In Cuba, the number of HIV infections to date is 85. The 
main 
goal of the Cuban program is to identify people before they 
become ill. This is in contrast with other programs in the world 
that identify seropositive individuals after they have already 
become ill or when they go to the hospital, or by chance. 
  The goal of the Cuban program is to detect seropositive 
cases 
as early as possible as to give counseling and also do 
preventive work so that this disease does not spread. This is 
the reason our figures are much smaller than those of other 
countries. We never have had an unchecked geometric growth of 
this infection. We have had a small mathematical growth in the 
number of seropositive cases since 1987. In 1986 we detected a 
number of cases accumulated from prior years.

<F P=106> [Report by NTV correspondent Nestor Labrada on the Ciego de </F>
Avila AIDS Sanatorium, including interviews with the sanatorium 
director and patients; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Labrada] Every 24 hours approximately 
5,000 people in the world become seropositive of the Human 
Immunodificiency Virus [HIV], which causes the Acquired 
Immunodificiency Syndrome [AIDS]. This is the AIDS Sanatorium of 
Ciego de Avila, one of the 13 currently operating in Cuba. In 
these centers, more than 900 patients receive dedicated care. 
For each patient, the state spends more than 28,000 pesos 
annually. The centers form part of the extensive program 
operating in Cuba to prevent the spread of the epidemic, a 
program that ranges from testing pregnant women to monitoring 
seropositive cases. Orestes Antonio Varo, director of the Ciego 
de Avila Sanatorium, points out that patients receive not only 
medical treatment but also the understanding and affection that 
is needed in these cases. 
[Varo] Efforts are made to keep the patients healthy 
and to establish a favorable psychological environment that will 
ultimately benefit their health. Furthermore, we prepare the 
patients for a future mobile service, which we hope to implement 
soon. The Ministry of Public Health is currently working very 
hard on this program so that our patients can return to the 
streets and live a normal life. 
[Labrada] For four consecutive days, these patients 
at the [words indistinct] receive the necessary treatment. They 
spend the rest of the week with their relatives at home. 
[First unidentified patient] Life in the sanatorium 
is very good. The truth is that if it were not for the 
sanatorium and the government, we would not be receiving any 
treatment. 
[Labrada] Many would like to incorporate themselves 
into society. 
[Second unidentified patient] I would like to 
continue my normal life. 
[Labrada] To this day, many associate the sickness 
with moral problems and do not understand that AIDS is a disease 
that affects all people and one that it is everybody's 
responsibility to prevent. 
[Third unidentified patient] I call on the youth and 
the population to maintain stability with regard to their 
partner; to practice safe sex; and not to reject people with 
AIDS just for being seropositive, but to help us overcome this 
evil so that we can all overcome it.

  [Text] Chiquimula Department, located 167 km east of the 
capital, is being stricken by a cholera epidemic that has caused 
10 deaths in only 72 hours, and has hospitalized 54 more 
persons, according to volunteer firefighters. 
  The report provided by that institution's public relations 
office claims that its units are working in the town of 
Chiquimula and other settlements in the department, transporting 
the victims. 
  Between Wednesday and yesterday, Friday, the CVB [Volunteer 
Firefighter Corps] ambulances have taken 85 patients to the 
Chiquimula National Hospital, 54 of whom proved to have 
contracted the disease. 
<H5>  In the Urban Area </H5>
  It was added that, in the town of Chiquimula, there are 
cholera victims in the Cuatro de Febrero, El Angel, La 
Democracia, and El Molina districts, to which the CVB ambulances 
have been dispatched. 
  It was also noted that, of the cholera patients in the town 
of Chiquimula, one adult and one child have died; however, more 
deaths are feared, because the same circumstances are prevalent. 
<H5>  In the Rural Area </H5>
  It was further explained that seven more persons died of the 
disease in the municipality of San Juan la Ermita, and that 
there is evidence of many other victims in that entire section. 
  Elsewhere in the report, it was noted that another young 
girl, aged 16, had died from cholera in Equipulas, and that 
patients from the villages of Marraxco and Canan are appearing 
at the national hospital. 
  The volunteer firefighters added that cholera victims have 
also been reported in the villages of Shusho Arriba and Shusho 
Abajo. Although these volunteers have but little equipment, they 
are responsible for transporting the patients. 
  At the national hospital as well, work is being done with 
only meager resources available. Nevertheless, the staff's major 
effort is aimed at saving the lives of patients, many of whom 
are already in an advanced state of dehydration upon arrival. 
  The volunteer firefighters explained that, if the rate 
continues as it is now, they will have to request aid from their 
headquarters in the capital, so as to be reinforced with 
personnel and equipment, in addition to ambulances for moving 
the patients.

  [Text] The health authorities announced yesterday that 215 
new cases of cholera have been reported this week; of these 
patients, three have died. This latest report brings the total 
number of patients reported from 1991 to the present to 1,524. 
  In 1993 alone, 1,100 cases have occurred. The patients who 
died included a young man of 22 in San Jose Comayagua and two 
children, four and 11 years of age, in Tegucigalpa. 
  The area most seriously affected by cholera continues to be 
the southern zone, specifically the department of Choluteca, 
where 166 of the 215 new cases occurred. After Choluteca, Valle 
and Francisco Morazan are the areas most affected, while the 
number of patients reported in Copan and Atlantida remains at 
the normal level. Men accounted for 935 of the cases reported, 
and women for 563. 
  Differing with the official figures, Maria del Carmen 
Portillo, the coordinator of the Child Welfare and Development 
Project of the Evangelical Committee of Development and National 
Emergency (CEDEN), has reported that in El Triunfo, in the 
department of Choluteca, 200 individuals have been infected with 
cholera, and 62 have died. 
  The total number of patients infected by the Vibrio cholerae 
in Choluteca, as reported by the CEDEN, is not included in the 
official figures released by the Ministry of Public Health. 
According to Portillo, an emergency exists in that locality 
because of this disease.

  [Text] Yesterday, Health Minister Jaime Freundt-Thurne 
Oyanguren announced that his department is adopting preventive 
measures to avert another cholera outbreak, especially during 
the coming summer season. 
  Freundt-Thurne stressed that the Health Ministry has set as 
its priority the population's education, to prevent its exposure 
to contracting this disease again. 
  He claimed that, for this purpose, the status of sanitation 
is being improved with the installation of water and sewerage 
services, in some instances financed with Fonavi [National 
Housing Fund] resources. 
  He added that the incidence of cholera cases on the national 
level has been reduced through the sanitation measures being 
implemented. He admitted that the virus has ceased to be of 
epidemic proportions, and has become endemic. 
  He mentioned that, in the latest statistics for the week of 
10-16 October, 622 cases of diarrheal diseases were officially 
reported. He remarked that 83 of them were confirmed as cholera, 
but that no deaths were reported. 
  The vice minister of health, Eduardo Young Motta, for his 
part, confirmed those figures, adding that the number of acute 
diarrheal diseases for the year in Lima alone is 28,550, with 22 
fatalities. 
  In order to coordinate its preventive action, the Health 
Ministry is scheduling a series of activities with the 
municipalities, associated particularly with the control of 
street vending, considered a leading contaminating agent. 
  According to a timetable that is due for approval within the 
next few days, samples will start to be taken of foods sold on 
the streets, and a widespread community health education 
campaign will be intensified. 
  At the same time, doses of rehydrating salts are to be 
distributed, free of charge, among health centers and medical 
stations, especially those in human settlements. There are also 
supplies of serum for treating the serious cases that may appear. 
<H5>  The Main Propagating Factors </H5>
  The use of nonpotable water, consumption of contaminated 
ocean products and vegetables, and a lack of personal hygiene 
and sanitation in the home are the main factors spreading 
cholera, which afflicts persons of any age or social status. 
  Cholera, the scientific name of which is vibrio 
cholerae, is of bacterial origin. Its virus was discovered 
in 1884 by the scientist Robert Koch. 
  The current pandemia began at the end of January 1991, when 
it struck the population of Chancay primarily. Spreading rapidly 
among the coastal populations, weeks later it reached the 
interior of the country. Next, the epidemic extended to Ecuador 
and, subsequently, to the rest of South and Central America. 
There were even some ``imported cases'' treated in the United 
States. 
  The Peruvian experience in dealing with this disease evoked 
the interest of Latin American specialists, who came to Peru to 
learn about the treatment systems for eradicating the disease in 
their countries.

  [Text] In the early years of independence, thousands of 
diphtheria cases were registered in the country. With an idea 
of eliminating this contagious disease, the Health Ministry made 
the vaccination of newborn babies compulsory in the 70's. 
Despite all the measures that have been taken, diphtheria still 
exists in the country. Over 100 people have recently contracted 
diphtheria throughout the country. Over to Nacera Bouzid for 
more details: 
  [Begin Bouzid recording] About 150 diphtheria cases have 
been 
registered in the provinces of Tamanrasset, Ouargla, Ghardaia, 
Bouira, and Tizi Ouzou from May to December this year. 
According to the Ministry of Health and Housing, 23 people have 
died of this disease. The ministry added that a large number of 
people who have not been vaccinated risk contracting diphtheria.

  [Text] PATNA, October 5: More than 600 people in the 
villages of Khairi Ajgarwa, Sisbania and Tikulia in the Motihari 
block of East Champaran district have been taken ill during the 
past six days, with seven of them succumbing to the illness, 
which is yet to be identified. 
  While early reports said that it might be cholera, it now 
appears that it may in fact be food poisoning contracted from 
eating fish that had washed ashore during the floods and had 
affected this area. 
  The director-in-chief, Dr Eileen Thakur, who had a 
telephonic 
conversation with the civil surgeon of Motihari this afternoon, 
told TOINS that people of these villages had fallen ill after 
consuming the small dead fish. Dr Thakur said the seven persons 
of Khairi Ajgarwa had, in fact, died of food poisoning and not 
of cholera. She said in Khairi Ajgarwa alone 500 people had 
fallen ill complaining of diarrhea and vomiting. 
  The civil surgeon of Motihari has informed the government 
that a medical team has been camping at Khairi Ajgarwa village 
to ascertain whether the disease which had been raging in these 
villages was cholera vibrio non zero or not. 
  The director-in-chief, Dr Thakur today directed the civil 
surgeon to send a detailed report about the disease within two 
days.

  [Text] MADRAS, Oct 5: Duplication of work in AIDS awareness 
and prevention could be avoided through periodic review and 
proper coordination among groups working in the field, the 
Governor, Dr M. Channa Reddy, has said. 
  Addressing representatives of Non-Governmental Organizations 
and the core group on AIDS control formed by the Tamil Nadu Dr 
MGR Medical University at Raj Bhavan today, he said awareness 
programmes alone were not enough. They had to be supported by 
concerted action from the people. All sections of society had to 
be mobilized in a systematic manner to tackle the spread of the 
disease. 
  Universities had a pivotal role to play in the awareness 
programmes. The blueprint prepared by the medical University 
could serve to coordinate the work of NGOs and other 
organizations involved in the field and could cut down 
expenditure. 
  The time limit fixed for awareness programmes should be long 
enough for organizations working in the field to bring about the 
desired behavioural changes in the individual, Dr Reddi said. 
Awareness activities in a particular locality could be for a 
period of three years as NGOs then would have time to draw up 
their plans and execute them in a better manner. 
  The Additional Project Director (Technical), National AIDS 
Control Organisation (NACO), Dr Shiv Lal, said the blueprint 
prepared by the Medical University was well within the national 
strategy for AIDS control. The University could supplement the 
efforts of State-level organisations. 
<H5>  459 full blown AIDS cases </H5>
  Of the 19 lakh blood samples screened throughout the country 
by NACO till September, about 13,200 were found to be HIV 
positive. In about 70 per cent of cases, the transmission was 
through the sexual mode, according to studies. There were 459 
full blown AIDS cases in the country; of this 152 were reported 
from Tamil Nadu. The figures were based on screening blood 
samples from among the urban population. The estimated HIV 
prevalence in the country, including the rural population, would 
be nearly one million. According to the Planning Commission, 
migrant labour constituted about 30 per cent of the urban labour 
force. This group was vulnerable to the disease and efforts had 
to be made on a large scale to educate them. 
  The Union Government would spend Rs. 222 crores over a 
five-year period on AIDS awareness and related projects. 35 per 
cent of the outlay was earmarked for the 
Information-Education-Communication (IEC) programmes, 30 per 
cent for blood safety projects and 10 per cent for Sexually 
Transmitted Diseases control and surveillance programmes.

  [Text]AHMEDABAD, September 27: Locust swarms have been 
sighted again in at least 20 villages of Banaskantha and Mehsana 
districts, forcing the authorities to launch massive aerial and 
ground operations to combat them. 
  A Bell helicopter of the state agricultural department and 
several jeeps have been deployed to fight the menace. 
  While locust swarms were sighted over the experimental farms 
of the Gujarat Agricultural University in Palanpur in 
Banaskantha on Saturday evening, they were located over some of 
the villages in Chanasma, Patan and Kheralu talukas of Mehsana 
district yesterday by the officials of the agricultural 
department. 
  The survey by the officials revealed that isolated swarms of 
both pink and brown coloured adults, located at Banaskantha and 
Mehsana during the last 24 hours, had been spreading over around 
200 hectares of land, threatening the standing crops. A 
spokesman of the team said that with the use of the helicopter 
and also intensive dusting by jeeps and aerial survey the swarms 
were neutralised at Danta, Dhanera, Deesa and Palanpur 
yesterday. In Mehsana district intensive ground operation by 
hand spraying and dusting was on in the affected areas. 
  According to official sources, at least two swarms located 
in 
Banaskantha district were believed to have come from Rajasthan 
and its surrounding areas. Later they were heading towards 
Chanasma, Patan and Kheralu in Mehsana district and were moving 
at the speed of 15 to 20 km per hour. The authorities had also 
made arrangements for supplying adequate quantity of chemical 
mixture for ground as well as aerial spraying. 
  The operation team led by Mr R.S. Tripathi, plant protection 
officer, also used jet of smoke for neutralising the swarms. 
According to the latest report certain swarms were believed to 
have moved towards Pakistan through the Rann of Kutch. The 
authorities concerned in Kutch district have also been alerted 
to be ready for taking necessary action. 
  According to the records of the state agriculture 
department, 
locusts had invaded Gujarat 11 times during the last 100 years.

<F P=106> [IRNA report: ``Tomorrow Will Be Too Late; Let's Prevent </F>
AIDS Today''] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted on history of AIDS] The first 
case of AIDS in Iran was reported in 1986 when a six-year-old 
hemophiliac child contracted it as a result of imported blood, 
after which the Ministry of Health, Treatment, and Medical 
Education set up a department known as the National Committee 
for Combating AIDS. 
  According to Dr. Malek Afzali, the deputy minister for 
health, as of the month of Aban [23 October-21 November] this 
year, 219 people have been affected by the AIDS virus in Iran. 
Of these, 85 have contracted the disease, and 62 have died. 
  The National Committee for Combating AIDS warns that if 
serious preventive measures are not instituted by the officials 
and the people in general, this disease could appear on a more 
extensive scale in the country. 
  At present, one can state: The best treatment for AIDS and 
one of the most important means of controlling this destructive 
disease--as recommended by the World Health Organization 
[WHO]--is adherence to religion and family values and 
familiarizing people with the ways the virus is transmitted and 
measures to prevent it. 
  Doctors, experts, specialists, and officials at the Blood 
Transfusion Center and the Health Ministry believe that in order 
to combat AIDS and its spread on a national level, necessary and 
adequate training about AIDS and other infectious diseases 
should be imparted to the people by means of various 
organizations, such as the Ministry of Culture and Islamic 
Guidance, Ministry of Education and Training, Ministry of 
Culture and Higher Education, the mass media, and the Friday 
imams. Special clinics to provide medical services to those who 
have already been infected by the AIDS virus should be 
established.

  [Text] Three people, one of them a child, have died as a 
result of an outbreak of diphtheria in Astrakhan. Fifty-two 
sick people and 54 carriers of this infection have been 
hospitalized. The sanitary and epidemiological station sees the 
cause of this terrible disease in migrational processes. Cases 
of diphtheria have also been registered in neighboring Kalmykia. 
  The oblast administration has allocated approximately 
50,000,000 rubles for emergency measures to combat the epidemic. 
Vaccinations have been given to 25 percent of the children and 
80 percent of those in the high-risk group. According to the 
law, which specifies that each territory can draw up its own 
sanitary regulations, compulsory vaccinations for doctors, 
students, teachers, shop workers, and the staffs of public 
catering and motor transport enterprises have been ordered. 
But, in spite of all the work to provide the public with 
information, epidemiologists are concerned at the passive 
attitude of the population and the strange apathy towards their 
health.

Scientific Methodology Center for the Fight against AIDS, by 
Lyudmila Dianova; date and place not given: ``AIDS Not Sleeping 
But Increasing Its Victims''] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted][Dianova] What is 
the status of AIDS testing in our country? 
[Pokrovskiy] We have a system of mass compulsory 
testing. Zealous medical personnel send to the laboratories 
everyone who does and does not need it, with no account taken of 
human rights or of the material cost. There should be a 
different approach to this problem. 
[Dianova] How many people are infected with the HIV 
virus in Russia at the moment? 
[Pokrovskiy] Six hundred and ninety-two. As a 
comparison, there were 652 recorded in May. Some people (not 
least some journalists) are unimpressed by this figure. And 
there are voices claiming that the AIDS problem in our country 
is imaginary or exaggerated. But the situation in the United 
States 20 years ago was exactly the same! If we do not want to 
catch up with America in terms of these sad statistics we need 
to raise the AIDS issue to the level of state policy. And this 
presupposes the creation of a national AIDS committee, the 
adoption of a Russian law on AIDS, and the instilling of order 
in the structure of organizations called upon to combat the HIV 
infection.

  [Text] [201529] [video opens with correspondent against 
backdrop of building] [Samoletov] A few years ago it was 
absolutely impossible to enter this enterprise's grounds. This 
was strictly a defense enterprise and produced nothing less than 
bacteriological weapons. After the production of 
bacteriological weapons was banned, a group of scientists from 
the center joined in the conversion program and began working on 
a comprehensive method of combating tumors and seeking a method 
of eliminating AIDS. They based their work on hyperthermia: 
Heating the tumor or the blood of the patient to a temperature 
of 42.5 degrees Celsius, at which point the diseased cells die. 
Similar experiments had been conducted before, but without 
producing tangible results because in practice raising the 
temperature too high inevitably results in death. Now the 
``Biotherapy'' Scientific Clinical Center in Novosibirsk has 
conducted lengthy research into and examination of the human 
body and has learned how to achieve temperatures up to 45 
degrees while protecting the healthy cells and the body itself 
from the effects of the high temperatures by means of new 
biological substances developed on the basis of a 
newly-discovered enzyme. [passage omitted consists of interview]

  [Text] In connection with the complication of the 
epidemiological situation as regards diphtheria (the incidence 
of this illness has increased eightfold over the past five 
years) the Moscow Government has decreed that the mass 
immunization of the population be carried out on the capital's 
territory. Vaccination against diphtheria will be compulsory 
for all workers in trade, public catering, the services sphere, 
transport, children's preschool and medical institutions, 
schools, and similar organizations. All small children in 
kindergartens and students in schools, technical colleges, and 
institutes will be vaccinated. It has been decided to immunize 
at least 95 percent of the capital's workers against diphtheria. 
  According to a city hall press center announcement the 
capital authorities have approved a number of measures to 
prevent vagrancy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Kozhemyakin, chief epidemiologist </F>
of the Belarusian Ministry of Health, by Galina Malakhovskaya 
under the ``Medicine'' rubric; place and date not given: 
``Those Who Are Reckless Get Sick'' -- questions published in 
boldface; first two paragraphs are SEM DNEY introduction] 
  [Excerpts] ``Rumor has it that an epidemic of diphtheria 
is beginning in Belarus. Is that right?'' (from reader N. 
Pavlovich's letter). 
  A SEM DNEY correspondent has talked to Anatoliy Kozhemyakin, 
chief epidemiologist of the Belarusian Ministry of Health. 
[Kozhemyakin] These rumors are grounded. While 
Belarus recorded 22, 26, and 66 cases of diphtheria in 1990, 
1991, and 1992, respectively, over the first 10 months of this 
year, we have registered already 80 patients with 38 in Minsk 
and 12 in its oblast. Unfortunately, we have death cases as 
well. It is too early to speak about an epidemic, but the 
disease has passed to the offensive. 
[Malakhovskaya] Anatoliy Kuzmich, what are the 
reasons for such a rapid spread of diphtheria? 
[Kozhemyakin] People perceive diphtheria as a 
children's infectious disease. However, no matter how 
paradoxical this may be, this disease has matured considerably. 
For example, among the 80 patients, 52 people were over the age 
of 15. This can be explained by the fact that the immunity 
acquired through vaccination weakens over the years. According 
to laboratory tests conducted in Belarus, about 40 percent of 
the population, mostly adults, have no diphtheria antibodies. 
Therefore, the chief sanitary inspector of Belarus has issued 
an order requiring that residents be immunized every 10 years 
beginning from 16 years of age. 
  Certainly, we must strictly observe the terms of children's 
immunization. By the way, about 87 percent of the Belarusian 
population was immunized or repeatedly vaccinated against 
diphtheria last year. Although this is one of the best 
indicators among the CIS countries, it falls short of the 95 
percent recommended by the World Health Organization [WHO]. 
[passage omitted] 
[Malakhovskaya] Anatoliy Kuzmich, we have information 
that an epidemic of diphtheria has already been registered in 
Russia. 
[Kozhemyakin] Not only in Russia, but also in 
Ukraine. About 8,000 cases of diphtheria have been recorded in 
Russia over the first nine months of this year with 254 deaths 
among them. People's constant migration aggravates the 
situation both in our republic and abroad. According to the WHO 
statistics, 6,324 diphtheria patients have been recorded in 18 
European countries over the first eight months of this year, 
with Russia and Ukraine accounting for 97 percent. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpt] Among the former USSR republics, Belarus ranks 
third in the number of people infected with venereal diseases 
and first in the number of those infected with AIDS. As of 20 
November 1993, Belarus has 100 AIDS-infected people and 70 
percent of them live in Minsk. Regarding the fact that the 
statistics depict only some 12 percent of those actually 
infected, you can easily calculate the real number of 
AIDS-infected people in Belarus. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Kirsten Sorrig: ``Revolution at National </F>
Hospital''] 
  [Text] Health: The National Hospital will be divided into 
nine centers. Of these, seven will function as minihospitals. 
The doctors are worried that specialties will be split up. And 
that everything is happening too quickly. 
  The National Hospital is standing before its greatest change 
ever. 
  Today the hospital administration is calling all section 
heads together to orient them on the thorough structural change 
that will be carried out during 1994. The main elements of the 
plan will be made public next week. 
  The National Hospital's 40 divisions will be put together in 
nine centers. Of these, seven will function as minihospitals, 
some with over 500 employees. The last two centers will, among 
other things, contain laboratories, pathology, and X ray. 
  The new plan is based on an analysis done in close 
cooperation with the consultant firm of McKinsey &amp; Co. The 
National Hospital's director, Christian Nissen, counts on having 
centers with new structures and new leadership established 
during 1994. One of the nine centers is already under way. This 
is the Heart Center, which was opened on a trial basis a year 
ago, and which will run completely according to the new method 
of operation by 1 January. 
  ``The patients will have a shorter waiting time, and the 
hospitalization procedure will go more smoothly,'' Nissen said. 
``They will meet fewer doctors and nurses, and the atmosphere 
will become that of a smaller hospital.'' 
<H5>  Divided Specialties </H5>
  Among the doctors there is worry that the thorough change 
will destroy the specialties. And that everything is being done 
too quickly. In the Specialist Division, where the doctors' 
further training is supervised, the developments are being 
watched closely. 
  ``We are not negative about the new organizational forms,'' 
the division chairman, senior Dr. Hans Karle of Herlev Hospital 
said. ``On the other hand we think that it would be wisest to 
analyze things thoroughly before entering into big changes. 
  ``The process that has been set in motion is motivated by 
desires for efficiency in administrative, operational, and 
service tasks. It is for research, development, and training. 
Here there are goals and intentions, but nothing concrete to 
hang them on yet.'' 
  In doctors' circles there is also doubt about how logical it 
is to redo the whole National Hospital according to the new 
model and whether in the end some segments will not benefit from 
the changes. 
  ``It is not wrong to start with the Heart Center, ''Hans 
Karle said.`` But I would have been hesitant to carry out the 
change completely before getting a lot of experience and having 
thoroughly analyzed whether one can both rationalize and at the 
same time assure the quality of training and research.''

<F P=106> [Article by Marianne Harbo: ``Danish Blood Preparations </F>
Checked''] 
  [Text] Donor blood: Even if there is no risk for Danish 
patients, the authorities are taking very seriously the matter 
of German blood that has not been HIV tested. 
  Danes must feel completely safe in the medicine they 
receive. 
  Therefore the Danish authorities will go through the 
country's hospitals and apothecaries with a fine-tooth comb 
looking for preparations of blood from the German blood bank UB 
Plasma Laboratory that have not been HIV tested. 
  Even if the preparations are in no case dangerous. 
<H5>  Every Detail </H5>
  ``We intend to show that we have examined every detail. 
Therefore we are checking to see whether any medical firms 
represented in Denmark can have bought blood products that have 
not been tested for the HIV virus,'' Eva Sandberg, a section 
head in the Health Department, said. 
  ``If there is, we will call the preparations back. We do not 
want to have any of that rubbish on the Danish market.'' 
  Sandberg stressed that as things stand now only blood that 
has been tested is used in Denmark. All imported blood is 
cleaned and heat treated--virus inactivated, as it is 
called--for example, 10 hours at 60 degrees centigrade. 
  ``The HIV virus is not very robust, so that a completely 
unimaginable concentration of the virus would be necessary for 
there to be a risk of any of it surviving,'' Sandberg said. 
  The Health Department has written to producers and importers 
of blood products in Denmark and asked them to answer as soon as 
possible whether they have used any of the ``risky'' deliverers. 
  Imported blood products are, for example, albumin, which is 
used for patients who have lost a great amount of blood, gamma 
globulin, which among other things is used to prevent liver 
infections, as well as factor products for bleeders. 
<H5>  Letter From Novo </H5>
  Among the large producers of blood preparations is 
Novo-Nordisk in Gentofte, which has already sent a letter of 
reply. Communications Chief Mike Rulis answers with a flat 
denial. 
  The largest of the rest of the producers is 
Seruminstituttet, 
and then come in random order Kabi Pharmacia, Beringvaerket, 
Sanders, and Immuno. 
  At Seruminstituttet only Director Leif Pallesen can reply. 
He 
could not be found this evening. 
<H5>  How Danish Blood Is Tested </H5>
  During the past eight years, all Danish blood has been 
screened, that is, tested for the AIDS virus and Hepatitis C and 
D. This is the way Danish blood is made safe: 
  1. Blood donors must be healthy and sound. They must not be 
taking medicine (birth control pills, headache pills, etc., are 
accepted). Homosexuals and drug addicts are rejected. After 
stays in areas of risk such as, for example, Africa, there is a 
period of quarantine. 
  2. All blood is tested for the AIDS virus (HIV), Hepatitis 
B, 
and Hepatitis C. 
  3. Blood for blood transfusions cannot tolerate heat 
treatment and is used directly, but is not mixed. Blood plasma 
for blood products (bleeder medicine, etc.) is mixed and treated 
thermally.

  [Text] The appearance of salmonella in slaughtered chickens 
has been rising lately, according to the Veterinary Directorate. 
Investigations show that in October there were salmonella 
problems in about 30 percent of the chicken stock. This is a 
rise from last year, in which there was only salmonella in about 
10 percent of the chickens. 
  The agricultural minister has called the situation 
unsatisfactory. It is far from the goal of bringing salmonella 
down to under 5 percent. 
  In the light of the discouraging results, the plan will be 
reviewed by the authorities in cooperation with the poultry 
branch with the intention of tightening things up. 
<H5>  More Will Be Vaccinated </H5>
  Thousand of small children have been vaccinated against 
meningitis since the offer of free vaccinations was made six 
months ago. Just the first two months after the beginning of the 
arrangement in May over 27,000 children were vaccinated with the 
so-called HIB vaccine, according to DET FRI AKTUELT Thursday [4 
November]. the vaccine protects against a type of 
life-threatening meningitis.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``Westh Upholds Salmonella Action </F>
Plan''--first paragraph is BERLINGSKE TIDENDE introduction] 
  [Text] Farmers and the Agriculture Ministry are still far 
apart on the salmonella problem. 
  At a meeting with the Danish Slaughterhouse Association on 
Friday [29 October] Agriculture Minister Bjorn Westh (Social 
Democrat) maintained that for the sake of consumers he will not 
relax the action plan to combat salmonella bacteria in pig herds 
and in processed products from slaughterhouses. 
  On the other hand the minister regards the slaughterhouse 
group's fear that up to one-fifth of the 1,500 medium-sized pig 
herds will come under public supervision by Christmas as greatly 
exaggerated. 
  Only five out of the 50 medium-sized herds in which analysis 
has been completed so far have such a high incidence of 
salmonella that they have come under supervision. This 
corresponds to 10 percent and not the 20 percent the swine 
sector fears might be the result of the action plan. 
  ``If the tendency holds expenses for the sector will be less 
than 150 million kroner,'' said the minister, referring to the 
slaughterhouse association's own estimate that the cost would be 
more than twice that amount. 
  After the meeting the chairman of the Danish Slaughterhouse 
Association, Bent Sloth, said he was glad that there is 
apparently less of a problem in herds than they had feared. But 
he stuck to his criticism of the action plan and expressed 
disappointment that the swine sector did not meet with the 
necessary sympathy from Westh. 
  But the group did get a number of concrete concessions from 
the meeting. The minister said among other things that he is 
prepared to discuss conditions for producers of small pigs, who 
have had problems with the plan, that it may be possible to 
reduce testing costs and that the authorities can help 
slaughterhouses find the most efficient methods of slaughtering 
salmonella-infected pigs. 
  ``I well understand that with swine prices at the current 
low 
level farmers find it almost unbearable to have this additional 
problem. But it is no use complaining, we must try to get 
through it,'' the minister said.

<F P=106> [Ritzaus Bureau report: ``Salmonella Thriving''] </F>
  [Text] There is far more salmonella in Danish processed 
pork products than in comparable Swedish products. 
  This can be seen from a comparison between the Agriculture 
Ministry's analysis of salmonella in processed products from 
slaughterhouses and the Danish Slaughterhouse Associations' own 
study of salmonella in Swedish pork. 
  The Nordic Council has set a limit of 5 percent on the 
content of salmonella in samples from slaughterhouses. At the 
annual meeting of the National Committee on Swine yesterday the 
chairman of the Danish Slaughterhouse Association, Bent Sloth, 
revealed that the Danish slaughterhouse average is 2.7 percent. 
  On Friday the slaughterhouse group will meet with 
Agriculture 
Minister Bjorn Westh (Social Democrat) to discuss an action plan 
to combat salmonella.

<F P=106> [Article by Annette Hagerup: ``Doctor Predicts Danish </F>
Measles Epidemic''--first paragraph is BERLINGSKE TIDENDE 
introduction] 
  [Text] Parents' fear of having their children vaccinated 
against measles, mumps, and rubella could result in a measles 
epidemic with the risk of serious complications. 
  The Serum Institute fears that we will have a new measles 
epidemic within the next few years. 
  The fear is due to the fact that requests for the MFR 
[measles, mumps, and rubella] vaccination dropped 10 percent 
this year. (This vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and 
German measles, ed.) 
  ``The public's support of MFR vaccinations is too low to 
enable us to stave off a measles epidemic in the long run,'' 
said Tove Ronne, chief physician at the State Serum Institute. 
  ``At present measles is generally not seen in Denmark. But 
at 
some point the disease will be introduced into the country 
again. And as by now quite a few children are not vaccinated 
against measles there will be fertile ground for an epidemic. A 
measles epidemic can occur only if there are enough unvaccinated 
children in a society who can infect each other and thus keep 
the epidemic going. 
  ``Today we have a large group of somewhat older children who 
have not been vaccinated. In the event of an epidemic these 
children run a bigger risk than they did before because the risk 
of complications increases with age,'' Ronne said.'' 
  Vaccinations for children is a service that is offered to 
parents. There is no charge and they are not compulsory. 
  ``The first MFR vaccination is given when a child is 15 
months old. So theoretically babies below that age risk being 
infected with measles if they are in day care centers with 
somewhat older unvaccinated children,'' Ronne said. 
  Inflammation of the brain is one of the serious 
complications 
of measles. 
  In Africa the disease is responsible for 5 percent of deaths 
among children.

<F P=106> [Ritzaus Bureau report: ``Sentenced for HIV Sex''] </F>
  [Text] A 34-year-old woman who is infected with HIV was 
sentenced to three months in jail yesterday in magistrate's 
court in Grenaa for having exposed a 32-year-old man to the risk 
of HIV infection by having intercourse without a condom. The 
case is fundamental as it is the first time in this country that 
an HIV-infected person has been sentenced for endangering 
someone through just one sexual episode without a condom. In 
August, Eastern Superior Court upheld a sentence handed down in 
Copenhagen Municipal Court in which a 35-year-old HIV-infected 
Haitian was sentenced to a year and a half in jail for having 
unprotected intercourse with 23 different women. In both 
convictions the HIV-infected person was sentenced for failing to 
disclose their HIV status and thus violating Paragraph 252 of 
the Penal Code concerning endangering the lives and health of 
others through gross wantonness or inconsiderateness. 
  In determining the penalty in the three-month jail sentence, 
consideration was given to the woman's situation and the fact 
that the 32-year-old had not been infected with HIV. 
  The woman immediately appealed the sentence to superior 
court.

<F P=106> [Ritzaus Bureau report: ``No Charges in Infection </F>
Case''--first paragraph is BERLINGSKE TIDENDE introduction] 
  [Text] The public prosecutor has decided that there is no 
evidence to support bringing charges in the case in which 89 
hemophiliacs were infected with HIV-tainted blood. 
  Copenhagen Public Prosecutor Hanne Bech Hansen has decided 
not to charge former Interior Minister Britta Schall Holberg, 
former chief medical officer and chief of the Public Health 
Administration Soren K. Sorensen, and Public Health 
Administration department chief Jens Overo in the case of 
HIV-tainted hemophiliac medication. 
  The public prosecutor found no evidence for bringing charges 
and this seems to exhaust the possibilities for the Danish 
Hemophiliac Society to hold anyone personally liable for the 
fact that 89 hemophiliacs were infected with HIV-tainted blood 
products in the mid-1980's. 
  The Hemophiliac Society called the public prosecutor's 
decision ``sad, unfortunate, and incomprehensible.'' 
  The society had reported the three for quackery, negligent 
manslaughter, and causing considerable damage to body and health. 
  ``In order to prove that anyone is criminally liable it must 
be possible to establish that the hemophiliacs referred to in 
the report were given the infected blood after the three people 
named there became aware of the risk. 
  ``There is no evidence in the case to establish this,'' the 
public prosecutor wrote the hemophiliac society in her decision. 
  ``This decision is sad in many ways. Partly because we will 
probably never be able to assign personal responsibility and 
partly because in the future these three people will now be able 
to state that they had no responsibility. This will evoke strong 
feelings among hemophiliacs,'' said the chairman of the Danish 
Hemophiliac Society, Terkel Andersen. 
  In her reasons for the rejection Hansen referred among other 
things to a judicial review of the case prepared by superior 
court judge Niels Johan Pedersen. But according to the 
hemophiliac society the review deals solely with the period 
after 1 January 1986, while the society's citation concerned the 
time before that. 
  ``The review is exclusively descriptive as far as the period 
before 1 January 1986 is concerned--it was not part of the 
judge's commission to express an opinion about the course of 
events prior to that date,'' Andersen said.

<F P=106> [Article by Keld Nissen: ``AIDS Information </F>
Scrutinized''--first paragraph is BERLINGSKE TIDENDE 
introduction] 
  [Text] Information about AIDS has come to a halt in 
Frederiksborg County, according to a former project staff 
member. The County Council Association will look into the 
situation in the other Danish counties. The Public Health 
Administration is preparing a new nationwide AIDS campaign. 
  The County Council Association will now look into whether 
counties are providing enough information about AIDS. This 
action is being taken following criticism of inadequate 
information efforts in Frederiksborg County. 
  After the short-term so-called CEN/LOK [central/local] 
campaign in the Danish counties ended, the work of informing the 
public about AIDS was supposed to be continued locally in an 
effort to change people's attitudes and sexual behavior in the 
long term. 
<H5>  No Overview </H5>
  Mayor Knud Andersen (Liberal) of Bornholm County, chairman 
of 
the County Council Association's hospital and health committee, 
has no overview of whether the long-term AIDS information work 
is functioning in the counties. 
  ``But I intend to look into how the campaign went and also 
suggest new measures from the central office if they are 
needed,'' he said. 
  The Public Health Administration is preparing a new campaign 
on HIV and AIDS for 1994. 
  After the Copenhagen area and Arhus County, Frederiksborg 
County is the area of the country that has the most registered 
patients with full-blown AIDS, currently 62. 
<H5>  Lack of Initiatives </H5>
  Despite this the county does not provide people with enough 
information about the disease, criticized Claus Krygell, who was 
coordinator of the county's CEN/LOK campaign from 1991 to 1992. 
  ``The short-term goals--to increase people's knowledge about 
the disease--was achieved to a large extent, but the county has 
had little to offer since the summer of 1992,'' Krygell said. 
  The chairman of the county's AIDS committee, medical officer 
Jens Steensberg, admits that information activity has declined 
somewhat. This is due to changes in the county's administration 
where AIDS information was not given top priority. 
  ``But if people from outside provide ideas for activities, 
funds are available for them,'' he said. 
  Tove Tougaard, office manager of the county social and 
health 
administration, expects activity to pick up in the fall and 
winter. The county is planning to distribute information and set 
up condom dispensers at senior high schools and vocational 
schools and is also planning activities for World AIDS Day, 1 
December. 
  In the first half of 1993 around 8,000 condoms were 
distributed in connection with information activity. 
  Bjorn Knudsen of the Public Health Administration's AIDS 
office is of the opinion that the level of county activity 
differs widely. 
  ``But it is natural to see a drop in activity after a 
campaign,'' he said.

  [Text] The incidence of measles is continuing to rise in 
some areas of the country despite an alert to parents to have 
their children vaccinated after an epidemic in Dublin earlier 
this year. 
  However, the overall number of cases reported to the 
Department of Health has fallen since the start of the summer. 
  So far this year, there have been 3,493 cases of measles 
reported countrywide compared to just 179 last year. 
  A major alert about the potentially serious disease was 
issued as the school year began last September and this 
triggered an increase in the number of parents having their 
children vaccinated. 
  Feedback from a number of health boards suggests supplies of 
the vaccine were in much greater demand than usual, but the fear 
is there will be a fall-off once the attention abates. 
  The North Western Health Board confirmed yesterday the 
number 
of cases reported there in the last couple of weeks had 
increased. 
  ``It is not an epidemic but there has been a definite rise 
in 
the level of cases of the disease,'' a spokesman said. 
  He said more than 100 cases were reported in the last four 
weeks in the Inishowen, Letterkenny and Fanad areas. 
  The spokesman again appealed to parents to have children 
over 
the age of 15 months vaccinated. They should also look out for 
symptoms of measles in their children and keep them at home from 
school because it was so infectious. 
  The vaccination rate in the North Western Health Board area 
is relatively high and is around 95pc in some regions.

  [Text] President Robinson yesterday called for more 
straight talking about AIDS to ensure that young people know how 
to protect themselves against it. 
  She expressed concern that young people from the West of 
Ireland who are thinking of emigrating do not have adequate 
information about the disease. 
  Latest figures show that AIDS has claimed the lives of 162 
Irish people, while more than 1,400 have tested HIV-positive. 
  On a visit to AIDS Health West in Galway, a voluntary 
organisation of which she is a patron, President Robinson said 
too many young people were leaving Mayo, Galway, Donegal and 
Sligo ``at risk of their lives'' because of ignorance.

  [Text] Gavle (TT)--Twar [as published] bacteria are found 
much more frequently among recruits in the I-14 [unit] in Gavle, 
ARBETARBLADET reports. 
  Doctors Hakan Gnarpe and Stefan Sterner in Gavle have 
studied 
the occurrence of twar bacteria, which was formerly linked to 
the odd deaths among those involved in cross-country 
orienteering among the recruits. 
  In 1990, 11 percent of the 506 recruits who were studied had 
antitwar antibodies in their bodies. This year antibodies were 
found in as many as half of those 394 who were studied. In 1991 
and 1992 no comparable studies were done, which is why a clear 
picture of how the increase is occurring cannot be drawn. 
  Gnarpe said that it is not a question of an epidemic within 
the I-14 unit alone. 
  Twar can lead to a number of different infections from head 
colds to lung inflammation and heart muscle inflammation. Twar 
bacteria have proven to be more common in the Gavle area and in 
Dalarna than elsewhere.

  [Text] In a few months, Swedish physicians will start 
testing a new drug against AIDS. The drug is called DNCB, and 
has been used for decades against warts. 
  ``People in San Francisco infected with the HIV virus have 
used DNCB on their own for years without any formal approval 
from the health care system,'' said Linda Morfeldt-Mansson, a 
physician at Danderyd Hospital, who specializes in infectious 
diseases, and who is a member of the network of Swedish HIV 
physicians. 
  ``Until now, the drug has only been the subject of a single 
study, which was conducted in the United States. This study, 
however, was based on such a narrow base that we hardly can draw 
any conclusions from it,'' she noted. 
  The Swedish study is supposed to include 200 HIV patients 
from all over Sweden. 
  ``We will also include a number of patients who are 
seriously 
ill and who are not expected to survive for very long with the 
use of normal treatment methods. They may also test DNCB if they 
so choose. It is for their sake that we are eager to start the 
treatment as soon as possible,'' said Linda Morfeldt-Mansson.

Flu Epidemic Say Doctors''] 
  [Text] Britain is facing its worst flu epidemic since 1989, 
the Royal College of General Practitioners said yesterday. 
  Dr Douglas Fleming, director of the College's monitoring 
unit, said 127 cases per 100,000 population had been reported 
this week, three times the normal rate. 
  However, the Government is seeking to play down fears of an 
epidemic and, with the A Beijing 92 flu strain 
sweeping southwards from Scotland, Dr Kenneth Calman, Chief 
Medical Officer, said vaccine would be available for all who 
need it. 
  The College's figures, based on findings at 92 ``spotter 
practices'' cross the country, suggest there were 65,000 new 
cases of flu reported this week. 
  ``I don't like to use the word epidemic because it can 
frighten people,'' Dr Fleming said. ``Although we are not in as 
bad a situation as 1989, I would say that we have an epidemic.'' 
  His figures show that flu reports have more than doubled in 
the Midlands and South in the past week and increased by more 
than 50 per cent in the North. 
  The Duchess of Kent was among the flu's latest victims 
yesterday, cancelling a prize-giving engagement in Clerkenwell, 
London. In Yeovil, a 35-bed orthopaedic ward at the district 
hospital had to be closed this week after patients and staff 
were struck down by the illness. 
  In Hampshire an infection control team was called in to the 
Botley Ward of Knowle hospital, where psychiatric patients were 
taken ill. 
  In 1989, when the infection rate reached 580 per 100,000, 
more than half a million cases were recorded in a week and 
between 20,000 and 25,000 died. 
  A spokesman for the Public Health Laboratory Service in 
Colindale, North London, said the latest version of Beijing flu, 
which was first identified last year, was not particularly 
severe, though it was classified as an ``A'' -- or more virulent 
-- strain. 
  The current strain is seen as a minor variation of previous 
versions. The latest vaccine is also considered capable of 
dealing with two other types of flu: A Singapore and 
B Panama. 
  General practitioners are expected to vaccinate those whose 
lives could be ``at risk'' from flu, though they do not receive 
a special payment. These include elderly people, diabetics, 
those with heart, kidney or lung disease and those whose immune 
systems are weak. 
  The Department of Health said that there is not a shortage 
of 
vaccine. A spokesman said that 4.3 million doses were available 
already, only 400,000 fewer than last year. 
  Another 460,000 doses are expected to be ready for 
distribution shortly, the spokesman added. 
  Dr Calman has also recommended that vaccine should be 
provided for residents of nursing homes, old people's homes and 
other long-stay facilities where flu can spread rapidly. 
  He said: ``It is not possible accurately to predict the 
impact of influenza at this time of the year, but it would be 
reasonable to expect rates of illness to increase over the next 
few weeks.'' 
  The Department of Health is expected to buy almost five 
million vaccine doses over the coming weeks from three suppliers. 
  The main symptoms of the new strain are the usual flu 
symptoms: fever, headache, aching limbs, coughing, sneezing and 
a runny nose.

<F P=106> [Article by Robin Gedye in Bonn and Peter Pallot: ``British </F>
Alert Over AIDS Scandal''] 
  [Text] Blood products made by a German firm at the centre 
of an Aids scare in Germany are being withdrawn by the 
Department of Health in London and several other countries took 
steps yesterday to impound the products. 
  The department announced that 126,000 units of blood 
products 
manufactured by UB Plasma, of Koblenz, had been bought by the 
National Health Service. 
  Last year Britain imported 120,000 doses of a product to 
boost immunity. Since 1989 the NHS has bought 6,000 doses of 
albumin, also made by UB Plasma, to treat severe blood loss. 
``Because of the length of time, it must be assumed that some of 
these batches have been used,'' a department spokesman said last 
night. 
  The other countries which have decided to withdraw suspect 
blood products are France, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, 
the Czech Republic and Greece. At the same time the Greek health 
ministry said it would take legal action against the German 
exporters of possibly untested plasma. 
  It is feared that suspect products may also have reached the 
Middle East. 
  Remaining stocks in Britain are being urgently recalled by 
Immono, an Austrian company which bought the consignment from 
Germany and exported it here, said the department spokesman. 
``However, we are absolutely sure that these stocks were 
batch-tested by the National Institute for Biological Standards, 
Testing and Control and there was no trace of HIV,'' he said. 
  The recall was ``purely precautionary and is to ensure total 
patient safety''. 
  Authorities are seeking to establish how many doses of the 
immunity booster Gammabulin have been used. People with impaired 
immune systems or those travelling abroad and at risk of 
hepatitis would have been among those intramuscularly injected. 
The other product -- Human Albumin Solution, 4.5 per cent -- 
would be used in any situation in which blood was lost in 
quantity, such as accidents, surgery or a complicated birth. The 
spokesman said: ``There is no evidence that HIV has been 
transmitted by these two products. We are self-sufficient in 
blood and plasma and we do import blood products which are 
licensed by the Medicines Control Agency.'' 
  Britain does not import blood -- only blood products. Since 
1985, when the risks of spreading HIV were realized, all blood 
factors have been heat-treated. 
  Mr David Blunkett, Shadow Health Secretary, urged the 
Government to make a clear statement to allay fears. 
  Dr Harold Gunson, director of the National Blood Authority, 
said: ``British patients can be reassured that this blood in 
England and Scotland is the safest that one can have in the 
world. 
  ``We have been fully testing all our blood since 1985 for 
HIV.'' 
  But he added: ``We do import some final purified plasma 
products.'' He did not know whether any had come from Germany. 
  British military authorities in Germany urged the small 
number of people treated in German hospitals in emergencies in 
the past 10 years to have themselves tested if they were 
worried. Pentagon officials issued similar instructions to US 
Servicemen in Germany. 
  In Germany, where blood donations are paid for and where a 
number of people connected with UB Plasma have been arrested, 
there is evidence that the health ministry is uncertain of the 
extent of the spread of suspect products. 
  When the scandal broke a month ago, the semi-autonomous 
Federal Health Agency was dissolved for failing to pursue 
evidence that UB Plasma had flooded the market with possibly 
untested blood products. Then on Thursday it was alleged that 
the firm had knowingly released ``slightly infected'' blood on 
to the market.

  At a national blood transfusion seminar which ended 
yesterday 
in Ouagadougou, Jean Gabriel Ouango, the permanent secretary of 
the National AIDS Control Committee, discussed the current 
national AIDS situation. Ouango stated that between 7 and 8 
percent of the population is seropositive, representing about 
450,000 persons. He said that in Ouagadougou alone there are 
about 5,000 persons testing seropositive, and added that very 
soon an anonymous AIDS screening center would become 
operational. (Ouagadougou Radiodiffusion Nationale du Burkina 
Faso in French 1300 GMT 25 Nov 93) 
<H5>  Ghana </H5>
  The minister of health, Commodore Obimpeh, announced that 
422 
cases of Buruli Ulcer Disease has been reported from five 
regions in the country. This was disclosed to parliament on 24 
November while he was brieing the house on the spread of the 
disease. He stated that, although the causative agent of the 
disease is known, the exact mode of transmssion is not known. 
He said that disease tracking efforts would be intensified to 
minimize the number of cases. (Accra Ghana Broadcasting 
Corporation Radio Network in English 0600 GMT 25 Nov 93) 
<H5>  Nigeria </H5>
  The UNICEF representative in Nigeria, Mr. (Kulio Waki), 
declared that Nigerian salt is sufficiently iodized. He made 
this remark in Abuja at the opening session of a two-day 
workshop on the eradication of iodine deficiency disorder. 
However, Mr. (Waki) said that Oyo, Ondo, Edo, Enugu, Benue, 
Cross River, and Plateau states were still risking iodine 
deficiency. He urged health workers and coordinators in the 
program in those states to carry out the distribution of iodine 
capsules effectively, so as to eliminate the dangers the disease 
poses to the population. The Abuja workshop is aimed at 
eradicating mental and physical deformities, as well as 
disabilities that affect human beings due to a lack of iodine in 
their bodies. (Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English 1500 GMT 
18 Nov 93) 
<H5>  Rwanda </H5>
  Jean-Baptiste Nubahumpatse reports that Burundian refugees 
in 
southern Rwanda and Bugesera still face untold suffering. 
Dysentery rages, while food and the infrastructures needed to 
meet their basic wants are lacking. Here is his report: 
[Nubahumpatse] About 20 people die every day in the 
Burundian refugee camps. That is at least what transpires from 
testimonies from charitable relief organizations operating in 
the region such as the Belgian Red Cross and French Medecins 
Sans Frontieres who particularly deal with health problems. The 
Burundian refugees are thus hard hit by dysentery, diarrhea, 
measles, and other diseases. The grave overpopulation in the 
camps, which has caused unbearable congestion, remains the 
greatest handicap to the smooth running of relief operations. 
The UNHCR, in cooperation with the Ministry of Works and Social 
Affairs as well as local authorities, are currently at work to 
try and solve the problem. In addition, particularly due to 
this overpopulation in the camps, Burundian refugees rightly or 
wrongly complain of a lack of adequate food rations. That is 
the reason why some of them take risks by venturing across the 
border to Burundi to try and get extra food. They are welcomed 
by deadly bullets fired by permanently vigilant Burundian 
soldiers, irrefutable proof of the continuing killings deep 
inside Burundi. (Kigali Radiodiffusion Nationale de la 
Republique Rwandaise in French 0430 GMT 19 Nov 93) 
<H5>  Uganda </H5>
  There has been an outbreak of dysentery in Kisoro District 
in 
which 12 people are recorded dead. Seven out of the 12 dead 
died at Mutolere and Kisoro Hospitals while five died at their 
homes. The scourge started in (Murora) sub-county and later 
spread to some other parts and has now covered almost half the 
district, the most hit areas being those along the Uganda-Rwanda 
border. Other affected areas include (Ruaramba), (Chihe), 
(Gisorora) and Muganza, being parishes which harbor the influx 
of refugees fleeing the war. (Kampala Radio Uganda Network in 
English 0400 GMT 24 Nov 93) 
<H5>  Zaire </H5>
  There has been an outbreak of dysentery at Lodja lately, 
spreading to Lomela and other areas. About 80 deaths have been 
reported. The worst-hit areas include Djinga and Gombela. The 
government has appealed for urgent assistance from international 
aid agencies (Kinshasa Tele-Zaire Television Network in French 
1900 GMT 23 Nov 93)

coverage areas. Source information is given in parentheses after 
each item. 
<H5>  Benin </H5>
  Our country joined the international community on 1 December 
to observe World AIDS Day. According to the National AIDS 
Control Program coordinator, from 1985, when the first cases 
were diagnosed, to date, there have been 566 AIDS cases. In 
1992, there were 218 cases; and for the first six months of this 
year, 101 new AIDS cases have been registered. Following a 
survey, the number of seropositives is estimated at 400,000. 
(Cotonou Office de Radiodiffusion-Television du Benin Radio in 
French 1930 GMT 1 December 93) 
<H5>  Congo </H5>
  Health Minster Jean Ekoundzola issued a message in 
Brazzaville to mark World AIDS Day. The minister stated that an 
estimated 19,000 AIDS cases and 100,000 cases of HIV-infected 
persons have been reported in the Congo. The minister said that 
in Brazzaville, one out of three adult deaths was due to AIDS. 
He also stated that 7 percent of pregnant women have Human 
Immuno Deficiency Virus, which causes the disease. The minister 
stated that one out of three of these women would transmit the 
disease to their babies. (Dakar PANA in English 1143 GMT 1 Dec 
93) 
  Schistosomiasis, a disease characterized by itching and 
blood 
in the urine, is reappearing in the Niari area. According to 
the head of the schistosomiasis unit, although the disease is on 
the decline, some cases can still be found mainly in three 
primary schools of the area where the incidence varies between 6 
and 7 percent -- based on a survey conducted in 1991. Due to 
disturbances in the country, figures for the 1992-1993 period 
are not yet available. In Kiniati, out of a population of 365 
inhabitants, the incidence was about 65 percent in 1991. In 
1992, this figure had decreased: Out of 225 people examined, 52 
cases were diagnosed. (Brazzaville Radio Nationale Congolaise 
Network in French 1830 GMT 4 December 93) 
<H5>  Cote D'Ivoire </H5>
  The coordinator of the National AIDS Control Program, who 
was 
invited to the studio on 1 December on the occasion of the World 
AIDS Day, revealed that the incidence of AIDS in the country 
today is estimated at 10 percent of the population. This does 
not, however, mean that one Ivorian out of 10 is seropositive. 
For the sexually active adult population aged between 15 to 49 
years old, the incidence is around 9.8 percent. The coordinator 
also said that the AIDS education campaign in the country is 
making some progress because now 10 percent of the population 
aged between 15 to 49 years old say that they regularly use 
condoms during casual sexual encounters. In 1988 this figure 
was around 2 percent. In addition, more than 80 to 90 percent 
of ceremonies involving or held by the youth carry messages on 
AIDS. Local, departmental, and regional committees on AIDS and 
other sexually transmitted diseases, as well as national 
nongovernmental organizations, have been established throughout 
the country. (Abidjan La Chaine Une Television Network in 
French 2000 GMT 1 December 93) 
<H5>  Ghana </H5>
  The Ashanti Region now tops the list of AIDS cases in the 
country. A total of 3,515 cases of the disease were recorded 
between 1989 and 1993. This figure represents 31.8 percent of 
the total of 11,044 cases recorded throughout the country. The 
district pharmacist in charge of Kwabre, Mr. Kofi Baye, 
announced this when he launched the district AIDS Awareness Day 
at Nkosu. Mr. Baye said that as part of measures to check the 
menace, health authorities in the district have trained 30 
people to mount educational programs to complement efforts of 
health personnel. The Kwabre district secretary called on 
churches, youth associations, and unit committees to help fight 
the AIDS menace in the district, which now has a record 27 
cases. (Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in 
English 2000 GMT 30 November 93) 
<H5>  Niger </H5>
  Niger joined the rest of the international community to 
observe the Sixth World AIDS Day on 1 December. As of 30 
November, there were 992 declared AIDS cases in the country. 
According to the national director of the Niger AIDS Control 
Program, for the first six months of this year, 183 cases were 
recorded. A look at figures for previous years shows that 
full-blown AIDS cases have increased, which also implies an 
increase in the number of seropositives. The most affected 
target-population is prostitutes and truck drivers. Among 
prostitutes in Niamey, the infection rate rose from less than 9 
percent last year to 15.30 percent this year. For truck 
drivers, the rate is 3 percent. (Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in 
French 1200 GMT 1 December 93) 
<H5>  Nigeria </H5>
  Nigeria joined the world community on 1 December to 
celebrate 
World AIDS Day. The director general of the Ministry of Health 
and Human Services, addressing newsmen in Lagos, disclosed that 
the number of people who have tested HIV-positive in the country 
stands at about 50,000 to 100,000. As of November this year, 
there were 952 AIDS cases out of which 100 patients have died. 
(Lagos Voice of Nigeria in English 1030 GMT 2 December 93) 
  It was reported in Makurdi by the Benue director general in 
charge of health and human services, Moses Ugye, that a total of 
644 of about 6,600 blood samples from donors screened at the 
general hospital in Makurdi between August 1989 and October of 
1993 were found to test positive for Human Immuno Deficiency 
Virus (HIV), which causes AIDS. The director general stated 
that 44 of these samples were confirmed to be full-blown cases 
of AIDS. 
  The medical superintendent at Makurdi General Hospital, Dr. 
Sylvester Ogiri, disclosed that 15 AIDS patients were admitted 
and later discharged at the hospital this year at their own 
request. Dr. Ogiri said that before their voluntary departure, 
the AIDS victims were given proper counselling in a bid to 
discourage them from spreading the disease. (Dakar PANA in 
English 1651 GMT 3 Dec 93) 
  In Benue State, out of the 6,550 blood samples screened for 
the AIDS virus, 644 tested positive. The director general in 
charge of the Ministry of Health, who disclosed this, also 
confirmed that 44 of the blood samples carried the AIDS virus. 
The medical superintendent of the Makurdi General Hospital 
revealed that the hospital had admitted 15 AIDS patients this 
year. (Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English 1500 GMT 3 
December 93) 
<H5>  Zaire </H5>
  Zaire joined the international community on 1 December to 
observe World AIDS Day. With a little more than 21,000 AIDS 
cases recorded to date and close to 2 million seropositives, 
Zaire is one of the worst hit countries in the world -- 
accounting for 3 percent of total world AIDS cases. The 
suspension of cooperation between Zaire and its leading foreign 
partners has had serious effects on the spread of the disease in 
the country. In order to prevent the disaster that could result 
from the blocking of external resources, the National AIDS 
Control Program has decided to set up a special AIDS fund.

<H5>  Botswana </H5>
  HIV -- ``The permanent secretary to the president, Mr. 
Elijah 
Legwaila, says the recent research by the AIDS and Sexually 
Transmitted Diseases Unit of the Ministry of Health estimates 
about 92,000 people as being infected with HIV in Botswana.'' 
(Gaborone Radio Botswana Network in English 1610 GMT 15 Nov 93) 
<H5>  Lesotho </H5>
  AIDS -- ``The AIDS program manager in the Ministry of Health 
says there are 297 cases of AIDS in Lesotho. She, however, said 
this number does not reflect the exact figure of people with 
AIDS infection because many victims have not been medically 
examined.'' (Maseru Radio Lesotho in Eng 1130 GMT 17 Nov 93) 
<H5>  Mozambique </H5>
  HIV -- ``Sofala Province reported 80 HIV cases between 1986 
and March 1993. Dr. Inacio Barreto, provincial supervisor for 
AIDS, says the figure could be inaccurate due insufficient means 
of monitoring the spread of the virus.'' (Maputo Radio 
Mozambique Network in Portuguese 1400 GMT 17 Nov 93) 
<H5>  Namibia </H5>
  Polio -- The Ministry of Health and Social Service on 12 
November announced that ``a polio epidemic had broken out in 
Namibia, following eleven cases of Polio Myelitis reported to 
the Katutura Hospital.'' The 11 victims are children from 2 to 
4 years of age. They come from the Windhoek suburbs of 
Okuryangava, Wana-heda, Katutura, and Hochland Park, and from as 
far away as Keetmanshoop, Bethanie, Mariental, and Kalkrand. 
Five cases have been confirmed as having been caused by Polio 
type 1 wild strain virus,'' which ``descended from the West 
African Polio virus strain'' and was responsible for a polio 
outbreak in Nambibia in 1988. 
<H5>  South Africa </H5>
  Anthrax -- At least 150 buck and 60 hippos have died of 
anthrax in the Kruger National Park in the past two months. The 
disease broke out in the Orpen Gate area and spread north and 
eastward. (Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network English 1100 
GMT 16 Nov 93) 
  Typhoid -- ``At least four patients suffering from typhoid 
have been admitted to the Rietfontein Hospital'' near 
Johannesburg, and there are unconfirmed reports of 10 cases of 
typhoid in Delmas Hospital, about 50 km east of Johannesburg. 
(Johannesburg SAPA in English 0658 GMT 19 Nov 93) 
<H5>  Zimbabwe </H5>
  Dysentery -- Health Minister Timothy Stamps said that there 
had been an outbreak of a ``usually mild and short-lived'' form 
of dysentery in Mutare and Mashonaland East and Central. He 
also warned of ``a fatal and mysterious disease, 
entero-haemorragic E.coli,'' which had been reported in Masvingo 
and Manicaland South. He did not say how many cases of either 
disease had been reported. (Harare THE HERALD in English 8 Nov 
93 p 3) 
  AIDS -- Conservative estimates say the number of children 
orphaned by AIDS in Zimbabwe will reach 600,000 within the next 
6 years, a senior government official revealed at the start of a 
conference on AIDS orphans on Wednesday. (Johannesburg SAPA in

<H5>  Angola </H5>
  AIDS -- More than 600 AIDS cases have been reported in 
Angola 
since 1985. Deputy Health Minister Francisco Mendes has 
revealed that the people most affected by the disease of the 
century are between 20 and 30 years old. (Maputo Radio

  Tropical Neuropathy -- ``More than 300 cases of tropical 
neuropathy were recently reported in Mongincual District, 
Nampula Province.'' (Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in 
Portuguese 1730 GMT 27 Nov 93) 
NAMIBIA 
  Polio -- A minor outbreak of polio has occurred in Namibia 
with eight confirmed cases of the disease, currently restricted 
to the southern half of the country, the South African National 
Health Department said on 24 November. It said South Africans 
travelling to Namibia were advised to ensure polio immunisation 
of children under five years was up to date. The Namibian 
Health Ministry had launched a mass immunisation campaign to 
halt the spread of polio, an infectious viral disease which can 
result in paralysis of groups of muscles. The last polio 
epidemic in South Africa occurred in 1988 in Natal/kwaZulu, with 
the last case reported in 1990. (Johannesburg SAPA in English 
1410 GMT 24 Nov 93) 
<H5>  South Africa </H5>
  Typhoid -- An outbreak of typhoid fever has caused a health 
scare in the Botileng township outside Delmas. Since Friday, 
nearly 500 people with symptoms of the deadly disease have been 
treated. Although it is still not known whether all the cases 
are typhoid-related, 21 patients have been tested positive for 
the disease. All the people treated have shown tell-tale 
symptoms of the disease, which include severe headaches, stomach 
cramps, vomiting, and dehydration. The Delmas town council was 
unable to treat the large number of patients in local hospitals, 
so the South African Defense Force was called in. A make-shift 
hospital was equipped in an old hangar near the township. 
Between 300 and 350 people have since been transferred to 
hospitals in the Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging area, some 
as far afield as Hillbrow. No deaths related to the disease 
have been confirmed. (Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network in English 
1600 GMT 22 Nov 93) 
  Further on Typhoid -- The toll in the Delmas typhoid 
epidemic 
has risen to six, while 307 people arer still being treated in 
hospital, the Transvaal Provincial Administration said on 
Friday. A sixth person died of the disease on Thursday night. 
One of the new admissions to the Far East Rand Hospital was a 
white angler from Springs, who had been fishing in the Delmas 
area, the statement said. The source of infection was still not 
known. The statement stressed that all people visiting the 
Delmas district were entering a ``high risk area'' and that it 
was important to take sufficient precautionary measures. A 
total of 177 patients were still being treated in provincial 
hospitals, 123 in the field hospital, four in the Heidelberg 
hospital and three in the Boksburg-Benoni hospital. A joint 
epidemiological survey by the Universities of Pretoria and the 
Witwatersrand commenced on Thursday. (Johannesburg SAPA in

  HIV -- The Ministry of Health has disclosed 31,900 people 
have the AIDS virus (HIV). This year 319 are reported to be 
already suffering from AIDS. As of March 1993 there were 261 
full blown cases. From then to June, 24 more cases were 
reported bringing the figure to 285. From June to September the 
figure surged by 34 cases bringing the total figure to 319. 
Most cases recorded fall between the ages 15-49. (Mbabane THE

  [Text] ``What amazed me in Somalia was the UN tactics. It 
was so hopeless, it didn't lead anywhere. At an earlier stage, 
even before the summer, the UN should have learned from what had 
happened and tried to change the course of events, either by 
reaching a political settlement with the clan leader, Aidid, or 
by increasing military presence in order to clean up Mogadishu.'' 
  This was the opinion expressed by the physician, Johan 
Dalen, 
44, who recently returned to Sweden after having worked for a 
few weeks at the Swedish field hospital in Somalia. 
  ``My strongest impression from Somalia, and the one it is 
the 
hardest to forget, is of the injured children; children who had 
been shot in the head, or who had had both legs amputated. As a 
surgeon, one wants to perform surgery, and that one really gets 
to do in Somalia,'' said Dalen quietly. 
<H5>  Curfew </H5>
  Johan Dalen has previously worked in Cyprus, Lebanon, and 
Cambodia, through the UN and the Red Cross. 
  ``In Somalia I have seen how much can be done with limited 
resources,'' he said. 
  There is still unrest in the capital, Mogadishu, but in 
rural 
areas, the famine is, in essence, eliminated. Food supply and 
the purely military aspects of the operation do work. But in 
Mogadishu, where gangs of thugs roam the streets at night, the 
curfew is still in effect after 1800. 
  The hospital, which employs 150 Swedes, is located in the 
same area as the old university and the U.S. Embassy. The Swedes 
are taking care of 20,000 UN soldiers. 
  In the immediate vicinity of the hospital, 5,000 U.S. 
soldiers are stationed, and consequently the area is often 
subject to grenade attacks. 
  ``No, I was not afraid. When one lives in the middle of a 
conflict, it becomes part of everyday life, and as we were not 
the primary target for the grenades, it was not that 
dangerous,'' said Dalen. 
<H5>  Strict Orders </H5>
  The people working at the field hospital have received 
strict 
orders not to leave the area without taking precautions. The 
hospital staff members wear helmets, submachine guns, and 
bulletproof vests, and travel to and from the airport in armed 
convoys. The vehicles are equipped with Swedish and Red Cross 
flags to indicate that they are not Americans. And to protect 
themselves against shrapnel, most people stay inside as much as 
possible. Even women receive training at UN courses in the use 
of weapons.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``Disagreement About Field Hospital </F>
in Somalia''] 
  [Text] A battle seems to be brewing within the 
administration regarding the UN's request for the Swedish field 
hospital to stay in the Somalian capital of Mogadishu. Foreign 
Aid Minister Alf Svensson (Christian Democratic Coalition) tells 
TT [Press Wire Service] that the decision to bring it home at 
the end of the year remains in effect. Defense Minister Anders 
Bjorck also wants to bring the field hospital home. 
  ``If the decision is no, we will protest,'' says Lars 
Leijonborg of the Liberal Party. 
  ``This is a matter that must be coordinated; it is not 
appropriate for Svensson himself to send a no to New York,'' in 
Leijonborg's opinion. He adds that the matter has not arrived at 
the cabinet's coordination office. 
  He says that he has the full support of the Liberal Party, 
including the cabinet members, in demanding that the Swedish 
equipment and, preferably, the personnel as well should remain. 
  According to the foreign aid minister, the decision to bring 
the field hospital home is firm. 
  ``If some party brings up the matter in the government we 
will have a reason to reexamine this. But so far Leijonborg has 
only asked a question and Bengt Westerberg (Liberal leader and 
social affairs minister) has asked for foundation material,'' 
says Svensson. 
  The foreign aid minister thinks that the tens of millions of 
kronor which the field hospital in Mogadishu costs would be put 
to better use by reinforcing equipment at other hospitals in the 
region for the same amount. 
  Leijonborg says that there is also another aspect to the 
question: 
  ``UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is trying to get 
the United States to fulfill its commitment in Somalia. So 
Sweden should not try to avoid it.''

Natal''] 
  [Text] DURBAN--The South African Defence Force 
[SADF] is stepping up its Aids awareness campaign among Zululand 
troops amid fears that the disease is rapidly spreading south 
from Mozambique. 
  In a recent screening of 600 applicants to the Kwazulu 
Police 
in Empangeni, A Durban laboratory tested 54 as HIV positive. 
  A doctor involved in the testing estimated that the number 
of 
people infected with the virus would increase the closer one 
came to the Mozambique border. 
  A doctor working at a clinic in Zululand said one in three 
of 
the soldiers he treated for sexually transmitted diseases was 
HIV positive. 
  ``It is horrific what is really happening and the government 
is not prepared to discuss the problem,'' the doctor said. 
  He estimated that 8 percent of the population in the 
Matubatuba area, mainly those in 18 to 28 age groups, was HIV 
positive and this was developing into ``a massive problem''. 
  The SADF Medical Service has stepped up its Aids awareness 
campaign, which began in 1988. 
  Medical staff director of the SADF Medical Service, Ken 
Ingham, was reluctant to give exact figures of HIV positive 
cases in affected units in Zululand, but said they were not as 
high as those in the surrounding population. 
  Brigadier Ingham said soldiers had limited access to the 
public, usually only on weekend passes, and this was why the 
number of HIV soldiers was lower than in the surrounding 
population. 
  ``That's because soldiers get AIDS from civilians, not from 
other soldiers,''Brigadier Ingham said. 
  He said the campaign was working better in the army than in 
the community because ``no-one can force members of the public 
to listen'' 
  Northern Zululand is recognised by Aids researchers as ``One 
of the worst areas in the country'' and the HIV virus is 
spreading rapidly. Doctors say there is a lot of cross-border 
movement between South Africa and Mozambique and the virus is 
being brought south.

  [Text] Johannesburg Nov 23 SAPA -- More than 1,000 
suspected cases of typhoid have been reported from the Delmas 
area in the eastern Transvaal. And more patients are arriving 
continuously at an emergency field hospital in the area, while 
others are being transferred to hospitals in the 
Pretoria/Witwatersrand/Vereeniging region and Garankuwa. 
  So far one death has been confirmed, that of Marinda Zulu, 
23, who died in the Delmas Hospital on Tuesday morning. She 
first felt the symptoms three days ago but went to the field 
hospital only on Monday. She was transferred to Delmas Hospital 
on Monday afternoon and died early on Tuesday. Another woman 
and a primary school pupil had also died, but it had not been 
confirmed they died of typhoid. 
  Brig Louis du Preez, the officer commanding the field 
hospital on Tuesday said: ``I don't see it subsiding for at 
least the next week since the disease has an incubation period 
of seven to 14 days.'' 
  The Delmas Town Council set up the emergency hospital at the 
local airport by Saturday morning to deal with the influx of 
people from Botleng township who could not be accommodated in 
nearby hospitals. At least 50 SA [South African] Defence Force 
medical corps personnel are working around the clock treating 
patients at the field hospital. One of the doctors contracted 
the disease and was evacuated to one military hospital in 
Voortrekkerhoogte, Pretoria, on Monday morning. 
  Brig du Preez confirmed there were more than 1,000 cases of 
suspected typhoid, including those that had been sent to other 
hospitals. Nearly 150 people were admitted to the field 
hospital on Monday, although more than 40 were discharged by the 
end of the day and a further 50 on Tuesday morning, with tablets 
for them to continue treatment. 
  Brig du Preez said 21 cases of typhoid had been confirmed so 
far, but added that since test results took 72 hours to be 
determined, the figure was certain to rise dramatically. 
Ambulances would continue transporting people from Botleng to 
the nearby hospital. Loudspeakers were being used to urge all 
those with diarrhea to report to the hospital, Brig du Preez 
said. 
  According to Acting Town Clerk Henre de Hart, older people 
and children were more susceptible to the highly contagious 
disease, which is spread through body fluids and contaminated 
food. 
  Delmas Management Committee Chairman David Swanepoel said 
water had been tested weekly in the past, but was now being 
analysed daily. 
  Most cases had come from the Mandela View squatter camp on 
the outskirts of Botleng, although the syringe needles stuck in 
a map to indicate the origin of each case, clearly showed the 
disease had struck the entire township. 
  Mr de Hart said the causes were unhealthy living conditions, 
which were being addressed by a R[rand]6.9 million grant for the 
development of 2,700 new stands.

  [Text] Beijing, November 30 (XINHUA) -- China now has 1,159 
reported cases of AIDS infection and the virus carriers, a 
health official said here today. 
  Of the 1,159 cases, 211 are foreigners and Overseas Chinese 
and 948 are Chinese. China has found 19 aids victims, 14 of 
whom have died. 
  Most of the HIV/AIDS carriers in China are drug abusers or 
returnees from abroad, said the official. 
  On the eve of ``World AIDS Day'', a national association of 
sexually transmitted disease (STD) and AIDS control and 
prevention was set up here. 
  Addressing the inaugural meeting of the association, Chen 
Minzhang, minister of public health, said that the association 
will help the government organize figures from various circles 
to take part in STD and AIDS prevention activities. Meanwhile, 
it will focus on health education, information exchange and 
international cooperation on STD and AIDS control. 
  According to Chen, the Chinese Government has always 
attached 
importance to preventing and controlling the spread of STD and 
AIDS. It has passed laws and regulations on prevention of AIDS 
and STD, which have promoted the management, research, 
surveillance and treatment of such diseases. 
  However, STD and AIDS epidemic areas are still expanding in 
China. ``We lack publication and comprehensive management 
measures on STD and AIDS prevention,'' said Chen. 
  He urged government departments at all levels and 
communities 
all over the country to undertake commitments in STD and AIDS 
prevention and control. Meanwhile, he called for more 
cooperation on AIDS control among different departments in the 
country.

  [Excerpt] Beijing, December 1 (XINHUA) -- China will 
further strengthen its education on AIDS prevention and control, 
said an official from the Ministry of Public Health. 
  Addressing a meeting held here today to mark ``World AIDS 
Day'', Yin Dakui, vice-minister of public health, said that 
publication and education on AIDS prevention must be emphasized 
in the country. 
  ``It is very important for Chinese to raise their awareness 
of AIDS to fight against the killer disease,'' he said. 
  Chinese medical specialists attending the meeting believe 
that China is one of the countries least affected by AIDS. 
However, they said they thought that many Chinese still lack 
knowledge on AIDS prevention. [passage omitted] 
  In Asia, there are about 1 million cases of AIDS infection 
HIV carriers. Of the 1,159 confirmed carriers in China, 19 have 
shown symptoms of the disease.

  [Text] Beijing, December 1 (CNS)--A projection by the 
central authorities indicates that by the year 2000, China will 
probably have a total of 100,000 AIDS-infected cases with people 
suffering from full-blown AIDS are put at 20,000, the Vice 
Minister of Public Health, Mr. Yin Dakui, said today. 
  China has so far been seen as having fewer cases of AIDS 
infection. By late last month, 22 provinces, autonomous regions 
and municipalities had reported a total of 1,159 cases showing 
positive in AIDS tests while the number of full-blown AIDS cases 
was 19. 
  Mr. Yin said that the figures had come only from a sample 
survey of 2.3 million people and the actual number of cases with 
the infection was far greater than that, being estimated at 
5,000 to 10,000. 
  Speaking at a function today for World AIDS Day, Mr. Yin 
said 
that should resolute measures to prevent AIDS not be adopted, 
China would become a country with a high AIDS rate by the turn 
of the century. 
  A research office under the State Council and public health 
departments as well as health experts joined hands early this 
year to study the risk of AIDS facing the country. Experts have 
estimated that the fatal disease has caused economic loss of at 
least between RMB 540 million [renminbi] and RMB 1.3 billion 
while the greater loss incurred was put at between RMB 790 
million and RMB 1.87 billion, dealing a serious blow to 
families, society and the national economy. 
  The Ministry of Public health and the World health 
Organization have recently made joint efforts in helping China 
in its preventative work against AIDS. Such work undertaken 
next year will centre on publicity regarding AIDS prevention as 
well as on active measures to deal with it. 
  Awards have been won for a number of outstanding publicity 
items on AIDS. The president of an AIDS-prevention association, 
Mr. Qian Xinzhong, said that while China still has comparatively 
few cases of AIDS, the authorities should lose no time in 
promoting education on the disease and prevent it from spreading 
while at the same time helping people to overcome unnecessary 
fears regarding AIDS.

end of September 1993.'' He explained the state government is 
giving priority to AIDS prevention works, and wide-scale plans 
have been drawn up to combat AIDS, which has been noted as the 
third priority health problem of the country in the work 
projects of the 1993-96 National Health Program. Finally, the 
minister noted that AIDS prevention and suppression central 
committee and other committees at the various state and 
divisional levels and township levels were also formed to 
effectively perform AIDS prevention and suppression activities 
on a wider scale.

  [Excerpts] Thailand will have 20,000 to 30,000 AIDS 
patients a year if the disease is not controlled, Public Health 
Minister Athit Urairat warned yesterday. 
  Dr Arthit said the ministry's epidemiology and AIDS 
divisions 
estimated that AIDS patients would increase from 16,250 in 1993 
to 31,500 cases a year in 2000. 
  ``We can't ignore the AIDS problem any more. It is time to 
collect state and private resources to control the spread of the 
disease,'' Dr Athit said. 
  He said the Government had a clear policy on AIDS and would 
do everything to prevent and control the problem. [passage 
omitted] 
  The minister vowed that the ministry would develop and 
expand 
its services to cope with the problem and would provide equal 
opportunities for use of public health services. 
  To mark World AIDS Day, the ministry yesterday organized 
campaigns to fight AIDS in all provinces. [passage omitted] 
  The country has 3,769 reported cases of AIDS and 2,727 
reported AlDS-related cases (ARC), Dr. Athit said. 
  Chiang Rai, Bangkok, Chiang Mai Lampang and Phayao are the 
provinces with the highest number of reported AIDS cases. 
  Dr Athit said surveys conducted every six months since 1989 
showed the rate of increase among individual drug users group 
(IVDU) was constant at 35.21 per cent, whereas that of the sex 
workers group had increased from 23.8 per cent to 28.67 per cent. 
  He said the statistics also showed an increase in pregnant 
women with AIDS from one per cent to 1.39 per cent. [passge

  [Text] Ruse -- If a few more cases are registered, the 
health authorities will announce a syphilis epidemic. So far, 
the number of cases has reached 105, which is about one-seventh 
of the total number of registered syphilis cases in the country. 
Of these, 78 persons attending the outpatients department for 
skin and venereal diseases are residents from the town of Ruse. 
  The figures show that 52 of the patients are unemployed, 
while 11 are women who are suspected of practicing the world's 
oldest profession. The patients vary in age from 11 to 80 
years. Despite the fact that a regional office for combating 
venereal diseases was set up at the end of October with the help 
of the local administration, specialist doctors, and police 
officers, the problem continues to arouse worry and evidently 
requires a different approach.

  [Text] Sofia, December 1 (BTA) -- The Sofia Inspectorate 
of Hygiene and Epidemiology will distribute over 2,000 condoms 
today, December 1, marked as World AIDS Day. The condoms will 
be handed out together with leaflets on AIDS hazards. 
  A round-table discussion on the problems of HIV carriers and 
their families is due to start next Tuesday. The experts will 
also discuss the risks to which medics are exposed. 
  There are 121 registered HIV carriers in Bulgaria. The 
danger of the transmission of the infection through blood 
transfusion has been eliminated, according to experts of the 
central AIDS laboratory in Sofia. Only ten people have 
contracted the disease through homosexual contacts since AIDS 
tests were introduced. Heterosexual contacts remain the 
principal way of contracting AIDS and this is an alarming fact, 
physicians say. Eleven children were born to infected mothers, 
and one of them is definitively diagnosed as infected. 
  The import of AZT, the only existing medicine for AIDS, is 
expensive and often unobtainable. [sentence as received]

acceptable mechanism to achieve the goal of nonproliferation in 
South Asia. 
  A Foreign Office spokesman, answering a question about the 
foreign secretary's visit to Japan and his talks in Tokyo with 
Japanese officials, said that Japan has shown interest in 
participating in a regional conference on nuclear 
nonproliferation. The conference was proposed by Pakistan. He 
said the foreign secretary attended the sixth session of the 
Pakistan-Japan Joint Commission and held talks on bilateral and 
economic relations. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] 
and arms control issues were also discussed. The spokesman said 
Pakistan reaffirmed its stance that it is ready to ratify the 
NPT, provided that India is willing to do so simultaneously.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>
  [Text] Geneva November 30 TASS -- Reservations made by the 
Ukrainian Parliament when ratifying the START I Treaty hit a 
blow on the current regime of nonproliferation of nuclear arms, 
Russian permanent representative to the U.N. conference on 
disarmament Grigory Berdennikov told a news conference here 
today. 
  In fact, there was no ratification, as major components of 
the START I Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol and a major 
instrument of their implementation were removed, he said. 
  For instance, the Ukrainian Parliament excluded Article 5 of 
the Lisbon Protocol. The article ensures Kiev's joining of the 
treaty on nonproliferation of nuclear arms as a non-nuclear 
state. What is especially dangerous is that it happened on the 
eve of a conference on open-ended prolongation of the Treaty 
scheduled for 1995. Ukraine has actually proclaimed itself the 
sixth nuclear power. 
  In the words of Berdennikov, Kiev has also violated the 
agreement signed in early September in Massandra, the Crimea, by 
the Ukrainian and Russian Government heads to ensure the 
withdrawal of all strategic nuclear arms to the Russian 
Federation for further dismantling. 
  The Russian representative called attention to the danger 
posed by nuclear warheads on Ukrainian territory which are no 
longer maintained by Russian specialists. Only Russian 
specialists can efficiently maintain the warheads and the 
missiles. Thus, all the responsibility for the state of nuclear 
arms rests on Ukraine. 
  The Ukrainian Parliament resolution is not only the issue of 
Ukrainian-Russian relations, stressed Berdennikov. It also 
concerns other nuclear states, depositaries of the treaty on 
nonproliferation and the whole international community. 
  No doubt, neither the START I nor the START II Treaties can 
enter into force due to the Ukrainian steps. Berdennikov said 
they would like to convey Russian concern with Ukrainian actions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Vitaliy Yakovlev, deputy chief </F>
of staff of the Russian Defense Ministry's Main Directorate, by 
Aleksandr Zhilin, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI's military commentator, in 
the "Expert Appraisal" column: "The Winged Chernobyls"] 
  [Text] More than 600 aircraft-based cruise missiles are 
located on Ukraine's territory. And although at present they 
have no flight missions, specialists believe that combat use of 
such missiles is quite possible. For this to happen it is 
enough for strategic bombers to deliver them to an enemy's 
territory and carry out emergency dropping. There will be no 
"classic" nuclear explosion but the radioactive pollution of the 
territory will be almost the same as with one. The probability 
of such a dangerous course of events is discussed by Major 
General Vitaliy Yakovlev, deputy chief of staff of the Russian 
Defense Ministry's Main Directorate, in a talk with MOSKOVSKIYE 
NOVOSTI's correspondent. 
  [Zhilin] There has been much controversy over the Ukrainian 
nuclear charges. What can you say about this as a specialist? 
  [Yakovlev] Nothing reassuring. Today there are 
approximately 2,000 nuclear charges in Ukraine. Their technical 
condition can no longer be called satisfactory. Their warrantee 
service life is not more than six years, and some it is already 
running out. This calls for constant attention by maintenance 
and service personnel. In particular it is necessary to replace 
the obsolete components with new ones, which Ukraine does not 
have. 
  [Zhilin] But the Ukrainian nuclear warheads are serviced by 
Russian specialists. 
  [Yakovlev] Were serviced. After the Ukrainian parliament 
legitimized its ownership of the nuclear weapons and its defense 
minister issued orders to place the so-called S-type 
installations under his control, the Russian Defense Ministry 
lost the possibility to monitor the condition of the nuclear 
ammunition. There are no more Russian military units there. In 
other words, Russia can no longer be responsible for nuclear 
security on Ukraine's territory, while the latter for its part 
is incapable of ensuring nuclear security in handling these 
charges. 
  [Zhilin] What specific dangers does this involve? 
  [Yakovlev] Even the chief designers will not answer this 
question accurately. Nuclear charges whose service life has 
expired may not be safe to dismantle. Neither scientific 
research nor practical tests have been conducted on this count. 
No one could even expect such circumstances to arise. 
  In the current year designers and our specialists have 
visited a nuclear ammunition depot in Pervomaysk. The warheads 
there have begun to "run a high temperature." The reason is 
violation of the storage conditions. In particular there were 
eight times as many warheads in the storage as is allowed by the 
rules. The chief designers in their report insisted that all 
them be urgently sent for destruction. But the Ukrainian side 
did not agree. It should be noted here that the rules for 
storing nuclear weapons are being breached not only in 
Pervomaysk. 
  [Zhilin] If the expired service life makes the dismantling 
of nuclear warheads so dangerous, why then should Russia do it? 
  [Yakovlev] This is exactly what we have been talking about 
with our Ukrainian colleagues. If all the agreements on 
destroying the Ukrainian nuclear weapons concluded in Massandra 
are thwarted and the guaranteed service life expires, it is not 
ruled out that Russian enterprises may refuse to process the 
warheads. 
  [Zhilin] Does Russia supply components to replace the old 
ones on Ukrainian nuclear warheads? 
  [Yakovlev] Russia will supply them if Ukraine strictly 
adheres to the Massandra agreements. 
  [Zhilin] Can Ukraine use the nuclear forces for military 
purposes? 
  [Yakovlev] Last May part of the strategic bombers and also 
nuclear technical units operating approximately 600 air-based 
strategic nuclear charges swore the Ukrainian oath of 
allegiance. This means that Ukraine became potentially capable 
of using air nuclear weapons. True, to this end it has to 
resolve a number of technical problems. But as radiological 
weapons these charges can be used already now. 
  [Zhilin] What is the way out then? 
  [Yakovlev] There is only one: observance of the Massandra 
agreements. The Russian Federation Ministry of Atomic Energy is 
ready to dismantle all the nuclear charges stationed in Ukraine 
within 24 months. 
  [Zhilin] Can a situation arise wherein the nuclear warhead 
will "go" from Ukraine's territory to other countries? 
  [Yakovlev] I would like to stress once again that Russia 
does not control the condition and maintenance of these charges. 
In other words, should this happen, we may not even know about 
it. These are dangerous games fraught with a terrible disaster. 
I am saying this not as a politician but as a specialist on 
nuclear weapons.

  [Text] Kiev, 1 Dec -- A news conference on the outcome of 
the autumn session of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation 
Parliamentary Assembly has taken place in the sitting hall of 
the Supreme Council of Ukraine. Replying to a question by a 
correspondent from DER SPIEGEL magazine (Germany), Ivan 
Plyushch, chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, reported 
that Leonid Kravchuk sees his task as explaining to the world 
community the content of the reservations made by the Ukrainian 
parliament when ratifying the START I Treaty. However, Ivan 
Plyushch noted that Leonid Kravchuk "as president of Ukraine and 
as a human being can either accept or not accept the content of 
the reservations," and has the full right to turn to the 
parliament of Ukraine for explanations. The chairman of the 
Supreme Council called the statement of the Russian Government 
concerning Ukraine's stance on START "brutal in form and 
distorted in content." He noted that the reservations of the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine to START ratification do not touch 
Russia's interests and do not violate a single norm of the 
treaty. 
  In connection with reports that China and Turkey "have an 
understanding attitude" to Ukraine's stance and reservations to 
START, a question was addressed to the chairman of the Supreme 
Council: Who specifically supports Ukraine's stance or at least 
has an understanding attitude to it? Ivan Plyushch did not 
reply to the question, while Mr. Cindoruk, president of the 
Black Sea Economic Cooperation Parliamentary Assembly and 
chairman of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, proposed that 
journalists get the answer to this question at the next assembly 
of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Parliamentary Assembly, 
which will take place next spring. 
  People's Deputy Anatoliy Kasyanenko, the newly appointed 
ambassador of Ukraine to Georgia, believes that Mr. Cindoruk 
avoided answering the question from an UNIAR correspondent 
because he had received instructions from Washington to change 
his stance (it is well known that Turkey is the only NATO 
country to support Ukraine's position during ratification of the 
START treaty).

  [Text] Brussels December 3 TASS -- The North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council succeeded to do what the CSCE session of 
foreign ministers failed to accept in Rome - to urge Ukraine to 
ratify the START-1 treaty without any reservations, according to 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
  "As far as the problem of non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons is concerned, in Brussels (we) succeeded to do what was 
not done in Rome. The final communique urges the ratification 
of the START-1 treaty and the joining of the nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty by all countries," he told reporters on 
Friday. 
  "In other words, there is no doubts that the decision of the 
Ukrainian Supreme Soviet is not viewed as the ratification of 
the START-1 treaty and the task of eliminating the nuclear 
weapons still faces out southern neighbour", Kozyrev said. 
  The North Altlantic Cooperation Council is working in a 
"more 
realistic manner" than the recent CSCE meeting in Rome, he added. 
  He also welcomed the fact that the issue of an urgent 
admission of East European nations to NATO was postponed. "There 
is no talk about it now, the issue has been omitted from the 
agenda", the minister said and added that the council is now 
discussing the Russian initiative to develop partnership between 
East European states, Russia and NATO members in such concrete 
spheres as conversion and peace-keeping efforts. 
  The intiative is viewed by Moscow as an alternative plan to 
NATO expansion.

  [Text] Moscow November 29 TASS -- "Russia might initiate 
the use of nuclear weapons under certain conditions. This is 
envisaged in its military doctrine which has proclaimed the 
nuclear deterrence to be the backbone of its military policy and 
the means of deterring not only nuclear but conventional wars as 
well. At the same time Russia pledges not to use nuclear 
weapons first," said Professor Sergey Rogov, deputy director of 
the Institute for the U.S. and Canada Studies and president of 
the Centre of National Security and International Relations at a 
news conference held in the Russo- American information centre 
on Monday. 
  Rogov said that the document reflects a more open approach 
to 
problems of national security than the one earlier practiced by 
the soviet political and military leadership. Rogov described 
such an approach as "a tangible step in declarative nuclear 
strategy."

  [Text] Rome, 30 Nov -- "Russia will take the most resolute 
and possibly, tough steps to ensure that the issue of the 
inviolability of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty should be 
reflected in the final documents of the CSCE Council of Foreign 
Ministers session. We assess the `spread' of nuclear weapons as 
the biggest threat and as an unprecedented challenge to European 
security," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stated in a 
conversation with the ITAR-TASS corespondent at the end of the 
first day of the CSCE Council of Ministers session in Rome. In 
the minister's opinion, the participants in the meeting 
understand the danger of such a development. What we are saying 
about this problem by no means signifies some kind of "squabble 
between Russia and Ukraine," A. Kozyrev noted. It is a question 
of strict fulfillment of the international obligations taken 
upon ourselves. In this connection, the minister pointed to the 
position of the United States, Germany, and other countries 
which have called upon all the sides to strictly observe the 
clauses of the START-I treaty. 
  The importance of the current Foreign Ministers Council 
session will depend on how quickly and effectively it will be 
able to react to the new challenges and threats to security and 
stability in the continent, A.Kozyrev declared. He pointed out, 
in particular, that two years ago, the Russian side drew 
attention to the danger of aggressive nationalism and urged the 
strengthening of CSCE peacekeeping activities. Naturally, the 
brunt of the settling of conflicts in the former republics of 
the Soviet Union is being borne by Russia, he stressed. 
However, the CSCE can and must provide assistance with 
implementing these peacekeeping efforts. 
  In conclusion, the minister voiced the conviction that a 
considerable "advance in CSCE activities" would result from the 
current Foreign Ministers Council sitting, and that Russia's 
initiatives will be reflected in the final documents.

  [Text] Moscow November 30 TASS -- The Persian Gulf 
countries believe that "Russia as a great power must act as a 
guarantor of stability in the world and in the region," Russian 
Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin told a press conference devoted 
to the results of his last week's trip to the United Arab 
Emirates and Russian arms export. 
  A press release circulated at the press conference said 
Russia earned 2.3 billion dollars from arms sales in 1992, and 
has set sights on earning about nine billion dollars annually. 
It is hardly sensible to turn away from this source of income 
which helps solve numerous problems facing this country, the 
press release says. 
  It also stressed that Russian arms exports are not 
politically motivated. They are purely commercial in nature and 
are not directed against the interests of any separate country. 
"Moreover, we are prepared to discuss with the world exporters 
a reduction of arms exports on a reciprocal basis," the paper 
said. 
  Russia is now orientating its arms sales towards financially 
and politically stable Middle East, Latin American, and 
Southeast Asian countries. Good prospects exist for cooperation 
with China in the military field, the release said. 
  Responding to questions from journalists, Aleksandr Shokhin 
expressed confidence that the privatisation process underway in 
Russia, including the sell-off of military enterprises, will not 
impair state control over Russia's arms export. He recalled 
that Russia had set up a special system of control over its arms 
sales, and control is now being further tightened.

Georgiy Shmelev] 
  [Text] Rome, 30 Nov -- New challenges to security and 
cooperation in Europe are taking on an increasingly dramatic 
character. The threat of aggressive nationalism has replaced 
that of totalitarianism. This was stated today by Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, speaking at the fourth session 
of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the CSCE which is taking 
place in Rome. 
  The fact that manifestations of aggressive nationalism are 
gripping not only eastern but also central and western Europe 
demands much more decisive and urgent reactions, the minister 
emphasized. He considers that what is needed above all is 
"unambiguous moral condemnation of these manifestations." The 
Russian side has therefore proposed the adoption of a document 
in which the CSCE participant states would declare that 
intolerance and xenophobia are incompatible with a civilized 
Europe standing on the threshold of the 21st century. 
  In A. Kozyrev's opinion it is important that the Rome forum 
should adopt measures to support and strengthen the institution 
of the CSCE's Supreme Commissar for National Minority Affairs. 
"There should be a guaranteeing of the effectiveness of 
humanitarian law in armed conflicts engendered by aggressive 
nationalism," he declared. 
  Andrey Kozyrev believes the CSCE has another important task; 
namely, to reinforce its peacekeeping potential in order to 
settle conflicts where agressive nationalism has led to 
bloodshed. He pointed to the special role of CSCE observers, 
who are "working heroically in South Ossetia, the Dniester 
region, and Abkhazia, acting hand in hand with the Russian 
Federation peacekeeping forces." 
  In this connection A. Kozyrev called upon the CSCE to 
support 
Russia's peacekeeping efforts and to reexamine the issue of CSCE 
observers returning to "hot spots" in the territory of former 
Yugoslavia. The minister thinks it would be correct for the 
CSCE to make the authorities in Belgrade aware that constructive 
steps on their part would open up prospects for the FRY to 
rejoin the CSCE. The minister believes that the CSCE should take 
upon itself the political coordination of peacekeeping efforts, 
within the framework of such organizations as NACC [North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council], CIS, NATO, and the Western 
European Union. 
  A. Kozyrev described as a fresh and unprecedented challenge 
to European security the fact that "for the first time since the 
signing of the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 
1968, we are seeing under way in Europe not a strengthening of 
the nonproliferation regime and new states joining it, but 
essentially the reverse." "One of the CSCE member states," the 
minister pointed out, "has, contrary to the obligations it 
assumed, officially announced that it possesses nuclear weapons. 
Furthermore, we are speaking here of an awesome nuclear 
potential exceeding that of some powers possessing nuclear 
weapons." The Russian Federation minister believes that this 
creates a completely new situation in terms of security on the 
continent of Europe. A. Kozyrev called upon the CSCE to make a 
determined declaration of the inviolability of the 
Nonproliferation Treaty.

  [Text] When one reads police reports, one forms the 
impression that Russian thieves are the deftest thieves in the 
world. It appears that our correspondent in Murmansk, Valeriy 
Anuchin, is going to confirm this. He reports that someone has 
managed to steal nuclear fuel from one of the depots of the 
Northern Fleet, situated in the outskirts of the city. This was 
the kind of fuel used for nuclear submarines. Three uranium 
rods have disappeared. They pose no threat to [people's] health 
and the environment, and apparently the thieves knew this when 
they were stealing the rods.

<F P=106> [Report by Constantine Maximov in Moscow] </F>
  [Text] Many changes have taken place in the core of Russian 
military philosophy as a result of changes in the international 
community, the restriction of Russian arms sales because of 
internal political and economic crises, and the departure of 
Russian scientists--as is reported--to escape deteriorating 
living conditions. 
  AL-SAFIR met with Mikhail Mali, head of the Russian National 
Security Council Committee, who is participating in the 
supervision of military production. It asked him about the 
future of military production, which he showed some optimism 
about. We had the following dialogue. 
  [AL-SAFIR] What is the condition of the Russian military 
industry institution? Is it still capable of exporting modern 
military equipment and arms abroad? 
  [Mali] I posed such questions in a meeting with President 
Boris Yeltsin recently. The president then read a statement 
from our ambassador in Bangladesh in which the latter says that, 
for no reason whatsoever, we are allowing tenders, one after the 
other, to be awarded to other countries. In this way, we are 
opening up markets in which we previously had a strong position 
to competitors who are defeating us with our own weapons. 
  Of course, the Middle East has its own special character. 
Regarding Bangladesh, we could have made millions of dollars 
there. We need this money so that the mechanisms for production 
will be set up at the Aviastart installation in Ulyanovsk, which 
we opened to manufacture Tu-204 planes. 
  We exhibited the most modern samples of Russian military 
weapons and equipment in Abu Dhabi and China. Military 
industry, despite the setbacks it has had, is capable of 
exporting competitive equipment. We have decided that from now 
on we will not attempt to sell old models. While previously the 
Soviet Union did not hesitate to sell old weapons, we sell new 
weapons as much as possible without affecting our defense 
capabilities. We have displayed the newest weapons, beginning 
with modern projectiles and ending with airplanes, missiles, 
electronics, and modern optical equipment. 
  In Abu Dhabi, we proposed to the Americans staging a battle 
between the Russian T-80 tank and the American Abrams. The 
members of our tank team volunteered to stage the battle because 
they were convinced they would win. The Americans rejected the 
offer. Their rejection was an indication that they accept the 
fact that the Russian tank is superior in combat. 
  We could export new weapons to the amount of 10-12 billion 
[currency not specified] a year despite the fact that our 
weapons exports in 1992 dropped to $3.5 billion. We can also 
flood the market with spare parts for our weapons and military 
equipment. It is no coincidence that the prime minister decided 
to supervise the exports of weapons because of his 
dissatisfaction with what has been happening so far. 
  [AL-SAFIR] How is Russia doing in the arms markets, 
especially in the Middle East? 
  [Mali] With the dissolution of the contract between the 
Soviet republics and turning the page on the Soviet regime, the 
internal political problems overshadowed all others. Russia, at 
that time, according to the opinion of many Russian politicians, 
directed its energies toward coping with these problems that 
were much more important. The production of the most modern 
models of military equipment and the export of weapons was not a 
priority. It was only natural for us to lose a part of our 
trade market immediately. 
  The arms trade is more difficult than the trade in gold or 
diamonds due to the force of habit that controls it. We have no 
existence in a number of markets now after we stopped exporting 
spare parts and ammunition. We failed to meet the schedules for 
exports and have not taken into consideration the situation in 
Syria, for example, or Jordan, Tunisia, Libya, or Algeria. I 
regret that Algeria, according to information I have, bought 
non-Russian military equipment, as did India. Yes, we do not 
have a presence in some markets anymore. However, we hope to 
return to these markets. As of 1994, we will resume our regular 
activities. I hope we will regain our positions in the arms 
markets and acquire a better position than we had before. 
  The president has signed a decree stipulating raising the 
minimum salaries of workers in the military industry by eight 
times more than the salaries in the rest of the sectors. The 
military industry will be granted 20 percent of the price of 
products the state orders from it before delivery of the 
products. Such a step will give confidence to those who work in 
the field and they will become more creative in new equipment. 
As for the approval of the military philosophy, it has enabled 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to develop a plan for 
arming the military until the year 2000. 
  [AL-SAFIR] What kind of weapons can Russia sell to the Arab 
countries? 
  [Mali] I believe we can sell the weapons that we exhibited 
there this year, particularly air defense missiles. These 
missiles can be used to destroy targets on the ground, at sea, 
and in the air. It has been shown in practice that the 
S-300,000 missiles are capable of destroying aerial targets and 
ships 180 kms off shore. They can also be launched from ships 
to destroy a whole regiment of tanks on shore after specially 
equipped planes locate their position. We have models of such 
planes. In short, these sea-ground, sea-air, and 
surface-to-surface missiles are unique and multi-purpose weapons. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Can Russia produce weapons and equipment fit for 
use in the Middle East climate? 
  [Mali] We benefited a great deal from the Abu Dhabi military 
fair. The Russian delegation included all senior weapons 
designers to see for themselves soldiers who are unlike Russian 
soldiers, who do not complain of severe winter cold nor of hot 
summer weather. The soldiers of many countries are used to 
comfortable conditions. Thus the military industry sector, which 
will be requested to promote exports, is required to produce 
weapons and equipment fit for use in tropical and desert 
regions. These weapons and equipment must be fit for use in the 
areas where they will be exported and ensure comfort for 
personnel using them, meet certain technical specifications, and 
are easily guided and aimed. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Are the various products of the Russian military 
industry establishment going to change in light of the new 
military philosophy? 
  [Mali] We will introduce numerous changes. It has been 
decided to limit production of assault submarines to two 
submarines a year. Production of Diesel-powered submarines will 
be considerably reduced. I think that we will stop building 
large ships as we no longer needs them because they are 
vulnerable and their operation is very costly. According to our 
new philosophy and, given the current developments in Russia, 
tactical weapons have become strategic ones. We will go ahead in 
producing the winged Cruise missiles and the (Plazma) weapon in 
which we are far ahead of Western countries. This is a 
defensive weapon that can be used for destruction of attacking 
missiles as well as ground targets. We will continue to develop 
light weapons that are easy to move by land, sea, and air; 
computerized weapons; and combat communications systems. Since 
the ideological confrontation worldwide that previously 
exhausted us is over, we may focus on producing and advancing 
modern weapons such as the Mig aircraft by using foreign-made 
electronic equipment to increase the effectiveness of our 
weapons by 30 to 40 percent. We can also meet the interests of 
our Western partners to some extent. It is highly likely that we 
will cooperate with other countries in the manufacture of 
military weapons and equipment. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Would you like to say anything to the Arabs who 
may seek to purchase Russian weapons? 
  [Mali] We are ready to receive Arab military delegations to 
teach them how to use new models of weapons while testing them 
to facilitate their introduction into their armies as quickly as 
possible. We have also established, with President Yeltsin's 
approval, a bank for the Military industry establishment in 
which Greece shares in its capital. We do not know yet if the 
Arabs desire to share in funding weapons production. The door 
is open to them and we invite them to participate in this bank 
activity and in joint weapons production. We invite the Arabs 
to inspect the weapons system at the Nizhniy Novgorod Fair. We 
are preparing to exhibit new models of weapons at this fair and 
in Moscow. We will exhibit new types of military equipment and 
provide ample information on them. We do not have any intention 
of exploiting them and all that we want is for our exhibits to 
attract buyers. We will prove the effectiveness of our products 
in a competition with rivals. As for me, I support returning 
approximately 60 percent of the revenue of our weapons exports 
to the Arabs for investment in their economic sectors. This 
policy is in our interest for several reasons, primarily because 
this cooperation will enable us to retain the work sites of the 
important industrial sector. We can also safeguard the security 
of regions by our own weapons and ensure revenue from our 
exports. Such deals are in the interests of both sides.

there. Paramilitary protection service personnel here have 
discovered a theft of nuclear fuel as used by nuclear 
submarines. Three uranium control rods have been stolen. A 
crime file has been opened. The theft is being investigated by 
a special interdepartmental group which includes representatives 
of the Fleet Military Prosecutor's Office, military 
counterintelligence organs, and the Internal Affairs 
Directorate. The theft, the specialists believe, was committed 
by people familiar with this kind of nuclear fuel. That is, the 
thieves knew in advance that the fuel rods represent a health 
hazard.

Nothing like this has ever happened in Murmansk before. 
However, I am convinced that but for our mismanagement and

is to commission the branch railroad built long ago for the 
Northern Fleet military base in Zapadnaya Litsa and the 
equivalent civilian nuclear fleet enterprise for this fuel 
transit center to be dispensed with. [video shows numerous views

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Sychev: "Moscow and Washington Will </F>
Keep World Ocean in their Sights"] 
  [Text] Colonel General Igor Sergeyev, commander of the 
Russian Strategic Missile Forces, has had talks with top 
Pentagon officials and the command of the U.S. strategic forces 
regarding the retargeting of strategic nuclear missiles. 
  At his latest press conference President Bill Clinton did 
not 
specify whether the consultations had gotten far. Russian state 
institutions are also refraining from comment. 
  The Russian and U.S. presidents are examining at least two 
ways of implementing the initiative suggested in April by Boris 
Yeltsin to President Clinton in Vancouver. According to one 
option it is planned to retarget ballistic missiles, designed by 
Russia and the United States for mutual destruction, on 
godforsaken corners of the world ocean. According to 
unconfirmed reports 24 desert regions have already been 
identified as suitable for the role of false targets. Another 
option envisages not targeting the missiles anywhere. 
  "The idea of retargeting has long been discussed in academic 
circles," a staffer at a Russian department said. "It is useful 
and it is good that we are moving from theory to practice. 
Russia and the United States are no longer adversaries yet to 
this day they have been keeping each other in their sights." 
  What will the implementation of the Russian idea provide? If 
there is an unsanctioned launch there will not be mass human 
casualties or a retaliatory nuclear missile strike. Because of 
its military-technical flaws the agreement could become a 
touchstone of the sincerity of the friendship between Moscow and 
Washington and a confidence-building measure. After all, apart 
from secret agents there are no other means which would allow us 
to assure ourselves of the honesty of our partner and his 
fulfillment of his commitments. 
  In addition it takes only about 15 minutes to retarget 
individually targeted missiles and warheads. You only have to 
put the necessary programs into the computers. 
  Nonetheless, it is better to have "disoriented" missiles 
than 
missiles which "know" precisely the point which has been 
targeted in the United States or Russia. In given circumstances 
the time necessary for reprogramming could save mankind.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andrey Stawrow, director of the Republican </F>
Training and Information Center for Nuclear Security, Power 
Engineering, and Education, by Anatol Slanewski; place and date 
not given: "Construction of Nuclear Power Stations: To Be or Not 
To Be?" -- first two paragraphs are ZVYAZDA introduction] 
  [Excerpts] The September issue of NEMAN included an article 
by three of the Republic's most well-known scientists -- Radzim 
Haretski, Anatol Kudzelski and Yawhen Pyatrayew -- entitled 
"Beware of Atomic Stations!" The authors discussed some 
chapters of the energy program adopted by the Cabinet of 
Ministers, which is "overwhelmingly oriented toward the 
development of nuclear power engineering." How did they explain 
why Belarus should opt for another direction in its development? 
Some 2 million tons of oil are extracted from the Prypyat oil 
and gas basin. Haretski, Kudzelski, and Pyatrayew estimate that 
as much as two-thirds of our oil deposits remain trapped 
underground because of low extraction coefficient. The 
deposits of brown coal in the same Prypyat basin are estimated 
at about 1 billion tons, while oil-shale deposits are put at 11 
billion tons. Scientists calculate that the energy potential of 
the two richest deposits, at Turawski and Lyubanski, are 340 
million tons of arbitrary fuel. (The heat value of 1 tonne of 
arbitrary fuel is 60 percent that of 1 tonne of oil). 
  We interviewed Andrey Stawrow, director of the Republican 
Training and Information Center for Nuclear Security, Power 
Engineering, and Education at the Cabinet of Ministers, on his 
opinion about the fate of the country's nuclear power 
engineering. [passage omitted] 
  [Slanewski] Many publications devoted to the future of 
Belarusian nuclear power engineering have recently appeared, 
generating even more discussion on this issue. Is someone 
trying to "score political points" here? 
  [Stawrow] One should remember that this issue is not about 
nuclear power engineering as such, but about the mainstay energy 
source for Belarus. We have no major energy sources in our 
country -- quite the opposite of what some authors of the 
above-mentioned articles are trying to tell us. Truth be known, 
there are minerals on the Republic's territory, such as brown 
coal and shale. However, their processing technology is too 
expensive, labor-intensive, and simply flawed. We have nothing 
except for 2 million tons of oil and a handful of accompanying 
natural gas. This is my first point. The second one is that 
about half of our thermoelectric power stations are worn out and 
dilapidated. They should be either radically overhauled or 
replaced with entirely new ones. Our problem is a lack of large 
deposits. We think that it can be resolved in three ways. 
First, we should continue to import energy. You understand that 
one can transmit electrical energy -- heat cannot be transmitted 
through wires. At the same time, electric energy accounts for 
only a quarter of all the energy we consume, with 70-75 percent 
represented by thermal energy. This means that we would have to 
buy resources for generating thermal and electrical energy, 
which is the second solution. The third way would be to search 
for some deposits within the country. Following careful 
analysis, we have reached quite a simple conclusion. There are 
only two options -- to orient ourselves toward Russian gas and 
oil, basing our power engineering system on imports, or to 
develop our own deposits. The latter can only be implemented in 
the form of nuclear power stations. The energy program, 
referred to by the article's authors, proved that given our 
conditions, nuclear energy is the most appropriate option. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Slanewski] Let us touch upon definitely the most sensitive 
issue for us. After we build nuclear power stations, would we 
be able to say that we live in safer ecological conditions than 
before? 
  [Stawrow] This is an easy question to answer. Nuclear power 
plants are, ecologically speaking, the safest source of energy. 
Of course, one can ask, "What about Chernobyl?" My answer is 
that the Chernobyl accident showed us how not to develop nuclear 
power, and in no way should lead us to abandon it altogether. 
This is borne out by the recent decision by the Ukrainian 
Cabinet of Ministers in favor of continuing operation of the 
Chernobyl nuclear power station. I have always said that 
Ukraine will never shut down that station because it is hard to 
throw away 3 million kilowatts of energy -- almost half of 
Belarus' needs. We are frequently threatened that another 
accident may strike once again. But we have already been 
sitting on the powder keg for a long time, with the Ignalinsk 
nuclear station only 15 km from our border. As an example, one 
of the biggest nuclear stations in France is located within the 
Paris city limits, while in Japan, one of their nuclear plants 
is in a resort area. There are generally accepted rules on 
where to construct such stations, depending on geological 
conditions, weather patterns, etc. There are also many projects 
to construct strong concrete "shells" around the stations. Or 
take, for example, the idea of Andrey Sakharov to build nuclear 
stations underground. [passage omitted] 
  [Slanewski] Nuclear power plants require a great deal of 
nuclear fuel. Besides that consideration, where would we get 
the personnel? 
  [Stawrow] The sooner we start thinking about this, the 
better. It is no secret that the former Belarusian Institute of 
Nuclear Power Engineering managed to make possible the operation 
of two nuclear stations. It is another thing that our experts 
have started to leave, and it is hard to keep them. If we are 
to launch our stations by, say, the year of 2005, our institutes 
and universities must set out to prepare specialists now. 
Otherwise, we will have to invite them from abroad. As for 
fuel, there are several options. Some reactors, such as the 
Canadian-made "Candu," require no concentrated fuel, and can 
work on natural uranium. Plus, the amount of uranium available 
on the open market is immense -- you can buy it everywhere. 
There will be no problem if we build a reactor that operates on 
concentrated fuel. Let me note the following: While prices for 
conventional fuels -- oil and gas -- keep climbing, nuclear fuel 
is becoming even cheaper. 
  [Slanewski] What about burying and destroying wastes? How 
serious is this problem? We still remember the recent conflict 
between Japan and Russia. 
  [Stawrow] This problem is pretty serious. However, as the 
experience with the Chernobyl station showed, nuclear stations 
do not produce much waste. This also applies to medium-active 
wastes. As for highly active wastes, it is the spent fuel 
itself, which is stored at the station, sometimes for decades. 
The question then comes down to whether to keep that waste on 
our own territory or make arrangements with countries that allow 
such waste to be buried on their territory. This is a key 
issue, which is more of an economic consideration than a 
technical one.

  [Text] [Unidentified correspondent] For the first time an 
Ostankino camera crew has visited the most secret facility where 
the explosive filling for the first Soviet atomic bombs was 
made. The Vostokredmet industrial association, which until 
recently mined and refined uranium, is situated in a suburb of 
Khudzhand, an oblast center of Tajikistan. Thirty-five thousand 
people, mostly Russians, who live and work at and around the 
site have suddenly become unwanted by anyone, including Russia, 
in a republic in the grip of a military confrontation. But the 
golden minds and hands of these people have done everything to 
save the enterprise. The construction of a gold refining 
production line is now almost complete at the combine, which 
will allow independent Tajikistan to have its gold in ingots by 
the New Year holiday. Specialists at the combine designed and 
built all the refining equipment themselves. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Byelashov, deputy chief of the </F>
Department of Arms Control: "What To Do With the Strategic 
`Triad?'"] 
  [Text] How should today's Ukrainian Army look? It has 
been two years since the Ukrainian Armed Forces were 
established. So, this question is still on everyone's mind 
today. This is understandable, because such issues as defense, 
armed forces, and defense budget are the center of attention in 
any country, the more so when a country only begins to 
reestablish its statehood, including its defense structures and 
mechanisms. 
  Currently, these issues are vigorously discussed by the 
Ukrainian people at all levels -- in the legislature, the 
government, and the media. The Ukrainian Supreme Council has 
adopted a military doctrine and examined a concept of Ukrainian 
state security. 
  One of the most important issues is, of course, the problem 
of nuclear weapons. Many controversies have been triggered by 
the debate over this issue, which becomes more vehement every 
day. In this article, I would like to touch upon a few aspects 
of this topic. 
  First of all, is Ukraine a nuclear state? Everybody must 
understand that currently it is not. It is not the same to have 
rights to be a nuclear state (Ukraine undoubtedly has such 
rights) and to be one. At this time, Ukraine can neither use 
these weapons (Ukraine does not possess the control systems), 
nor is it able to independently provide secure and efficient 
maintenance of them (this is the sole competence of the 
producers of these weapons, who are not controlled by Ukraine). 
  This way, the statements on "our" nuclear weapons that "do 
not have to be turned back to anybody," or on Ukraine's nuclear 
status, politely speaking, are not justified. A simple decision 
to detain the nuclear weapons deployed on Ukrainian territory 
will not make our country a nuclear state. 
  Secondly, can Ukraine become a nuclear state? 
  To become a real nuclear state, it is necessary to go 
through 
the entire process that other nuclear states have experienced, 
meaning to develop full-value nuclear potential (except the 
designing and production already existing in Ukraine). 
  Should a decision on Ukraine's nuclear status be adopted, it 
will be necessary to develop our own nuclear-warhead technology, 
appropriate production forces, scientific potential, as well as 
solve the issue of nuclear testing (meaning to find a place on 
Ukraine's highly populated territory where tests could be 
conducted, since only countries that have well-developed nuclear 
weapons systems can introduce a moratorium on nuclear tests -- 
it is not possible to develop new nuclear weapons without 
testing). 
  Theoretically, Ukraine is able to solve most of these 
problems (I will not say how many billions of karbovanetses or 
even dollars it would cost). However, it should be pointed out 
that given the current economic circumstances, this could be too 
heavy a burden. 
  Thirdly, what could be the consequences of such a decision? 
  It is not hard to predict the political consequences of such 
a decision. It is obvious that we will have to forget about 
help from other countries, in practically all fields. The 
sanctions against Iraq and South Africa should be remembered. A 
possibility of more decisive acts by other countries should also 
be taken into consideration, provided that those countries are 
really concerned about Ukraine's nuclear program. The military 
actions against Iraq's nuclear facilities may be cited as an 
example. 
  This way, analyzing the political, economic, and military 
aspects of national security, it is hard to avoid the feeling 
that the "nuclear option" might not strengthen but weaken 
Ukraine's security. Additionally, nobody claims that the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces are not strong enough to protect the 
country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, including 
deterrence measures. This can be provided by an army with 
conventional equipment, given its modern organization, the 
proper training of servicemen, and appropriate weapons. 
  Undoubtedly, Ukraine's defense policy provides for strategic 
objectives that are to be conducted by the strategic forces. 
However, these forces and objectives cannot be confused with the 
temporarily united CIS Nuclear Forces. Not attempting to dwell 
on the strictly military aspects of this issue, it should be 
pointed out that besides such types of armed forces as infantry, 
air force, antiaircraft defense, and a navy, Ukraine should also 
have strategic forces, or at least a strategic command of 
Ukraine's Armed Forces. It must be understood that such forces 
should play a dual role -- to be a potential deterrent, meaning 
that the nature of their weaponry should deter a potential 
enemy, and to conduct regular strategic assignments. 
  They could include such deterrence-strategic forces as the 
Missile Deterrence Forces, equipped with conventional weapons 
allowed by international agreements. First of all, such 
equipment should include highly accurate cruise missiles with 
appropriate ranges, ballistic missiles with highly accurate 
warheads of high yield, and nonnuclear intercontinental 
missiles, provided strict adherence to appropriate international 
agreements. 
  Ukraine has defined its path to nuclear-free status. 
Nevertheless, the Ukrainian Strategic Forces can have 
conventional missile systems of appropriate ranges. The more 
so, because these missiles can be equipped with conventional 
warheads, particularly, with volume-explosive [obyemno-vybukhova 
diya], kinetic, and vacuum action modes. By the way, the 
firepower of these missiles, as well as of certain artillery 
systems, resembles that of certain weapons of mass destruction, 
such as nuclear arms. 
  I would put somewhat aside the possibility of using 
intercontinental ballistic missiles. The most important issue 
in this regard is the military expediency of such missiles and 
their maintenance. Installing conventional warheads on 
strategic ballistic missiles would be expedient only in case a 
warhead has a high energy yield, like the ones in 
volume-explosive and kinetic warheads. Otherwise, sending a few 
hundred kilograms of TNT to another continent would make no 
sense. Another problem is the possibility of developing, 
servicing, and improving such kinds of weapons. It is no secret 
that Ukraine is producing strategic intercontinental missiles. 
To equip them with nonnuclear warheads does not seem very 
complicated. However, such sophisticated carriers as 
intercontinental ballistic missiles should be occasionally 
tested. However, there are no appropriate testing grounds in 
Ukraine. So, it is necessary to reach an agreement on testing 
our missiles with Kazakhstan or Russia, where such facilities 
exist. 
  The number and storage of such missiles also require deep 
consideration. Longevity and efficiency of these weapons 
depends on these factors. 
  An appropriate missile-attack warning system is also very 
important. Without it, intercontinental ballistic missiles, 
especially those in silos, could become easy targets of a first 
strike due to their inability to launch a counterattack. 
  The final decision, of course, rests with military 
specialists. 
  Ukraine has some TU-160, TU-95, and TU-22m heavy bombers. 
Whereas the practically experimental TU-160 bombers, without 
spare parts and ground facilities, have a problematic value for 
Ukraine as strategic weaponry (they are useless as 
nuclear-capable aircraft due to their tactical and technical 
parameters), the TU-95 and TU-22m bombers have undoubted value 
for strategic tasks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The nuclear 
TU-95 bombers deployed in Ukraine can be converted into 
nonnuclear ones, which is allowed by the START I treaty, 
provided their further maintenance in Ukraine. There is no 
doubt about the expediency of using TU-95 bombers as heavy 
nuclear- capable aircraft, strategic surveillance aircraft, or 
reconnaissance aircraft. For example, heavy B-52 bombers with 
conventional munitions used by the United States in Vietnam 
proved highly effective. 
  The modern TU-22m airplanes are also renowned throughout the 
world as counter antiaircraft forces, thanks to their superb 
technical parameters. Moreover, they are classified as 
conventional weapons. 
  Such powerful long-range air forces could perform important 
deterrence assignments in the framework of Ukraine's military 
doctrine. Additionally, their second purpose could be launching 
powerful strategic and conventional attacks during regular 
combat. 
  A considerable part of the Black Sea Fleet could also 
conduct 
Ukraine's strategic missions. The protection of Ukraine's 
southern sea borders is part of Ukraine's strategic defense. 
Submarines and vessels armed with cruise missiles and other 
kinds of advanced- technology weapons can successfully perform 
such duties. 
  According to the present military doctrine, these forces may 
conduct strategic defense tasks in the place of nuclear weapons. 
  The Airborne Forces are equipped with all kinds of modern 
aircraft, such as heavy AN-22 and IL-76 planes, as well as 
medium and light AN-72, AN-26, and AN-2 airplanes, which are 
equipped with special landing weapons and have adequately 
trained personnel (the remains of the 98th Division could become 
the core of these forces). The Airborne Forces should also be 
subordinated to the strategic command of the Ukrainian Armed 
Forces, since they are also performing strategic duties. 
  The Ukrainian Strategic Forces could also comprise certain 
mechanized well-armed infantry battalions, regiments, and 
brigades, which should be able to operate independently. 
  The main units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces should be 
strong 
enough, first of all, to help the Strategic Forces repel any 
potential aggressor, and secondly, to prevent any possible 
encroachment on Ukrainian territory. All these forces should be 
mobile enough to conduct combat operations of various nature and 
magnitude, and given the minimum number of personnel, to operate 
throughout Ukraine. 
  The Supreme Council's adoption of the final version of a 
realistic and comprehensive military doctrine will facilitate 
the quicker development of a modern armed forces that would be 
able to successfully perform complex tasks, which they are 
facing at the present stage of conversion into the new world 
order.

<F P=106> [Interview with Leonid Kravchuk, president of Ukraine, by </F>
Renaud Girard; in Kiev, date not given: "Kravchuk: `Ukraine 
Must Pursue Denuclearization'" -- first six paragraphs are LE 
FIGARO introduction] 
  [Text] Ukraine only won its independence in August 1991. 
But the euphoria which greeted the event is now long forgotten. 
  The inherited weight of the Communist system has crushed the 
enthusiasm of the young American or Canadian graduates -- the 
grandchildren of Ukrainian immigrants -- who returned to the 
land of their ancestors to help the government in Kiev to build 
a new society. Most of them have now made the return trip back 
across the Atlantic, such as the senior manager with the Bank of 
Boston who gave up a very comfortable salary to take up the post 
of deputy governor of the new central bank of Ukraine. 
  After more than two years of independence, the Ukraine has 
still not managed to be rid of its past as a formerly model 
Soviet province and to set a new path once and for all, in 
economic and political terms. 
  With respect to the economy, the strategy pursued by 
President Kravchuk -- democratically elected in December 1991 
with 62 percent of the votes -- , a mixture of disorganized 
liberalization and steps backwards toward a planned economy, has 
led to an unprecedented social bankruptcy. Inflation is verging 
on 2,000 percent; deprived of raw materials, firms are simply 
ticking over; barter has become the principal medium of 
exchange; wages have failed to keep pace with prices; people 
survive only thanks to support within the family and the black 
market. The "karbovanetz", the money issued two years ago in 
order to leave the rouble zone, has lost more than 30 times its 
value against the Russian currency -- which itself is hardly 
known for its stability. 
  More than anything else, the Ukraine suffers from its 
dependency on Russia for energy supplies. The time when oil and 
natural gas were virtually free is well and truly past. Moscow 
now demands payment in hard currency at worldwide oil markets. 
The energy bill alone absorbs 80 percent of the Ukraine's 
export revenue. The population has already been informed that 
it should not expect their apartments to be heated above 10 
degrees centigrade this winter. 
  Politically, the central authority is relatively stable, 
thanks to President Kravchuk's skills as a political maneuverer. 
A former Soviet apparatchik, he has succeeded in steering a 
course avoiding both the pitfalls of super-nationalism and 
communist nostalgia. But on the international stage, the 
Ukraine is in the process of alienating itself from the powers 
which were most favorably disposed to this former Soviet 
province. They are concerned by Kiev's prevarication in the 
matter of nuclear disarmament. 
  [Girard] On 19 November the Ukrainian parliament only voted 
for a partial ratification of the START 1 Treaty. During a 
previous interview, in January 1992, you told me that the 
Ukraine would be rid of all its nuclear weapons by December 
1994. What is the situation regrading your country's 
denuclearization? 
  [Kravchuk] It is true, at the time I told you that the 
Ukraine intended to become a non-nuclear state. I maintain this 
commitment. The Ukraine must pursue its policy of 
denuclearization. Because I remain convinced that there is no 
other solution for the Ukraine. The Ukraine is not going to 
build up its international prestige and reputation by possessing 
nuclear weapons, but rather by respecting the undertakings it 
has made and pursuing its policy of denuclearization. 
Unfortunately, our parliament failed to ratify all the 
documents I submitted for its signature. Why? First of all, 
because the world's other nuclear powers did not work together 
with us during the 12 months which preceded the START 1 
agreement. They made no effort to understand our particular 
situation and the concerns of a parliament with which they 
established no dialogue. 
  [Girard] What is causing concern to the Ukrainian members of 
parliament? 
  [Kravchuk] They fear the territorial claims which are being 
expressed in certain nationalist circles in Russia. Their vote 
reflects the opinion -- which is widely held here -- that 
nuclear weapons are a means of protection against threats to the 
integrity of Ukrainian territory. My opinion has not changed: 
The country must be denuclearized. But the West should 
understand that a president does not have the authority to run 
the legislative at will. Fortunately, the text approved by 
parliament allows me a certain margin of maneuver in order to 
continue diplomatic negotiations to achieve the conditions for 
our denuclearization. I intend to make full use of this. 
  [Girard] If you are a candidate at next June's presidential 
elections, will you campaign for the Ukraine to be a signatory 
of the NPT [Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]? 
  [Kravchuk] It all depends on the legislative elections next 
March. If the new parliament is dominated, as I would like it 
to be, by a majority of competent men who are able to understand 
the country's domestic situation and international interests, I 
will again go on the offensive. I will do everything in my 
power for the Ukraine to ratify the START treaty, the Lisbon 
protocol, and the NPT. But as I said, it all depends on the 
parliament. 
  [Girard] Will you stand in June? 
  [Kravchuk] You will know two months in advance, when the 
candidates have to register. 
  [Girard] Dismantling nuclear weapons is an expensive 
process. 
What are you expecting from the West? 
  [Kravchuk] Reciprocal action. The West must understand that 
the text approved by parliament does not under any circumstances 
mean that the denuclearization process has arrived at an 
impasse. It allows the executives in the different countries to 
continue to work in concrete terms. Rather than speculating on 
the consequences of this vote, the West would do better to 
provide me with technical and financial assistance in order to 
destroy the nuclear warheads! I am also ready to make a gesture 
to ease international concern. I am ready to start defusing our 
nuclear missiles and even to dismantle a part of our warheads, 
while awaiting the time when we can completely dismantle all our 
nuclear weapon sites. 
  [Girard] But what specifically do you want from the West? 
  [Kravchuk] Above all else, security guarantees. You must 
understand the fears of the Ukrainian people. 
  [Girard] Are you hoping for defense agreements, or NATO 
membership perhaps? 
  [Kravchuk] No, but simply declarations by the major nuclear 
powers undertaking not to attack the Ukraine and, at the same 
time, to guarantee its territorial integrity. If we receive 
such undertakings from Russia, the United States, France and 
Great Britain, the Ukrainian population will feel they are 
living in safety. 
  [Girard] On 1 October the five permanent members of the UN 
security council thanked Russia for its action in maintaining 
peace in the former USSR. What do you think of this declaration? 
  [Kravchuk] I find it premature to say the least. Without 
wanting to judge the responsibility of any of the parties in 
complex ethnic conflicts, the fact is that Russian troops were 
often locally involved. Before applauding a country as a 
"peace-keeper" you must first be sure that its action is not in 
any doubt. 
  [Girard] Are the conditions present for Crimea -- which only 
left Russia under Khrushchev -- to become a new Abkhaz 
Republic? After what has happened in Georgia with the Abkhaz 
minority, do you not fear that Crimea, whose population is 
mainly Russian, will soon revolt against the Ukraine? 
  [Kravchuk] There are two reasons why the situation in Crimea 
cannot degenerate into a conflict of the Georgia-Abkhaz type. 
First of all, there is constant dialogue between Russia and the 
Ukraine. At the outset, I took the initiative for a negotiated 
regulation of all questions relating to the status of the Black 
Sea -- including, above all, Crimea. This initiative was 
approved by President Yeltsin and the process is functioning. 
The same applies to the dividing up of the Black Sea fleet. 
The different ethnic groups who make up the population in this 
region must understand that the interests of both the Ukraine -- 
in whose territory it lies -- and of Russia must be taken into 
account. Secondly, the Ukraine has granted almost total 
economic and social autonomy to Crimea. We do not dictate terms 
to Crimea. 
  [Girard] Judging by the meddling of Moscow in the conflicts 
in Georgia, Azerbaijan, Moldavia, Tajikistan, do you not see a 
return to Russia's imperial policy? 
  [Kravchuk] I would not like to state in such a direct way 
that there is a return to Russian imperialism. But it is clear 
that there does exist a strong heritage of imperial policy as 
pursued first by the tzars and then by the Soviet Union. We 
must also remember that there are 25 million Russians living in 
the territory of the former USSR. It is not realistic to expect 
Russia to give up all its interests outside its own territory. 
The United States is able to maintain its interests outside 
American territory: So why should such a policy be denied to 
Russia? 
  [Girard] So what is the problem then? 
  [Kravchuk] The problem with the Russians is their way of 
acting, the methods they use to defend their interests. 
Admittedly, Russian troops were already on the spot in all the 
conflicts you have just mentioned. Moscow did not send in 
troops. These troops were faced with very delicate situations. 
But I believe that they should refrain from intervening in 
ethnic conflicts. Good intentions are needed on both sides. 
The local populations should not be too arrogant with regard to 
the Russians who have stayed behind and at the same time the 
Russians should renounce any temptations of imperialistic 
manipulations. 
  [Girard] How are you going to explain to the Ukrainians that 
independence has meant heating and electricity cuts in the 
middle of winter? 
  [Kravchuk] All countries have gone through difficult periods 
such as we are going through now. Independence is not the prime 
cause. It is the transition between two different systems of 
organizing society. You cannot change overnight from a planned, 
centralized economy to a market economy. We have chosen the 
Western model in order to obtain a new quality of life. That 
means breaking with a lot of things. Under the former system, 
the Ukrainian economy was fully integrated into the Soviet 
economy, of which it represented 20 percent. The division of 
labor -- and not regional autonomy -- was the rule in the former 
USSR. We were specialized in processing industries. Under such 
conditions, how could we build up an independent economy? 
  [Girard] You have debts of 2.5 billion dollars to Russia. 
This summer, the Russians had suggested that, in order to repay 
them, you should sell your share of the Black Sea fleet. Now 
they are calling for a share in Ukrainian companies. Do you 
consider these demands to be justified? 
  [Kravchuk] We are going to set up mixed companies with a 
capital open to foreign investors. It is only natural to have 
industrial relations with Russia. Our companies need its oil, 
gas, raw materials. In return, we can offer it our refining and 
processing capacities. The two countries have everything on 
which to build mutually rewarding industrial relations.

<F P=106> ["Statement Following Rebuttal" issued by the Press Service </F>
of the Ukrainian Embassy in Moscow] 
  [Text] Under the garish heading "Russian Defense Ministry 
Refutes Ukrainian Ambassador's Statement" IZVESTIYA on 25 
November printed an interview by its correspondent with Major 
General Vitaliy Yakovlev, deputy chief of staff of the Russian 
Defense Ministry Main Directorate. Commenting on a remark which 
IZVESTIYA attributed to V. Kryzhanovskiy claiming that "80 
dismantled and disassembled nuclear warheads" were dispatched to 
Russia, Yakovlev claims that the "ambassador's words do not 
correspond to the real state of affairs." 
  The Press Service of the Ukrainian Embassy in the Russian 
Federation is authorized to state that the Ukrainian ambassador 
did not make any such remark either during the 23 November press 
conference or at any other time. This also becomes obvious on 
objective analysis of the transcripts of the press conference -- 
both the one available to the embassy press service and, for 
instance, the one which was prepared and then circulated to 
subscribers of the Russian-U.S. FEDERAL NEWS SERVICE agency. 
Incidentally, nothing of the sort was reported in the VESTI 
broadcast which IZVESTIYA cites (the embassy has the video 
recording in its possession). The issue at the press conference 
was the Ukrainian side's readiness to start carrying out the 
treaty straight after ratification by the parliament, which the 
mass media, including the Russian media, reported straight away. 
  [Signed] The Press Service of the Ukrainian Embassy in 
Moscow.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic </F>
correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy 
Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] During a telephone conversation with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk stated that he 
would submit the START-I Treaty to the parliament to be elected 
on March 27, the White House' spokesperson Dee Dee Meyers 
announced in Washington. 
  As we reported earlier, on November 19, the Ukrainian 
parliament ratified the START-I Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol 
with numerous reservations which, in Moscow's opinion, 
undermines the regime of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. To 
quote Meyers, these reservations disappointed President Clinton. 
  The Ukrainian president's Staff informed Interfax that the 
telephone talks between Clinton and Kravchuk had lasted for 30 
minutes and that no one had been informed of the details. 
  Besides the ratification of the START-I Treaty, the two 
leaders discussed "the economic situation in Ukraine," said a 
representative of the president's Staff. 
  He also said that Clinton had proposed searching for ways of 
implementing the START-I Treaty and expressed readiness to help 
Ukraine solve its economic problems. 
  The Ukrainian and U.S. presidents discussed ways of 
attaining 
agreements on U.S. financial and economic assistance in 
Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, on compensation for the nuclear 
materials and on guarantees of Ukrainian security," he told 
Interfax. 
  He also said that the two leaders had discussed details of 
Kravchuk's forthcoming visit to the U.S. during which 
Ukrainian-U.S. economic cooperation will be discussed.

  [Text] Ukraine Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko, who is 
taking part in the work of the CSCE session in Rome, held a news 
conference today. 
  He noted that unfounded accusations have been heard on the 
part of certain participants at the lofty forum to the effect 
that Ukraine has supposedly declared itself a nuclear state. 
However, the minister of foreign affairs emphasized, Ukraine 
does not want and has never desired to acquire operational 
control over nuclear weapons. The nuclear button is located in 
Moscow, and one should not forget this. For Ukraine nuclear 
weapons are material wealth, in which the labor of the Ukrainian 
people has been invested. There is, therefore, every ground for 
demanding just compensation, Anatoliy Zlenko stated. 
  The minister explained Ukraine's stance regarding the 
nuclear 
weapons located on its territory. The decision of the Supreme 
Council on ratification of the START I Treaty, he said, opens 
the way to gradual elimination of nuclear arsenals. The world 
should realize this, understand it, and take a step to meeting 
Ukraine halfway. 
  The head of the foreign policy department stressed that 
giving Ukraine appropriate guarantees of security and economic 
assistance on the part of the world community would remove all 
obstacles from Ukraine's path to acceding to the Nuclear 
Non-proliferation Treaty. 
  Touching on the issue of giving Russia a mandate for 
peace-making operations on the territory of the former USSR, the 
minister of foreign affairs emphasized that a reliable mechanism 
to control such operations needs to be created, which should 
only involve multinational forces. The television and radio 
agency Novyny reported this at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
of Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Kovalenko report: "Kiev Considers Nuclear Missiles </F>
Its Gold Reserve"] 
  [Text] Paris -- Ukraine has been criticized in Rome at the 
CSCE meeting, in Brussels at the NATO session, and in Paris at 
the parliamentary session of the Western European Union for 
deciding to keep its nuclear arsenal. 
  "I understand [Russian Foreign Minister] Andrey Kozyrev's 
concern and at the same time am still surprised at the 
inconsistency of some of Russia's representatives and the 
minister himself," Anatoliy Zlenko, head of Ukraine's foreign 
policy department, told me in Paris. 
  Minister Zlenko reminded me that Ukraine has ratified the 
START I Treaty. That is an important first step toward 
Ukraine's acquiring the status of a nuclear-free state, but it 
is not the last step. Since Ukraine and Russia are two friendly 
states it is not in Moscow's interests to exacerbate the 
situation. 
  Zlenko stressed that the disquiet voiced in Kozyrev's 
statement over the fact that Ukraine is a nuclear state does not 
accord with the facts: "Ukraine is not a nuclear power. It is 
the owner of nuclear weapons with a limited opportunity of 
putting them to their designated use." 
  The minister stressed that Ukraine primarily views the 
nuclear weapons as a "great material asset" and, on this 
premise, is willing to conduct talks and decide their future. 
The tactical nuclear weapons that were withdrawn from Ukraine 
to Russia last May are valued, according to Anatoliy Zlenko, at 
several billion dollars. We are being forced to surrender an 
asset that our people created without receiving compensation. 
  The head of the Ukrainian foreign policy department 
indicated 
that two questions have to be decided. The first is associated 
with guaranteeing national security: "Otherwise our people will 
not understand us since we will be left alone to face the danger 
that exists around Ukraine. Especially since we are constantly 
facing territorial claims from both the east and the south." 
  The second concerns the provision of financial and technical 
aid for Kiev -- and this is in the interests of the 
international community. The Ukrainian budget does not have the 
money to destroy the nuclear weapons. But there is a 
comprehensive government program for the destruction of these 
weapons. And this program costs over $2.5 billion including the 
social requirements. 
  Kiev also has bones to pick with Moscow. Thus, assessing 
Russia's new military doctrine, Anatoliy Zlenko noted that some 
of its provisions, primarily the possibility of Russia being the 
first to use nuclear weapons, worry the international community, 
including Ukraine. Against whom does Moscow intend to use these 
weapons? Who is its number one enemy?

  [Text] A small audience assembled for the news conference 
of Anatoliy Zlenko [Ukrainian minister of foreign affairs] at 
NATO headquarters. The journalists were interested in why 
ratification of START I by the Ukrainian parliament is being 
rejected by the participants of the North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council [NACC] or why it is being criticized. The minister of 
foreign affairs of Ukraine noted: 
  Now one should consider that opinion is changing since a 
Ukrainian proposal for the formula was adopted in the joint 
communique. The word -- unreservedly -- was removed from the 
draft [which said] -- Ukraine should ratify START I unreservedly 
and fully. So this means that ratification of START I by 
Ukraine is a fact. 
  In his replies Anatoliy Zlenko found quite a successful 
comparison concerning the unreserved ratification of START I and 
said that Ukraine had received a terrible gift from the USSR -- 
the Chernobyl plant and the accident there. Ukraine has been 
left alone with this tragedy. It spends 15 percent of the state 
budget on eliminating the aftermath of the accident. 
  And so Ukraine has learned from misfortune, and that is why 
it is demanding compensation for nuclear weapons. Therefore, if 
our state hands over the whole nuclear arsenal to Russia, it 
will be left alone with its problems and the world community 
will forget about Ukraine. Another paradoxical fact ensues -- 
Ukraine needs nuclear materials for its electric power stations 
and buys them from Russia. It pays vast amounts of money for 
this, and it has not received a cent for that nuclear arsenal, 
which it handed over to Russia.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Academy of Sciences' institute of 
sociology has carried out a survey among the population. Thus, 
45 percent of people questioned are in favor of Ukraine 
retaining the status of a nuclear state and only a third want 
its nuclear disarmament. The popularity of politicians was also 
unexpected. Former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma is most popular. 
President Kravchuk is in second place, with Rukh Chairman 
Vyacheslav Chornovil third and Supreme Soviet Chairman Ivan 
Plyushch fourth. However, most consider Leonid Kravchuk 
nevertheless to be the top contender for the new election of 
president.

Himself In White Paper"] 
  [Text] This event has not been announced and will not be 
released in any communique, nor official statement. Top secret. 
However, the defense council convened by President Mitterrand 
yesterday at the Elysee Palace [president's office] at 1700 
certainly is a major test for the present cohabitation. 
  The participants were -- besides the head of state -- Prime 
Minister Balladur, Defense Minister Francois Leotard, Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe, Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery, the 
chiefs of staff, Admiral Jacques Lanxade, General Amedee Monchal 
(Army), General Vincent Lanata (Air Force) and Admiral Coatanea 
(Navy), Deputy General to the Armament Authority Henri Conze and 
the secretary general to national defense, Admiral Lerche. 
  The agenda included the White Paper on defense which the 
government would like to publish in January and the preparation 
of the bill on the military program for the years 1995-2000 that 
should be discussed by parliament next spring. In fact, the 
most important issues facing the council were the French 
position vis-a-vis NATO and the future of the French deterrent 
force, the trends of which should be determined for the next 10 
or 15 years by the White Paper. 
  Francois Mitterrand, who did not want to be directly 
involved 
in the preparation of the White Paper requested by Edouar 
Balladur, could give his support to it if it does not contradict 
his fundamental options in the field of defense. This is the 
reason why this defense council was organized -- another council 
should take place late in December or early in January -- so 
that the head of state can examine the final drafting of the 
document. 
  The Elysee and the government point out that the French 
policy toward NATO is developing without jolts in cohabitation. 
The joint opinion -- in view of the NATO summit on 10 January 
-- is that progress will have to be made in affirming the 
necessity of a European defense body, through the Western 
European Union. The complementarity and the autonomy of 
decision of such a body vis-a- vis the Atlantic Alliance will 
have to be clearly defined. In the same way, if the government, 
and to a smaller extent, the president wish to participate more 
actively in the NATO structure, it is out of the question to 
come back under the integrated command of the Organization, 
which France wishes to see deeply reformed. 
  The nuclear issue was much more intricate. The majority in 
government, mainly the RPR [Rally for the Republic] -- already 
opposed to the moratorium on nuclear tests decided by Francois 
Mitterrand -- recently seemed to support a possible development 
of the French doctrine to a "strong vs. the weak" deterrence 
which implies the use of miniaturized nuclear weapons called 
"beheading weapons." This development is totally opposed to the 
position of Francois Mitterrand, who advocates leveling strike 
force in a context of "strict sufficiency" with the objective of 
reducing world arsenals and fighting against proliferation. 
  The government will probably fix dates for the tests which 
he 
deems must be resumed in limited number, while waiting to 
control the situation. On the other hand, Francois Leotard, 
with the support or at the request of Edouard Balladur, recently 
stated -- in public and on several occasions -- that France 
rules out the possibility of heading for a "doctrine of use". 
In this field, attention is given not to break the consensus. 
But it is legitimate to wonder to what extent Edouard Balladur 
supports a policy of a thorough modernization of the nuclear 
arsenal, since it is quite obvious that he does -- and will not 
in the coming years -- have the necessary budget for this 
purpose.

  [Text] Bursa, Nov. 27 (AA) -- Police have seized 4.5 kg of 
uranium in this nortwestern city and arrested three Georgians 
trying to sell the material intended for use to produce nuclear 
weapons, officials said on Saturday. 
  They said police, acting on a tipoff that the Georgians who 
came to Turkey about a week ago were looking for a market to 
sell the uranium, contacted them as potential buyers. 
  When police tried to detain the Georgians, a brief clash 
broke out and the sellers were wounded and arrested. 
  The Georgians were asking $150,000 for one kg of uranium. 
  It was not immediately clear how the Georgians acquired the 
uranium but after the collapse of the former Soviet Union there 
have been widespread reports of stolen nuclear materials. 
  The seized uranium was sent to Turkey's Atomic Energy 
Institute for further research.

  [Text] Ankara, Nov 29 (AFP) -- Turkish police are hunting 
5.5 kilograms (12 pounds) of missing uranium, which may have 
been stolen from Chernobyl nuclear power station, police said 
Monday. 
  It is part of a 10 kilogram batch of the radioactive 
material, the remainder of which was recovered Thursday in 
Bursa, western Turkey, in an undercover operation. 
  Three Georgians were slightly wounded when they were 
arrested 
after trying to sell the uranium to disguised police officers. 
Their identities were still not revealed Monday by police. 
  The seized material has been sent to a nuclear research 
centre in Istanbul for tests, as police look for links with a 
smaller haul of uranium in October in Istanbul. 
  In the earlier incident police arrested five Turks and three 
Iranians allegedly attempting to sell 2.5 kilos of uranium, 
which the Istanbul research centre said was of insufficient 
quality for the manufacture of a nuclear bomb. 
  Five of the group, including one Iranian, were jailed for 
the 
"illegal trafficking of nuclear material" by a court in Istanbul. 
  Parts of the Chernobyl nuclear power station in Ukraine are 
still in operation despite a massive explosion in one of its 
reactors in April 1986 which caused the world's worst peace-time 
nuclear disaster, releasing a cloud of radioactive dust across 
Europe.

<F P=106> [By Peter Mackler] </F>
  [Text] Rome, Dec 1 (AFP) -- Diplomatic chiefs from 52 
countries struggled through a second day of talks Wednesday with 
little agreement in sight on using Russian peacekeepers to 
police the former Soviet Union. 
  Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti doubted whether anything 
more than a vague statement of principles would emerge from the 
two-day session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE). 
  "The subject is not completely ripe for a decision," Cotti 
told reporters as foreign ministers and other representatives of 
the CSCE states continued their deliberations. 
  "There will not be an absolute consensus but a rather broad 
accord in principle with strict conditions," he said. 
  Delegates here said the ministers were generally agreed on 
the need to strenghten peacekeeping structures across a Europe 
plagued by ethnic and national strife. 
  But Moscow's request for a mandate in the former Soviet 
republics drew warnings of caution from several nations and 
opposition from the Baltic states, where Russia still has troops. 
  They fear Russia could use peacekeeping operations as a 
pretext for maintaining control over its former domain. 
  The Russians, who have deployed forces in such hotspots as 
Georgia and Tajikistan, have sought authorisation from the CSCE 
or United Nations to give them international legitimacy and 
financing. 
  But officials here said questions remained on the system of 
financing, the relationship of Russian troops to their 
international supervisors and other issues. 
  A Swiss diplomat, who asked not to be named, said the CSCE 
would ask a group of experts to study the matter and report back 
in a few weeks. The aim is to reach a conclusion by a meeting 
of CSCE senior officials in Prague in March. 
  "I understand the fears of certain countries," Cotti said. 
"But it is in everybody's interest to see a country, above all a 
large country, operating within the framework of international 
law." 
  The Swiss minister said another subject of hot debate here 
was pressure on the Ukraine to dismantle the nuclear arsenal it 
inherited from the defunct Soviet Union. 
  Sources said Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev asked 
the CSCE to condemn the Ukraine for balking on disarmament and 
unconditional ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction 
Treaty [START I). 
  Ukraine Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko reiterated here 
Tuesday that his country was moving towards gradual elimination 
of its stockpile but required security guarantees and financial 
help.

<F P=106> [Article by Ernst-Ludwig von Aster: "Training for the </F>
Super- MCA -- Russian Nuclear Engineers Rehearse Emergency 
Scenario in Greifswald"] 
  [Text] The warning lights flash frantically and a shrill 
screech issues from the alarm siren. Dimitri Kljuev keeps calm. 
He stands by the red phone, his eyes glued to the control 
panel, which shows a leak in the first circuit -- in the reactor 
area. As Kola reactor block IV shift supervisor, he gives brief 
instructions. In a short time the 440-megawatt plant is back 
under control. Kljuev and his six colleagues take a break. 
"Tomorrow we really get down to business," says the Russian 
nuclear engineer. 
  Peter Reibert, who is in charge of the Greifswald nuclear 
power station training center's 25 computers, will be giving 
Kljuev and his colleagues something to sweat about. In an 
inconspicuous- looking building, CAG, an offshoot of the former 
Greifswald nuclear power station, simulates the nightmare of 
many an environment policymaker: "Our program embraces 
everything, from a measuring instrument breakdown right up to 
the worst emergency scenarios." 
  The team from the Russian island of Kola will spend three 
weeks in front of the operating panel, where they feel quite at 
home: The control room is identical to their Russian model, and 
all the reactor reactions are simulated in real time. The 
crucial difference is that Greifswald stores almost 150 standard 
accidents to which WWER-213 reactors have succumbed, whether 
they have occurred in the Ukraine, Bulgaria, or Hungary. "We 
train for emergencies here," says Reibert. Every move that the 
operating personnel makes is recorded on camera and discussed. 
When necessary, critical situations can be repeated and 
analyzed. 
  The simulator in Greifswald was originally intended for 
in-house use, training personnel for the local nuclear power 
station in GDR days. When the reactor was shut down for safety 
reasons after unification, the simulator was retained, and the 
Federal Environment Ministry has been financing additional 
training for eastern European nuclear engineers there to the 
tune of about 2 million German marks a year since 1992. More 
than 20 reactor crews have taken the three- week crash course to 
date. 
  There are over 40 plants in the WWER class -- not to be 
confused with the Chernobyl type -- in eastern Europe; the low 
level of training, in the former Soviet Union in particular, is 
scandalous. Moscow had all the know-how for handling atomic 
plants, but the collapse of the USSR brought a split in 
responsibility for atomic piles as well. "New states, such as 
the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Lithuania are now cut off from the 
brains of the nuclear industry and left on their own with their 
reactors," says Bernd Mueller, head of CAG. 
  This notwithstanding, none of these states is keen to forego 
the use of nuclear power. The reactors -- none of which meets 
western safety standards -- are still running. "A further drop 
in standards is only to be expected," says Reibert. Skilled 
staff are emigrating as well. In the Ukraine, for instance, 
some plants can only run five shifts instead of the normal 
seven, while the Russians have withdrawn all their technicians 
from some reactors in Kazakhstan. There are hardly any 
facilities for training reinforcements. Training takes place on 
the job, and knowledge is often handed down by word of mouth, 
the "elders" passing their experience on to the younger 
generation. When they arrive in Greifswald and confront the 
entire accident potential inherent in the plants where they 
work, it is a nerve-racking experience. "After four or five 
hours' constant stress, we give them the afternoon off, 
otherwise it's too much for them," says trainer Reibert.

Unit, chief of the PREPHA program of the National Office for 
Aerospace Studies and Research (ONERA): "Toward a Super-Ramjet: 
Cooperation With the Moscow Central Institute of Aircraft 
Engines"] 
  [Text] Since the spring of 1992, the ONERA [National Office 
for Aerospace Studies and Research] and its industrial partners 
Aerospatiale, Dassault Aviation, SEP [European Propulsion 
Company], and SNECMA [National Company for the Study and 
Construction of Aircraft Engines] have been involved in a series 
of cooperation activities with several research and study 
centers in the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States] on the 
subject of the super-ramjet and associated technologies. This 
strategy is part of the wider national PREPHA (Research and 
Technology Program for Advanced Hypersonic Propulsion) program. 
  This means that close relations are being maintained with 
such prestigious institutes as the MAI [Moscow Aviation 
Institute] or the institutes of the Siberian branch of the 
Novosibirsk Academy of Sciences (Institute of Theoretical and 
Applied Mechanics, Thermophysics Institute, and others). In 
this context and with the support of the DRET [Research, 
Studies, and Technologies Directorate of the Ministry of 
Defense], the ONERA has been able to develop a particularly 
fruitful cooperation with the CIAM [Central Institute of 
Aircraft Engines Moscow], whose activities are located on two 
sites: In Moscow, where most of the theoretical and laboratory 
work is done, and in Turayevo (50 kms from Moscow), where the 
institute has an impressive complex of industrial testing 
facilities. 
  Under the leadership of its present director Donat 
Ogorodnikov, the CIAM, which is specializing in the study and 
development of aeronautical engines, devotes a substantial 
amount of its activity to the study of the super-ramjet, and in 
particular the hydrogen- propulsed super-ramjet. Existing 
cooperation focuses on two main areas: 
  -- the development of computation codes in aerothermics and 
in aerothermochemistry; 
  -- the in-flight experimentation of an axisymmetrical super- 
ramjet. 
  High-Performance Digital Diagrams [subhead] 
  Concerning the development of computation codes, the CIAM is 
suggesting digital diagrams derived from that of Godunov and 
which are particularly economical in terms of computation time. 
Areas of joint activity include a comparative evaluation, based 
on the computation of a series of test cases, of the CIAM 
diagrams and those used at the ONERA. When this evaluation is 
finished, Russian specialists will come to France to help their 
French colleagues embed CIAM digital diagrams in some of their 
codes, notably those dealing with supersonic aerothermochemistry. 
  Other than the initial work of selecting and embedding the 
most appropriate digital diagrams, ongoing research will be 
continued within the scope of the PREPHA program aimed at 
defining and validating the models which best represent the 
physical phenomena governing aerothermics and 
aerothermochemistry of the super-ramjet. The CIAM and certain 
Novosibirsk-based institutes will be able to contribute their 
experiences and their databases in this field, but ways of 
cooperation on this issue remain to be decided. 
  Although the development of computation codes is a very 
promising area of cooperation in the medium and long term, 
in-flight testing of a super-ramjet is, in the short time, the 
most beneficial. 
<H5>  First Test Inconclusive </H5>
  In November 1991, the CIAM conducted an initial in-flight 
test of a hydrogen axisymmetrical super-ramjet. A stabilized 
supersonic combustion phase could not be reached during this 
test because the carrier rocket's trajectory control was 
insufficient and the hydrogen flow control was set too close to 
the limits for unpriming [desamorcage]. As a result, the engine 
operated only a few, very short moments in supersonic mode. 
  During the summer of 1992, ONERA's financial contribution, 
thanks to support by DRET, enabled the CIAM to start up 
preparations again for a second experiment, which had been 
interrupted for lack of funding. 
  A second in-flight test was carried out on 17 November 1992 
from a military base located between Priozersk and Baykonur in 
Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan government officials and scientists 
attended the testing alongside French and Russian scientists. 
<H5>  Second Joint French-Russian Test </H5>
  The design of the axisymmetric super-ramjet tested by the 
CIAM resembles that of the ESOPE engine tested on the ground by 
the ONERA at the beginning of the seventies in the S4MA wind 
tunnel at its Modane Avrieux center in the French Savoy region. 
The hydrogen combustion, which ignites as soon as the engine 
reaches Mach 3.5, takes place initially in subsonic mode because 
of an injection of hydrogen in the zone upstream of the 
combustion chamber. When the Mach number goes beyond five, the 
injection is distributed between the upstream and downstream 
zones of the combustion chamber to stabilize combustion in 
supersonic mode. 
  This engine and its control system were developed by the 
CIAM 
on a special small-sized test bench in its Turayevo center. The 
mechanical design and manufacture were subsequently handed over 
to the Soyuz development division located near this center. 
  The engine does not fly autonomously. The combined 
engine/control system/tank module is tandem-mounted on a rocket, 
derived from a ground-to-air missile, which ensures its 
acceleration to up to Mach 5.5. This rocket was modified by the 
Fakel engineering and design office which perfected the control 
system in such a way as to ensure a trajectory which is 
sufficiently close to the nominal trajectory enabling the 
super-ramjet to perform well. 
  The rules controlling the hydrogen flow injected into the 
upstream and downstream zones of the combustion chamber are 
based on controlling the priming of the combustion throat [veine 
de combustion] (supersonic flow in the whole chamber). These 
rules were modified for the second flight test to improve the 
available unpriming margin and to enable the engine withstand a 
possible incidence intake during the supersonic combustion phase. 
<H5>  Encouraging Results </H5>
  The trajectory executed by the rocket during the second 
experiment was much nearer to the nominal trajectory than in 
1991. A tank pressurization problem limited the flow of hydrogen 
injected, independently of any regulation, as soon as the 
engine's regenerative cooling system started working at full 
capacity. However, supersonic combustion could be stabilized for 
about 15 seconds. 
  Because the engine remains connected to the carrier rocket, 
it is impossible to obtain a direct measure of the thrust. 
However, the wide use of pressure and temperature gauges along 
the length of the engine should enable the fluid dynamics into 
the engine to be understood better and therefore to facilitate 
the comprehension of physical phenomena governing the 
performance of the super-ramjet. In addition, this will also 
lead to establishing test cases in real, well-documented flight 
conditions for the development and validation of computation 
codes. 
<H5>  An Operation To Be Continued... </H5>
  Although this second experiment was relatively successful 
with the stabilization of combustion in supersonic mode during a 
significant length of time, it should be noted that because of 
the lack of hydrogen flow this operation was far from nearing 
the unpriming limits, therefore at a weak thrust. They were 
also unable to check the efficiency of the hydrogen flow control 
system, whose technology is somewhat old-fashioned, in 
regulating the hydrogen flow to avoid unpriming of the 
combustion throat. 
  Continuing the operation should initially allow the tank 
pressurization problem to be solved, thus avoiding the engine's 
operation at nominal capacity and allowing its in-flight 
control. Next, the engine should be equipped with more 
finely-tuned instruments, possibly based on Western technology, 
and the carrier rocket should be developed to enable a maximum 
Mach flight number to be reached. This should allow us to 
improve our knowledge of the super-ramjet and the quality of the 
validation of computation codes. 
<H5>  Not Just a First Step </H5>
  It is clear that the super-ramjet of the axisymmetrical type 
is not the best propulsion technology for a hypersonic vehicle. 
Indeed, the expanse of wet surfaces, and therefore losses 
through friction and heat exchange, slightly limits the maximum 
thrust level. In addition, it is difficult to combine the 
highly integrated propulsion system needed on hypersonic 
vehicles with the circular section of each engine module. The 
current operation, which benefits from the advances being made 
at the CIAM, should therefore be considered as an initial phase 
making it possible to: 
  -- acquire expertise in the development and experimentation 
of a super-ramjet; 
  -- set up a database for the validation of computation 
codes. 
  The PREPHA program, although it involves the study of large 
two- dimensional super-ramjets (chamber entrance section: 1 
square meter under study, 5 square decimeters in ground testing, 
to be compared with 1 square decimeter for the CIAM engine) will 
be the first to benefit from this cooperation. 
  It is above all in the longer term that the evaluation of 
the 
working methods and skills of the CIAM in the field of design 
and testing the super-ramjet will optimize conditions for a 
cooperation program which aims to experiment the autonomous 
flight of a super- ramjet whose design is closer to future needs 
and future applications of hypersonic air-breathing propulsion. 
<H5>  The Super-Ramjet </H5>
  The ramjet benefits from natural recompression linked to a 
slowing down in air intake flow rate. For Mach numbers under 6, 
it can be interesting to slow the flow down to subsonic level to 
ensure the best combustion rate without thrust levels being 
strained by too weak pressure recuperation levels in the air 
intake. Beyond this limit (about Mach 6), recompression to 
subsonic flow causes precombustion pressure and temperature 
losses which do not allow enough energy to be added to the flow 
and to transform it into thrust through a sonic nozzle. It is 
therefore preferable to limit recompression to a moderately 
supersonic Mach number (2 to 4) on condition that the techniques 
to stablize supersonic combustion flow are functioning. This is 
super-ramjet mode. 
  Studies carried out over the past few years on the subject 
of 
partially air-breathing propulsion systems for space launchers 
have led French teams to estimate that limiting the 
air-breathing phase to the Mach-O to Mach-6 level will not 
improve the overall performance in terms of net mass in orbit in 
relation to full rocket propulsion: "Air-breating technology, 
which is heavier, does not pay its way." To develop this field, 
a super-ramjet is required capable of reaching Mach numbers over 
10 and, which is more likely, close to 12. Although subsonic 
combustion ramjet technology is relatively well mastered in 
France thanks to a number of exploratory developments and to the 
development of the ASMP and the (incomplete) ANS [expansions 
unknown], some research into super-ramjets has been conducted 
during the sixties and seventies (ESOPE: tests at Mach 6 under 
forced control [conduite forcee]). This is why PREPHA's main 
objective is to improve our knowledge and our tools for the 
design of the super-ramjet, a potential solution for entirely 
recoverable and reusable launchers in the future.

  [Text] Rome, Dec 2 (AFP) -- Italy will aid Russia to 
dismantle its nuclear weapons, under an agreement signed here by 
Foreign Ministers Beniamino Andreatta and Andrey Kosyrev, the 
Italian Foreign Ministry said Thursday. 
  The aid will be in the sectors of monitoring the 
environmental and health aspects and protecting the personnel 
carrying out the destruction of the weapons. 
  The agreement, which will cost Italy 10 billion lire (six 
million dollars), has to be ratified by parliament. 
  Kosyrev has been in Rome since Monday for the ministerial 
meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(CSCE).

  [Text] Tehran Dec. 2, IRNA -- An informed political source 
here Thursday categorically denied Western circles claim on 
conclusion of a long-range missile test treaty between the 
Islamic Republic of Iran and the Democratic Peoples Republic of 
Korea (DPRK). 
  Recently some American and European media carried reports on 
the likelihood of Pyongyang's selling long-range Scud missiles 
to Tehran as well as testing of the Nodong-1 missiles in Iran. 
  The Iranian source reiterated that Tehran and Pyongyang have 
signed no contract either on testing or purchase of long-range 
missiles. 
  Experts believe that bringing up of such issues aims at 
intriguing the regional states, the rich Arab states in 
particular, to purchase more Western arms. He further added 
that launching of the so-called joint maneuvers of the Persian 
gulf littoral states with Western countries are also in this 
direction. 
  He made it clear that manufacture and purchase of 
conventional weapons for defending the territorial integrity of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran is very natural. 
  He said the West by raising such fabricated news aims at 
intriguing an arms race in the region. 
  President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in his recent 
interview with Egyptian journalist, Hassanain Haykal, said that 
Iran enjoys a powerful missile technology.

  [Text] Vienna, Dec. 3 (YONHAP) -- Hans Blix, 
director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA), reported a serious deterioration in the continuity of 
North Korea's nuclear safeguards to a meeting of the IAEA Board 
of Governors Friday. 
  Some cameras, which have been monitoring North Korea's 
nuclear facilities and material, are no longer running, he said. 
  It is becoming more difficult for the IAEA to confirm that 
North Korea is not diverting declared material from peaceful 
purposes, Blix told the board. 
  It has become impossible for the IAEA to have meaningful 
assurance that North Korea is using its nuclear material and 
facilities for peaceful purposes, he said. 
  If North Korea does not cooperate with the IAEA, he warned, 
the inspection continuity of the nuclear safeguards might 
deteriorate to a state from where it cannot be restored. 
  The IAEA must visit and inspect nuclear material and 
facilities in North Korea to determine if North Korea has 
diverted declared material from peaceful purposes. 
  North Korea has not allowed the IAEA to do normal inspection 
activities at its nuclear facilities since February and the 
situation is worsening as time goes by, he said. 
  He said that the IAEA is ready for dialogue and consultation 
with Pyongyang and to send an inspection mission anytime North 
Korea is ready to accept it to carry out its work for 
full-fledged implementation of nuclear safeguards, including 
access to additional information and visits to additional places.

  [Text] Vienna, Dec. 3 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors adjourned its meeting 
Friday after it had agreed on the need for urgent action to help 
resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Unless Pyongyang takes positive measures, including the 
acceptance of IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities, the 
North Korean nuclear issue will cease to be a subject of 
negotiations but a target of action by the international 
community. 
  During Friday's session, the United States and France 
expressed grave concern over the possibility of the use of 
nuclear materials by North Korea for the development of weapons. 
  They said their countries will have to take strong follow-up 
measures, including reference of the issue back to the United 
Nations Security Council. 
  Nelson Sieverling, U.S. [IAEA] governor, said that if North 
Korea does not accept IAEA inspection at an early date, there 
would not be a third round of high-level U.S.-North Korean 
talks. The United States will have no choice but to refer the 
issue to the U.N. Security Council, he said. 
  Sieverling made the remark after expressing grave concern 
over a report by IAEA Director-general Hans Blix that the IAEA 
could not give a "meaningful assurance" to the governors that 
North Korea was using nuclear materials only for peaceful 
purposes. 
  The United States would not only continue its negotiations 
with North Korea but also have to refer the question to the U.N. 
Security Council if IAEA inspections are not taking place in 
North Korea and continuity of nuclear safeguards is maintained, 
he said. 
  But the situation has not yet reached the point where it 
could not be turned around, Sieverling said, urging North Korea 
to accept the IAEA's routine inspections as soon as possible. 
  The French Governor urged the IAEA to convene another Board 
of Governors meeting before its regularly scheduled one next 
year to work out countermeasures if there is no progress in the 
issue. 
  It is necessary, he said, for the international community to 
take strong action including sanctions against North Korea by 
referring the question to the U.N. Security Council. 
  The governor from Switzerland criticized the North Korean 
argument of "special circumstances" and urged Pyongyang to 
immediately and completely implement its nuclear safeguards 
agreement. 
  Governors of other countries also shared their opinion that 
time was running out on North Korea for the resolution of its 
nuclear issue and all criticized Pyongyang in firm and 
unprecedented tones. 
  Against these remarks, North Korea's ambassador to Vienna, 
Yun Ho-chin, repeated his country's old rhetoric that the issue 
had been raised by "some officials of the IAEA Secretariat" and 
that it was controlled behind-the-scenes by the United States. 
  Therefore, he said, responsibility in the North Korean 
nuclear issue rests entirely on the IAEA and the United States. 
  The nuclear question would be automatically solved once the 
United States and North Korea worked out the so-called package 
deal aimed at improving bilateral relations, he said. 
  Continuity in nuclear safeguards in North Korea or any 
damage 
in the IAEA's surveillance mechanism also rested with the IAEA 
because the IAEA had refused to conduct inspections, Yun said. 
  Ronald Walker, chairman of the Board of Governors, in 
summary, stated the board's complete support for handling of the 
question by the IAEA Secretariat and the director-general. 
  While urging North Korea to accept IAEA inspections, Walker 
expressed concern over proliferation in North Korea's 
non-compliance of nuclear safeguards. North Korea's refusal to 
accept IAEA inspections has to be regarded as a challenge to the 
entire nuclear non-proliferation regime, he added. 
  Walker asked Blix to report the Board of Governors' position 
to the United Nations.

  [Text] Seoul, Dec. 4 (YONHAP) -- The results of Friday's 
North Korea-U.S. contact were insufficient but worth looking at, 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Saturday in Seoul's 
optimistic response to a meeting that officials described as 
having "substance." 
  Asked his initial response to the contact, Han said the 
results were "insufficient. But we do need to examine them." 
  Tom Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state, and 
Ho 
Chong, deputy chief of the North Korean mission to the United 
Nations, met in New York for approximately two hours. 
  Kim Sam-hun, ambassador in charge of nuclear issues, refused 
to say what was discussed in the New York meeting but described 
it as both positive and unfulfilling. 
  "Seoul and Washington will need to examine what went on at 
Friday's meeting. Any decision has to wait until after the full 
review," Kim said. 
  The meeting was Pyongyang's first official response to a 
contact Nov. 24, where Washington explained the results of a 
summit a day earlier between Seoul and Washington. 
  Washington reiterated two demands before the next high-level 
dialogue with Pyongyang -- that North Korea allow continued 
safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and 
talk with South Korea on denuclearizing the Korean peninsula. 
  Despite reports of nearing a deadline on the issue, Foreign 
Ministry officials strongly indicated that the mood in Seoul and 
Washington is that the choice is still for dialogue. 
  "We have said all along that we will try to solve the 
problem 
through dialogue. This effort will continue as long as they 
have a chance," Kim said. 
  Seoul officials refused to say which of the two demands made 
progress, but a White House spokesman said North Korea did not 
give any clear indications on accepting international nuclear 
inspections. 
  North Korea has been telling the IAEA that it will allow 
only 
a change of films and batteries in inspection cameras, but 
inside sources said it has been more flexible on the inspection 
scope in contacts with the United States. 
  Pyongyang and Washington may hold further contacts after the 
South Korean and U.S. Governments examine the results of the New 
York meeting, Kim said.

<F P=106> [Report by Washington-based correspondent Chin Chang-ho] </F>
  [Text] An official from the North Korean UN mission met 
with U.S. State Department officials at the UN Headquarters in 
New York at 1000 on 3 December and conveyed the official North 
Korean position regarding the permission to inspect part of 
North Korea's nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA]. This is North Korea's affirmative response [as 
published] to the 24 November U.S. demand that North Korea allow 
nuclear inspections in the first place, as agreed upon by the 
ROK and the United States in their Washington summit. This 
affirmative response of North Korea could represent a 
significant step forward toward resolving the North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  The unofficial North Korea-U.S. contact on 3 December was 
attended by Thomas Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of state 
for East Asia and Pacific affairs; Kenneth Quinones, official in 
charge of North Korean affairs of the State Department; and Ho 
Chong, deputy head of North Korea's UN mission. The contact 
lasted about two hours. THE WASHINGTON POST reported that the 
U.S.-North Korean contact in New York was a very positive one 
and that significant progress was made regarding the IAEA 
inspection and the nuclear inspection monitoring cameras 
installed in the nuclear facilities in Yongbyon. The paper 
reported that a U.S. official said that further discussions with 
the North Korean side are necessary as to the specific points. 
  The paper reported that the U.S. State Department officials 
proposed that President Bill Clinton and the IAEA closely 
discuss the North Korean proposal contained in the 3 December 
response. 
  The paper reported that the U.S. officials said that a more 
specific review ought to be made as to the technical matters 
connected with the appropriateness of the new inspection and 
that the United States will discuss the overall situation with 
the ROK before it sends an official reply to North Korea. 
  U.S. State Department spokeswoman Shelley, in a routine 
briefing on that day, said that an unofficial contact was made 
between the United States and North Korea based on the latter's 
2 December request for a contact in New York. She added that 
the U.S. Government will first discuss the response with its 
allies before it makes a decision on the next step toward North 
Korea. 
  It has been learned that the U.S. State Department's 
decision 
on the next step means the resumption of the New York contact 
next week. 
  The ROK Embassy in Washington hinted that although the North 
Korean response in the North Korea-U.S. contact was far short of 
U.S. expectations, it was not totally pessimistic.

  [Text] Tokyo, Dec. 6 (YONHAP) -- The United States has been 
studying the possibility of bombing North Korea's nuclear 
facilities and has concluded that it is impossible, a Japanese 
newspaper reported Monday in a dispatch from Washington. 
  The MAINICHI SHIMBUN quoted a senior U.S. official as saying 
that attacking North Korea's nuclear facilities would be very 
difficult, although President Bill Clinton and Defense Secretary 
Les Aspin had said they would not rule out military action 
against the communist country. 
  The Pentagon has been looking into possible options, 
including a pre-emptive air strike, with the understanding that 
military action will be difficult if Pyongyang acquires nuclear 
weapons, the U.S. official said. 
  But Washington came to the conclusion that it is impossible 
to destroy North Korea's nuclear facilities with missiles or 
bombs if they are moved underground, he said. 
  Bombardment of reactors or nuclear fuel storage sites was 
ruled out as it is most likely to result in a release of 
radioactivity, he said. 
  In addition, Washington had to consider the possibility of 
Pyongyang's retaliating and devastating South Korea, the 
MAINICHI observed. 
  Seoul is a strong opponent of an attack and, considering all 
of the odds, a military attack on North Korea's nuclear 
facilities is highly unlikely, the newspaper commented. 
  The Japanese daily noted there were calls for an air attack 
if the situation worsens from conservative U.S. congressmen and 
some military experts, but they lost ground with Washington's 
reaching this conclusion.

<F P=106> [By Chin Chang-uk from Washington] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned that the U.S. Government will 
soon hold a meeting at the White House to study measures 
concerning North Korea's response delivered on 3 December 
regarding the inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities, and 
has established a policy to refuse the North's proposal and 
present a new proposal. 
  It is known to be a growing possibility that the U.S. 
Government will make the "negative conclusion" because the 
dominating opinion is that although the North's proposal 
delivered through the nonofficial contact in New York shows 
partial progress, the North's condition of accepting limited 
inspection [chehanjok sachal] on its nuclear facilities is not 
acceptable. 
  It is anticipated that the U.S. Government will eventually 
notify North Korea of the refusal and repeat its demand for the 
inspection of two undeclared facilities, which North Korea is 
obstinately refusing. 
  According to a U.S. Government source on 6 December, it is 
known that the message will be conveyed to North Korea during 
the contact in New York on 6 or 7 December, after approval by 
President Bill Clinton. 
  The source says the U.S. new proposal suggests that if North 
Korea accepts inspection of two undeclared facilities, the date 
for the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks may be confirmed.

  [Text] Baghdad, Dec 6 (AFP)--A first consignment of 
irradiated fuel from Iraq's nuclear programme has been flown to 
Russia for disposal, a U.N. source said Monday [6 December]. 
  Maurizio Zifferero, assistant director general of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has said around 35 
kilograms (77 pounds) of irradiated fuel is to be transferred to 
Russia. 
  A first shipment was flown out on board an Antonov-124 
transport plane from al-Habbaniyah airport west of Baghdad on 
Sunday, the U.N. source said without specifying the quantity. 
  "The second and final consignment will be shipped out early 
next year," the source said. 
  Iraq agreed to have its irradiated nuclear fuel removed 
during a visit in April by Zifferero at the head of a team of 
nuclear inspectors. 
  Zifferero has refused to give the precise cost of the multi- 
million-dollar operation, which is to paid for by Iraq. 
  The IAEA dispatched around 12 kilogrammes (26 pounds) of 
enriched uranium to Russia last month. 
  The United Nations ordered the destruction of Iraq's nuclear 
programme under Gulf war ceasefire resolutions eliminating its 
weapons of mass destruction.

  [Text] Seoul, Dec. 8 (YONHAP) -- Presidents Kim Yong-sam 
and Bill Clinton agreed in a telephone conversation Tuesday that 
North Korea's nuclear inspection offer contains some elements 
that deserve a positive reaction from South Korea and the United 
States, but that it is insufficient and unsatisfactory as a 
whole. 
  The two presidents felt that the offer made by North Korea 
on 
Friday requires basic consideration regarding the future of the 
Korean peninsula, and agreed to take advantage of the 
opportunity within reason, Presidential Spokesman Yi Kyong-chae 
said Wednesday. 
  Yi said that making use of the opportunity within reason 
meant that the presidents had agreed to consider elements of the 
offer and not reject it entirely. 
  In their 30-minute conversation, Clinton conveyed the firm 
and resolute U.S. stance on the North Korean nuclear issue and 
Kim stressed the need for close cooperation between their 
countries in dealing with the issue, Yi said. 
  They agreed to continue discussing details of a joint South 
Korea-U.S. approach to the North Korean nuclear issue at a 
working level. 
  Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for foreign 
affairs and national security, will fly to Washington to meet 
with National Security Adviser Anthony Lake for talks on the 
approach. 
  Yi said the presidents discussed tariffication of rice and 
rice market opening, but he refused to reveal the content of 
their discussion because negotiations between the two 
governments are under way in Geneva. 
  The negotiations are expected to make progress on the basis 
of the presidential conversation, officials said. 
  On Dec. 3, Kim reportedly met a high-ranking U.S. Government 
official at his office to ask for U.S. understanding of Korea's 
unique situation in Uruguay Round negotiations on rice market 
opening. 
  The telephone conversation was the first between the two 
presidents using a hot line that was opened in July.

  [Text] Moscow, Dec. 8 (YONHAP) -- The Russian Government 
said Tuesday that North Korea's acceptance of partial nuclear 
inspection represents a step forward, but not sufficient enough 
to lead to a fundamental solution of the problem. 
  North Korea's expression of its willingness to accept 
international inspection on some nuclear facilities showed it 
was turning to a positive position in light of the opinion of 
the international community, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Gregory 
Karasin told reporters. 
  The proposal does not, however, lead to a fundamental 
solution of the problem, which calls for full implementation of 
its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and a 
guarantee of uninterrupted nuclear inspection, Karasin said. 
  The Russian Government hopes the problem of banning nuclear 
proliferation on the Korean peninsula will be resolved through 
constructive dialogue and mutual cooperation between North Korea 
and the International Atomic Energy Agency at an early date, he 
said.

  [Text] The DPRK Embassy in Russia hosted a gathering with 
Russian social scientists at the embassy building on 2 December. 
Functionaries from the Orientalism Institute, the Far East 
Affairs Institute, and the Human Affairs Institute of the 
Academy of Sciences of Russia, and professors and doctors from 
the Philosophy Department of the Moscow University were invited 
to the meeting. 
  DPRK Ambassador to Russia Son Song-pil and embassy staff 
were 
present. Ambassador Son spoke first. 
  The ambassador said that our country has achieved great 
results of socialist construction in all sectors under the wise 
leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  He exposed details of the vicious maneuver by the U.S. 
imperialists and international reactionaries aimed at stifling 
[apsal] our socialist system under the pretext of the suspicion 
of nonexistent nuclear development, and noted: 
  As the world knows, our country has neither the will nor the 
ability to produce nuclear weapons. Even if we can produce 
them, for what would they be? The nuclear problem was raised in 
our country as the United States posed nuclear threats to us by 
deploying about 1,000 nuclear weapons in South Korea and 
conducting the Team Spirit joint military exercise, a nuclear 
war exercise. 
  Therefore, in order to fundamentally solve the nuclear 
problem of the Korean peninsula, talks must be held between the 
United States, the nuclear problem maker, and the DPRK, its 
victim. Pressure or threats will not work with us. 
  The ambassador pointed out that the United States has been 
delaying the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks while demanding 
unjust conditions, and said: 
  We proposed a package solution method, which requires that 
the United States and the DPRK decide what each side should do 
to resolve the nuclear issue and implement their duties at the 
same time. If the United States accepts our proposal and the 
DPRK-U.S. talks are successfully held, the nuclear issue of the 
Korean peninsula will be fundamentally resolved. 
  After exposing the fact that Japan and the South Korean 
authorities are viciously maneuvering to break up DPRK-U.S. 
talks, the ambassador stressed that their maneuver is aimed at 
accelerating their own nuclear weapons development and nuclear 
armament by using the suspicion of our nuclear development as a 
pretext. 
  The ambassador urged the United States to abandon its 
insidious purpose and accede sincerely to the third round of 
DPRK-U.S. talks, and he continued: 
  Our position is clear. We will not hold talks while being 
under pressure. The United States must clearly know who its 
dialogue counterpart is. If the United States breaks up 
DPRK-U.S. talks and continues to pose the nuclear threat to us, 
we will take a corresponding measure [ungdanghan chochi] of 
retreating the suspension of the effectuation of our declaration 
to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  We are ready for both dialogue and war. We have a firm 
economy, a strong national defense, and the might of 
single-hearted unity of the people who are united firmly around 
the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il. No force in the world can break up this 
single-hearted unity. 
  Today, our revolutionary cause pioneered by the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song has brilliantly been succeeded to the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  Our people will firmly unite around the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il in the future too, will defend the banner of 
socialism to the last, and will brilliantly consummate the 
socialist cause in our country. 
  Speeches were made by (Kavalyov), professor and doctor of 
Moscow University; (Vanin), chief of the Orientalism Institute 
of the Academy of Sciences of Russia; and other participants at 
the meeting. 
  They congratulated the Korean people on their results 
achieved in the revolution and construction under the banner of 
socialism, and entirely supported our principled position toward 
resolving the nuclear issue. 
  They extended the greatest honor and gratitude to the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the creator of the chuche idea, and 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the successor of the great 
leader's revolutionary cause.

  [Text] United Nations, Dec. 8 [as received] (YONHAP) -- UN 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali will visit Seoul on Dec. 
22-24 and then travel to Pyongyang on an official visit, one of 
his aides said Wednesday. 
  Negotiations on the visit were proceeding well, Alvard de 
Soto, a political adviser to Butrus-Ghali, said. De Soto said 
Butrus-Ghali was going to Pyongyang at the invitation of North 
Korea, which is a UN member. He denied the possibility of the 
UN leader playing as a mediator in talks over the North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  The nuclear issue is being dealt with in talks between North 
Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency and between 
North Korea and the United States, and should be handled by the 
Security Council but not by the secretary-general, de Soto said. 
  He, however, suggested the possibility of Butrus-Ghali 
playing a certain role in the resolution process in his personal 
capacity and said the nuclear issue is on the agenda of his 
meeting with North Korean leaders. 
  A highly-placed official on the South Korean Mission to the 
United Nations said it was unlikely Butrus-Ghali would mediate 
in the North Korean nuclear issue because it is being dealt with 
in negotiations between the parties concerned. North Korea, 
which is demanding direct talks with the United States, will not 
want him to play such a role, he added. 
  The secretary-general will convey to North Korean leaders 
the 
international community's position and mood on the nuclear 
issue, including resolutions by the UN Security Council and 
International Atomic Energy Agency, the official said. 
  His visit to Pyongyang when diplomatic efforts to settle the 
North Korean nuclear issue have made little progress and the 
imposition of UN sanctions appears imminent opens the 
possibility he will act as a go-between. 
  A UN source, noting that the U.S.-North Korea talks are at a 
level below vice minister, said there is a possibility the U.S. 
Government will use the visit to convey a message to Kim Il-song. 
  Butrus-Ghali said in a speech at the U.S. Military Academy 
last month that Kim Il-song had rejected his request for a 
visit, suggesting that he planned to visit Pyongyang some time 
ago. 
  Butrus-Ghali will be the first UN leader to visit Pyongyang 
in 14 years and the first ever to visit Seoul. Kurt Waldheim 
made a brief stop in Pyongyang in 1979.

<F P=106> ["Unjustifiable Attitude of U.S. and IAEA Sides" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, December 9 (KCNA) -- At a recent meeting 
of the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] held in Vienna the United States and the IAEA 
sides reportedly revealed an unjust attitude of blatantly 
provoking the DPRK over the guarantee of continuity of 
safeguards on nuclear activities. 
  The U.S. delegate made insidious remarks that the United 
States would "not resume negotiations" with the DPRK unless the 
continuity of nuclear safeguards was ensured. And the director 
general of the IAEA groundlessly said "there is possibility of 
North Korea having transferred nuclear substances to other 
places as the regular lifespan of inspection cameras has come to 
an end". 
  The outcry of the U.S. and IAEA sides that the continuity of 
safeguards on nuclear activities of the DPRK were undermined is 
a totally unfounded talk, and it is a dirty act reversing black 
and white. 
  At present, the inspection cameras and seals of the IAEA 
remain attached to the nuclear facilities of the DPRK. It is a 
sheer distortion of fact, therefore, to say that the continuity 
of safeguards on nuclear activities is on the point of 
suspension and that nuclear substances might have been 
transferred to other places. 
  The DPRK is ready to receive an inspection team for the 
readjustment or replacement of inspection cameras at any moment 
if the agency requests. This stand of the DPRK will remain 
invariable till the nuclear problem has been solved completely 
through DPRK-USA talks. 
  Thus, inspection cameras are enough to ensure the continuity 
of safeguards. But the DPRK, taking the position of the U.S. 
side into consideration, manifested the lenient stand that the 
range of inspection may be further expanded, and had already 
informal contacts with the U.S. side and proposed working 
negotiation to the IAEA side, too. 
  Nevertheless, the U.S. and IAEA sides contended that the 
DPRK 
should accept "wholesale inspection" by the agency in order to 
ensure the continuity of safeguards, setting it as one of the 
preconditions for the holding of the third round of DPRK-USA 
talks. This is an argument that cannot convince anyone. 
  The United States should come out at an early date to the 
third- stage DPRK-USA talks with an honest attitude, instead of 
setting unreasonable "preconditions". And the IAEA side must 
refrain from despicable acts of throwing a wet blanket over the 
talks any longer.

  [Text] Tokyo, Dec. 9 (YONHAP) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin said during the recent APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation) leaders meeting in Seattle that China would not 
increase the present level of the amounts of petroleum and foods 
it furnishes to North Korea, the daily MAINICHI SHIMBUN here 
reported in a dispatch from Washington Thursday. 
  Quoting a senior U.S. Administration official, the newspaper 
said Jiang gave the word during his summit meeting with Japanese 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Also during the meeting, Jiang stressed that China does not 
recognize any nuclear development on the Korean peninsula. 
  The Chinese president said that China would do what could be 
a plus to the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issues but 
never do what could be a minus to it. 
  As a concrete measure, Jiang promised not to increase the 
present level of the shipment of Chinese petroleum, foods and 
other trade items to North Korea, the paper said. 
  The American official reportedly added that Jiang also made 
it clear that China will convey to North Korea its position that 
Beijing cannot recognize military stockpiling of the foods China 
supplied to North Korea. 
  Another U.S. official said it had been confirmed that North 
Korea recently offered to China to buy with cash several million 
dollars worth of diesel oil for use as tank fuel, but China 
rejected it. 
  U.S. Administration officials said that they had received 
the impression that China would not obstruct it if there arises 
a situation in which the United States and other countries would 
have to take a sanction against North Korea in connection with 
the nuclear question.

  [Text] Brussels, Dec 9 (AFP) -- NATO defence ministers 
expressed Thursday "serious concern" over North Korea's nuclear 
arms programme and urged stepped-up efforts to prevent the 
spread of such weapons around the world. 
  The ministers from all 16 NATO members except France said in 
a statement after two days of talks they were worried about the 
"growing risks" posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction. 
  "We expressed serious concern at the actions taken by the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the possible 
consequences for regional security and stability, as well as the 
potential repercussions in other parts of the world." 
  The ministers called on Pyongyang to abide by the provisions 
of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The North Koreans have 
threatened to suspend their adherence to the treaty in a dispute 
over inspection of two suspected nuclear sites. 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation defence chiefs also 
urged the Ukraine to fulfill pledges to dismantle its nuclear 
arsenal inherited from the old Soviet Union and to ratify the 
START I disarmament treaty. 
  They called for "intensified efforts" to prevent a spread of 
nuclear arms "and to address and to counter if necessary the 
associated risks to alliance security." 
  NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner expressed the hope 
that the alliance's summit here next month would adopt a U.S. 
proposal for active steps to keep weapons of mass destruction 
out of the hands of terrorists and renegade states. 
  But he acknowledged that financing would be a major problem 
in a key element of the U.S. counter-proliferation scheme, an 
anti- missile defence system. 
  "There is such a costly expense that nobody can go it 
alone," 
Woerner told a news conference. "Perhaps the Americans but not 
Europeans."

  [Text] Seoul, 2 December (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said on Thursday that no time limit was set to the resolution of 
the North Korean nuclear issues during the recent Korea-U.S. 
summit meeting in Washington. 
  In an interview with the MBC Television on its 32nd 
anniversary, President Kim said North Korea's nuclear 
development should be thwarted by all means inasmuch as the 
question is directly linked to the survival of the 70 million 
Korean people. 
  "At the moment, we can be neither pessimistic nor optimistic 
about the resolution of the controversial issue," Kim said. 
  Looking back over the reforms he engineered in the past nine 
months, the president said, "you cannot wash away in mere 
several months all those defects that had piled up over a period 
of 30 or so years." 
  He said there needs a longer period of time to change the 
people's way of thinking. The president stressed there must 
especially be a change in conscience and notion on the part of 
politicians. 
  President Kim implied that he won't change the nation's 
educational system rather hastily. "Our educational system had 
undergone changes too often, which had brought about much 
problems in itself," he said. 
  The president also said the basic flow of the Korean economy 
appears to have entered a rightful track. Nevertheless, he 
cautioned the people not to expect any overnight improvement of 
the economy.

<F P=106> [By Washington-based correspondent Chong Hae-yong] </F>
  [Text] A rumor from the Washington political circle 
strongly suggests that South and North Korea are seeking the 
resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue through secret, 
behind-the-scene contacts, in addition to the on-going 
working-level contacts between the United States and North Korea 
in New York. The observation is gaining unusual interest. 
  According to a reliable source in Washington on 30 November, 
working-level representatives of the ROK and North Korea are 
discussing pending issues, including the resolution of the North 
Korean nuclear issue which is at a stalemate, and the resumption 
of the South-North dialogue, in either Seoul, Pyongyang, or a 
third country city such as Beijing or Moscow. The source says 
there is also a possibility that a secret nuclear envoy of the 
ROK Government might have been in North Korea and have had 
contacts with high-ranking North Korean officials to seek a 
breakthrough in the nuclear issue. It is also rumored, but not 
confirmed, that the ROK side's representative to the contact 
with North Korea is one of President Kim Yong-sam's aides whose 
surname initial is "H" or "J".

  [Text] It is the ROK Government's first assessment that the 
North Korean position expressed at the 3 December U.S.-North 
Korean working-level contact had a positive side but was 
unsatisfactory. The government said it would be able to announce 
its official position on the North Korean response early next 
week after fully reviewing which part of it is positive and 
which part is unsatisfactory. 
  Accordingly, the government will likely hold a policy 
meeting 
with the United States in the near future in order to decide a 
position of the ROK and the United States on the North Korean 
proposal. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said today that the North 
Korean response was not fully satisfactory [chungbun hajinun 
anchiman] but it is necessary to review it. 
  In his supplementary explanation on the North Korean 
position, Nuclear Ambassador Kim Sam-hun said that North Korea's 
position was insufficient to meet preconditions [chonje chogon], 
thus hinting that North Korea did not fully accepted our side's 
demands as preconditions -- North Korea's acceptance of ordinary 
inspections [tongsang sachal] and the South-North envoy exchange. 
  Ambassador Kim said, however, that the ROK and the United 
States aim at continuing to make efforts to resolve the North 
Korean nuclear issue through dialogue and that they will take 
countermeasures [teaung pangan] after modulating [choyul] both 
sides' positions. By saying so, he implied that several more 
contacts between the United States and North Korea may be held 
in the future.

  [Text] The Advisory Council on Democratic and Peaceful 
Unification Policy held a joint meeting of its Management and 
Standing Committees on 8 December. At the meeting, government 
offices concerned delivered reports on the current status 
regarding the North Korean nuclear issue and South-North 
relations. The Advisory Council adopted a four-point resolution 
including a point urging an early solution of the North Korean 
nuclear problem. 
  In the resolution, the Advisory Council on Democratic and 
Peaceful Unification Policy urged North Korea to accept 
transparent nuclear inspections and to resume the South-North 
dialogue. It also urged the Governments of South and North 
Korea to take active and immediate measures for meetings and 
reunion of separated family members, which all the countrymen 
desire. 
  In his report, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said: The ROK 
and the United States made it clear that it would be difficult 
to continue U.S.-North Korean contacts and international 
measures [kukchejok chawonesoui taecho] will be inevitable 
unless North Korea accepts inspections by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency and accedes to the South-North envoy 
exchange for discussions on the nuclear issue.

  [Text] Tokyo, Nov. 30 KYODO -- Japan's plutonium safety 
standards are so strict that even an unforeseen major accident 
at the nation's fast-breeder reactor Monju would not endanger 
nearby residents, the 1993 White Paper on nuclear safety said 
Tuesday [30 November]. 
  The Director General of the Science and Technology Agency, 
Satsuki Eda, presented the paper to the cabinet Tuesday morning. 
  The paper includes a special section on plutonium use in 
advance of Monju's scheduled April 1994 criticality, the moment 
when the reactor's fuel achieves a chain reaction. 
  The reactor, at Tsuruga in Fukui Prefecture, uses plutonium, 
which is 260,000 times more radioactive than uranium. 
  The paper states that since plutonium is a byproduct of the 
burning of uranium, there is no intrinsic difference between the 
two substances. 
  But the paper notes that the nation's standards for 
acceptable irradiation levels also pertain to bone and lungs, 
which absorb plutonium easily. 
  At Monju, for example, the paper said that even if a major 
accident occurs -- an event it said is technically impossible -- 
safety measures are so tight that nearby residents would receive 
less than the allowable levels of radiation.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the spokesman of the DPRK Foreign </F>
Ministry on 29 November -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] The spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued 
the following statement in connection with the fact that 
recently the U.S. President and other officials enumerated 
violent words and behavior that greatly incite us, thus creating 
a grave barrier in resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Statement by the spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry: 
  Recently, unusual moves are appearing in the United States 
that are creating a grave barrier in resolving the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula. At a meeting to announce the result of 
the so-called U.S.-South Korea summit talks recently, U.S. 
President Clinton made a violent remark by finding fault with 
us, saying that if someone attacks us it will have to pay a dear 
price. Officials in the United States are also inciting us 
greatly and are making violent remarks running counter to 
dialogue. 
  It might be that these words and behavior stem from the 
purpose of having great influence over the South Korean person 
in authority, but we cannot but deal with this matter in a very 
prudent way because such words and behavior was made at a time 
when the issue of holding the three-stage DPRK-U.S. talks was 
put on the agenda. This can only be viewed as is a violent 
violation on the principle of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement and 
an act of betrayal on the other side of dialogue. 
  We put forth the package deal method out of the desire to 
resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula in a 
fundamental way from an equal and fair basis. Our package deal 
method is a fair method wholly coinciding with the principle of 
the DPRK-U.S. joint statement. The United States had assessed 
this positively at one time. 
  If the United States accepts the package deal method which 
we 
put forth, all issues related to the nuclear issue will be 
resolved including the issue of implementing the safeguards 
accord, and there is no need to take a lot of time here. 
  However, currently, as the ringleader of the nuclear issue 
on 
the Korean peninsula, the United States is neglecting the 
responsibility and position that they are entrusted with. Also, 
it seems that while having no political principle, they are 
moving toward the policy of pressuring and crushing [apsal] us 
by even dragging in a perpetrator. 
  Predictions are prevalent within and without the Korean 
peninsula that a war may break out during the current South 
Korean person in authority's term of office. This is related to 
the fact that the South Korean authorities are working in every 
way to interfere in the smooth resolution of the nuclear issue 
by driving a wedge in the DPRK-U.S. talks, and that they are 
also continuously moving toward aggravating the situation. 
  The South Korean authorities are pretending to have some 
kind 
of interest in the implementation of the North-South joint 
declaration on denuclearization. However in reality, they are 
only abusing this as a damping device to interfere in the 
DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  For the U.S. authorities to secretly scheme with these kind 
of fellows shows that they are working to use South Korea as a 
shock brigade in their policy toward Korea and in carrying out 
their strategy in Asia by soothing the South Korean authorities 
who are currently oversensitive and to save their face. 
  When viewing this, we do not know whether the United States 
truly wants to resolve the issue through dialogue, or whether it 
is pursuing the policy of acting hostile and crushing [apsal] 
Korea in the same old way. 
  If the United States tries to crush [apsal] us by forcing 
their unjust demands through pressure toward us, the dialogue 
counterpart, the consequences arising therefrom will be truly 
dangerous. If the United States thinks that pressure can work 
on us, it is a miscalculation. It seems that the United States 
does not yet know very well about its dialogue counterpart. 
  Our people and the People's Army will never yield to 
anybody's pressure. When we declared our decision to withdraw 
from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], we were prepared 
for all possible circumstances, and we are fully prepared to 
safeguard the sovereignty of the country even if the worst event 
such as sanctions or war is imposed on us. 
  If the United States truly wants to resolve the nuclear 
issue, it must sincerely accede to the talks even now rather 
than resorting to the method of pressure such as sanctions and 
so on by running off the track of dialogue. 
  The South Korean authorities must realize that interfering 
in 
the progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks will only achieve ahead of 
schedule their self-destruction. They must correctly find ways 
to survive. 
  We want a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue through 
dialogue. However, if the United States makes a blank paper out 
of the principle of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement and refuses to 
hold the talks, there will be no need for us to uncomfortably 
suspend any longer the effectuation of our withdrawal from the 
NPT [urinun taehwarultonghan haengmunjeui pyonghwajok haegyolul 
paragoitta. kurona migugi kkutnae chomigongdongsongmyongui 
wonchigul paekjihwahago hoedamul kumandugettamyon urido choyak 
taltoeui hyoryok palsaengul toisang pulpyonhage chongjisikyonoko 
issul piryoga opkedoelgossida]. 
  Dialogue is not a gift from one side to the other side, and 
we have no intention to hold dialogue by receiving pressure. 
The success or failure of the peaceful resolution of the 
nuclear issue wholly lies on whether the United States has the 
will to give up its policy of crushing [apsal] Korea.

<F P=106> ["We Have No Idea of Having Dialogue Under Pressure, DPRK FM </F>
Spokesman" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, November 29 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
reiterated that the [words indistinct] negotiated solution of 
the nuclear issue, "but," he stressed, "if the United States 
intends to nullify the principles of the DPRK-U.S. joint 
statement and discontinue the talks, there will be no need for 
us to suspend any longer the effectuation of our withdrawal from 
the Non-proliferation Treaty uncomfortably". 
  The spokesman issued a statement today in connection with 
ill- boding moves in the United States which lay grave hurdles 
to the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  The statement stresses: 
  "If the United States acts to stifle the DPRK, pressuring 
the 
dialogue partner to accept its unreasonable demands, it will 
produce a very dangerous consequence. 
  "If the U.S. thinks pressure can work on the DPRK, it is a 
miscalculation. 
  "The United States seems not to know yet its dialogue 
partner. 
  "Our people and People's Army will never yield to anybody's 
pressure. 
  "When we declared our decision to withdraw from the Nuclear 
Non- proliferation Treaty, we had taken into account all 
possible consequences, and we are fully prepared to safeguard 
the sovereignty of the country even if the worst event such as 
"sanctions" or war is imposed on us. 
  "If the United States truly wants the solution of the 
nuclear 
issue, it must sincerely accede to the talks rather than resort 
to pressure such as "sanctions" and the like out of the orbit of 
the dialogue. 
  "The South Korean authorities had better seek a [words 
indistinct] mindful that their obstructions to the progress of 
the DPRK-U.S. talks would precipitate their own destruction. 
  "Dialogue is not a gift of one party to the other, and we 
have no idea of having dialogue under pressure. 
  "Success or failure in the peaceful solution of the nuclear 
issue entirely depends on whether the United States has the 
willingness to renounce the policy of stifling the DPRK, or not." 
  The spokesman recalled that the DPRK proposed a formula of 
package solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
"If the United States accepts the DPRK-proposed formula of 
package solution, all problems related to the nuclear issue 
including the compliance with the safeguards agreement will be 
solved and it will not take much time," said the spokesman.

  [Excerpts] Seoul, Dec. 1 (YONHAP) -- Russia turned down 
South Korean compensation proposal for its old legation site in 
Seoul Wednesday, saying the offered amount is insufficient. 
  Nikolai Solovyev, visiting head of the Asia-Pacific 
Department at the Russian Foreign Ministry, told YONHAP that he 
tabled a "new proposal" in his meeting with South Korea's 
Assistant Minister Sin Ki-pok on Seoul's compensation for the 
legation site nationalized back in 1970. 
  The Russian official said that in his opinion, North Korea 
was "far" from developing nuclear weapons and that Moscow 
supports Washington-Pyongyang dialogue. 
  Russia is ready to join the trilateral negotiations among 
South Korea, Japan and the United States on North Korea's 
nuclear issue and also ready to join China-U.S. negotiations on 
the matter. [passage omitted] 
  On North Korea's nuclear issue, the Foreign Ministry 
official 
said Russia did "cooperate with (North Korea's) nuclear reactor 
on grounds that it can be used for peaceful way." 
  Asked how far Moscow believes North Korea is in its nuclear 
program, Solovyov said in his personal opinion, the communist 
state is "very far from having nuclear weapons." 
  There are questions about how much plutonium North Korea 
has, 
he said. 
  "We are giving our best efforts for reentering North Korea 
to 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, to keep North Korea as a member 
of the Treaty," said Solovyov. 
  Russia "is ready to join consultations among South Korea, 
Japan, United States...ready to participate in U.S.-China 
consultations," he said.

<F P=106> [By reporter Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned that there has been no change at 
all in the position of North Korea, which has refused the 
overall inspection [chonmyon sachal] by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA], even after the ROK and U.S. leaders 
announced a principle of settling the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  North Korea sent a message to Hans Blix, director general of 
the IAEA, yesterday [1 December], a day before the meeting of 
governors of the IAEA is held, and showed a negative response by 
saying that it cannot accept the overall inspection at present. 
  The IAEA said that it had received a reply message from 
North 
Korea in connection with its 24 November message urging the 
North Korean side to accept the overall inspection, but the 
contents of the message shows that there is no change at all in 
its previous position that it would only allow the change of 
monitoring equipment. 
  Also, IAEA authorities say that the IAEA may declare North 
Korea as a country that has not fulfilled the Nuclear Safeguard 
Accords unless it allows access to experts of the suspected 
nuclear facilities. 
  An IAEA official said the IAEA has no other choice than to 
refer the North Korean issue for the second time to the UN 
Security Council around the end of this year.

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Television Network in 
Japanese at 0219 GMT on 28 November, as part of its 105-minute 
talkshow "Sunday Project" which begins at 0100 GMT carries an 
approximately 15-minute report on an exclusive interview with 
exiled North Korean Lieutenant Im Yong-sum by "KOREA REPORT" 
chief editor Byon Jin-il in Seoul. In the recorded interview 
conducted in an unidentified room in Seoul, Im Yong-sum speaks 
in Korean with Japanese voice-over translation. Date of the 
interview is not given. 
  Concerning North Korea's alleged construction of various 
facilities underground, Im Yong-sum, who was reportedly in 
charge of facilities construction, says: "[In building 
underground facilities] North Korea is making use of Iraq's Gulf 
War experience, wherein the U.S. military and allied forces made 
saturation air raids and Iraqi airfighters were unable to 
demonstrate their abilities. Therefore, an effort is being made 
in North Korea to build a runway under ground so that airplanes 
can be launched even if a runway is destroyed." 
  With regard to the DPRK's suspected development of the 
missile "No Dong," the exiled officer notes: "Missile launch 
pads have been built in Hate, North Hamgyong, and in Munchon, 
Kangwon; and another missile launch pad is under construction in 
Chungan [as heard] in a border area near China. These are the 
major launch pads. When I was building military facilities, I 
heard that the existing missiles are deployed to counterattack 
Japanese and U.S. air raids, and at that time, I firmly believed 
that if we got serious about it, our missiles could destroy even 
Japan, the United States, or South Korea." 
  Asked if he thinks North Korea has already had nuclear 
weapons, Im Song-sum answers: "Yes. In North Korea, even 
rank-and-file soldiers think so. All North Korean executive 
military officers know that two facilities located in Yongbyong 
are the nuclear facilities. If these two facilities are open to 
inspections, North Korea's nuclear development technology will 
be revealed." He then notes that when he was in North Korea, he 
believed that North Korea had already developed nuclear weapons 
as a nuclear deterrent. He then stresses if North Korea should 
provoke a war, the United States would joint the war, and 
therefore, Japan's participation in the war would be inevitable, 
noting: "As a preemptive strike, North Korea would attack U.S. 
military bases in Japan and then make air raids on Japan's major 
military bases." He says all the soldiers were ordered this 
year to prepare for a semi-war. 
  Im Song-sum then discusses growing dissatisfaction with Kim 
Chong-il within the military. He also speaks about North 
Korea's food situation. He says "living condition of the people 
living beyond Pyongyang is miserable." 
  The interview ends at 0234 GMT.

  [Text] It was learned on 2 December that, in an effort to 
solve pending issues such as the nuclear issue, the 
establishment of DPRK- U.S. diplomatic relations, and the 
North-South dialogue, North Korea has submitted to the United 
States a six-point package solution proposal, which includes the 
support for North Korea's policy of reunifying the country by 
founding a confederal republic of Koryo, and a commitment 
guaranteed by documents that nuclear weapons will not be used. 
  According to a government source, during recent contacts 
with 
the United States, North Korea presented "a six-point package 
proposal." In connection with the nuclear threat, the demands 
include: (1) a U.S. guarantee, supported with documents, that it 
will not launch a preemptive nuclear attack (NSA) [expansion 
unknown]; (2) a U.S. statement on not deploying nuclear weapons 
in South Korea; and (3) the permanent suspension of the Team 
Spirit exercise. In connection with the abolishment of the U.S. 
hostile policy toward North Korea, it asks for: (1) the 
replacement of the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement; 
(2) the withdrawal of the U.S. designation of North Korea as a 
terrorist state; and (3) the support for North Korea's policy of 
reunification through the founding of a confederal republic of 
Koryo. 
  In a package solution proposal on 11 November, Kang Sok-chu, 
first vice foreign minister of North Korea, called on the U.S. 
side to take practical actions to abolish its "nuclear threat" 
and "hostile policy." However, the details of the package 
solution proposal were not revealed then. 
  Most of these demands are believed to have been proposed by 
North Korea in previous contacts. However, it has not been 
confirmed whether North Korea presented these demands at the 
final U.S.-North Korean contact as a proposal for a package 
solution. 
  North Korea was learned to have left out demands for U.S. 
support in the construction of a light-water moderated reactor, 
recognition of North Korea as an actual state equivalent to 
South Korea, abolition of the export ban against North Korea and 
economic assistance, and withdrawal of U.S. troops in this 
package solution proposal. 
  North Korea's exclusion of such demands from the current 
proposal is thought to have been prompted by its judgment that 
once the nuclear problem is solved in a package deal, the United 
States will take appropriate steps for North Korea. 
  The United States was learned to have conveyed its position 
towards this package solution proposal by North Korea on 24 
November that a comprehensive [pogwalchok] solution would only 
be possible if North Korea accepts inspection by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency and comes to North-South 
dialogue. Therefore, North Korea's response, which will attract 
a lot of attention, is expected to be revealed soon. 
  A high-ranking government official stated that "the U.S. 
position is that with the exception of the point on supporting 
the Koryo confederal system, the remaining five points in North 
Korea's package solution proposal are negotiable." 
  This official said that "since written assurance of not 
using 
nuclear weapons and a pledge not to deploy them are already 
reflected in the existing U.S.-North Korea joint statement, more 
specific progress would help. In addition, the United States is 
open to considering a temporary suspension of the Team Spirit 
exercise." He added that the U.S. position is that "once 
transparency in North Korea's nuclear issue is guaranteed, the 
prospect for implementation of the denuclearization declaration 
will be brighter and accordingly, assistance in North Korea's 
construction of a light-water moderated reactor as well as 
humanitarian economic assistance will be possible."

<F P=106> ["United States Must Know its Dialogue Partner Well" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, December 2 (KCNA) -- U.S. CIA Director 
Woolsey reportedly let out a provocative war blast against the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea on November 30. 
  In this bellicose outburst, he said it is "important to make 
combat preparations" to attack the DPRK and "possibility of war 
cannot be ruled out". 
  This is an exasperating remark that could be uttered by none 
other than a trigger-happy element intending to push the 
situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. 
  All the more serious is the fact that, as Woolsey said, "the 
President issued this instruction." 
  We cannot but take a very serious note of the fact that U.S. 
President Clinton "ordered combat preparations" inwardly, not 
long after he threatened that any one who "venture an attack 
will have to pay dearly for it," obviously hinting at the DPRK, 
when he was announcing results of the U.S.-South Korea "summit 
talks" some time ago. 
  Such remarks of the U.S. authorities are a crude breach of 
the DPRK-USA joint statement and perfidy against the dialogue 
partner. It cannot be construed otherwise than an act to block 
the third round of DPRK-USA talks. 
  The recent powder-reeking, bellicose outbursts of the U.S. 
authorities suggest that their clamour about "preconditions" is 
motivated by a sinister political intention. This makes us 
wonder whether the United States truly seeks a negotiated 
solution of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula or 
persistently pursues a hostile policy for stifling the DPRK. 
  The United States which has deployed many nuclear weapons in 
South Korea and is constantly presenting a nuclear threat to the 
DPRK, is now crying that the "possibility of war cannot be ruled 
out", provoking it which has neither intention nor capacity to 
develop nuclear weapons. This is really a shameless act 
reminding us of a thief crying "stop thief!" 
  If the United States intends to bring the DPRK into 
submission in league with Japan and South Korea by means of 
pressure, "sanctions" and force of arms through the 
"international cooperation system," it is a big mistake. 
  No coercion and threat can solve anything. 
  The United States must discard the old conception of 
confrontation of the cold war era and promptly stop the foolish 
moves to contain the DPRK with strength. 
  It must act properly, knowing well of its dialogue partner.

  [Text] The South Korean puppets committed a grave military 
provocation by illegally infiltrating a combat ship deep into 
our side's territorial waters on the West Sea yesterday [5 
December]. 
  At around 1358 [1058 GMT] yesterday, in broad daylight, the 
South Korean puppets infiltrated three combat ships from 
Taechongdo into our side's territorial waters. The combat ship 
group, which infiltrated deeply into our side's territorial 
waters, undertook a combat formation near Chaejak-ri, 
Ongjin-county, South Hwanghae Province with the purpose of 
realizing a hostile attempt. 
  The Korean People's Army's Navy patrol ships, which were 
thoroughly defending the sea guardpost of our socialist 
fatherland, immediately went to the spot and the sea-based 
cannons [haesangpo] undertook a combat posture to take a 
self-defensive measure. Taken by surprise, the rascals 
hurriedly fled southward. 
  The South Korean puppets' reckless maritime infiltration 
activity is a deliberate and premeditated military provocation 
to aggravate artificially the tension on the Korean peninsula. 
  The South Korean puppets should deeply consider the grave 
consequence of the rascals' military provocation and should not 
act rashly. 
  If the South Korean puppets constantly go down the road of 
confrontation and war in spite of our repeated warning, our 
people and People's Army will impose a thousand-fold stern 
retaliation against the aggressors.

<F P=106> ["United States Should Approach DPRK's Proposal Prudently </F>
and Make Decision on its Judgement, DPRK FM [Foreign Ministry] 
Spokesman" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, December 9 (KCNA) -- "If the United 
States refuses to accept even the proposal made by the DPRK side 
at the DPRK-USA working contact in New York on December 3, the 
DPRK cannot but form the final judgement that the United States 
no longer has the intention to continue dialogue," declared a 
spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea. 
  "The United States should approach the DPRK's proposal 
prudently and make a decision on its judgement", he said. 
  U.S. media set afloat reports quoting recent remarks of the 
U.S. official quarters that "there are both positive and 
negative aspects" in the proposal of the DPRK, that "it is a 
matter which should be examined carefully through consultation 
with allies" and that "never-ceasing pressure should be put on 
North Korea". Answering a question put by the KCNA in this 
connection today, the spokesman said: 
  "This time we made to the U.S. side a detailed proposal to 
expand the scope of inspection for fully guaranteeing the 
continuity of safeguards by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA). 
  "This progressive proposal made by us was a step which was 
taken in good faith after the U.S. side accepted the DPRK's 
formula of package solution and should affirmative willingness 
to practically improve the relations between the DPRK and the 
USA. 
  "It is the largest concession on the part of the DPRK at the 
present stage in view of the low level of confidence between the 
DPRK and the USA and between the DPRK and the IAEA. 
  "Of course, it is a transitional measure adopted before the 
third-stage talks and it is clear that an agreement on the 
package solution at the third-stage talks would lead to a full 
inspection of the facilities reported to the IAEA. 
  "And, in the afore-said proposal, we declared that, if the 
South Korean authorities proposed a working contact for the 
exchange of special envoys between the North and the South on an 
understandable term, the North was ready to examine it 
affirmatively. 
  "It is, in fact, improper for the United States to raise the 
exchange of special envoys between the North and the South of 
Korea as a precondition for its talks with the DPRK": The 
exchange of special envoys between the North and the South had 
been proposed by us and it is our stand to carry it into 
practice by all means. 
  "As the exchange of special envoys is aimed at discussing 
not 
only nuclear problem but also a number of problems arising in 
the relations between the North and the South, it is a domestic 
issue of our nation which should be discussed and agreed upon 
between the North and the South. So it is not a problem in 
which the United States should interfere, still less a problem 
requiring good offices of the United States. 
  "However, proceeding from the position to solve the nuclear 
problem at any cost, the DPRK, with good intentions, made clear 
its stand toward the exchange of special envoys between the 
North and the South, fully taking into consideration the 
embarrassing circumstances of the U.S. side. 
  "Now some quarters of the United States are raising a noisy 
row as if the discontinuation of the `Team Spirit' joint 
military exercises were a big concession. But, in fact, the 
manoeuvres are an act of nuclear threat that plainly contradicts 
the spirit of the joint statement between the DPRK and the 
United States and so it is a big mistake for the United States 
to try to wrest something from the DPRK in return for it. "The 
United States would be well advised to give up the idea of using 
the discontinuation of the war game as a bargaining chip. 
  "If the manoeuvres are forced, we are fully prepared to cope 
with them."

  [Text] Lukavica, 14 Dec (TANJUG) -- The Sarajevo front has 
been marked today by intensive sniper fire and fire from heavy 
infantry weapons by Muslims on Serb positions and Serb-held 
suburbs. 
  Throughout the night combat activities were considerably 
stepped up in the northern and southwestern sections of the 
front where Muslim forces pounded Rajlovac, Ilidza, Hadzici, and 
Nedzarici with artillery weapons, among others. 
  Positions of the Vogosca operative group of the army of the 
Serb republic were pounded with antitank grenades and 82-mm 
mortar shells from the direction of the Muslim strongholds at 
Sokolj and the city's main waste disposal location. 
  The Serb side returned fire and according to Serb military 
sources, one Serb fighter was wounded in the attack. 
  Overnight, Muslim forces carried out a strong mortar attack 
against Kasindolska Street from the direction of Butmir and 
across the airport runway. The 82-mm caliber shells were filled 
with poison gases, that is, tear gas. 
  During the night Muslims stepped up fire against the Serb 
defense lines in Hadzici and Zuc hill from the direction of 
Goduse, Kralupa, and Ormanj Hill. 
  There is also evidence of Muslim forces concentrating in the 
area of the cold-storage plant at Stup and in Sokolovic Kolonija.

  [Text] Prague/Plzen Dec 9 (CTK) -- According to an unnamed 
Israeli diplomat in Prague, there exists a suspicion that Czech 
firms are participating in supplying technology for Iran's 
nuclear programme. 
  In an interview with CTK, the diplomat did not rule out the 
possibility that Israel's concerns could become one of the 
topics of Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec's upcoming 
visit to Israel, scheduled for December 12-14. 
  The diplomat also based his suspicion on an October 28 
report 
in the French daily LE POINT, according to which the Czech firm 
Skoda Plzen allegedly signed an agreement with Iran to supply 
technology for nuclear reactors in exchange for deliveries of 
oil products. 
  Referring to Skoda's cooperation with Iran in nuclear 
engineering, the manager for technical service of nuclear power 
plants of the Skoda Jaderne Strojirenstvi Plzen company, 
Frantisek Svitak, said today that Iran was interested in 
constructing a nuclear power plant and that Skoda could supply 
it with reactor equipment through the mediation of a Russian 
general supplier. 
  In the interview with CTK, the Israeli diplomat pointed to 
similar deliveries to Iraq before the Persian Gulf War and 
stressed that Iran currently represented the biggest threat to 
Israel. 
  Skoda General Director Lubomir Soudek visited Iran at the 
end 
of November and the beginning of December where he negotiated 
the possibility of cooperation in energy, transport engineering 
and the sugar industry. 
  During his recent visit to Prague, Israeli Acting Defence 
Minister Mordechai Gur told CTK that supplies of armaments and 
military systems to the Teheran government by unnamed European 
countries have turned Iran into a threat to world peace. He 
said then that Israel would welcome the Czech Republic's 
participation in the Middle East peace process by exerting 
pressure on countries such as Iran and by controlling its 
exports to prevent these countries from pursuing aggressive and 
militant policies. 
  According to Israeli Analyst Dani Kesem, who was quoted by 
the Czech press this week, Skoda is becoming for the American 
company Westinghouse and for the German concern Siemens the gate 
to the Iranian nuclear market. This statement was immediately 
denied by Skoda Spokesman Jaroslav Hudec who said he considered 
it misleading. 
  Skoda effectively cooperates with Westinghouse in developing 
nuclear fuel for the VVER [water-moderated water-cooled power 
reactor) 1000 reactor destined for the Temelin nuclear power 
plant in Southern Bohemia, Svitak told CTK today. 
  He said that non-active model tests are currently being 
conducted at Skoda's testing facilities for Westinghouse which 
is supplying models of nuclear fuel, to check the suitability of 
its nuclear fuels for the VVER 1000 reactor. 
  Svitak said that Skoda had been promised it could provide 
similar tests at its testing facilities to check nuclear fuel 
for the VVER 440 reactors. With these reactors are equipped, 
for example, the nuclear power plants in Dukovany, Southern 
Moravia, and in Jaslovske Bohunice, Western Slovakia. It has 
not yet been decided which firm will supply this fuel. 
Westinghouse, Siemens, the French Framatome, and Swedish-Swiss 
ABB are participating in the selection process.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Slavoljub Susic] </F>
  [Excerpts] There are at least two reasons to link the 
discovery of lethal waste delivered from Germany to neighboring 
Albania with the war and other events in the Balkans. First, 
involved are materials whose degree of poisonousness--that is, 
toxicity--in larger concentrations are by no means lower than 
some well-known chemical weapons. The second reason is 
strategic and long-term interests that the developed Europe and 
United States want to realize in these regions. 
  Without denying the long-accepted general definition of war 
as the continuation of politics with different means, one should 
still recall the fact that there are means, the use of which is 
not permitted in war or peace. Involved are, among others, 
chemical-biological combat means that, due to their known and 
potential effects, represent a great danger for modern 
civilization. [passage omitted] 
  Chemical weapons have been used in local wars. They are even 
used today in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, where, in their 
attacks on Serbian positions, Izetbegovic's mujahedins are 
reportedly using ammunition charged with poisons, most probably 
produced in one of the existing factories of chemical products, 
pesticides, or detergents. 
  Of course, it is difficult to predict the extent of an 
ecological catastrophe in the event that cisterns with chloride 
explode or if chemical plants in Tuzla or factories of mines and 
explosives in Vitez and Gorazde are deliberately destroyed. 
  Therefore, we cannot be calm over the recent discovery of a 
large quantity of lethal chemicals in the neighboring Albania. 
There are ever louder rumors that something similar may have 
been delivered to some western regions of the former Yugoslav 
federation in exchange for diplomatic and military aid in the 
forced secession from the mother country. All this directs one 
to the justified suspicion that Germany and other developed 
countries are not instigating the present reorganization of the 
Balkans from the well-known geostrategic reasons alone but are 
rather ensuring room for dumping chemical and radioactive waste 
as far as possible from their own threshold and under someone 
else's carpet.

<F P=106> [Article by Virginia Perez Araoz and Mariano Botas] </F>
  [Text] In initial remarks to LA PRENSA, Energy Secretary 
Carlos Bastos says: "I cannot understand some government 
officials who have adopted the habit of calling journalists, 
making strong remarks, challenging other government officials, 
and having journalists play the role of a judge." Nevertheless, 
since he clearly and explicitly is not in the mood to challenge 
the National Commission for Atomic Energy [CNEA], the energy 
secretary directly addresses the issue that actually worries him. 
  Bastos says: "Here on my table I have a preliminary report 
by a consulting company, a survey that is not directly linked to 
CNEA because it just describes the state's function with regard 
to the nuclear power industry in those countries where the 
production of nuclear power is in private hands. There is also 
a report on the situation in the United Kingdom, a country that 
was unable to achieve nuclear privatization and whose experience 
we also are interested in learning." 
  [LA PRENSA] But this is not all the "Group of Entrepreneurs" 
was asked to do ... 
  [Bastos] This is a preliminary report. Afterward, there will 
be a summary on all the practical cases reviewed. With this 
material, the presidency of the nation (including presidential 
secretary Eduardo Bauza; President Menem; CNEA Chairman Manuel 
Mondino; and, probably, [Economy] Minister Domingo Cavallo, who 
will convey the Energy Secretariat's opinion) will decide if it 
would or would not be viable to open up the nuclear area for the 
participation of private capital. 
  If it is indeed viable, a second step will be taken in which 
the consulting company would actually present some concrete 
privatization alternatives. 
  [LA PRENSA] Why was CNEA not consulted on the decision to 
call this consulting company? 
  [Bastos] Because we are not making decisions on CNEA. We are 
just trying to establish a basis, based on international 
experience, to determine which way to advance, if a decision is 
made on advancing. 
  The nuclear issue is a field almost exclusively staked out 
by 
CNEA people. Not even all the nuclear scientists participate in 
it. 
  Based on the survey requested, we just want to become 
acquainted with, to define what will happen with industrial 
security if the production of nuclear power is transferred to 
private hands; what will be done with the plants and nuclear 
waste when the nuclear power plants stop operating; and if the 
rates that will be approved for these companies will be 
regulated or will be established by market conditions. These 
are politico-economic issues that are independent from the way 
in which CNEA would be restructured. 
  [LA PRENSA] The energy secretary said: "No one has a 
definite opinion on how CNEA will be restructured because no one 
knows how the entire industry will be restructured. For 
example, if the nuclear power plants are privatized, who will 
supply the fuel? Will foreign companies be allowed to supply it 
or will the participation be restricted to national companies? 
Will they be exclusive suppliers or will they have other deals? 
These are open questions." 
  But if CNEA's future is raised again, it is because there is 
a definite opinion that things are not working the way they 
stand now. 
  [Bastos] I am not saying that CNEA is operating well or 
poorly now. I am actually saying that there are general 
guidelines on streamlining the state. We, Minister Domingo 
Cavallo and I, have adhered to these guidelines with plenty of 
evidence. The state must be removed from entrepreneurial 
activities. The control of general interests in entrepreneurial 
activities alone must be left in the state's hands. 
  [LA PRENSA] Is it a mistake, then, to claim that all nuclear 
activities must be in the state's hands? 
  [Bastos] I don't know. I am not a specialized expert in this 
area. I actually know that our secretariat is responsible for 
the energy policy, in general. And we cannot stop voicing an 
opinion on the organization of the nuclear field that is 
involved in energy production. 
  I do not want to get involved in an argument with Mondino or 
bring the CNEA under the Energy Secretariat's jurisdiction. I 
must insist, however, that we are entitled to voice an opinion 
on this issue. 
  This industry obviously will be restructured. And it is 
important for the political power to hold the reins and decide 
on the nuclear area's role and the way it will be restructured. 
  Maybe Mondino is unaware of the fact that the studies may 
recommend that it is not advantageous to privatize CNEA ... 
  [LA PRENSA] Does the Energy Secretariat, then, believe that 
it is best to privatize CNEA? 
  [Bastos] This is not the way in which the report requested 
from the consulting company should be understood. Maybe it has 
been misinterpreted because, for the time being, we do not 
intend to define the privatization of the power plants. We 
actually are trying to determine the role in this area that the 
state plays in other countries, the state's responsibility. 
  At the moment, everything is in the hands of CNEA, a state 
organization that has superimposed activities and a single 
balance. The CNEA is a development and research center. And at 
the same time, it controls its own accounts and projects. It 
must be restructured. 
  [LA PRENSA] Nevertheless, Mondino's proposal to transform 
CNEA into a corporation is precisely aimed at that ... What is 
your opinion? 
  [Bastos] What I told Mondino is about a meeting that was 
also 
attended by Bauza. It is about a superficial change that does 
not propose basic issues such as how to integrate CNEA into the 
electric industry or security and the risks of a nuclear 
accident. 
  The idea of separating the accounting was good but to do 
that 
there is no need for a decree; it can be done through an 
internal procedure. 
  The project is up in the air. If he is asked what the 
state's 
role is, Mondino would say that CNEA is responsible for defining 
a policy for the industry. And this is not so. CNEA is not the 
state but an organization of the state. 
  [LA PRENSA] Is there international capital interested in the 
nuclear industry? 
  [Bastos] Practically all the international companies are 
interested in finishing the Atucha-2 nuclear plant. This is the 
business in which they are now interested. But some Spanish and 
Canadian companies have been asking about the eventual 
construction of a fourth nuclear plant. 
  [LA PRENSA] What is the timetable for drawing up a plan for 
restructuring CNEA? 
  [Bastos] The second report by the consulting firm will be 
ready before the end of this year; it is a synthesis of the 
experience abroad. With this information, we will begin to 
discuss the need to open up to private capital and in which 
areas to do it. 
  I believe that by the middle of next year a decision already 
will have been made on the meaning and ways of restructuring 
proposed for CNEA. 
  But this process, I insist, is not linked to an Energy 
Secretariat goal. It has to do with the state's reform.

  [Text] (DYN) -- Argentina has become a member of the 
Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the Foreign Ministry 
officially revealed yesterday. 
  The governmental organization is made up of 25 countries. 
Joining Argentina as a newcomer will be Hungary. 
  The decision is seen to be the result of a long-term policy 
of Foreign Minister Guido di Tella to join the international 
committee and was helped by President Menem's decision earlier 
this year to scrap the Condor missile development. 
  In Switzerland yesterday, where the MTCR was due to stage a 
meeting, the Argentine representative Andres Cisneros said 
Menem's government "had renounced the development of offensive 
arms in order to participate in the highest of technological 
progress for peaceful ends."

<F P=106> [Article by Tania Malheiros in Rio de Janeiro] </F>
  [Text] On 7 December, Senator Dirceu Carneiro (PSDB-SC 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Santa Catarina State]) told O 
ESTADO DE SAO PAULO that he has received a note from Foreign 
Relations Minister Celso Amorim informing him that the 
quadripartite agreement that the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) negotiated in Vienna, Austria, will open Brazilian 
nuclear installations to international inspection for the first 
time. Carneiro explained that the agreement "is a landmark in 
the history of international nuclear safeguards." 
  He said that the agreement explains how the IAEA will 
inspect 
nuclear installations in Brazil. Carneiro is the speaker for 
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and was in charge of the 
negotiations between the Senate and the Brazilian administration. 
  The timing of the visits was the most controversial aspect 
of 
the issue. Carneiro said the IAEA agreed to notify in advance 
its intention to inspect Brazilian nuclear installations and to 
make the inspection only after their construction is finished. 
"The IAEA wanted to inspect installations while construction 
was under way, but Brazil did not agree," Carneiro said. 
  He also reported that from the diplomatic viewpoint the 
Brazilian negotiators gained status in the eyes of the 
international community. "Brazil tied its ratification of the 
accord to the fulfillment of certain conditions, unlike many 
other countries that did not follow suit," Carneiro stated. 
  According to the senator, the IAEA was pressuring to gain 
control over nuclear energy in Brazil. The agency wanted, among 
other things, to visit Brazilian installations whenever it 
received a report that Brazil was using nuclear energy for 
nonpeaceful objectives. "Brazil did not accept this and 
demanded that unscheduled inspections comply with auxiliary 
regulations that clearly establish how this should be done, and 
the IAEA agreed," the senator explained. "This was the aspect 
that countries fear most, which is why Brazil has never signed 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which will be 
reviewed in 1995." 
  The senator also reported that the Brazilian-Argentine 
Agency 
for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Material (ABACC), not the 
IAEA, will control nuclear material in Brazil. "This will be 
done to make sure that the uranium enriched in Brazil using 
Brazilian technology will not be diverted to manufacturing arms 
in Brazil or abroad," Carneiro said. The Brazilian Senate will 
have to ratify the agreement signed with the IAEA early in 1994.

  [Text] Valparaiso -- The draft agreement on the approval of 
several amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty is ready for 
publication in the official gazette following registration at 
the Controller's Office. 
  This draft agreement modifies the Treaty for the 
Proscription 
of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, which was 
formulated in April 1969 and was ratified by Chile in October 
1974. 
  This international treaty, signed in the Mexican town of 
Tlatelolco, seeks to establish zones and environments free of 
nuclear weapons. It is the first of its type encompassing an 
extensive and heavily populated zone like Latin America and the 
Caribbean. 
  The changes seek to include countries which obtained their 
independence since the implementation of said treaty (Belize and 
Guyana), to change in the treaty's name, and to include the 
Caribbean nations. 
  Finally, by suggestion of Chile, Argentina, and Brazil, 
essential amendments are being made to make the treaty's control 
system more operational without affecting its essential 
political principles and objectives.

  [Text] Today, at the International Atomic Energy Agency 
headquartered in Vienna, Austria, Cuba demanded the elimination 
of the two-category state system mentioned in the 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons treaty: those which do not 
possess these weapons, and the known nuclear powers. Andres 
Garcia de la Cruz, executive secretary of the Atomic Energy 
Commission of Cuba, said that the agency should demand that the 
known nuclear powers honor their commitment to end the nuclear 
arms race and to disarm, a commitment set 25 years ago. Garcia 
de la Cruz made these comments during a meeting of the agency's 
Board of Governors, and he insisted on the adoption of a new 
policy to strengthen the efficiency of the safeguard 
[salvaguardia] system. 
  Garcia de la Cruz also pointed out that, before proceeding 
with the implementation of these programs, it is necessary to 
establish an adequate legal framework and to proceed with the 
programs without waiting for the results of the technical and 
economic evaluation to determine their implications from the 
legal standpoint.

  [Excerpts] Dr. Conrado Seminario, the Peruvian Institute of 
Nuclear Energy (IPEN) executive director, reported on 18 
November that IPEN has exported radioactive material produced in 
the "Racso" [Oscar Miro Quesada de la Guerra] Nuclear Center in 
Huarangal to the United States and, more recently, to Ecuador. 
  Seminario pointed out that the Huarangal center has enough 
production capabilities, but its main duty is to promote 
research and development among Peruvian University professors 
and students. 
  Seminario said IPEN does not have any mortgage obligations 
or 
indebtedness to Argentina, whose technicians installed the 
"Racso" Nuclear Center. The current debt is between governments 
and is handled normally. [passage omitted] 
  Concerning the Santa Anita irradiation plant, Seminario said 
65 percent of the infrastructure has been completed. The 
equipment's arrival will be authorized when 85 percent of the 
infrastructure has been completed. 
  A 1.7 billion-sole appropriation is required to complete the 
infrastructure and purchase the complementary equipment. The 
plant's main equipment is under construction in Russia. It will 
cost $1.2 million. This equipment will be donated by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The IAEA also has sent a purchase order for $160,000 for the 
cobalt-60 the plant will require. 
  Perishable foodstuffs will be irradiated at the plant in 
order to preserve them for export. Roots, for example, may be 
preserved for eight months without spoiling. According to their 
natural properties, fruits have different preservative lives.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "India's Missile Program"] </F>
  [Text] India successfully test fired the surface-to-surface 
missile Prithvi [Earth] the other day. This 250-km-range 
missile had undergone a series of tests earlier, and the one 
carried out the other day was the last of the series. After the 
acquisition of the Prithvi missile, the Indian army's combat 
capability will increase many times, which will endanger the 
security of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and other small 
countries besides Pakistan. These countries are relatively weak 
compared to the tremendous military potential of India. 
  According to Western media reports, India possesses a 
nuclear 
weapon, and it has amassed plutonium to the extent that it could 
make 25 to 30 bombs. India launched its missile program a 
decade ago, and since then it has experimented with various 
types of missiles, of which Prithvi and Agni [Fire] are top of 
the list. Agni is a long-range missile, whose range is 2,000 to 
3000 kms. Although the Agni is in its early stages, after the 
successful test launch of Prithvi, Indian experts are now fully 
concentrating on Agni, and they will soon test-fire it 
successfully. 
  It is a strange thing that the United States took serious 
note of Pakistan's acquisition of missiles from China and 
imposed sanctions against China. Pakistan has already been 
subjected to similar, even more stringent, sanctions. However, 
India's nuclear program, which deserves serious notice, was not 
given such a consideration. Now, it is understood that the 
United States has asked both Pakistan and India to roll back 
their missile programs. In this case also, Pakistan is being 
subjected to the same injustice in its nuclear program and 
missile production, which is justified by the Pressler 
Amendment. Those at the helm of affairs in the U.S. 
Administration also have now realized that the restrictions 
imposed on Pakistan under the Pressler Amendment are not 
justifiable. From this, it can be rightly expected that the 
United States will soon move to redress this injustice and end 
the discriminatory treatment on Pakistan.

  [Text] The indigenously developed surface-to-surface medium 
range missile Prithvi [Earth] was successfully launched at 1225 
PM [0655 GMT] from the interim test range at Chandipur on sea in 
Orissa today. Prithvi landed accurately after three minutes on 
a small island (Tentuli Chada) located in the Bay of Bengal as 
planned. This was the 12th launch of Prithvi. The speciality 
of today's launch is that it was from mobile launcher with a 250 
kg payload. The scientific adviser to the Defense Ministry, Dr. 
Abdul Kalam, and the three service chiefs witnessed the test 
launch.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pressler And All That"] </F>
  [Text] The reported U.S. move to repeal the Pressler 
amendment is the latest indication of changing American 
diplomacy towards South Asia. Ms. Robin Raphel's absurd remarks 
on Kashmir, questioning the Instrument of Accession; Mr. Warren 
Christopher's letter of appreciation to the Prime Minister on 
the peaceful solution of the Hazratbal crisis; and now the move 
to scrap the Pressler amendment, paradoxically, are all part of 
a change. The Pressler amendment came into effect on October 1, 
1990 mainly to chastise the countries of South Asia which were 
refusing to sign the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] and surrender 
the right to acquire nuclear weapons. In Pakistan's case, the 
punishment was to cut off military and economic aid to which 
that country had got so accustomed that its elite could not do 
without it. The amendment has been a major irritant between 
Islamabad and Washington. Amending this amendment would give Mr. 
Clinton freedom to resume aid to Pakistan. It would give an 
instant reward to premier Benazir Bhutto, currently America's 
favourite among Pak leaders. However, by implication this move 
is more anti-Indian than pro-Pakistan. It carries strong 
implications for India. The stated purpose of the U.S. 
decision, the Americans say, is not to allow Pakistan to go 
nuclear but encourage it to look for a more "equitable and 
non-discriminatory" application of punitive measures against 
nuclear threshold countries. Another justification provided is 
that the Pressler law "no longer serves U.S. nonproliferation 
objectives in South Asia." It is a well-known fact that New 
Delhi and Washington are not on the same wavelength on the NPT. 
While the U.S. wants India to sign the NPT on the dotted lines, 
India regards the treaty as unacceptable because it is 
discriminatory. Pakistan has expressed its willingness to sign 
the NPT, provided the U.S. forces India to submit on the NPT. 
The idea is to give currency to propaganda that India does not 
want a nuclear-free South Asia. The pro-Pakistani lobby in the 
U.S. has been arguing that Pressler's restrictions target 
Pakistan alone and no other country. Pakistan's ruling elite 
wants Pressler employed against India, although this country has 
no military nuclear programme. It appears that Mr. Clinton has 
accepted this convoluted logic. It is rightly apprehended that 
the new law, when approved by the U.S. Congress, can be used to 
deny American aid to India. And correspondingly aid can be 
resumed to Pakistan. India's political leaders have so long 
been passive on this issue that it is probably futile for them 
to say anything different from the mantra they have repeated 
these last 30 years. Our so-called open option policy should be 
made really open. Ms. Bhutto's assertion that Pakistan's 
nuclear programme cannot be capped and Mr. Clinton's move to 
scrap the Pressler amendment should persuade India to undertake 
an in-depth review of the whole issue.

<F P=106> [Commentary by the News Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] Hans Blix, secretary general of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], has stated in a report on Iran's 
nuclear activities that there is no cause for concern and that 
the Islamic Republic of Iran does not intend to make nonpeaceful 
use of nuclear energy. 
  The IAEA secretary general's report was submitted after 
studies were made by a delegation sent to Iran by the agency. 
In Khordad [month ending 21 June] Hans Blix stated that the 
Islamic Republic of Iran's cooperation with the IAEA was perfect 
and that there was no proof that Iran was using nuclear material 
for nonpeaceful purposes. 
  The IAEA's inspection and report on Iran's nuclear 
activities 
took place within the framework of the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Pact and agreements between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the 
IAEA. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Pact is a worldwide agreement 
that was approved in 1968 to prevent the proliferation of 
nuclear arms in the world. Under this pact, nuclear countries 
have refrained from transferring nuclear arms and technology to 
other countries, while nonnuclear countries have accepted not to 
attempt to attain nuclear arms. The IAEA has been assigned the 
job of supervising the implementation of the pact. By signing 
agreements with various countries, the IAEA monitors the nuclear 
installations and activities of countries in a bid to prevent 
the nonpeaceful use of nuclear energy. 
  The IAEA's view, which has been stated at a time when Iran 
is 
being accused of trying to gain access to nuclear arms, is very 
significant. Even though the Islamic Republic of Iran is a 
member of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Pact and emphasizes the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy, there has been a wave of 
propaganda on Iran's intentions and efforts to acquire nuclear 
arms. 
  This propaganda, which is mainly being disseminated by 
America, is aimed more at inflicting pressure and sanctions on 
Iran rather than at preventing nuclear proliferation. America 
has resorted to this accusation on several occasions and has 
called on its allies to review their relations with Iran. 
  But while revealing that there is no basis for the false 
propaganda against Iran, the remarks by the IAEA secretary 
general as an impartial and international source showed that 
Iran does not intend to make nonpeaceful use of nuclear energy 
and that its activities to acquire nuclear energy are within the 
framework of international pacts that grant this right to every 
country.

<F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>
  [Text] Israel carried out a new nuclear test in the 
Mediterranean early this month. According to our information, 
the new nuclear test focused on experiments with new types of 
short-range nuclear missiles and other technological weapons and 
equipment. 
  An Israeli technical committee chose the site of the new 
nuclear test, preparations for which lasted approximately four 
months. The same information indicates that the test aimed to 
check the efficiency of three secret Israeli bases that control 
the launch of nuclear missiles and weapons. Israel spent over 
$30 million on the test and part of the money was used to buy 
advanced technological equipment. 
  Some Arab governments reportedly received important 
political 
reports on the details of the test. The reports urged these 
governments to intervene directly with the United States and 
European states to keep the Mediterranean safe from nuclear 
tests. 
  This is Israel's second nuclear test this year.

  [Text] Tripoli, Al-Kanun [December] 6, Jamahiriyah News 
Agency -- A professor from a Libyan university, in co-operation 
with the centre for nuclear research in Tajoura has reached a 
breakthrough in his experiments in nuclear fusion, the energy 
which is created from a nuclear reaction between two nuclei, 
with identical characteristics, such as hydrogen rays, when they 
are fused. This type of reaction is the opposite of what takes 
place in nuclear fission which is currently carried out by 
atomic reactors throughout the world and are used to produce 
nuclear energy and to conduct nuclear tests. 
  The research scientist says that the results of his theory 
is 
the solution to the problem of beginning research in this area 
at an international level, where research continues and there is 
still no emergence of a reactor which would use hydrogen as it 
[word indistinct]. Hydrogen is one of the main elements of 
water and thus energy created from nuclear fusion is considered 
to be one of the most important alternative forms of energy in 
the future because its fuel (water) is available in (?great 
quantities) from the sea and oceans. 
  The research scientist says that this discovery will spur 
scientisist to review their research and experiments and to 
reexamine their theoretical studies and reformulate them on new 
bases and concepts. 
  The research scientist said that this discovery would help 
to 
solve other scientific problems which depended on it.

Asif Ahmad Ali by JORDAN TIMES Chief Editor George Hawatimah in 
Islamabad on "Thursday"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] 
  Q: Pakistan's refusal to endorse the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty 
has cost it much needed American assistance at a time when it 
needs all the help it could get. What are your views on nuclear 
arms, and how do you explain the continued nuclear activities of 
Pakistan against loud criticism and accusations that it is 
weapon- oriented at a time when the world trend is towards 
disarmament in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union? 
  A: Pakistan does not oppose the NPT. We have never refused 
to endorse the NPT. However, as a matter of principle we cannot 
accept discriminatory treatment vis-a-vis our neighbour India. 
In fact, as early as 1979, Pakistan had proposed simultaneous 
adherence by India and Pakistan to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
In that year we had also proposed that the two countries should 
simultaneously accept the IAEA safeguards. We have also called 
for the establishment of a nuclear weapons free zone in South 
Asia and a bilateral/regional nuclear test ban. Regrettably 
India has taken a negative stance on all these fair and 
constructive proposals which are aimed at preventing nuclear 
proliferation in our region. 
  When the NPT was adopted in the U.N. General Assembly in 
1968; Pakistan voted for it. We clarified then that Pakistan 
would sign the NPT if our neighbour India did so also. Pakistan 
has always been concerned about India's desire to develop 
nuclear weapons. These fears were realised when India exploded a 
nuclear device in 1974. Pakistan continues to maintain a 
principled position that it will accept any non-proliferation 
measure that is equitable and non- discriminatory between 
Pakistan and India. Therefore, if India signs the NPT, Pakistan 
will do so simultaneously. 
  On nuclear arms, let me state it categorically that Pakistan 
fully shares the view that nuclear proliferation would be 
destablishing and would threaten international peace and 
security. This is more true after the end of the cold war and 
the landmark agreements between the U.S. and Russia to reduce 
their nuclear arsenals. Pakistan has resolutely supported 
international efforts aimed at achieving complete nuclear 
disarmament as well as nonproliferation, particularly through 
the establishment of equitable and non-discriminatory regional 
non-proliferation regimes. 
  Our position regarding the U.S. nuclear policy in South Asia 
is that the Pressler Amendment which has created difficulties in 
the Pak-U.S. relationship, is a discriminatory law as it applies 
only to Pakistan and not to India or other countries which are 
known to be seeking a nuclear non-proliferation as India feels 
no compulsion to respond to the many constructive measures we 
have proposed for keeping South Asia free of nuclear weapons. 
The criticism against Pakistan over the nuclear issue is 
unjustified. 
  We remain committed to using our nuclear programme for 
peaceful purposes only. 
  While, in the development of this peaceful nuclear 
programme, 
we have acquired a certain technical capability, Pakistan has 
taken a firm political decision not to use this capability to 
produce nuclear weapons. Statements made by us reflectng this 
position are meant as reaffirmation of the peaceful nature of 
Pakistan's nuclear programme to preclude any misunderstanding.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Perception of N-Policy"] </F>
  [Text] The question as to whether there is any meeting 
point in the US administration's position on the Pressler 
Amendment and that of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's, can be 
answered in different ways. The US position as of today is that 
the Pressler Amendment is not going to be removed, only its 
debilitating effect on the US President's inherent executive 
powers, may be neutralised through another law. Ms Bhutto, on 
the other hand, has been saying that her government would keep 
pressing the US to dismantle the Amendment because being 
country-specific, it is a bad law. The law, in fact, is not 
only bad, it is also the only law of its kind in the US 
legislative history which seeks to penalise a friendly country 
(also its ally for a long time) and exempt from its application 
those who have been in the opposite camp and worked against US 
interests. There being a major moral anomaly involved in the 
application of this law, Ms Bhutto's plea makes sense. 
Therefore, on the face of it, there is no meeting point between 
the US position and that of Pakistan. Yet for all its apparent 
distance, the question may in its actual thrust may either be of 
semantics or of political tact. The US Congress, having been 
fed for a long time by the joint Israel-Indian lobby on the 
evils of nuclear technology in the hands of an Islamic country, 
may not be willing to countenance any move which would in effect 
amount to condoning Pakistan's `misstep'. Paradoxical as it may 
seem, the pro-Pressler lobby in the US congress believes that 
while Pakistan's alliance is of value to US strategic interests 
in that region, as was proved during the war in Afghanistan, it 
is less reliable than India where nuclear technology is 
concerned. To disabuse that lobby of this notion and persuade 
it to treat Pakistan and India at par, may take some time and 
effort. It could be that the US administration is unwilling to 
make that effort. It may have thus chosen the less prickly 
option of seeking for the President the same discretionary 
powers of waiver in the case of the Pressler Amendment, which he 
has in the case of most other US laws. 
  On principle, the PM's stance of `no rollback' on the one 
hand and of protest against a bad US law on the other, is 
morally right. Whether that would place the US administration in 
a difficult position vis-a-vis its Congress, is however, another 
matter. Yet it is obvious that both positions have been forced 
on the two governments by internal considerations. With the 
Opposition in Pakistan shouting betrayal, Benazir is obliged to 
talk openly on a subject which had best been kept confidential 
and the US administration may have found it necessary to keep 
the hardliners in the Congress mollified for a similar reason. 
Looked at from this angle the demand in Pakistan for an open 
debate on our nuclear policy, may not be in the best interest of 
the country. An in-camera debate would be far better, if at all 
it is unavoidable.

  [Text] Pakistan has expressed the hope that a rewrite of 
the American Foreign Assistance Act to be undertaken by Congress 
will further the objectives of nuclear nonproliferation jointly 
shared by the United States and Pakistan. A Foreign Office 
spokesman said in Islamabad today that Pakistan views the 
Pressler Amendment as a discriminatory law. He said Senator 
Pressler is likely to visit Pakistan by the middle of this 
month, and Pakistan will try to put across its point of view on 
the discriminatory nature of this law. 
  Replying to a question, the spokesman said Pakistan is 
continuously negotiating with different governments on different 
means to achieve the objectives of nonproliferation in South 
Asia,. He, however, said Pakistan has not received any specific 
proposal from the United States recently.

  [Text] Islamabad -- Pakistan's nuclear programme has 
neither been capped nor freezed, rather the country has adopted 
a policy of "restraint" on the issue, says General (Retd) Mirza 
Aslam Beg, former Chief of the Army Staff. 
  In an exclusive interview to Pakistan Observer, and weekly 
Hurmat, General Beg, who had been associated with policy 
formulation on the subject, revealed that the country had 
attained the required capability during the last tenure of the 
PPP government and the decision to adopt policy of restraint was 
made unanimously by all concerned. According to him, the 
decision was taken collectively by the then President, Mr Ghulam 
Ishaq Khan; the Prime Minister (then) Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto 
and the (then) COAS (Mirza Aslam Beg). 
  Clarifying the position whether the programme has been 
capped 
or freezed, the former COAS explained different stages of 
nuclear weapon programme. He said in the first stage Uranium is 
enriched at low or high level. Low Enriched Uranium (between 3 
to 6 percent) is used in atomic power plants whereas High 
Enriched Uranium (90 to 95 percent) is meant for 
weapons-oriented programme. In the second stage enriched 
Uranium is given device shape and different components of the 
device are manufactured. The third stage involves laboratory 
system whereas the whole system is tested in the fourth stage 
either through cold test or hot test as done by India in 1974. 
Dropping of the nuclear warhead is the fifth and final stage of 
the programme. With this background, he said stoppage of all 
the stages simultaneously would be called capping and stoppage 
of work on one or two stages would be called "freezing". But 
there is a third term "restraint" meaning not to proceed beyond 
attainment of the required capability. 
  General Beg said the capability was achieved during BB's 
previous rule and she had all the powers to take a decision 
about the fate of the nuclear programme. He said the decision 
to adopt policy of restraint was taken by GIK, BB and he (Mirza) 
himself and Nawaz Sharif inherited this decision. He strongly 
dispelled the impression that the decision was taken because of 
any outside pressure and said it was a voluntary decision. 
After this, the scientists were asked to work on other projects 
like missile manufacturing. "Had our programme been rolled 
back, all the scientists and technicians working on it would 
have been rendered superfluous and sent to their home which is 
not the case", he explained. 
  Replying to a question, General Beg said BB was a party to 
the decision to pursue the policy of "restraint" and Nawaz 
Sharif too continued this policy during his rule. Therefore, he 
said, they ought not blame each other. 
  To another question, he said the United States wants us to 
roll back and destroy the nuclear programme but "no Pakistan 
Government could do that". He said the present government 
should take the nation into confidence about the nature of the 
programme and its present stage as people would never allow any 
compromise on this vital issue. 
  The former COAS was of the view that there was a time when 
Pakistan could have detonated its nuclear device but any such 
action now would create many problems for the country. 
  General Beg was also critical of the decision of Pakistan 
Government to withdraw Kashmir resolution from a UN Committee 
and said India has agreed to talk to Pakistan only to buy some 
time. He said the present session of the UN General Assembly is 
ending on December 15 and India expressed its readiness to 
discuss the Kashmir issue with Pakistan only to deprive Pakistan 
of the opportunity to raise the issue at the world body. Now 
Pakistan would have to wait till next session. He was of the 
view that the forthcoming round of Pak-India talks would be 
fruitless. The very basis of the dialogue i.e. Simla agreement 
is not relevant because the discussions should focus on how to 
implement the UN resolutions. 
  About (American) General Hoar's visit to Siachin, he said 
the 
United States wanted to convey a signal to India that it would 
be in trouble if it (India) tried to improve its relations with 
China. Similarly, when India was going to sign an oil pipeline 
project agreement with Iran, the United States openly supported. 
Pakistan on Kashmir but when India described the project as 
"not feasible", Americans showed a gesture of goodwill by 
advising Pakistan not to take up Kashmir issue to UN.

<F P=106> [Report by Maulana Baabar] </F>
  [Text] Islamabad: The government Wednesday categorically 
stated it would accept inspection of its nuclear instalations 
only on a regional basis. 
  Explaining the government's policy regarding the interest of 
the Clinton administration in inspecting the nuclear 
installations, a Foreign Office spokesman said: "Consultations 
on this issue continue from time to time, including with the 
United States, but we will accept inspection only on a regional 
basis." 
  Reiterating the country's broad policy objectives on nuclear 
non- proliferation in South Asia, the spokesman said it should 
be "on a non-discriminatory basis and, create reasonable balance 
in conventional armed strength." He said Pakistan had always 
expressed its desire for achieving non-proliferation either 
through bilateral arrangement with India or on a regional basis 
and had given many proposals on this count.s 
  While welcoming the assessment of the State Department 
regarding the nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia, the 
spokesman said the new aid bill omitted the country-specific 
Pressier Amendment and, and the Pressler "standards" would be 
evenly applied to all countries. But, he said, the draft of the 
bill was not available. 
  The spokesman initially declined to comment on the new US 
aid 
bill, saying: "It is not for us to comment on the US 
legislation", as its had already been explained by a State 
Department spokeswoman Monday. 
  But when reminded by a journalist that he did not hesitate 
to 
comment on the Pressler Amendment which was also a US 
legislation, he said the government would wait before it reveals 
its official position on the new US foreign aid legislation. 
"We will see what form it will take, then we will comment," he 
said. 
  On the Indo-Pak talks, the spokesman said Pakistan hoped 
India would improve situation in held Kashmir for "purposeful 
and meaningful negotiations". 
  The spokesman also announced that Foreign Minister Sardar 
Assef and his Indian counterpart Danesh Singh would meet in 
Dhaka at the 13th Session of the Saarc Council of Ministers 
meeting, starting December 4. However, it would be an informal 
meeting and there was no fixed agenda, he added. 
  There is as yet no decision regarding Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto's visit to New Delhi to attend the UNESCO meeting. The 
dates for Bhutto's China visit have beenf confirmed and she 
would pay an official visit to that country from December 27-29. 
  The government once against expressed its concern regarding 
the continued fighting in Afghanistan. In this regard, the 
Afghan Foreign Minister had been informed that Pakistan 
considered there was no military solution to the infighting in 
his country. "Without taking sides we are willing to bring about 
peace," he said.

  [Excerpts] Launching the first indigenous locomotive at a 
ceremony in Risalpur today, the prime minister, Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto, said it is an historic event which marks Pakistan's 
entry into the comity of nations manufacturing locomotives. 
  [Begin Bhutto recording] Pakistan has entered into the 
community of nations who are producing their own locomotives. 
This momentous occasion of commissioning Pakistan's first 
locally manufactured locomotive is indeed an historic milestone 
in railways' industrial capacity as well as the country's 
history. [applause] Development activity in the country gives 
us satisfaction and pride. Risalpur is one of the backward areas 
of Pakistan. The establishment of a locomotive factory here will 
give a boost to the area and to the Frontier Province. The 
Risalpur Locomotive Factory is a tribute to the resilience of 
the workers of Pakistan Railways. This factory speaks volumes of 
the talents, the skills, the capability of all those who worked 
day and night in the respective positions in the Railways 
workshop. [end recording] 
  The prime minister also spoke about the collaboration 
between 
Pakistan and Japan in the economic and technogical fields and 
said on a number of international issues Pakistan and Japan 
share common perception. 
  [Begin Bhutto recording] We have benefited immensely from 
Japanese investment and technical assistance in locomotives, in 
the automobile industry, fertilizer production and power 
generation. We have worked together in the field of economy as 
well as in the sphere of science and technology. The 
inauguration today of this locomotive factory and the launching 
of the first locomotive built is a testimony of our growing ties 
in the fields of science, technology, and economy. Japan and 
Pakistan share similar views in the field of foreign policy. 
Both countries seek to build a world where there is a 
limitation and reduction of strategic weapons. We share the 
same concern about nuclear proliferation, about human rights, 
and narcotics control. [end recording] 
  [Passage omitted on speeches of Secretary for Railways and 
Japanese ambassador and Bhutto's visit to various sections of 
factory] 
  Talking to newsmen before her departure from Risalpur, Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto said the Kalabagh dam will be built only 
if all the four provinces agree to it. The prime minister said 
the NWFP [North-west Frontier Province] and Sindh have some 
reservations on the constructions of this dam. We will 
negotiate with these provinces and then go for it if a consensus 
emerges. 
  On the country's nuclear program, she reiterated in 
categorical terms that it would not be rolled back.

<F P=106> [Report by Ansar Abbasi] </F>
  [Text] Islamabad: There was unanimity among the speakers at 
a seminar on "Pakistan's Nuclear Option" that the nuclear 
programme is a deterrent, essential for the country's security, 
and so it should not be rolled back, frozen or capped, otherwise 
the country could face serious threats from outside. 
  The seminar, which was organised by the Institute of Policy 
Studies, asked whether the fact that Pakistan has made a nuclear 
device should be declared to the world or should be kept vague. 
  Those who enlightened the audience included: the former 
Joint GOAS, General (Retd) K M Arif; the director general of 
ISI, Lt General (Retd) Asad Durranl; the former federal minister 
and ambassador to Washington, Abida Hussain; Senator Khuralud; 
Dr Tahir Amin and a former ambassador, Dr S M Koreshi. 
  The speakers were also united in the belief that nuclear 
non- 
proliferation would be welcomed if it were universal, but any 
selective application of the principle should never be accepted. 
  Without going into controversies concerning who capped the 
programme, General K M Arif said the important question to ask 
was, why was it capped? What was the aim? Was it done to get 
US aid or to get the Pressler Amendment scappred? 
  General (Retd) Asad Durrani said ambivalence is better than 
declaration because declaration would diminish the effectiveness 
of the threat. He said the Pakistani nuclear threat was based 
on assumption. 
  The retired general said that India believes that we have 
the 
capability and the will to use it. He said the enemy is 
hesitant about launching a crackdown in occupied Kashmir because 
of this deterrent. 
  If one side, he said, is conventionally weaker than the 
other 
side, it must rely on the strength of deterence. A genuine 
deterrent, he said, would function at every level-both 
conventional and nuclear. 
  Durrani said that the US linkage of Pakistan's nuclear 
programme with that of India has helped in many ways. The 
negative effect, he said, would be if India agreed to 
denucle-arise its capability. Then Pakistan would have to give 
up its deterrent, and that would leave Pakistan on an unequal 
level with India's conventional weapons. 
  Syed Abida Hussain said that during her tenure as ambassador 
to Washington she went through a very strange and rather 
humiliating experience. She said the peosple in the US are very 
crude, and they don't care for others, especially those who are 
useless for them. 
  She said she landed in the US with the idea that the US was 
Pakistan's friend, as they jointly struggled against the Soviet 
Union for Afghanistan, but for the US Afghanistan has already 
become history. 
  During her stay in Washington she said, she suffered severe 
criticism and hatred of Pakistan and the Muslim countries. 
  North Korea, Pakistan and Kazakhstan are three countries 
which are the constant target of their criticism in this regard. 
The other thing she experienced there was that the Americans 
used the terminology of Muslim "fundamentalists," militants and 
"the Muslim threat." 
  Dr Tahir Amin, professor of international relations at 
Quaid-e Azam University, said was between Pakistan and India had 
been averted on several occasions because of the nuclear 
deterrent. 
  He raised three very important questions. Why are 
governments in Pakistan weak, and why do they compromise on 
national issues? What is the extent of American penetration in 
Pakistan? And what changes have taken place in the world, and 
what will their implications on Pakistan be? 
  He said the national interest is defined by a small military 
bureaucratic elite which is approached by outsiders, and they 
always compromise the national interest defined by themselves. 
He said no political government has the capacity to with stand 
such pressures.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Asif Ahmad Ali has said that 
Pakistan will not sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] 
in a situation in which India is doing everything for the 
proliferation Aof nuclear weapons. In an interview with a 
Bangladeshi newspaper, THE TELEGRAPH, he said that Pakistan has 
been obliged to face a difficult situation through the linking 
of aid with the signing of the NPT in the Pressler Amendment, 
while India is acquiring nuclear technology and introducing 
weapons to carry nuclear warheads to their targets and [nuclear] 
submarines. 
  The foreign minister said that Pakistan believes in nuclear 
nonproliferation. However, the security issues of relevant 
countries should be viewed from a regional perspective. He 
urged India to review its role in the region.

  [Text] Dhaka, Dec 6 -- Foreign Minister Asif Ahmad Ali has 
said that Pakistan would not possess more technology or 
ingredients to proliferate nuclear arms but at the same time "we 
will not roll back the nuclear programme." 
  In an interview with independent English Newspaper, THE 
TELEGRAPH published in its Monday's issue captioned "Pak option 
for N-plan due to Indian threat."[sentence as published] The 
Foreign Minister said, "We believe in principle that the nuclear 
buildup is bad for the people. We have the capacity to do so but 
we have given assurances that we will not do so and we are 
simply keeping option for nuclear buildup open for security 
reasons." 
  The question of nuclear non-proliferation and the security 
of 
the states concerned must be addressed from regional point of 
view while India must re-think about its role in this region, Mr 
Ali said. 
  Replaying to a question about the US perception of nuclear 
proliferation by Pakistan, he said it would be difficult for 
Pakistan to sign nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) under 
the given situation when India was doing everything for 
proliferation. 
  The Foreign Minister said that Pressler's proposal for 
conditionalising the signing of NPT with aid had pushed Pakistan 
to a stake while India was still acquiring nuclear technology 
and introducing new weapons like nuclear carriers and 
submarines. "They are the naughty boys and nuclear 
delinquents", he added. 
  Asked about the present stand of the Pakistan Prime Minister 
not to roll back the nuclear plan in the wake of pressure from 
the West, Mr Ali said, "There were also suggestions from friends 
of Pakistan that it should not dismantle its nuclear programme." 
  When asked if (India) is not in a position to go to war what 
is the necessity on the part of Pakistan to maintain nuclear 
plant, the Foreign Minister said, "this is just because we can't 
let our defence programme shelved. We had been victim of 
aggression before and just for that matter we can't play with 
our own security." 
  The Pakistan foreign Minister referred to the Indian plea of 
developing nuclear weapons to counter China and said in the 
present context China is not at all threat to India or any other 
country. 
  Asked if Pakistan was in a position to counter India which 
has more than half a million soldiers Mr Ali said there was no 
provocation from Pakistan side rather India was mobilising 
soldiers to contain its internal insurgency which was going on 
in different parts of India. 
  He said India has got lot of problems and added even a 
massive troops mobilisation in Kashmir failed to restrain the 
Kashmiri people. "Just by using force you can't contain them." 
  Asked Pakistan would go for any defence pact with Bangladesh 
particularly when the 25-year treaty between Bangladesh and 
India expires by 1996. [sentence as published] He said. "Let 
time come. We have the highest sympathetic sentiments for the 
people of Bangladesh and what Bangladesh expects from us will be 
given due attention. "We have cooperation at all levels, he 
said.

  [Text] The prime minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto has said 
there will be no roll back of our peaceful nuclear program. 
Talking informally to journalists in Islamabad today, she 
answered a number of questions, including those on the nuclear 
issue and the Pakistan- American relations. 
  [Begin Bhutto recording] With the United States, we have 
also started a two-way dialogue to see how the two countries can 
overcome the problem that has arisen in their relationship. We 
cannot roll back [the nuclear program] and this is the position 
we have tried to explain to the United States that we cannot 
roll back. At the same time, we have explained to the United 
States that we support nonproliferation and we seek to have a 
peaceful nuclear program and so long as there is no threat to 
our security, our program will continue to be peaceful. 
  We feel that the Pressler Amendment is unjustified because 
it 
is not only discriminatory, but it does not serve the purpose of 
regional nonproliferation. In fact, it is a veto in Indian 
hands. 
  So, we are trying to pull Pakistan out of international 
isolation. We are trying to put Kashmir in its proper 
perspective and we are trying to put the Pressler Amendment in 
its proper perspective. Obviously, this is not liked by the 
opposition because our achievements only highlight their 
failure, and, so, they are kicking up a big dust about a 
non-issue. [end recording]

  [Text] Qinshan, December 15 (XINHUA)--The Qinshan nuclear 
power plant, the first Chinese-designed reactor, met its 
targeted annual generating capacity today, two years ahead of 
schedule. 
  Located in east China's Zhejiang Province, the plant has 
generated a total of 1.62 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity 
since the beginning of this year. 
  According to a plant executive, the plant is currently in 
trial operation, producing 7.2 million kilowatt-hours every day. 
  The official said that the 300,000-kilowatt plant has 
generated a total of 2.14 billion kilowatt-hours since it opened 
two years ago. 
  The plant has helped ease an energy shortage in east China, 
one of the country's fastest growing areas, he said. 
  The central government has approved a plan for the plant's 
second phase of construction, which will include the 
installation of two 600,000-kw generating units, he said. 
  A senior official at the Beijing-based China National 
Nuclear 
Corporation (CNNC) said that the government plans to build a 
group of new nuclear power plants around the Qinshan area. 
  China currently has two nuclear power plants. The second 
reactor is located in Dayawan (Daya Bay), in southern Guangdong 
Province, and is about 50 kilometers northeast of Hong Kong. 
  The Dayawan Plant's first generating set of 900,000 kws went 
into operation at the end of August this year.

  [Text] Hangzhou, December 16 (XINHUA)--By 2020, China 
should have a nuclear generating capacity of 20 million 
kilowatts, furnishing about five percent of the country's annual 
electric power output. 
  According to a senior official at the China National Nuclear 
Corporation (CNNC), nuclear power now accounts for only 0.5 
percent of the country's output. 
  The 300,000 kilowatt Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in Zhejiang 
province is celebrating the second anniversary of its trial 
operation. The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong, with 
two 900,000 kilowatt generating units, is to start commercial 
production next year. 
  ``That means China's nuclear power generating capacity will 
be 2.1 million kilowatts,'' said CNNC Deputy General Manager 
Zhao Hong. 
  Work has begun on the second phase of construction at the 
Qinshan facility, which involves four 600,000 kilowatt 
generating units powered by nuclear reactors, Zhao told XINHUA. 
  CNNC also plans to continue construction at the Daya Bay 
plant, which will install two more generating units, each with a 
capacity of 900,000 kilowatts or greater, he said. 
  Coastal provinces such as Jiangsu, Liaoning, Hainan and 
Shandong are ``interested in nuclear power plants,'' and are 
making pre- construction preparations or conducting commercial 
negotiations. 
  Nevertheless, Zhao said, the development of nuclear power in 
China has to be ``appropriate'' in scope and speed because 
nuclear reactors are expensive. 
  To cope with this problem, he said, CNNC welcomes foreign 
investment to supplement domestic funds from the central and 
local governments and Chinese bank loans.

<F P=106> [``Electric Power Problems Report Series'' column, by staff </F>
correspondents Chen Zujia (7115 4371 3946) and Zhu Jingruo (2612 
4552 5387): ``Nuclear Power: An Option That Leads Us out of the 
`Bottleneck'''--first paragraph is editor's note] 
  [Text] This newspaper followed the report series on the 
railway problem in the first half of the year with another 
series on the electric power problem in the second half. 
Beginning with the article ``Electric Power: Another 
`Bottleneck' for China's Economy,'' the series eventually ran 
for two months, during which it produced 12 articles--all of 
them carried in a prominent place--and attracted widespread 
attention from various circles. The following article is the 
last in the series. In coming days, this paper will carry a 
synopsis by Shi Dazhen, minister of power industry. We would 
like to express our heartfelt gratitude to all the comrades who 
cared about and supported the electric power report series, and 
to those who offered assistance to reporters in their coverage. 
  The entry of nuclear power into our country's economic life 
is only a recent event. 
  On 15 December 1991, the Taishan nuclear power plant, 
situated on Hangzhou Bay, delivered powerful electrical current 
to the east China power grid. Toward the end of this year, the 
No. 1 generator at the Daya Bay nuclear power plant in Guangdong 
will go into commercial operation. There will be a continuous 
supply of nuclear power to Guangdong and Hong Kong, turning a 
new page in the history of China's energy. 
  At the time we were cheering the takeoff of nuclear power in 
our country, nuclear power alrady had supplied one sixth of the 
world's power generation, and in 1992 there were 424 nuclear 
reactors operating in countries around the world. 
  Changes in the energy consumption structure determine 
economic upturns and downturns. Following coal and petroleum, 
the peaceful use of nuclear energy has changed, in its turn, the 
world economic pattern. 
<H5>  I: Nuclear Power--the Key To Solving Problems in Development </H5>
  In the last 40 years, nuclear energy has been one of the 
main 
reasons why many countries along the Pacific rim and on the two 
shores of the Atlantic Ocean achieved rapid economic development 
despite their remoteness from or shortage of energy resources. 
  In the 1960's and 1970's, when southern China relied on the 
constant supply of coal from the north, nuclear power rose 
rapidly to the fore in Europe and the United States. In the 
course of 30 years, the United States built more than 100 
nuclear reactors and became the country with the largest nuclear 
power capability. France made developing nuclear power its 
national policy for solving the energy shortage, and in the 17 
years from 1973, increased its proportion of nuclear power from 
4 to 72 percent. A cheap and quality-constant nuclear power 
base has supported the French economy. Now, all the EC 
countries, which once were plagued by energy shortages, see 
one-third of their electric power generated by nuclear energy. 
Given all this, the developed European countries and the United 
States still believe that they will not make it into the 21st 
century without nuclear energy. 
  In the 1980's, the center of economic growth shifted to the 
Asia- Pacific region. Countries along the Pacific Rim, having 
pierced the dark clouds surrounding the nuclear incidents on 
Three Mile Island in the United States and at Chernobyl in the 
former Soviet Union, now see nuclear energy as the golden key to 
solving difficulties in economic development. 
  Japan, with 44 nuclear power plants, sees nuclear power as 
the ``key energy source.'' The government, the economic sector, 
and the power companies worked jointly, formulating long-term 
development plans. By the year 2000, Japan's nuclear power will 
account for 40 percent, as compared with the current 27.7 
percent of national power generation. 
  India has announced the building of another 22 nuclear 
reactors by the end of this century. The ROK and our country's 
Taiwan Province began developing nuclear power in the mid- and 
late 1970's, respectively. By 1988, it was accounting for about 
half the total power general in the ROK and Taiwan. Taiwan was 
able to halve its unit power price after it had successfully 
developed nuclear power. 
  News keeps arriving that Pakistan, Indonesia, the 
Philippines, and Thailand either are studying or are developing 
nuclear power plants. The trend of developing nuclear power 
plants in Asian countries is growing. 
  Meanwhile, nuclear technological sectors in Europe, the 
United States, and Japan have joined forces in researching a 
safer, cleaner, and more economical fast-reactor that can use 
nuclear resources more efficiently. Developed countries also 
have intensified research into nuclear fusion, a study that 
might offer mankind unlimited energy. 
  By now there is no doubt that nuclear power will be the main 
source of energy in the 21st century. It is now a global 
consensus that countries which fail to attain nuclear energy 
will never become developed. 
<H3>  II: Nuclear Power--The Ideal Recipe for Economies Along the 
Southeast Coast To Get Out of the Impasse </H3>
  Power shortages have become the ``bottleneck'' in our 
country's economic development--something the southeastern coast 
has felt most acutely. The region is reeling under the pressure 
of transportation bottlenecks and environmental pollution. 
  These transportation and environmental pressures all can be 
traced to the region's unbalanced energy structure. 
  Our country's coal energy is concentrated in the ``three 
Xi's'' (Shanxi, Shaanxi, and western [xi] Inner Mongolia), while 
70 percent of its water resources come from the southeastern 
coastal region. Eighty percent of the electric power supply to 
the southeastern coastal region is generated from coal. The 
north and west supply the south and the east with coal. 
Forty-six percent of the rail freight on the Beijing-Shanghai 
and Beijing-Guangdong lines is coal for power generation 
purposes, and 30 and 26 percent of the freight traveling the 
busiest waterways and highways--again--is coal for power 
generation. This rate, however, is still far from meeting the 
demand. At one time, 40 percent of Jiangsu's state-managed 
generator units were shut down because they had run out of coal 
for power-generating purposes. 
  Coal-generated power is the engine of economic development, 
as well as the cause of high transport volumes and environmental 
pollution. A million-kilowatt thermal power plant each year 
releases tens of thousands of tonnes of toxic particles, such as 
sulphur dioxide and oxidated nitrogen, and hundreds of kilograms 
of such carcinogenic particles as mercury, cadmium, and trityl 
ditacene. 
  How can we solve the three great problems--energy, 
transportation, and environment--afflicting the southeastern 
coastal region? In the manner of curing the pathological 
sources of three diseases with one surgical operation, it would 
be ideal to have one kind of energy, with a one-time investment, 
benefiting all quarters. Beyond the horizon of long-distance 
hydropower energy, people can catch a glimpse of nuclear power. 
  The advantage of nuclear power, compared with coal-generated 
power, is plain and obvious. A one-million kw water-pressurized 
nuclear reactor need change only 30 tonnes of fuel each year, 
one- 100,000th of the transport volume required by a coal power 
plant of the same capacity, thus solving the transportation 
problem at one stroke. The environmental pollution caused by a 
nuclear power plant operated under safe conditions is 
practically negligible, its radiation release being smaller than 
that from a coal power plant of similar capacity. Therefore, Dr 
Sieberg, a Nobel Prize-winning nuclear chemist, said on the 
occasion of the 50th anniversary of the nuclear fission of 
plutonium: ``Nuclear energy is the safest and most 
environment-friendly source of electrical power.'' 
  As early as 1970, Premier Zhou Enlai said in a relevant 
debriefing session: We will have to rely on nuclear power if we 
want to solve the fundamental power shortage problem of 
Shanghai. Nuclear power has solved a wide range of problems for 
many places having large populations and rapid industrial 
development, but suffering from a shortage of energy resources. 
No doubt it will prove a good recipe for the southeastern 
coastal region of our country. 
  Although the advantages of nuclear power are very obvious; 
  Although our country has a relatively rich uranium resource, 
sufficient for the development of nuclear power; 
  Although in the process of developing nuclear weapons, our 
country has fashioned a complete nuclear technological and 
industrial system, ranging from mining and the fission of 
uranium isotopes, to the production of nuclear-fuelled 
components, the design and construction of nuclear reactors, and 
the reprocessing of volt-amperes reactive fuel [fa ran liao hou 
chu li 0040 3595 2436 0683 5710 3810]; 
  Although our country has a 30,000-odd strong nuclear 
technological contingent, all members of which have been tested 
by decades of field work and are quite capable of hardship and 
working under pressure; 
  Although our country's infrastructural industry has 
experienced considerable development so that it can meet the 
needs of the development of nuclear power; 
  Nuclear power still plays a negligible part in our lives. By 
the end of this September, the Taishan nuclear power plant, 
which now is operating steadily, had generated an accumulated 
total of 1.7 billion kw of power. This, plus the total power 
volume generated by the two 900,000 kw generator units in the 
Daya Bay nuclear power plant up to the end of 1993 and mid-1994, 
respectively, has amounted to only about 1 percent of our 
country's total power generation. 
  We are late in starting; we missed the best time for 
development. On 28 February 1990, Qian Sanqiang, Li Jue, Jiang 
Shengjie, and Wang Ganchang wrote to Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, 
urging them to outline a long-term nuclear power development 
program, an action demonstrating the earnestness for the country 
and the people of these four highly decorated veteran 
scientists. Premier Li Peng replied to them on 30 April: ``A 
plenary session of the State Council Leading Group for Nuclear 
Power Plants on 15 March this year confirmed that nuclear power 
has been incorporated into the national economic development 
program.'' 
  Today, coastal provinces such as Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, 
Shandong, Liaoning, and Hainan, as well as inland provinces like 
Sichuan, Jiangxi, and Hunan, all are submitting requests for the 
construction of nuclear power plants. The strategic task 
confronting us now is to speed up development in order to catch 
up. In August 1993, the China National Nuclear Industry 
Corporation centralized facilities and talents in the design and 
construction of nuclear projects and in equipment procurement 
and technological services, so as to establish the new China 
International Nuclear Power Engineering Group Company, in order 
to benefit from the advantages of group companies in the nuclear 
power market. 
  Although we are working hard to catch up, every step along 
the way has proved extremely difficult. The status and 
functions of nuclear power in our country's economic development 
have yet to be fully appreciated by decisionmaking departments. 
The state nuclear power management is unable to muster enough 
muscle to centralize leadership, which has become a major 
constraint on the development of nuclear power. The absence of 
assured financing through institutional channels also has 
affected nuclear power research and pursuits. 
  Nuclear power plants require a relatively large initial 
investment, and their success ultimately depends on safety 
guarantees and financing pledges. The two nuclear power plants 
slated to be built--in Guangdong and on the Bohai Bay in 
Liaoning--have been assured of meticulous designs, but will they 
get stable financial guarantees? 
  The development of nuclear power is a complicated 
systems-engineering project. Owing to the highly specialized 
nature of the intensive research and production of key 
installations, the production of matching equipment for 
designated projects, the supply of nuclear fuel, the 
reprocessing of volt-amperes-reactive fuel, the disposal of 
``three kinds of waste products,'' the determination of sites 
for the power plants, and arrangements for their retirement, the 
process of actual implementation requires highly centralized and 
unified leadership, and firm and efficient day-to-day 
management. Otherwise, nuclear power will not be able to display 
its advantages in freeing us from economic ``bottlenecks.'' 
This is the eager wish of the majority of dedicated nuclear 
power workers and the true voice of countrymen eagerly hoping 
for a full power supply and never-ending light. Nuclear power, 
may your light and heat help push us out of ``bottlenecks!''

  [Text] Seoul, Dec. 23 (YONHAP)--Seoul officials said 
Thursday they remained optimistic of a breakthrough in the North 
Korean nuclear impasse after another Pyongyang-Washington 
contact in New York the same day. 
  One official, declining to be identified, said that a North 
Korea-U.S. high-level contact for a third round of nuclear talks 
may be agreed on next month. 
  Confirming the New York contact early Thursday morning, the 
officials said that the United States demanded North Korea 
accept inspections acceptable to the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) and necessary to continue IAEA safeguards. 
  It also demanded resumption of inter-Korean dialogue on the 
nuclear issue and meaningful negotiations, they said. 
  The U.S. side made it clear that the demands were 
preconditions, they said. 
  ``You could say there are forward movements,'' said one 
official. 
  The very fact that the contacts are occurring quickly 
signifies that the differences between North Korea and the 
United States are ``not very big,'' he said. 
  The two sides met on Monday with North Korea's response to 
the two demands by South Korea and the United States. The 
response was rated as positive by both Seoul and Washington, 
though not enough. 
  Ho Chong, deputy chief of the North Korean mission to the 
United Nations and the representative at the New York contact, 
said he suggested ``simultaneous steps'' in meeting demands of 
both sides. 
  Pyongyang reportedly suggested accepting overall IAEA 
inspections on all of its declared sites instead of limiting 
them to handpicked facilities in exchange for suspension of the 
South Korea-U.S. joint military exercise Team Spirit and the 
scheduling of the third round of high-level talks.

  [Text] Pyongyang, December 16 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam, a puppet, speaking about the fictitious ``nuclear 
problem'' of the North in an ``interview'' with the South Korean 
radio ``CBS'' [Christian Broadcasting System] on 14 December, 
said ``the United States would make no concessions,'' according 
to a report from Seoul. 
  This is a despicable attempt to frustrate the DPRK-USA talks 
aimed at a solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula 
and a heinous challenge to the North. 
  When he said ``the United States would make no 
concessions,'' 
he probably took into consideration the ``definite answer'' of 
the United States on the maintenance of an ``international 
cooperation system'' which he got during his U.S. trip in 
November in return for rice market opening. No one but 
flunkeyist traitors could do that. 
  The traitor Kim again raised the questions of ``inspection 
by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency'' and ``North-South 
dialogue,'' making quite a noise as if they were 
``preconditions'' for third round DPRK-USA talks. In the final 
analysis, this was also a sinister attempt to drop the checkbar 
on the way of DPRK-USA talks. 
  It is the biggest tragedy for the traitor Kim that he does 
not know that frustrating the DPRK-USA talks means, in the long 
run, cutting his own throat. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam must know this clearly and refrain 
from such mean acts as imprudently poking his nose into others' 
business.

<F P=106> [``NODONG SINMUN on Aichi's Outcry Over `Missile Issue' of </F>
DPRK'' -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, Dec. 11 (KCNA) -- The new director 
general of the Japan Defence Agency, Kazuo Aichi, in his first 
``instructions'' after his assumption of office, contended that 
although the cold war ended, the ``nuclear and missile issues of 
North Korea'' are ``a factor of instability.'' 
  NODONG SINMUN today says that his utterances soon after he 
got into office revealed his true color as the same warhawk as 
his predecessor Keisuke Nakanishi and his anti-DPRK attitude. 
  The news analyst says: 
  As far as the socalled ``nuclear issue'' of the DPRK is 
concerned, it is not a problem into which the Japanese 
reactionaries are not supposed at should poke their nose. 
[sentence as received] The nuclear problem on the Korean 
peninsula must be solved through negotiation between the United 
States, the party responsible for it, and the DPRK. 
  Lurking behind Japan's imprudent fuss is a sinister 
intention 
to use the fiction of ``nuclear threat'' from the DPRK as a 
pretext for its own nuclear armament and a shield to divert 
elsewhere the arrow of international criticism of its nuclear 
armament. 
  The ``missile issue'' of the DPRK over which Aichi raised an 
outcry presents no problem at all. It is entirely natural that 
we should take a self-defensive measure when the situation on 
the Korean peninsula has been strained and brought to the brink 
of war by the hostile forces. It is self-evident that this 
poses no ``threat'' to Japan and cannot be decried. 
  Japan, however, has decided to develop a missile defence 
system jointly with the United States with a shrill cry over the 
``missile issue'' of the DPRK, as if something big had happened, 
and is intensifying arms buildup more openly. 
  We will never tolerate this.

  [Text] Tokyo, Dec. 15 KYODO -- Japan should bar a Korean 
residents' association in Japan from making ``systematic 
shipments'' of military-related high technology to North Korea, 
the head of a Tokyo think tank said Wednesday [15 December]. 
  Katsumi Sato, director of the Modern Korea Institute, told 
the Foreign Correspondents Club of Tokyo that a North Korean 
military defector has attested to the shipments arranged by the 
pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan 
(Chongryun). 
  Sato said that Lim Song-son, a first lieutenant in the North 
Korean People's Army in charge of military construction who 
defected, told the institute that ``some 75 percent'' of the 
construction equipment, including trucks, cranes and bulldozers, 
are from Japan. 
  Sato quoted Lim as saying, ``whenever something breaks, we 
photograph the defective part and fax the photo to the Chongryun 
along with the part number. In no time, the part is shipped to 
us on the Mangyeongbong ferry.'' 
  The 150,000-member Chongryun functions as Pyongyang's 
virtual 
embassy in Japan. The Chongryun-operated ferry shuttles between 
Niigata and the North Korean port of Wonsan. 
  Lim, 30, who defected to South Korea in August and testified 
to the existence of underground missile launching pads in North 
Korea, was interviewed by the institute, which gained permission 
from the South Korean Government. 
  Sato said Japan should ``realize its duty'' to place curbs 
on 
computer chips and COCOM-regulated products, as his institute's 
investigation indicates North Korea is ``now trying to downsize 
a missile warhead, so that the Nodong-1 missile could deliver a 
nuclear bomb to Japan.'' 
  Sato, 64, charged Chongryun has exported ``key high-tech 
components North Korea needs for its war machine.'' 
  Song Yong-bok, an official of Chongryun's Scientist and 
Engineer Association of Korean Residents in Japan (SEA), denied 
Chongryun violated COCOM (Coordinating Committee for Export 
Controls) regulations. SEA is a group of about 170 Korean 
researchers working in Japanese universities and business 
companies. 
  ``All the large cargo and luggage we have sent to North 
Korea 
from Niigata has cleared inspections at customs,'' he said. 
  But Ikuo Misumi, senior inspector at the security export 
control division of the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry, told KYODO NEWS SERVICE, ``our ministry has not issued 
any instructions to Niigata customs to inspect the contents of 
each piece of luggage of passengers going to North Korea.'' 
  Sato also urged the government to halt the annual flow of an 
estimated 60 billion yen in Chongryun's banking remittances and 
cash gifts from Korean residents in Japan to their relatives in 
North Korea, saying the money eclipsed the entire 1990 North 
Korean budget of 35 billion won. 
  Tsutomu Nishioka, editor-in-chief of the institute's monthly 
news magazine, also said, ``although a ban on cash gifts to 
North Korean relatives may raise humanitarian problems, to 
prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear missile should 
take precedence, as a nuclear attack would snuff out so many 
people.'' 
  ``Many people are being forced to take along or send money 
as 
their relatives are taken hostage, whom Pyongyang has threatened 
to put into concentration camps or keep in detention, unless 
they handed over money,'' Nishioka said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Dec. 24 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has developed 
mobile launchers for its Nodong-1 missiles, making it extremely 
difficult to intercept the missiles or to locate launch 
facilities and knock them out of commission, the YOMIURI SHIMBUN 
newspaper reported Friday. 
  ``North Korea will put the Nodong-1 missile into operational 
deployment next year,'' the YOMIURI quoted international 
military sources as saying. 
  ``When North Korea succeeded in test firing the Nodong-1 in 
late March, it was launched from a fixed platform, so we thought 
that changing the location was very difficult,'' a Japanese 
Defense Agency spokesman was quoted as saying. ``But later the 
United States and Japan learned that a mobile launch was 
possible by analyzing intelligence.'' 
  ``The Nodong-1 is so large that launching it from a ship 
proved impossible, however,'' the senior official reportedly 
said. 
  ``Since it does not use a fixed launch platform, it is hard 
to discover the launch location. Moreover North Korea has 
transferred most of its military facilities underground, so an 
attack by U.S. forces on the missile facilities is difficult.'' 
  The Nodong-1, a modified Scud-C ballistic missile having a 
1,000-kilometer range, is capable of reaching most areas of 
Japan except parts of Hokkaido.

<F P=106> [``Exclusive'' by Peter Seidlitz in Beijing: ``Nuclear </F>
Threat Increases''] 
  [Text] North Korea has not one, but probably several atomic 
bombs and the vehicles to launch them, according to top Western 
diplomatic sources who have just returned from Pyongyang. The 
chilling assessment comes from two high-ranking Beijing-based 
European diplomats who have sent alarming reports to their 
governments following the secret fact-finding mission. 
  One of the envoys, an ambassador, writes in his report: 
``North Korea has, in our opinion, the full capacity to enrich 
natural uranium and graphite of North Korean origin and has 
built several kilo-sized bombs. We established as well that 
testing sites exist.'' 
  The diplomats had top-level discussions and were met by Kim 
Chong-il, the 51-year-old heir-apparent to ``great Leader'' Kim 
Il-song. They expressed to him their concern about the danger 
North Korea's nuclear weapons programme poses for world peace. 
  The North Koreans prompted speculation that they were 
acquiring a nuclear capability last March when they withdrew 
from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and refused further 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
Two meetings between North Korean and American officials last 
month failed to alter the situation. It was then that U.S. 
President Bill Clinton warned Pyongyang it would not ``be 
allowed to develop a nuclear bomb'' and urged them to ``crawl 
back off the ledge.'' 
  In recent weeks, the Central Intelligence Agency said North 
Korea might have enough weapons-grade plutonium for ``one or 
two'' bombs...but that assessment seems well short of the mark, 
according to the European envoys. 
  During their visit, they concluded that North Korea, which 
originally received help from Soviet nuclear scientists, had 
perfected the complicated ignition devices needed to explode an 
atomic bomb. They were also certain the Koreans had adapted 
short- range Scud-B Soviet missiles for use as launch vehicles. 
They are producing a Korean version of the improved Scud-C, 
which they have named Nodong-1. 
  The Nodong-1 has been tested over 650 kilometres but can 
deliver conventional or atomic bombs over 1,000 
kilometres--meaning most major South Korea and Japanese cities 
would be just 10 minutes away. 
  North Korea has now around 120 Nodong-1 rockets, some of 
which have been secretly exported to Iran. There are secret 
testing and weapons development programmes between Iran and 
North Korea. American military sources believe that Iran has 
provided nuclear technology that North Korea has been unable to 
acquire elsewhere. 
  The Koreans have also acquired mobile launching vehicles, 
according to sources. The Nodong-1 are transported on the 
chassis of IVECO heavy duty trucks made by Fiat in Italy. The 
Salzburg-based Austrian company Palfinger Ag, which makes 
special cranes designed for trucks, has imported crane equipment 
for this purpose. The cranes can lift the remodelled Scuds on 
the trucks and move them in seconds from horizontal transport 
into vertical launching positions. 
  The mobile launching vehicles are difficult to track by spy 
satellites and therefore difficult to destroy by aircraft or 
cruise missiles--as the allies found when chasing Iraqi Scuds 
during the Gulf War. It is believed 30 trucks have been fitted 
out as mobile launching pads. 
  A Beijing-based military attache said yesterday: ``There is 
ample evidence of the nuclear programme of North Korea coming 
from U.S. intelligence. The only question is whether North 
Korea has managed to change the original crude structure into a 
bomb and if it can be carried by a rocket. But even that 
doesn't matter. North Korea can drop the bomb by plane or 
deliver it by boat if it wants.'' 
  North Korea has also tested the reliability and 
predictability of the ignition and explosion devices of their 
bombs. The secret crater-like test site is on the banks of the 
Kuryong River--very close to Korea's main nuclear research 
facility at Yongbyon. 
  North Korea has imported from Europe extensive 
high-explosive 
testing material and neutron initiator materials, such as 
polonium 210 and tritium, sources said. 
  The device tested was, according to these experts, the most 
important evidence that nuclear bombs have been produced. North 
Korea, like Iraq, has escaped the export monitoring of special 
testing and diagnostic equipment and the necessary high speed 
electronic components. It has yet to perform a full-scale 
nuclear test, but because of sophisticated detection equipment 
employed by the West, it would not be practical for reasons of 
secrecy. 
  However, heat output measurements of North Korea's nuclear 
reactor have given some estimates of the amount of plutonium 
they have produced--believed to be enough for at least half a 
dozen bombs.

  [Text] Pyongyang, Dec. 17 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
DPRK Foreign Ministry answered a question put by a KCNA reporter 
today regarding the rumor now rife in the international 
community about the DPRK-U.S. contact made in New York on 
December 10. 
  He said: 
  A contact between the DPRK and the United States over the 
nuclear issue took place in New York on 10 December at the 
request of the U.S. side. 
  As is known, at an earlier contact we had advanced a new 
reasonable proposal which could break the present deadlock in 
the DPRK-USA talks. 
  U.S. official figures too took a positive view of it. 
  At the recent contact, however, the U.S. side came up with a 
counter proposal negating ours. 
  Although the U.S. side described its proposal as 
progressive, 
there is nothing new in it in actuality. The White House 
spokeswoman made this plain when she officially stated that 
``there is no change in the U.S. stand.'' 
  We showed the utmost lenience we could offer at the present 
stage, taking into consideration the U.S. side's expression of 
its readiness to accept our formula of package solution. 
Nevertheless, the United States stubbornly insisted on its 
unreasonable stand. Judging from this, we cannot but wonder if 
they truly intend to solve the nuclear problem, or seek to 
stifle our Republic on the pretext of the nuclear problem, 
although they say outwardly they hope for a negotiated solution 
of the nuclear problem. 
  Moreover, we cannot help doubting the United States' will 
for 
talks because they are deliberately delaying a solution of the 
nuclear problem by persistently raising as a precondition for 
the third round of the DPRK-USA talks the exchange of special 
envoys between the North and the South of Korea, a question 
which has nothing to do with the talks. 
  We made a dramatic offer to accept an inspection of the IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency] necessary for the 
continuity of safeguards, an offer commensurate with our special 
position in which we temporarily suspended the effectuation of 
our withdrawal from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, out of 
our basic stand to solve the nuclear problem fundamentally 
through the DPRK-USA talks. 
  We cannot but be surprised at the fact that the United 
States 
is laying artificial obstacles again by connecting the exchange 
of special envoys between the North and the South, an internal 
affair of our nation, with the nuclear issue in a far-fetched 
manner at a time when the prospects of a negotiated solution of 
the nuclear problem are in sight. 
  If this resulted from a U.S. policy switchover, we will have 
no alternative but to seriously consider our stand toward the 
dialogue. 
  If the United States continue to resort to pressure and 
delaying tactics without showing concern for the progress of 
the dialogue, it is hard to expect an agreement on the formula 
of a package solution even if the third round of talks were 
held. Saying its counter proposal is based on an agreement with 
its allies, the United States threatened to bring the matter to 
the United Nations unless we accept it. We cannot but be on our 
guard against this ultimatum-like pressure of the U.S. 
  In case the last opportunity of a negotiated settlement of 
the nuclear issue should be lost because of the unreasonable act 
of the United States threatening our existence as today, it 
would be the United States that would regret this. 
  Clear is our position. 
  It entirely depends on the U.S. attitude whether the third 
round of talks are held and the nuclear problem is solved, or 
not in the future.

  [Text] In connection with the diverse public opinion being 
circulated internationally regarding the issue of the DPRK-U.S. 
contact which was held on 10 December in New York, the spokesman 
of the DPRK Foreign Ministry answered as follows to the question 
raised by the Korean Central News Agency's reporter on 17 
December: 
  According to the proposal by the U.S. side, a DPRK-U.S. 
contact was held on 10 December in New York to discuss the 
nuclear issue. As known, in the contact prior to this, we had 
put forth a new rational proposal which can open a breakthrough 
in the current deadlock in the DPRK-U.S. talks. In this regard, 
officials of the United States had made positive assessments. 
  Nevertheless, in the 10 December contact, the U.S. side came 
forth with an alternative which denies our proposal. The U.S. 
side practiced magic as if its alternative was progressive, but 
as the spokesman of the White House officially proclaimed that 
there is absolutely no change in the U.S. position, in essence 
there is nothing new in the alternative. 
  Considering the fact that the U.S. side said that it will 
accept our package deal method, we showed the maximum generosity 
we can carry out at the current stage. Nevertheless, when 
viewing the fact that the United States is continuing to insist 
on such an unjust position, we cannot but doubt whether it truly 
wants to resolve the nuclear issue or whether it is pursuing the 
plot to crush [apsal] us by finding fault with the nuclear 
issue, even though on the surface it is saying that it wants to 
resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue. 
  Moreover, the reason that it was inevitable for us to be 
suspicious about the agenda of the talks by the United States is 
that it continued to come forth with the issue of exchanging 
special envoys of the North and South as a precondition for 
holding the three-stage talks, which has no relation to the 
DPRK-U.S. talks, and intentionally delayed the resolution of the 
nuclear issue. 
  We presented a momentous proposal to accept the inspection 
by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency necessary to ensure the 
continuity of safeguards, a proposal commensurate with our 
special position of tentatively suspending the validation of the 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, out of our 
basic stand to resolve the nuclear issue at source through the 
DPRK- U.S. talks. 
  We cannot but be surprised at the fact that the United 
States 
is laying artificial obstacles again by linking the exchange of 
special envoys between the North and the South, an internal 
affair of our nation, with the nuclear issue in a far-fetched 
manner at a time when the prospects of a negotiated solution of 
the nuclear issue are in sight. If this is prompted by a change 
in the U.S. policy, we also must prudently reconsider our 
position toward dialogue [urido yoksi taehwae taehan uriui 
ipchangul sinjunghi koryohaeboji anulsu opta]. 
  If the United States is thus not interested in the progress 
of dialogue and resort continuously to the tactics of pressure 
and delay, even if the third round of talks is held, we can 
hardly expect the package solution to be agreed on there. We 
cannot but be on our guard, in particular, because the United 
States, saying that this counterproposal is agreed on with its 
allies, is taking an attitude of putting pressure in the manner 
of delivering an ultimatum, saying that if we do not accept it, 
it will take the issue to the United Nations. 
  If the United States behaves unjustly as it does, 
threatening 
our existence, thereby losing the last chance for resolving the 
nuclear issue through talks, it will be the United States that 
will regret it after all. 
  Our position is clear. It depends entirely on the attitude 
of the United States whether the third round of talks is held 
and the nuclear issue is resolved.

  [Text] Pyongyang, Dec. 22 (XINHUA) -- A Foreign Ministry 
spokesman of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) 
said today that he is expecting a response from the United 
States to DPRK's new proposal over the disputed nuclear issue. 
  He told reporters that the two countries were in contact on 
Monday [20 December] in New York and the DPRK had put forward a 
new plan in view of the U.S. suggestion proposed on 10 December. 
  The spokesman, releasing no details of DPRK's proposal, said 
nevertheless that it was ``reasonable'' and would 
``satisfactorily help solve the nuclear problems on the Korean 
peninsula.'' 
  The DPRK and the U.S. have failed to reach any agreement 
during their regular ``contacts'' throughout December. 
  Meanwhile, the United Nations Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali is reportedly traveling to the DPRK on Friday 
following his visit to the Republic of Korea. 
  He is the first UN chief to visit DPRK in the past ten years 
and is expected to hold talks with DPRK leaders on the 
deadlocked nuclear issue.

  [Text] North Korea's atomic power-related facilities which 
are located in 20 different areas throughout North Korea, 
include atomic power plants and laboratories such as the 
radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon. North Korea's atomic 
power plants, for example, are known to be equipped with old 
nuclear reactors, and, accordingly, the danger of accidents is 
very high. As such an accident will also affect us, special 
measures need to be taken. Yim Yong-kyu, director of the ROK 
Technological Institute for Atomic Power Safety, emphasized this 
at the workshop on ``North Korea's Science and Technology and 
Prospects for North-South Exchange in Science and Technology'' 
held on 8 December at the Tower Hotel in Seoul under the 
auspices of the General Union of ROK Scientific and 
Technological Organizations. 
  At the workshop, Director Yim stressed ``it is very 
important 
and urgent for us to diagnose the level of North Korea's atomic 
power technology and its safety,'' and added ``however, it is 
very difficult to grasp the whole picture of North Korea's 
atomic power as it was hidden for a long time.'' 
  According to Director Yim's research published during the 
workshop, North Korea initiated its research on atomic power in 
1956. After concluding an agreement on atomic power research 
with the former Soviet Union, North Korea established the atomic 
power engineering department at Kim Il-song University and Kim 
Chaek Engineering University and the atomic power research 
center at Yongbyon. With this as an occasion, North Korea began 
full-scale research activity on atomic power. 
  North Korea introduced a research reactor from the former 
Soviet Union in 1965. In the latter part of the sixties, North 
Korea began developing its atomic power industry, by exploring 
uranium, mining and smelting ore, processing nuclear fuel, and 
constructing power plants. 
  At present, North Korea has about 20 atomic power 
facilities, 
including a 200 megawatt [MW] atomic power plant now under 
construction in Taechon, the radiochemical laboratory in 
Yongbyon suspected of being reprocessing facilities, and uranium 
mines. 
  Director Yim said: North Korea asserts that it is developing 
atomic power to meet its rapidly increasing demands for 
electricity. However, considering the fact that it has no 
commercial-purpose atomic power plants, its refusal to accept 
nuclear inspections, and its development of missiles, this 
assertion by North Korea lacks credibility. 
  On the other hand, Director Yim expressed deep concern about 
the safety of North Korean atomic power plants by saying ``North 
Korea's atomic reactors are old type, graphite-moderated, 
gas-cooled reactors from the fifties. Fuel rods of such old 
reactors can be broken easily, and energy accumulated in 
graphite can be emitted in one shot. This may result in an 
accident.'' 
  He added: ``If North Korea has pushed ahead with the 
development of nuclear weapons secretly, the safety issue would 
not have surfaced due to the peculiar nature of North Korean 
society.'' 
  Director Yim guessed that ``The reason why North Korea has 
adhered to using graphite reactors, the safety of which is very 
low, is because graphite reactors can increase the yield of 
plutonium and can easily extract plutonium by using the natural 
uranium they exploit as fuel.'' 
  The status of North Korea's atomic energy-related facilities 
is as follows:

  [Text] The 1st Corps Information Service reports that 
artillery shells fired from Chetnik positions at parts of the 
defense lines suggest that today too will probably see the 
aggressor using all available means to enter the city. 
  This morning, an all-out artillery barrage is being directed 
at the region in and around Zuc, which the [Serbian] aggressor 
is targeting with howitzers, tanks, mortars, and other heavy 
artillery from several positions. The residential areas in the 
northwestern part of the city have also been targeted, while 
shells carrying chemical charges have landed on Glavica. 
  Everything points to the fact that infantry attacks could 
follow, so citizens are warned to restrict (?their movements). 
The general alarm has been sounded and citizens are asked to 
exercise maximum caution.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Jovanovic: ``Conspiracy in a </F>
Conspiracy''] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] 
<H5>  ``Cold Fusion'' </H5>
  Although the scandal in connection with illegal accumulation 
of wealth of Z. Panic and his son, the owner of the ``Kentaur'' 
Company, was disclosed in May, he remained chief of General 
Staff until the end of August. An established state board had 
the task of examining the circumstances in connection with the 
``Panic'' scandal (it was led by the unlucky Minister Pavle 
Bulatovic), but it has not written a report for the public yet. 
If Seselj is lying, why is not he put on trial? If General 
Panic had stolen, why is he not he on trial...? 
  One of the people we spoke with says this is ``a game within 
a game,'' adding that General Panic is an important man of the 
Serbian regime, one of the ``untouchables.'' His name is 
mentioned in connection with dealing with weapons and oil 
through a federal foreign trade institution. This institution 
has in the meantime been transformed into a company that 
functions as a fictitious cover for everything (``Jugoimport''), 
about which Seselj spoke for NIN, fearing that this weekly would 
be prohibited after this information is published! 
  The journeys of General Panic to Russia and Iraq in March 
1993 can be seen in this light. MONITOR wrote last month that 
large quantities of ammunition are entering Serbia and go on to 
Bosnia, and that there is also the transfer of weapons and parts 
for manufacturing 1000-km range missiles. It is also mentioned 
that technology is being imported and concentrated in the 
nuclear institutes in Serbia. The process of ``cold fusion,'' 
which would enable to equip the missiles with nuclear warheads, 
is being tested. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 19 Dec (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AHRAM 
comments in an editorial today on the UN General Assembly's 
recent resolution urging all Middle Eastern countries to join 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and stop developing or 
producing nuclear bombs. 
  The paper notes that Egypt was among the first countries to 
join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in the 1960's, while 
Israel refused and continues to refuse to sign the treaty or 
commit itself to the nonpossession of nuclear arms. 
  Referring to the UN inspection committees that have 
monitored 
Iraq's airspace and territory since it invaded Kuwait to ensure 
that it does not possess the capability to manufacture weapons 
of mass destruction, AL-AHRAM says a similar measure has not 
been applied to Israel even though it does not allow its nuclear 
installations to be inspected. 
  The paper urges Israel to comply with the UN General 
Assembly 
resolution, as the other countries in the region have, in line 
with the current effort toward establishing peace and 
good-neighborliness among them.

  [Text] Algeria has announced today its intention to join 
the international non-proliferation treaty. This announcement 
came on the occasion of the inauguration of El-Salam nuclear 
reactor at Ain Oussera. More details with Ahmed Khida: 
  [Begin recording] Khida: First, we 
stress that Foreign Affairs Minister Salah Dembri officially 
declared today in three languages Algeria's intention to join 
the international nuclear non- proliferation treaty. He was 
third to speak at the inauguration ceremony of the diplomatic 
missions--which were all invited, and most of whom attended--and 
before international and national journalists. 
  Dembri: Therefore, I officially announce today--in 
the name of the highest authorities in the country--our 
intention to join the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. 
  Khida: Therefore, after the El-Nour nuclear 
reactor in Algiers, with its weak one MW capacity, another 
nuclear reactor was officially inaugurated in Ain Oussera, 
Djelfa Province. It is called the El-Salam reactor and has a 
capacity of 15 thermal MW. The inauguration coincided with the 
35th anniversary of establishing Algerian-Chinese relations in 
1958. This reactor was the product of Chinese companies. The 
representatives stressed ongoing Algerian-Chinese cooperation 
and revealed that IAEA experts had visited the Ain Oussera 
nuclear reactor many times during the stages of its 
construction, and they had become convinced that this 
achievement was for purely peaceful purposes of research. 
  For his part, Algeria's Foreign Minister Dembri said that 
the 
El-Salam reactor had (?accepted) at the Algerian Government's 
request to meet the guarantees of the IAEA. 
  National Education Minister Ahmed Jebbar, who was the first 
to speak, stressed that the construction of the El-Salam nuclear 
reactor was a logical culmination of the considerable efforts 
exerted over 20 years in training, science, and technology. 
  Therefore, this new nuclear reactor is aimed at nuclear 
research, which has become a major component of all systems. 
The research to be carried out by this new reactor concerns the 
fields of medicine, X-ray treatment, and research development in 
the fields of agriculture and industry. 
  Finally, we record the absence of the general director of 
the 
IAEA, Mr. [Hans] Blix, who on this occasion sent a message to 
the Algerian Government in which he stressed his belief that 
this new achievement constitutes an important landmark in the 
development of nuclear research and control technology.

<F P=106> [``Comment'' column by Sayyid Mustafa: ``The Nuclear </F>
Contradiction''] 
  [Text] In his speech before the UN General Assembly on 27 
September, U.S. President Bill Clinton said that one of the most 
urgent priorities of U.S. policy in a post-Cold War world is the 
need to confront the spread of nuclear, chemical, and biological 
weapons of mass destruction. 
  He discussed the possibility that over 10 countries have 
such 
weapons and that there is a danger the number could increase, 
creating instability in various regions. 
  The United States is trying hard to apply this policy in 
many 
places. The world is currently witnessing an escalation between 
the first power in the world and North Korea. This escalation 
has reached the level of threats of war or threats to wage 
abortive attacks if Pyongyang does not adhere to the agreement 
on placing nuclear weapons under international supervision. We 
also notice a strict tone when U.S. officials discuss the 
nuclear capacities of countries such as Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq 
as well as their special abilities to produce weapons of mass 
destruction. 
  Often, U.S. officials shy away from answering questions on 
Israeli nuclear power and its effect on stability in the region. 
A few days ago, State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry said 
he needs preparation to answer such a question. 
  In a news conference at the U.S. embassy in Cairo, Frank 
Wisner, undersecretary of defense for policy, said, concluding 
his recent visit to Egypt, that there is a confusion of 
positions when North Korea's nuclear power and Israel's nuclear 
force are discussed. His only justification for this confusion 
was that Israel has not signed the nonproliferation treaty and 
that North Korea is threatening its neighbors. 
  The atmosphere of peace into which the region is moving 
badly 
needs this nuclear contradiction or policy of double standards 
applied in one area and forgotten in another to end. 
Washington needs to take effective measures and work together 
with countries in the region to rid them of the nightmare of 
total annihilation. Egypt, on an initiative by President Husni 
Mubarak to rid the region of weapons of mass destruction, was at 
the front of this field. The United States needs to adopt such 
constructive initiatives for peace to reign in the world of the 
new order.
