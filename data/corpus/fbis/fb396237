<F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Krutikov: "Situation of Conflict. After </F>
Nalchik Everything Is Back to the Way It Was"] 
  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has kept his 
promise: An edict was published concerning organizing the return 
of Ingush refugees to four villages of Prigorodnyy Rayon of 
North Ossetia. But observers are noting with alarm that this has 
not brought the long-awaited peace to the Northern Caucasus. 
  As we know, the edict was adopted while developing the 
agreements reached on 7 September in Nalchik when a declaration 
was signed which envisions Ingushetia's abandoning its 
territorial claims to North Ossetia, removing the thesis about 
the impossibility of Ossetians and Ingush living together, 
disbanding illegal armed formations, returning refugees to 
densely populated places, and "sealing off" the border between 
Russia and Chechnya. But as early as the next day the parliament 
of North Ossetia, under pressure from a rally of many thousands 
in the central square of Vladikavkaz, adopted a decree that 
actually disavows the results of the meeting in Nalchik. 
Justifying himself to the deputies, the head of the Supreme 
Soviet of North Ossetia, Akhsarbek Galazov, admitted that he had 
agreed to a partial return of the Ingush refugees under pressure 
from Boris Yeltsin. He himself, as before, considers this 
measure to be an illegal act that creates an impasse situation. 
  In turn, the president of Ingushetia, Ruslan Aushev, never 
tires of saying that he signed no documents in Nalchik, that the 
land from which the Ingush--citizens of North Ossetia--were 
deported has been Ingush territory for centuries, and that their 
return to Ingushetia is just a matter of time. 
  One statement after the other, the discussion among the 
leaders of the two republics has returned to its former tracks, 
assuming its previous tonality. For example, a couple of days 
ago Ruslan Aushev again accused the Ossetians of murdering the 
head of the temporary administration of the emergency region, 
Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Viktor 
Polyanichko. According to information from the president of 
Ingushetia, on 1 August Viktor Polyanichko went to the village 
of Tarskoye for negotiations with the commander of the Ossetian 
home guard, Bibo Dzutsev, in order to discuss with him the 
details of returning to the Russians the weapons of the Russian 
special forces that were seized by the Ingush in the 
Dzheyrakhskoye Ravine. Polyanichko was to have reached an 
agreement with Dzutsev not to intervene in the transfer of the 
weapons. This partially explains why Polyanichko did not have 
the proper guard--Bibo Dzutsev is in practically complete 
control of the actions of the fighting men in the region and 
enjoys respect in North Ossetia. Dzutsev, incidentally, turned 
up at the scene of the tragedy 10 minutes after the murder of 
Polyanichko and Koretskiy. Aushev thinks that the terrorists 
were urged on by the fact that on 2 August Polyanichko was to 
have been working on determining four population points of 
Prigorodnyy Rayon to which the Ingush would be returned. 
  According to a different version, Viktor Polyanichko was 
going to negotiations with the Ingush field commanders who had 
seized the weapons from the Russian special forces. A day before 
this Ruslan Aushev had told Polyanichko that the weapons would 
be returned but it would be necessary to pay 40 million rubles 
for them. Aushev asserts that he was prepared to forward this 
money himself and Polyanichko would then return this sum after 
the weapons had been turned over. On the morning of the murder 
Aushev again spoke with General Anatoliy Koretskiy and again 
offered his services for immediately buying the weapons. But the 
temporary administration thought that the price of the purchase 
could be considerably reduced and therefore Polyanichko went to 
the village of Tarskoye to negotiate the price of the purchase 
with the Ingush field commanders and the head of the 
Dzheyrakhskiy rural soviet, Tsurov. 
  In addition to this one there are several other versions of 
the murder of Viktor Polyanichko and General Anatoliy Koretskiy. 
The Russian investigatory group, in spite of the optimistic 
statements of certain of its members and the sworn promises of 
Sergey Shakhray, has still made no progress in investigating the 
terrorist act against the deputy prime minister of the Russian 
Federation. 
  The situation in South Ossetia has also unexpectedly become 
much worse. Not far from Tskhinval a Niva truck was blown up by 
a mine and another light vehicle following it was fired upon 
with an automatic weapon. In the vehicle were Georgian peasants 
from villages of the Tamarashenskiy corridor: Two were killed on 
the spot and four more, according to Georgian information, are 
missing. The next day this report was confirmed by the press 
center of the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs, which also 
announced that in Gori there was a meeting of representatives of 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia and the Ministry of 
Defense of South Ossetia at which they discussed the extremely 
dangerous aggravation of the situation in the region. 
  Observers think that the attack on the Georgian vehicles 
near 
Tskhinval was organized in response to the murder of the four 
Ossetians several days earlier. Recently in a number of Georgian 
villages of South Ossetia, especially Tamarashen, Kekhvi, 
Achabeti, Nikozi, Ergneti, and Eredvi, there has been tension, 
and active military preparations have been underway. The 
Ossetians are expressing concern not only about the mobilization 
activity of Georgia but also the inaction of the peacekeeping 
forces and military command. The Ossetians have been forced to 
"fill out" their own defense in spite of the fact that recently, 
as a result of internal feuds and disagreements, the political 
situation in South Ossetia has been considerably weakened.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Todres: "Steppe Leadership. The Kuban: </F>
Typical Characteristics in Typical Circumstances"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  The Territories </H5>
  The broad (about 30 cm wide) and deep (three stories) crack 
in the wall of the KUBANSKIY KURYER building has been gaping 
there for a month already. The reasons, the objective, and the 
perpetrators of the terrorist act are still unknown, but the 
result is known: At that time a 20-year-old proofreader at the 
newspaper died on the spot under debris falling from above. 
Local authorities expressed alarm and sympathy, law enforcement 
organs swore to find the perpetrators and punish them, and 
democrats added one more item to their list of communist crimes. 
  The unpoliticized majority of Krasnodar residents recalled 
this apotheosis of the election campaign with sarcasm and 
cynicism: "Even the Decembrists were unable to blow up the 
newspaper properly: For some reason they placed the bomb in the 
men's john...." 
<H5>  Personalities </H5>
  The elections in Kuban were a competition among three 
individuals, and they were by no means Gaydar, Zyuganov, and 
Zhirinovskiy. Vying for places in the senate were titans of 
local significance, each of whom had managed to be the master of 
Krasnodar Kray and become a symbol of a certain epoch. 
  The decades of socialism and kolkhoz construction in the 
Kuban--Nikolay Kondratenko, chairman of the kray executive 
committee, and then chairman of the kray soviet, who was 
overthrown in August 1991 for supporting the State Committee for 
the State of Emergency. 
  The troubled present of "gradual reforms" and quiet 
privatization without unnecessary competitions--the present head 
of the kray administration, Nikolay Yegorov. 
  The unrealized romantic dreams of members of Democratic 
Russia from the "living circle" of the times of the 1991 
putsch--Vasiliy Dyakonov, who became governor after the fall of 
Governor Kondratenko but who remained in the post little longer 
than a year. Mr. Dyakonov remained in the people's memory 
because of his mass farmerization (17 farmers appeared in the 
kray and there was stiff resistance to decollectivization on the 
part of the rest of the population) and his attempt to maintain 
the minimum prices of bread in 1992--by collecting fees from 
tobacco and alcohol trade in the Kuban. The management blunders 
for which Mr. Dyakonov was removed are a material fact, but it 
is no less of a fact that his dismissal was persistently 
achieved by the kolkhoz leaders and the tobacco and vodka 
directorate. 
  Nonetheless, according to the assessment of the current head 
of the kray soviet, Aleksandr Zhdanovskiy (who ran on the 
Yabloka ticket), the contest for senate seats included "not so 
much ideologists as clans." Once united into a single 
party-economic elite, the chiefs now--with the disappearance of 
the oblast committee supervision--have recognized the 
differences in their branch interests. And they have not yet 
been able to achieve an awareness of their common regional 
interests which would join the local elite together with a new 
glue in a subsidized, slowly privatized Krasnodar Kray. 
  Nikolay Kondratenko ran in the elections as a representative 
of the "agrarian clan" of kolkhoz chiefs. Nikolay Yegorov was 
supported by another part of the agrarians, managers, and those 
who had their eyes on the ports, borders, and other transit 
capabilities of the kray. Among his assets were long-standing 
ties with Vladimir Shumeyko and Viktor Chernomyrdin and more 
recent ties with Sergey Shakhray. Having gained the sympathy of 
the president's administration, the head of a powerful 
construction trust Vasiliy Dyakonov competed with the mayor of 
Krasnodar, Yevgeniy Samoylenko. 
<H5>  The Fight </H5>
  Mr. Kondratenko and Mr. Yegorov became members of the 
Council 
of the Federation. 
  The first winner was clear long before the elections: The 
rating of "Ataman Kondrat," who seemed to have retired from 
politics, had not dropped below 40 percent among Kuban residents 
during the past year. Mr. Kondratenko contemptuously rejected a 
proposal to withdraw in exchange for the position of head of the 
tobacco joint venture with the Philip Morris firm: A senator's 
position guarantees more magnificent prospects. 
  The main contest was for the second position--because of it 
a 
scandal broke out throughout all of Russia when the local 
election committee refused to register Mr. Dyakonov as a 
candidate, and it ended with the dismissal of the election 
committee chief Yuriy Lapkin. 
  The opposing teams accused one another of gaining signatures 
through pressure on their subordinates, direct falsification of 
signatures, and forgery when they were being verified.... 
  The position of the local Russia's Choice candidates was 
explained most clearly by the activist Lyudmila Belova, who up 
to this point was grateful to Vasiliy Dyakonov for the fact that 
it was during his governorship that her family was granted its 
own farm with 100 hogs: "All leadership is playing dishonestly. 
But the higher the leadership, the greater possibilities it has 
of doing this. Dyakonov has the least." Indeed, on 12 December 
(after campaigning had already been prohibited) at the doors of 
the electoral precinct of the kray hospital I encountered only 
two placards--of Governor Yegorov and Mayor Samoylenko. On the 
other hand, there is also a particle of truth in the words of 
the press secretary of the kray soviet, Galina Kravchenko: "If 
Dyakonov were from another bloc and not from 'Choice,' would 
Moscow really have raised such a stink?" 
<H5>  Zhirinovskiy </H5>
  Predictions have persistently given the LDPR [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia] second place in Krasnodar Kray. "It 
will get no higher: Unlike 'Choice' and the Communist Party of 
the Russian Federation, they actually have no organizations 
here," the Krasnodar sociologist Viktor Kritskiy assured me. In 
the end the party outdid both the Communists (twofold) and the 
members of Russia's Choice (fourfold). As discussions with local 
residents showed, most of those who voted for the LDPR did it 
"out of spite"; before 12 December few people even thought about 
the party slates: The elections remained elections from local 
families. "I just found out about all of these parties--at the 
precinct," a 40-year-old housewife, Tatyana Boyko, confided to 
us. 
  Local journalists doubt that Zhirinovskiy's victory in 
points 
really means an increase in his influence in the party in the 
kray: LDPR activists have nothing to do with the local elite. In 
conservative Kuban up to this point--and in the foreseeable 
future--things will be decided by the leadership. And up to now 
no one political force really has the required reserve. 
<H5>  Cossacks </H5>
  More than a million of the kray's population of 5 million 
consider themselves to be Cossacks. In the Cossack villages (and 
essentially more than half of the Kuban residents live in rural 
Cossack villages) they still distinguish Cossacks from 
"foreigners." "If a person could really rely on the Cossacks he 
would undoubtedly become a leader in the Kuban," thinks 
Aleksandr Zhdanovskiy. 
  There is no question of the authority of the current Cossack 
structures. Homegrown politicians with Cossack striped trousers, 
the majority of whom are city residents ("a real Cossack tills 
the soil"), have already managed to split into "red" and "white" 
Cossack troops. One group contains several thousand and the 
other--several hundred. The "whites" were openly in favor of 
Dyakonov, and the "reds" were cautiously in favor of 
Kondratenko. But both of them demanded "purging the Kuban of 
unwanted guests." 
  The traditional Kuban anti-Semitism is more of a theoretical 
nature: Barely 3,000 Jews live in the kray. The main "foreign 
enemy" is from the Caucasian Mountains. Since the beginning of 
the war in Transcaucasia the 350,000 local Armenians living here 
since Potemkin's times have been augmented by more than 100,000 
refugees from Armenia. The Russians, of whom there were twice as 
many among the refugees, have somehow been able to blend in with 
the local population. Armenians, the majority of whom have set 
up successful businesses, constantly feel the hostility of their 
neighbors and attacks from politicians. The latter, naturally, 
never miss a chance to gratify their supporters loudly and 
freely. During the last campaign the triumphant Nikolay 
Kondratenko attacked the "outsiders" especially openly. 
  "In the neighboring Stavropol Kray it has already started: 
The Cossacks have been beating up Armenians at the bazaars and 
kicking them out of their homes. Let me tell you--the Kuban is 
on the brink," a chap standing in front of the main Krasnodar 
market admitted. Incidentally, Konstantin Zatulin built his 
entire campaign in the south of the kray on the demand to set up 
a strong border between the Caucasian republics. In the opinion 
of the sociologist Kritskiy he would inevitably have won on this 
if the well-known Communist, the cosmonaut Sevastyanov, had not 
ended up as his opponent. 
<H5>  Prospects </H5>
  Head of the kray administration Nikolay Yegorov gives 
himself 
special credit for "achieving political stability," by which he 
means mainly elimination of the conflict with the Council. After 
coming to the Council of the Federation Mr. Yegorov still 
retains the governor's post, but the prospects for "stability" 
are still not so clear. 
  Elections to the new kray parliament have been scheduled for 
6 March. The current leader, Aleksandr Zhdanovskiy thinks that 
"the party will be, to put it mildly, much more progressive than 
the Council," and Nikolay Kondratenko is sure to occupy the 
position of its chairman. 
  Incidentally, one of Mr. Yegorov's closest advisers, the 
head 
of the Kuban innovation fund, Konstantin Vlasyuk, states that 
this will not mean a change in the politics in the kray: 
"Kondratenko's influence was greatly affected by the fact that 
he had been out of office for three years." 
  The administration has no way out other than to localize the 
activity of the new local legislators: In the first place, the 
openly subsidized Kuban, whose budget "could not be saved even 
by a single-channel system," is in no position to spoil 
relations with the Kremlin. In the second place, in the words of 
Mr. Vlasyuk, "the kray has attracted the attention of serious 
investors": for example, the main buyer at the auction in the 
Novorossiysk port (with its oil transfer terminal) was the 
Lukoyl Company. Many are also attracted by the stand of valuable 
redwood in the Caucasian foothills. 
  "The problem of the agrarians is that their sphere of 
influence remains within the kray. Ours is arising anew," 
asserts Konstantin Vlasyuk. "Our current task is somehow to 
convince the people close to the president of the Russian 
Federation that if Kondratenko and Yegorov win in the elections, 
the kray would not become a Russian Vendee. We can agree on 
everything to everyone's satisfaction."

<F P=106> [Edict of the President of the Russian Federation Boris </F>
Yeltsin and Statute "On the General Principles of the 
Administrative-Territorial Division and Organization of Local 
Self-Government in the City of Moscow"] 
  [Text] 
<H3>  Edict of the President of the Russian Federation Boris 
Yeltsin "On the General Principles of the 
Administrative-Territorial Division and Organization of Local 
Self-Government in the City of Moscow." </H3>
  According to information of the press service of the 
president of the Russian Federation, an edict of the President 
of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin "On the General 
Principles of the Administrative-Territorial Division and 
Organization of Local Self-Government in the City of Moscow" has 
been submitted for publication. The edict was signed on 10 
December 1993. 
  We present the full text of the document and the provisional 
statute approved by him: 
  "For the purposes of ensuring the development of local 
self-government in the city of Moscow and the execution by the 
city of the functions of the capital of the Russian Federation, 
I resolve: 
  "1. To approve the accompanying provisional statute on the 
general principles of the administrative-territorial division 
and organization of local self-government in the city of Moscow. 
  "2. To propose to the organs of state authority of the city 
of Moscow to develop and adopt normative acts in 
January-February 1994 that regulate the procedure for conducting 
reforms of local self-government in the city of Moscow. 
  "3. To submit this edict for review by the Federal Assembly. 
  "4. This edict goes into effect from the day it is 
published." 
<H3>  Statute on the General Principles of 
Administrative-Territorial Division and Organization of Local 
Self-Government in the City of Moscow: </H3>
  I. General principles of administrative-territorial 
division. 
  1. This provisional statute establishes the general 
principles of the administrative-territorial division of the 
city of Moscow as a component of the Russian Federation--a city 
with federal significance. 
  2. The system of administrative-territorial division of the 
city of Moscow is made up of: 
  --an administrative okrug; 
  --a municipal okrug. 
  3. The administrative okrug is an intracity administrative 
unit, a system of organs of authority that is built on the basis 
of centralized management. The procedure for managing the 
administrative okrug is established by a special statute 
approved by the mayor of Moscow. 
  The city of Zelenograd forms a separate administrative 
okrug. 
  The territory of the administrative okrug includes municipal 
rayons. 
  4. The municipal rayon is an administrative-territorial unit 
of the city of Moscow within whose borders the self-government 
of the population that lives on the given territory is conducted. 
  Municipal rayons are organized taking into account the 
socioeconomic characteristics of pertinent territories, their 
town-planning and historical features, and the presence of 
residential complexes and objects of the municipal 
infrastructure. The boundaries and the names of the municipal 
rayons are established by the Moscow City Duma on a 
representation of the mayor of the city of Moscow. 
  The municipal rayon is divided into microrayons 
(settlements) 
in which organs of territorial public self-government can be 
established. The boundaries and names of microrayons are 
determined by the organs of self-government of the municipal 
rayon. 
  II. The principles of organization of local 
self-government. 
  5. Local self-government on the territory of the city of 
Moscow is conducted on the basis of this provisional statute, 
legislation of the Russian Federation, and the normative acts of 
the city of Moscow, taking into account its status as the 
capital of the Russian Federation. 
  6. The organs of local self-government in the city of Moscow 
are municipalities that include assemblies of representatives of 
the population of the municipal rayon (municipal assemblies) and 
the head of the local administration (head of the municipality). 
  III. Local administration. 
  7. The activity of the local administration is directed by 
the head of the municipality, who carries out the management of 
the municipal economy and property, develops the estimate of 
incomes and expenditures, ensures its implementation, and 
performs other executive-administrative functions. 
  8. The head of the municipality is appointed in coordination 
with the municipal assembly by the mayor of Moscow from the 
number of candidates recommended by the prefect of the 
administrative okrug. 
  In the event of nonconcurrence by a majority of the members 
of the municipal assembly in the candidacy proposed for the 
position of the head of the municipality, the mayor has the 
right to resubmit this candidacy or propose another one. 
  Given the nonconcurrence of a majority of the members of the 
municipal assembly in the proposed candidacy in this case as 
well, within a two-week period the mayor of Moscow appoints an 
acting head of the municipality for a period of one year. The 
indicated person enjoys all of the rights and carries all of the 
responsibilities of the head of a municipality. 
  The head of the municipality cannot engage in other paid 
activity, except for teaching, scientific, and other creative 
activity. 
  9. The head of the municipality, in the event of a 
systematic 
nonfulfillment of his duties or their gross violation, can be 
dismissed from the position by the mayor of Moscow, including on 
a representation of the prefect of the administrative okrug, or 
on the basis of an appeal by the municipal assembly. The 
indicated appeal is examined by the mayor within a two-week 
period. 
  10. The head of the municipality issues instructions on 
questions of his own jurisdiction established by legislation of 
the Russian Federation and normative acts of the city of Moscow. 
  11. The administration of the city and the municipal 
assembly 
have a right to exercise control over the activity of the head 
of the municipality in a procedure stipulated by legislation of 
the Russian Federation and normative acts of the city of Moscow. 
  12. The procedure for dismissal of the head of the 
municipality and the appointment to the position and dismissal 
from the position of his deputies is established by the mayor of 
Moscow. 
  IV. Municipal assembly. 
  13. The assembly of representatives of the population of a 
municipal rayon (municipal assembly) consists of five to seven 
municipal councillors elected according to territorial election 
okrugs for a period of two years on the basis of general equal 
and direct elections in secret voting. 
  The procedure of elections to the municipal assembly and the 
number of municipal councillors are established by the Moscow 
City Duma on the recommendation of the mayor of Moscow. 
  14. The municipal assembly is convened by the head of the 
municipality, who heads the municipal assembly, no less than 
once a quarter to consider drafts of decisions proposed to him 
on the following questions: 
  --approval of estimates of incomes and expenditures and a 
report on their execution; 
  --approval of the annual program (plan) of socioeconomic 
development and building of the territory and a review of the 
report on its execution; 
  --approval of the procedure for managing municipal property; 
  --examination of other questions relating to the conduct of 
the municipal assembly. 
  15. The municipal assembly can be convened at the initiative 
of the Moscow City Duma, the mayor of Moscow, or by no less that 
two-thirds of the municipal councillors, but not more than twice 
a year. 
  16. The municipal assembly has the right to exercise control 
functions, including control over the activity of the head of 
the municipality and over the procedure for using tracts of land 
and municipal property. 
  17. The municipal assembly is competent to make decisions if 
more than half of the municipal councillors are present at its 
meeting. Decisions are adopted by a majority of the municipal 
councillors attending the meeting and are signed by the head of 
the municipality, except decisions about appealing to the mayor 
of Moscow on the question of dismissing the head of the 
municipality from his position. 
  18. Decisions of the municipal assembly that are adopted 
within the scope of its jurisdiction are obligatory for 
implementation by all enterprises, institutions, organizations, 
organs of public territorial self-government, and citizens 
located on the pertinent territory. 
  In the event that a decision of the municipal assembly 
contradicts legislation of the Russian Federation and normative 
acts of the city of Moscow, or affects the interests of the city 
as a whole, it can be suspended by the mayor of Moscow or 
official authorized by him. 
  19. The municipal assembly can be dissolved by the Moscow 
City Duma in cases established by legislation of the Russian 
Federation, and also as a result of the conduct of a local 
referendum on confidence in the assembly. The municipal assembly 
can adopt a decision on early dissolution. 
  The elections of municipal councillors must be held not 
later 
than three months from the date of the corresponding adoption by 
the Moscow City Duma of a decision on the dissolution of the 
municipal assembly, the announcement of the results of a 
referendum, or the adoption of a decision on self-dissolution. 
  V. Territorial Public Self-Government. 
  20. The population of microrayons (settlements), and also of 
streets, blocks, and homes, can establish organs of territorial 
public self-government acting in accordance with legislation of 
the Russian Federation and the normative acts of the city of 
Moscow. 
  21. The procedure for the formation of public 
self-government

the mayor of Moscow. 
  VI. Transitional Statutes 
  22. The periods and stages of the conduct of reform of the 
local self-government in the city of Moscow are established by 
the Moscow City Duma on a representation of the mayor of Moscow. 
  23. Before the adoption of the statute of the city of 
Moscow, 
peculiarities in the management of municipal property, including 
the procedure for submitting it to the management of the 
municipal rayons and associations in the interests of the 
residents of the entire city and its individual parts, are 
established by the Moscow City Duma on the recommendation of the 
mayor of Moscow. 
  24. Before the adoption of the statute of the city of 
Moscow, 
the procedure for the formation of estimates of incomes and 
expenditures of the municipal rayons is established by the 
Moscow City Duma on the recommendation of the mayor of Moscow. 
Before the creation of the necessary conditions for the 
formation and execution of local budgets, the formation and 
execution of a unified city budget, with an allocation of 
financial resources for the municipal rayons, is allowed.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Kalmykov: "The Government Is Looking for </F>
Money; but the Metro Has Already Found It in the Pockets of the 
Passengers"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  The Mayoralty </H5>
  It finally became clear yesterday that the city budget 
deficit for next year will be a minimum of 1.5 trillion rubles 
[R]. Prim Minister Yuriy Luzhkov insisted upon this figure 
despite the fact that it will require a substantial reduction in 
the expenditures of the government of Moscow next year--the 
draft of the budget, which takes into account the needs of the 
city in a maximum way, has a deficit of more than R7 trillion. 
  At a regular meeting, the Moscow government in the course of 
three and a half hours tried to find ways to cut the deficit. 
For this, priority expenditure articles that constituted the 
so-called protected group of expenditures and articles that were 
subject to reduction were determined. The government assigned 
social programs, the housing construction program, energy 
support for the city, the collection and processing of garbage, 
and also the reconstruction of the center of the capital to the 
"protected" group. 
  A reduction of the expenditures part, even by a total of 100 
percent, will not bring the desired results, inasmuch as just 
the "protected" programs require more than R16 trillion, but the 
expected incomes of the city treasury are limited to R14 
trillion. Therefore, the department of finance put forth several 
proposals to increase budget revenues. In particular, it was 
proposed to transfer housing construction projects to investors, 
and not to finance them directly. Moreover, the Moscow 
government intends to "extract" R2.5 trillion from the federal 
pocket in the form of subventions, "regardless of whether they 
are there or not." 
  Speaking at the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Boris 
Nikolskiy reported that in view of the reduction in outlays for 
the renewal of the rolling stock of the city's transport, there 
will be a significant increase in fares next year. Starting on 1 
January, a Metro trip will cost Muscovites and guests of the 
capital R50, and an even more substantial increase in fares on 
city transport is expected by the end of the year--up to R160, 
and on the Metro--up to R200.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Trofimov, doctor of legal sciences, </F>
under rubric "Position": "The Foreign-Policy Legacy of the 
Russian VS [Supreme Soviet]: The Deputies of the Federal 
Assembly Will Have To Study It for a Long Time"] 
  [Text] The election is over and now the new deputies have 
to decide in which committee of the Federation Council of the 
State Duma they intend to work. The overall direction of the 
deputies' wishes can probably be predicted. In the previous 
parliament several hundred people's choices wanted to link their 
fate with the Foreign Affairs Committee. True, fate smiled on 
only 20 of them. We will probably observe a similar situation 
now. 
  The future experts on foreign affairs will be met, however, 
by an unpleasant surprise: they will receive from the former 
Foreign Affairs Committee of the RF Supreme Soviet an 
inheritance that can considerably damage their political 
reputation. We are talking, in particular, about certain 
treaties that were submitted to the Supreme Soviet for 
ratification, but that have not yet passed through it. In all 
instances the reason for the postponements was approximately the 
same: doubts had arisen as to whether those treaties conform 
fully to the country's national interests. Therefore it would 
probably be beneficial to acquaint the broad public with a 
certain part of that inheritance. 
  For example, the Supreme Soviet did not have time to ratify 
the bilateral agreement with Ukraine about the reciprocal 
recognition of property rights, or a similar multilateral 
agreement with other CIS countries. The originator of both 
documents was RS Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee on the 
Administration of State Property]. The agreements stipulate that 
each of the states recognizes certain economic objects and rest 
homes on their territory as belonging to another state. Also, 
one of the chief criteria is that those objects were created 
prior to the collapse of the USSR at the expense of the republic 
budget of the appropriate independent state. Everything would 
seem to be all right -- Ukraine, Russia, and the other countries 
get back their sanitoriums and Young Pioneer camps and, at the 
same time, on a just basis exchange certain second-rate plants 
and factories. Especially since, at first glance, there are a 
lot of our sanitoriums in Crimea, and only a few Ukrainian ones 
on our territory. Definite doubts, however, have arisen in the 
experts' minds. The agreements were not accompanied by even a 
tentative list of what we will receive and what we will give 
back. Despite two requests from the Foreign Affairs Committee, 
that list has not yet been submitted. But the experts have noted 
the following situation. It is clear that Ukraine constructed a 
rather large number of objects outside the confines of its 
borders from its own budget. But Russia scarcely did so. Here, 
as a rule, everything was financed from the union budget. Thus 
it is completely possible that Russia will exchange one Young 
Pioneer camp for ten plants. Moreover, the agreements empowered 
specifically the Goskomimushchestvo officials to decide on an 
individual and final basis whose rights and whose property to 
recognize. The agreements were also not ideal with respect to 
resolving questions of military property, and also touch 
indirectly on certain potential territorial claims. 
  Despite all these doubts on the part of the deputies and 
experts, one of the Supreme Soviet committees submitted the 
multilateral agreement for ratification. Naturally, a discussion 
arose in the auditorium. The opposing sides began to appeal to 
Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
To give him his due, he displayed firm adherence to principles 
and, essentially sharpening his relations with the structures of 
executive power, recommended postponing the ratification and 
clearing up all the vague areas. The consideration of the 
question was rescheduled, but Goskomimushchestvo did not provide 
any explanations. 
  The Supreme Soviet also did not have sufficient time to 
ratify the agreement among the CIS countries concerning through 
shipments of humanitarian aid. The text of that agreement also 
appeared at first glance to be rather good. According to the 
agreement, if a shipment of humanitarian aid is being made 
across the country's territory, it should be given the "green 
light" at customs and on transportation. It would seem that it 
is impossible to act in a more humane manner. But definite 
doubts did arise in the deputies' minds. 
  It turned out that the sender himself decided whether or not 
the shipment was a humanitarian one. Objective criteria -- for 
example, quantitative ones -- were absent. In this instance, 
wouldn't the sender be tempted to declare all his through 
shipments to be humanitarian aid, attempting individually to 
come to an understanding with customs and transportation 
workers? Once again the official's arbitrariness? 
  A rather confused situation developed with the Agreement on 
the Creation of an International Scientific-Technical Center. 
According to that document, a number of leading countries in the 
West allocate $70 million to construct that center in Russia. 
The center transfers those funds to our nuclear experts to 
develop the most interesting projects for peaceful purposes. The 
agreement evoked very sharp discussions in the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, and parliamentary hearings were held concerning it, 
but the matter never got to the point of ratification. There 
were a rather large number of objections. Here are a few of 
them. According to the agreement the Center is an international 
organization with the participation both of Russian specialists 
and of representatives of the Western countries. But the 
"Westerners" have the veto right -- no money will be expended 
without their consent. That means that the Center chooses 
certain of our individual nuclear specialists with their project 
and makes the proviso that either the funds are allocated only 
to them, or to no one. Taking into consideration our 
impoverished situation, there can scarcely be any doubt as to 
whether it will be possible to refuse for a long period of time. 
But in this instance there arises the following danger. It is 
clear that, in a large collective, the role of its various 
scientists differs very much. There are always clear heads, and 
frequently they are not among the managerial staff, and those 
clear heads generate an ideology of investigating. All you have 
to do is to "pull them out" and a collective of many thousand 
people will not be able to create anything beneficial for a long 
time thereafter. The veto right has obviously created this 
danger. 
  There were also objections concerning the fact that Russia 
has freed both the Center itself and the representatives of the 
Western countries from any responsibility for any undesirable 
consequences from their activities on our territory (for which, 
indeed, ratification was required). Meanwhile it is generally 
known that the compensations for the damages incurred by an 
individual in the West reach millions of dollars. So there is 
immediate discussion about nuclear technologies and about 
Chelyabinsk-70 and Arzamas-16. Consequently, there is no desire 
in the West to pay in any real manner, even in the presence of 
blame, for our people who have perished or been maimed. This is 
all very similar to the attitudes toward natives. So, for the 
time being, these agreements remain unratified. It is curious to 
note that a number of diplomats in Western countries have 
organized simply a pilgrimage to the Foreign Affairs Committee, 
proposing the discussion of what are by no means general 
problems of Russian foreign policy or, for example, arms 
reduction or regional security, but only the question of 
ratifying specifically this agreement. 
  Of course, the problem of ratifying the START-II [in 
Russian, 
SNV-2] Treaty continues to remain open. Here too there are 
several curious but little-known details. For example, unlike 
us, the leading Western countries take a somewhat different 
approach to the problem of international security. There little 
is said about collective security, but, instead, wide use is 
made of various modifications of force models of maintaining 
international security, which assume as the basic goal the 
guaranteeing of an order resting upon a balance of forces (which 
should not be confused with parity or equality of forces), upon 
the division of spheres of influence, and upon the concept of 
local wars as a method of eliminating that balance. Proceeding 
from that concept, they figure out various alternatives for 
behavior. If the regional balance has been violated or an armed 
conflict has arisen, then it is stopped specifically by means of 
the restoration of the balance. A clear example of this is the 
conflict in former Yugoslavia, where the Serbs obviously are 
enjoying the military advantage. If it proves possible to shift 
the global balance of forces to their advantage, then the 
attempt will be made to implement it, by demanding economic or 
political concessions. And it is important here that, in order 
to make a decision, it is first necessary to compute the entire 
chain of the possible escalation of the conflict. If the 
computations indicate that it will be possible to achieve 
victory at the key stages, then the politicians begin boldly to 
demand concessions. If the other side proves to be slow-witted 
or uncompromising, then the West, in response, frequently 
proceeds along the chain, building up the conflict. They begin 
dropping bombs on Tripoli or Baghdad, and the people there, 
seeing that they are losing, quickly yield. 
  It is possible to argue about the details of this scheme, 
but 
on the whole this is exactly what kind of scheme it is. However, 
if this is so, and the quantity and quality of weapons is 
necessary not only to be victorious in war, but also in politics 
and in economics, then there arises the question of how the 
START-II Treaty fits into this scheme. Because it is clear that, 
in the formation of the balance of forces a participating factor 
is not only nuclear weapons, but also super-accurate weapons, 
the latest stealth materials, and the quality of troop 
management. It is no secret that the United States and NATO as a 
whole are strong specifically with regard to these components. 
And all of them remain outside the confines of the START-II 
Treaty. Moreover, according to the Treaty, the United States 
retains its main striking force -- the navy -- while we reduce 
our most combat-ready means -- surface missiles. So do we 
ourselves, by violating the balance of military forces, want to 
provoke the West to an economic, political, or territorial 
repartition? 
  Experts have also expressed the following fear. As is 
generally known, the SDI [in Russian, SOI] program proved to be 
insolvent and incapable of guaranteeing the security of the 
United States in the event of the launching of thousands of 
missiles by an enemy. However, if the START-II Treaty is 
implemented, computations on EVM [electronic computers] indicate 
that, with the aid of super-accurate weapons and the use of 
other similar equipment, it will be possible to prevent the 
launching of only approximately 200 Russian missiles. But it is 
already possible to intercept that number with the aid of SDI. 
Is it necessary for us in this instance, by our own hands, to 
resurrect that program? 
  In general, questions with respect to that Treaty have 
arisen. It is natural that the Foreign Affairs Committee in this 
situation requested the MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] and 
Minoborony [Ministry of Defense] to send the committee the 
American and NATO concepts of the balance of forces, the 
maintenance of international order, and the making of 
foreign-policy decisions, so that, within their context, it 
could decide the fate of the Treaty. In half a year no replies 
at all have been received. But unofficially it was said: "You 
have the text of the Treaty, so go study it." 
  Of course, most of the necessary American documents and 
conceptual studies were on the bookshelf at the Foreign Affairs 
Committee. It was, however, necessary to receive an official 
answer in order later to ask subsequent questions. It can be 
assumed, however, that no reply was given to the Committee not 
so much because there was a strong desire to protect the Treaty, 
as because there was no complete understanding of exactly what 
those rather poor deputies wanted from them. In any case, one is 
led to this conclusion by the military doctrine that was 
recently adopted by the Russian Security Council. There nothing 
was stated seriously about the need to use force models, 
although it is clear that, as a result of that mention, there 
would be a rather considerable increase in the political role of 
armed forces. 
  It is also necessary to talk about the unratified open skies 
treaty. The essence of that treaty is: in exchange for good 
money, the Western countries have the right, approximately once 
every ten days, to fly across Russia along any flight path, 
carrying out aerial photo reconnaissance. Correspondingly we, in 
exchange for payment, have the same right with respect to those 
countries. It is understood that these aerial surveys are a 
means of carrying out a very detailed monitoring of the 
situation in the country. But is it necessary for us to monitor 
the territory of the United States in this way? Possibly the 
specialists are making a mistake, but, in the opinion of several 
of them, it is scarcely possible by this method to prevent an 
attack launched by a considerably stronger opponent. 
  One would also scarcely think that it will be possible to 
obtain any substantial economically beneficial information 
since, in an industrial country, all the basic secrets are 
located most probably in the laboratories and computers. But 
with respect to Russia one can speak only about the economic 
value of various territories, natural resources, trends in 
foreign investments, expected harvests, plantings of narcotics, 
and local conflicts. In general, to put it mildly, one can 
notice a definite asymmetry of interests. 
  Of course, Russia has not been hiding anything for a long 
time, so one could think a bit about at least earning money on 
these flights. There is, however, no guarantee that our military 
men will not demand the earned money to pay for the same kind of 
flights over the United States, which are, essentially speaking, 
completely useless. And they may even ask for more money. 
  The Convention on the Destruction of Chemical Weapons is 
also 
on the approach to consideration in the VS [Supreme Soviet]. As 
is generally known, American chemical ammunition is most 
frequently thin-walled, and our, conversely, is thick-walled, 
which our military men always considered to be a shortcoming. 
But with the Americans the service life date is shorter because 
of the thin walls. Ours, on the other hand, can be stockpiled 
for many additional years, and can be gradually destroyed or 
reprocessed for advantageous use by ourselves. The Americans, 
however, did not forget the concepts of the balance of forces, 
and quickly organized the signing of that convention. Naturally, 
Russian diplomats did not fail to place their signatures 
wherever necessary, without having, true, unlike our 
transatlantic colleagues, either the funds to destroy the 
chemical weapons or a corresponding state program. 
  An agreement with Kuwait about military cooperation will 
also 
be brought to the State Duma. A draft of that agreement arrived 
at the Foreign Affairs Committee in late August. In accordance 
with that draft, Russia will sell to Kuwait a large consignment 
of weapons. In exchange Russia will pledge to render military 
aid to Kuwait in the event of aggression. Yevgeniy Ambartsumov 
was completely justified in proposing to the originators that 
they give an explanation. As a result, certain measures were 
planned, and, it would seem, the principle of satiated wolves 
and intact sheep was observed. But an oral understanding is one 
thing, and the text of a treaty is another. Currently one can 
only guess about how this question will be resolved. It should 
be noted that, according to the new Constitution, authorization 
for the use of troops abroad will be given only by the 
Federation Council, half of which consists of persons belonging 
to the executive branch of power. So there is something to think 
about here. 
  It is also worthwhile to discuss the draft of the law 
governing the procedure for the conclusion and denouncement of 
international treaties. This draft, which on the whole is a 
beneficial and necessary document, made its way in the Supreme 
Soviet to the second reading. But it did not manage to get 
through it. What remained a fundamental problem that was not 
completely resolved in it were the attempts made by the deputies 
to insert the right of the Supreme Soviet to the independent 
denouncement of any international treaties that are in effect 
for Russia. Objections to this, and not without certain grounds, 
were expressed by representatives of Boris Yeltsin and Andrey 
Kozyrev. They pointed out that this practice exists only in a 
few countries, in particular the KNDR [Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea], and that the Russian parliament can, in the 
heat of the moment and indiscriminately, denounce treaties with 
which, in conformity with international law, such action cannot 
be taken. They also pointed out that foreign partners, in the 
face of a threat of sudden denouncement, will trust Russia less. 
It was also mentioned that such steps taken by the parliament 
place it in opposition to the president. 
  There were also arguments from the other side: it was 
mentioned that, from the purely formal point of view, there is 
nothing illegal in parliament's having this right. For another 
state it is of no concern which agency in Russia signs or 
denounces treaties, so long as it acts on behalf of the entire 
country. 
  What is more substantial, however, is not the formal 
possibility, but the actual requirement that the parliament has 
in its pocket this right to independent denouncement. The fact 
of the matter is that, in our country, it has become a good 
tradition when one of the branches of authority, proceeding from 
certain interests, does not want to observe any reasonable rules 
of the game. In practical life, in the area of international 
relations this leads to corresponding manifestations. For 
example, in the summer of 1992 Russia concluded with the United 
States an agreement concerning the safe shipment and destruction 
of weapons of mass destruction. At the 7th Congress the deputies 
caused a ruckus on this question and, it must be said, not 
completely without justification. The Foreign Affairs Committee, 
during the winter of 1992-1993, collected the findings of many 
experts, organizations, and even ministries, which practically 
unanimously mentioned the infringement on Russia's national 
interests. Of course, the agreement freed the Americans of any 
responsibility for any actions on our territory; granted to all 
of them, down to the vehicle drivers and enlisted men, an almost 
diplomatic status; factually speaking, allowed them to ship 
whatever they wanted out of the country; etc. In general, it is 
a treaty between a white colonizer and a black aborigine. It is 
clear that, even on the basis of purely formal features, that 
agreement should have been submitted for ratification. However, 
that agreement is in effect to this day, and none of its 
originators, despite all the force of the ruckus that was 
raised, even thought about stopping its action. In this kind of 
situation, what is parliament supposed to do? 
  Another good example is the agreement with the United States 
concerning annexation to the requirements governing the 
nonproliferation of missile technologies. Incidentally, it 
should be noted that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for a 
rather long period of time, opposed the concluding of this 
agreement and yielded only under the large amount of pressure 
exerted by both sides. Parliamentary hearings on this problem 
indicated, to put it very mildly, the existence of the following 
threats to our interests. The destruction of advantageous 
contracts with India (cryogenic engines), Brazil, and other 
countries. The doubtfulness of obtaining any income from 
possible commercial launches (we have been banned from 
attracting any customers by low prices). Becoming dependent on 
the United States as a result of fulfilling a production order 
for the Freedom station. The destruction, because of the loss of 
production orders, of an entire branch of rocket construction. 
This would make unemployed not the drunkards, but several tens 
of thousands of skilled workers. Naturally, in this situation 
the Supreme Soviet enacted a decree concerning the need to 
submit this agreement for ratification. The agreement, however, 
went into effect on 1 November without any ratification and, of 
course, no one is planning now to question the opinion of 
parliament in this regard. 
  In 1990 the USSR and the United States signed an agreement 
concerning the demarcation of sea spaces in the Bering Sea. In 
accordance with the opinion of experts and on the basis of the 
results of hearings that had already been held in the USSR 
Supreme Soviet, we gave the Americans, as a result of that 
agreement, no less than 30,000 square kilometers. It would still 
be possible to return to the initial situation, since the 
agreement has not yet been ratified. Nevertheless, by the will 
of the responsible statesmen, the agreement has been "applied 
provisionally" for more than three years. The Foreign Affairs 
Committee has repeatedly proposed to the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs that it submit this agreement for ratification, but it 
has invariably received a polite refusal. It would seem that we 
are waiting while the United States becomes permanently 
established in the disputed sector and invests considerable 
amounts of money in it, and then the United States will demand 
unbelievable compensation from us. In the minds of the 
originators of the agreement, our parliament should not have any 
formal right to raise this question independently if the 
executive authority does not ask it to take such action. 
  One could give additional examples. The documents that 
parliament has never seen include, for example, agreements 
concerning the property owned by our troops in Germany. In 
accordance with the first of them, we were given several billion 
dollars. But soon another one was concluded, in accordance with 
which we ourselves, for some reason, rejected dollars and agreed 
to the zero version. 
  It is clear that the recommendations, appeals to the courts, 
etc., cannot help. The only thing that will help is the threat 
that the Federal Assembly will interact not with the other 
branches of authority, but directly with the foreign partner, 
that is, will be able to force us to take its own will into 
consideration. As soon as it becomes clear to other states that 
the signature at the bottom of a treaty was extorted from us and 
this is not yet everything, such attempts will end. 
  In practice, parliament will hardly enjoy the right of 
independent denouncement. We are speaking most probably about a 
threat, by referring to which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
will be able to prevent various feeble impulses. Essentially 
speaking, in recent time it was precisely this kind of silent 
understanding that existed between the Supreme Soviet and the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From time to time the former raised 
a commotion concerning individual questions, and the latter 
threatened a brawl, and as a result it prevented actions that 
were not completely thought out. 
  It should also be mentioned that the committee has not gone 
halfway to meet the dynamic attempts of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs to guarantee the enactment of legislative acts involving 
the use of our troops abroad in peacekeeping operations. There 
was basically one reason. The fact of the matter is that the 
rendering of military assistance is a very expensive service, in 
exchange for which it is possible to demand a lot. And it is 
that "in exchange for" that has not yet observed in our 
foreign-policy actions, and most of the deputies do not want to 
destroy our troops aimlessly. There has also been opposition to 
peacekeeping missions, and also, it would seem, for the reason 
that peacekeeping that stands above the conflict and outside of 
Russian national interests is a harmful myth that is calculated 
to appeal only to the man in the street. 
  Apparently the deputies of the future Foreign Affairs 
Committee will also encounter attempts by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs to guarantee the taking of secret actions by the 
Administration for the Providing of Services to the Diplomatic 
Corps, which possesses automobile-service facilities, hunting 
land, bases, and thousands of apartments. In any case the former 
committee agonized about this question for an entire year, but 
did not receive even a single positive response from the 
interested organizations. 
  It is possible with a large share of confidence to assume 
that, from the very first work days of the State Duma's Foreign 
Affairs Committee it will feel a considerable amount of pressure 
to guarantee the rapid ratification of many of the treaties that 
were mentioned. For the time being, the deputies have not had 
sufficient time to come to their senses or acquire experience. 
Because they have to learn a very great deal in order to oppose 
such attempts effectively.

<F P=106> [Article by Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of the Republic </F>
of Kazakhstan: "The Ideological Consolidation of Society as a 
Condition of Kazakhstan's Progress"] 
  [Text] "...The achievement of real independence 
requires political, intellectual, and spiritual support. It is 
essential that we secure not only an economic, organizational, 
and personnel breakthrough in these directions but also create 
an atmosphere consolidating society. And we have to have here an 
ideological conceptualization of our activity geared both to the 
immediate and the more distant future." 
  The work "Strategy of the Formation and Development of 
Kazakhstan as a Sovereign State" appeared in May of last year. 
It set forth my vision of the fundamental directions and content 
of the reform and pursued the goal of providing society with a 
sense of the future. Time has shown that the main priorities and 
their forecast characteristics as a whole were determined 
correctly. Many provisions of the strategy have been embodied in 
the new constitution, the National Program of Stabilization of 
the Economy and Extension of the Socioeconomic Reforms, and in a 
number of government programs. 
  An understanding that global transformations connected with 
a 
change, virtually, in a state's social and economic formation 
are always accompanied by complex processes of changes in 
people's consciousness forced me to commence in parallel the 
conceptualization and elaboration of these problems pertinent 
for the activity of any social organism. We have to negotiate a 
transitional period which is quite substantial both in terms of 
scale of work and in terms of time. It is extraordinarily 
important in this connection to create in society a spiritual 
atmosphere which is adequate to the changes and which may be 
sustained only by a balanced policy of the state in all spheres, 
so specific a sphere as ideology included. 
  Arguments over whether ideology is needed or not are largely 
unproductive. To put it no more strongly: After this term had 
been introduced in practice, last century, it became an object 
of such manipulation that in time it partially lost its original 
meaning. The same thing is also happening in our society, which 
lived for decades under the harsh conditions of a totalitarian 
system. It is not surprising that since its collapse the 
"ideology" concept has acquired a negative connotation and has 
recently been employed in political vocabulary with a large 
degree of skepticism. But does ideology as such, that is, the 
set of views and ideas which are formulated in any state, a 
developing state particularly, for the purpose of the exercise 
of foreign and domestic policy, the development of science, 
culture, and education, and the assertion of new moral values, 
merit such an attitude? 
  Evidently not, inasmuch as without such a system, which may 
be defined as ideological, a society of the modern type simply 
cannot exist. The leading states of the world have always 
aspired to the creation not only of a political and economic but 
also an ideological image attractive both to its own citizens 
and to other countries also. If the state allows a vacuum to 
occur in this sphere, it is frequently filled by philosophical 
precepts of a different kind. 
  Ideology is essentially a method, which has stood the test 
of 
time, of the consolidation and mobilization of a community of 
people for the accomplishment of political and economic tasks, a 
mechanism of the shaping of social behavior. But this is not a 
compulsory method but civilized influence on people's minds 
exerted by the state and the parties and public movements 
sharing its platform. The existence of other views and outlooks 
is by no means precluded here. As long as there is life, as long 
as there are society and the state, there will always be 
different ideological currents. 
<H5>  The Current Social and Political Situation in Kazakhstan </H5>
  Kazakhstan has finally and irreversibly renounced an unequal 
life in the shadow of a former empire and has embarked on the 
building of a strong sovereign state with a socially oriented 
market economy and fundamentally new social relationships. The 
political system and state arrangement are changing 
fundamentally, and the republic has emphasized its commitment to 
a democratic course and international rules and principles. 
The highest value of the society we are building is man, 
in whose name and for whose good the transformations have been 
initiated. Guarantees of people's rights and liberties have been 
secured in legislation, and the ideas of consolidation, 
humanism, internation accord, and the equality of all nations 
and nationalities have been laid down. 
  All this, strictly speaking, is a firm foundation for the 
consistent implementation of the reforms. But it would be an 
illusion to believe that changes in the social consciousness 
occur automatically with a change in political and economic 
systems. This is a far more serious and complex phenomenon 
inasmuch as it is connected with deep-lying processes of social 
life and changes in world-outlook principles and psychological 
stereotypes and the very tenor of the life of society and each 
person individually. We have all today come in for a dual load, 
as it were: It is as though both the economy and society find 
themselves between past and present. Even while having fully 
recognized that there is no road back, we must acknowledge that 
the system of management, science, culture, education, and 
spiritual life invisibly bear the imprint of the past. 
  The same is happening in the social consciousness also. Such 
a concept as "anomie"--the state of man's confusion under 
sharply changed conditions, when the established value system is 
reinterpreted and there is a radical change in life's 
values--became firmly established in scholarship back last 
century. This is a difficult test not only for the individual 
citizen but for the whole of society also. And despite the fact 
that an absolute majority of Kazakhstanis support the reform 
policy, we must recognize that many people, while having 
apprehended the need for changes with their heart, so to speak, 
have yet to grasp their essence intellectually and are 
experiencing uncertainty, lacking an entirely clear idea of 
their future. 
  The state of a certain spiritual discomfort is being 
intensified by the economic crisis, which for the ordinary 
individual has been expressed primarily in the unchecked growth 
of prices, a fall in the living standard, and the unresolved 
nature of many social problems. Extremes of the political 
struggle frequently disorient people also. The most unexpected 
political speculation sometimes finds for itself a niche in the 
social consciousness. 
  In order to understand the situation shaping up in the 
political sphere of Kazakhstan today it is necessary to closely 
analyze the substance of the ideas that are being actively 
discussed in the press, in the party polemics, in economic 
circles, and, yes, in broad strata of society, perhaps. 
  Granted the entire complex picture of political views, and 
there is a great collection of them, it would seem necessary to 
examine the socialist and liberal views, as two poles of the 
current social and political diversity. Of course, this is 
somewhat of a simplification, but one that makes it possible to 
see the picture as a whole. 
  The socialist platform has certain supporters in 
society, although it is unlikely that it could be taken as a 
basis in reform. The period of wholesale criticism of the 
socialist idea has passed. The time has come for a serious 
analysis of what was done for the people by socialism in its 
Soviet version and of what simply cannot be accepted. 
  The creation in Kazakhstan in the years of Soviet power of a 
powerful industry and agriculture and unique production 
engineering complexes, universal literacy, urbanization, and 
much else would have been impossible without Kazakhstan's 
industrialization. Our present potential is to some extent the 
result of the former system. Only in polemical over-excitement 
could this be denied. 
  Orthodox supporters of the socialist idea are speaking with 
nostalgia about the past and insisting on its return and the 
institution of proceedings against politicians for their 
"crime," virtually. The illogicality of framing the issue this 
way is astonishing: While always urging a consideration of the 
objective regularities in history, the opposition is today 
putting the emphasis on personalities and incidental or 
temporary factors. Of course, individual leaders of that time 
did perform some role in accelerating the disintegration of the 
state. But if we keep to an objective, not emotional, viewpoint, 
it is obvious that socialism was in the most profound crisis as 
a system of socioeconomic and political relations. It may today 
be said affirmatively that it is a question of a crisis of 
extensive proportions. 
  Economic crisis. A key criterion of the efficiency 
of social systems is economic efficiency. By this criterion the 
centralized planned economy had ultimately conclusively lost out 
to the market economy. 
  Political crisis. The contradiction between the 
stated power of the people and the concentration of power in the 
hands of a very narrow elite of the intraparty bureaucracy had 
reached its logical conclusion. Formally political structures 
created the semblance of democracy, but in reality all decisions 
at the local and central levels were made only by the party 
leaders. 
  National crisis. Despite the proclaimed 
internationalism, the socialist system most brutally suppressed 
the free development of the nations for decades. Specifically, 
in Kazakhstan more than half the Kazakh people perished or 
emigrated, according to experts' estimates, in the years of 
forcible collectivization. All peoples of the country sustained 
colossal losses. National crisis is largely the creation of 
economic crisis. The relations of the center and the regions 
were of a semicolonial nature. The raw material focus of the 
republic's economy and its noncomprehensive nature were 
deliberately predetermined. To the same extent Kazakhstan was 
tightly tied to the center and other regions in a transport 
system whose purpose was to make an independent outlet onto the 
foreign market impossible. Only the threat of violence held back 
the hidden internation tension. When the system fell apart, the 
territory of the former USSR flared up in internation conflicts 
and wars. This is not the fault of people but the fault of past 
and present politicians. Violence--from the direct physical 
extermination of whole peoples through the constriction of the 
sphere of application of national languages--had driven the 
contradictions deep down. There were no other methods for their 
resolution. Despite all the statements about internationalism, 
behind the facade of official ideology steady negative 
stereotypes took shape in some peoples in respect to others, 
which at the everyday level are alive today also. The attempt to 
standardize all nations in a single super-ethnic community--the 
Soviet people--had manifestly failed. 
  Further, ecological crisis. The particular 
features of the socialist economic system with its 
abstract-nationwide, but in practice, departmental, ownership 
led to colossal ecological malfeasance on the part of the 
ministries and departments. The essence of the problem is that 
while disposing unchecked of the land and natural resources, the 
departments at the same time were not interested in 
environmentally clean industries and bore no real responsibility 
for the inevitable tragedies. This "no one's property" 
phenomenon brought about global catastrophes without precedent 
in previous history. The lack of ecological standards resulted 
in the confrontation of society and nature. Kazakhstan found 
itself in an extremely serious situation in this respect. 
  One of the biggest disasters was brought the Kazakh people 
by 
the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site. Conducting nuclear weapons 
testing, underground included, in Kazakhstan, the system 
perpetrated one of the most monstrous crimes in the history of 
mankind against the citizens of its own state. Over half a 
million persons have suffered from radiation in our republic 
alone. Many of them have already departed this life at the 
height of their powers, hundreds of thousands have been deprived 
of their health forever. Several generations of children have 
been condemned from birth to live as invalids. And the tragedy 
continues in many families, which are giving birth to cripples. 
  Another catastrophe which came to Kazakhstan is the Aral 
Sea, 
which is disappearing from the face of the earth. This calamity 
has subjected the peoples of the vast Central Asia region to 
untold suffering. And not only them: Scientists have drawn a 
substantiated conclusion concerning the global destructive 
influence of the Aral cataclysm on vast territories of the 
planet. 
  But those who have suffered most from these experiments 
presented by the former regime as struggle for the "bright 
future" are primarily the people of Kazakhstan. 
  We have still to tally the entire damage inflicted on 
people, 
the land, and nature as a whole. If only to estimate the true 
dimensions of the catastrophes and to determine measures to 
eliminate their consequences. And the world also should have a 
clear idea of the actual ecological situation in Kazakhstan. 
  Moral crisis. There was a discrepancy between the 
ideological symbols and people's real values. The dual morals of 
the governing elite could not have failed to have brought about 
the similar morals of millions of people formally participating 
in various political activities--meetings, demonstrations, 
marches, and so forth--yet absolutely disbelieving of the 
proclaimed slogans. When, today, there is bewilderment as to why 
the system fell apart so easily, it is simply forgotten that it 
had long since lost the confidence of the people, who saw and 
understood our growing lag behind the West and the Soviet 
economy's accelerating slide into crisis. Socialist ideals in 
recent years evoked nothing more than irony. All this was known, 
but ideology obdurately continued to serve the ambitions of the 
ruling elite and to pass off its interests as all-state 
interests. Let us recall the myths of Soviet homespun ideology 
divorced from reality--the theory of the merger of the nations, 
the practice of the relationship of state and individual, when 
the latter was assigned the role of "cog," and the implanted 
party-mindedness of science, literature, and art. Even such 
natural feelings as love for the motherland, concern for the 
future, fidelity to the traditions of one's ancestors--all this 
was fitted into the Procrustean bed of the "moral codes of the 
builders of communism." This was not an ideology but a kind of 
speculation on people's moral principles. 
  But it should be considered that for many people, 
forswearing 
old illusions is a very painful process. Mocking their 
convictions is impossible. Engaging in a competent and honest 
polemic is another matter. It is essential to explain as lucidly 
as possible that under modern conditions equality via state 
redistribution, state paternalism, ideological uniformity, and 
the suppression of private property and the market would repel 
Kazakhstan from the world community. A return to the past is 
futile and could merely detonate society and lead to civil war. 
It is no less important to recognize that the ubiquitously 
asserted myths of socialism--of the kind we experienced--have 
collapsed not only in the CIS but throughout the world. 
  Despite a number of achievements of this system, useful and 
realized in practice, we cannot finish up at a historical dead 
end yet again. 
  Another direction of social thought puts the emphasis on 
traditions and national character. The ideology of 
traditionalism is logically connected with the crisis of 
socialist ideology. Truly, to what can we turn if the previous 
tenets have proven bankrupt? To, most likely, that which is most 
simple, comprehensible and at the same time profoundly moral and 
spiritual in the life of each people--traditions. Their role in 
the life of the people is indisputable. Cultural traditions have 
always been a source of social revival. A return to one's 
historical cultural roots is, of course, a positive process. In 
addition, it is necessary to abandon the simplistic 
interpretation of the relationship of traditions and social 
progress. The experience of the modern world shows convincingly 
that certain traditional structures are very organically 
interwoven in the fabric of the present civilization. Without 
experience, innovation is impossible also. It is traditions that 
enable a person to "keep his bearings" and adapt his way of life 
to the impetuous changes of the modern world. 
  Development of the national language, art, culture, everyday 
culture included, and the family is entirely supported in 
Kazakhstan. But the political ideology of the traditional type, 
which is based on a resuscitation of archaic forms of social 
arrangement, tribal mentality, and a system of legal views 
characteristic of the territorial organization of Kazakh society 
of the 18th-19th centuries, is categorically rejected here. 
  The immense space occupied by Kazakhs on territory from the 
Caspian to China required some structural formalization and 
particular centers of attraction. This coincided with the 
particular features of historical development of different 
regions and was accompanied subsequently by a system of 
administrative division consciously introduced by tsarism. On 
the other hand, the singularities of management of the economy 
also required a precise regulation of territorial issues. 
Regional affiliation, therefore, has primordially played an 
appreciable role in the political arrangement. But do we need to 
bring all this into the 21st century? After all, under modern 
conditions the rate of development of the social and cultural 
systems of the Kazakh people are absolutely incommensurable with 
that period. 
  Thus despite the aspiration, understandable to some extent, 
to find in our own history effective political mechanisms, we 
need to be realists and to recognize that the political ideas 
and political symbols of past ages are not suitable for the end 
of the present century. Even in the past, incidentally, our 
great educators called for the prevention of a stratification of 
Kazakh society. 
  Also popular in social circles are liberal ideas. 
At the end of the 1980's and at the start of the present decade 
the general euphoria at their triumph and the affirmation of 
ideals common to all mankind and the rights and liberties of man 
as the highest value led to the optimistic conclusion as to the 
conclusive victory of democracy and democratic principles. 
  But there has come to be a gradual understanding throughout 
the world that complex processes also are occurring against the 
background of liberal ideology. Not to touch on other regions of 
the world but to speak about our former common space, mention 
has to be made of the growing social tension in society, which 
is expressed at times in the most extreme forms--armed 
conflicts, political confrontations, economic anarchy, and 
people's unbelief in the possibility of changing anything. 
Instead of the growth of a civilized market, speculative capital 
in all spheres--finances, trade, foreign economic 
relations--walks side by side with two companions--criminal 
elements and the corrupt nomenklatura. These processes have 
nothing in common with the modern world market, but they exist 
in reality, manifestly contradicting the very essence of liberal 
ideology. Internation conflicts, on the other hand, graphically 
demonstrate that arguments about democracy and values common to 
all mankind are not as yet capable of protecting human life and 
dignity. 
  Of course, the contradiction between liberal ideology and 
harsh reality may be explained by reference to the legacy of 
totalitarianism. This would be correct, but only partly so. 
There are more profound reasons. 
  Liberal ideals and liberal ideology are the result of the 
extensive, centuries-long evolution of Western civilization. The 
basis of these is composed of objective prerequisites--private 
property, the mentality of individualism, and democratic 
political institutions. Its rudiments with us were either absent 
or were interrupted almost a century ago. In addition, a strong 
legal system facilitating the realization of liberal ideas was 
created in civilized states. Outside of these objective 
prerequisites this process is extraordinarily more difficult. 
  The fact that the main and most populous support of the 
ideology of liberalism--the middle class--as it is customarily 
called in social science, does not exist in the republic as yet 
has to be seen also. Account should be taken of the actual 
cultural and historical situation as well. The point being that 
with a mechanical transfer of Western liberal ideology to 
Kazakhstan its proponents would come up against such a 
phenomenon as culture--in the broad, including political, sense. 
Its nature and ideals cannot be changed in an instant. The type 
of political culture needs to be transformed gradually, in 
civilized fashion and on the basis of real reforms. 
  Thus an analysis of the political and ideological directions 
in present-day Kazakhstan testifies to the need for the search 
for particular paths in the formation of the ideological 
platform. We do not reject that which is valuable that has 
accumulated within it socialist and traditional and liberal 
views. But the tasks confronting Kazakhstan require, in our 
view, the conceptualization of somewhat different national 
ideological priorities. 
<H5>  Toward Real Independence </H5>
  We speak about the transitional period. What is 
its substance? To what do we aspire? There are a whole number of 
specific economic and political directions which are set forth 
in the constitution, documents of the executive and the 
legislature, and the programs of certain parties of Kazakhstan. 
But aside from the specific tasks, there is also a global 
purpose, without having achieved which we cannot successfully 
move forward along the path of the reform of society. It is a 
question of the achievement of the real independence of 
the republic. Despite its numerous attributes and the 
recognition and assertion of sovereignty, to say that Kazakhstan 
has acquired full independence would be premature. 
  We must in the next few years concentrate all efforts on 
this 
process. We have for this to resolve, generally speaking, the 
following key problems--to strengthen state principles, 
build a state based on the rule of law, and ensure the formation 
of a full-fledged national market on a new production 
engineering, structural, and institutional basis. Such a 
formulation of the issue will, most likely, meet with the 
understanding of parties and public movements, the work force, 
entrepreneurial circles, research and artistic organizations, 
and representatives of all strata of the population of the 
republic inasmuch as the said priorities are of an all-state 
nature and their realization could effect the profound 
modernization of Kazakhstani society. If we seek so necessary a 
consensus, we should also agree with such an inevitable 
condition: The achievement of real independence requires strong 
political, intellectual, and spiritual support. It is essential 
that we secure not only an economic, organizational, and 
personnel breakthrough in these directions but also create an 
atmosphere consolidating society. And we have to have here an 
ideological comprehension of our reality geared both to the 
immediate and the more distant future. 
  One of the main political aspects for us in the impending 
work is the strengthening of statehood. On the whole, 
this is a natural inference from the experience of world 
civilization: An objective need for an increase in the 
regulatory influence of the state, which is essential primarily 
to secure the emergence from the crisis and stabilization of the 
socioeconomic and social and political situation, is necessarily 
manifested in an era of profound crises and upheavals. We should 
concentrate the main efforts here on enhancing the role and 
responsibility of the executive, strengthening the vertical line 
of management, and forming strong presidential rule. Both 
parliament and society as a whole agree on the need for an 
intensification of this process, to which the quite precise 
allocation of functions of the three branches of power in the 
country's basic law testifies. 
  But the formation of the state of Kazakhstan is not confined 
merely to adoption of the constitution. Especially since it was 
stipulated from the very outset that it is a constitution of a 
transitional period which has been created. It reflects the 
realities of our present day and the complexities and 
contradictions of our society. Its provisions and requirements 
are binding on all. But it is necessary to ponder the prospects, 
looking into the future, even now. 
  The present Supreme Council is fulfilling its historical 
mission and performing a great deal of work, laying the 
foundations of the country's legislative base. The next stage of 
societal development will inevitably require us to create a 
professional parliament with clearly defined duties and powers. 
It is important also that we reach a common opinion on which of 
the world's prevalent and approved electoral systems is the 
optimum and which of them is applicable for our republic. The 
next task is the legislative separation of the powers of the 
central state and local authorities, in terms of which the 
executive and representatives authorities locally are 
sufficiently plenipotentiary in the solution of their problems. 
The central structures would then be relieved of diverse current 
business and could concentrate on the strategic directions of 
political, economic, and social development. 
  It is essential to reform the judicial system also. 
Unfortunately, people still have no faith in the authority and 
competence of the judicial authorities locally. It is as yet too 
early to speak of the objectivity of the courts and the 
constructive nature of their activity; they are divorced from 
the problems of society, as it were. It is necessary to make the 
judicial system as efficient as possible and to rid it of the 
possibility, which still exists, of pressure being exerted on 
the part of the power structures, in the localities 
particularly. A most practicable path of this reform is the 
legislative enshrinement of the appointability of judges by the 
head of state following a recommendation of a special supreme 
judicial council, say. We could this way ensure the genuine 
independence of the judges and cut short any encroachment on 
justice. 
  As we can see, the process of the formation of Kazakhstani 
statehood is a complex, laborious, and diverse task. And there 
should be no ill-considered haste or unwarranted slowness here. 
It is important to secure the mutual understanding and 
interaction of all branches of power. We would be doing future 
generations a bad turn were we to loosen the foundations of the 
state for the sake of momentary political benefits. 
  The accomplishment of radical socioeconomic 
reforms undoubtedly belongs among the main national 
priorities. This is a key question of modern Kazakhstan and its 
acquisition of independence. The fate of the reforms is directly 
linked with the mechanisms of state control of the political 
sphere inasmuch as Kazakhstan's development of recent decades 
has been characterized by very complex and large-scale 
processes. It is in this period that a number of global programs 
have been realized on the territory of the republic. These 
include the development of the virgin and fallow land, the 
creation of industry's colossal raw material base, and nuclear 
and space research. 
  But the national, social, and cultural problems introduced 
into Kazakhstan by the realization of these programs went 
unstudied and uncomprehended behind the economic and military 
aspect of these processes. A qualitative change occurred--for 
the first time the proportion of the urban population exceeded 
that of the rural population. The unevenness of the development 
of the regions increased sharply. There was a change in the 
national composition of the population on account of the huge 
immigration from the European part of the country. A sizable 
group of an urban Kazakh population, with the concentration of 
the bulk of the nation in the countryside, appeared. 
  All of this could not have failed to have led to the 
appearance of very strong differences in political and cultural 
orientations. At the same time, on the other hand, the 
ostensible ideological unity was deliberately emphasized and 
exaggerated, and the differences and problems were ignored. As a 
result the ideological and political contradictions of different 
strata of the population grew. Today they are coming to be 
manifested actively. 
  It is for this reason that the molding of a new economic 
philosophy now occupies a special place. This is connected 
primarily with its direct influence on an acceleration of the 
progress of the reforms. The ideology of a democratic, 
rule-of-law society based on a pluralism of ideas is nothing 
other than a reflection of views on the forms of ownership and 
management. We have set as the strategic goal the formation of 
genuinely market mechanisms and a socially oriented 
multistructural market economy. That is, we have opted for the 
path of the creation of a society in which economic liberty and 
the economic interests of the individual are indisputable and 
where the free expression of beliefs and spiritual values is 
guaranteed by the state and the law. 
  But owing to the tenacity of past ideological stereotypes, 
the affirmation of these norms can hardly be painless. It is no 
secret that instances of the open rejection of the reforms at 
both the power and the everyday level are far from isolated with 
us. What is to be done in this situation: opt for a hard-line 
policy, establish the direct diktat of the state, organize the 
persecution of the opposition for criticism of the government? 
There have been many examples of this in the contemporary 
history of the implementation of economic reforms, incidentally. 
  The actual social and political situation in Kazakhstan 
enables us to avoid such power actions lowering the republic's 
international prestige. It needs merely to be emphasized that 
both on the issues of a strengthening of statehood and in the 
economy there has to be a mutual aspiration of the government 
and the main political movements and parties to a convergence of 
positions on questions of the reform. It is not, of course, a 
question of some class appeasement and a ban on constructive 
criticism of the actions of the government and the formulation 
of alternative programs. The danger lies elsewhere. As the 
experience of certain CIS countries testifies, it consists of 
internation and political destabilization, which, certainly, is 
in the interests of no political party and no single inhabitant 
of multinational Kazakhstan. 
  A cultured, civilized dialogue with all who are sincerely 
interested in Kazakhstan's breakthrough in economic space and 
time is essential. It is necessary to take account of all this 
and to formulate the basic principles of ideology in the 
economic sphere. They are geared to: 
  the creation of a socially oriented mixed market 
economy based on a combination of the competitive 
self-regulation of production and regulation of the basic 
parameters of economic development on the part of the state; 
  support for national enterprise in all its forms 
with the priority of private enterprise in the sectors directly 
producing material assets in the sphere of services, 
construction, transport, and trade; 
  the structural reorganization of production and 
the surmounting of its raw material one-sidedness with 
priorities in the fuel and energy and iron and steel complexes 
and the food and consumer goods market and in the development of 
the system of service lines; 
  the social protection of the population, 
particularly the needy and handicapped strata, assurance of 
employment, and the surmounting of unemployment and the 
unmanageability in migration processes; 
  use of the economic advantages from the middle "Eurasian" 
geopolitical location and pragmatism in the choice of 
economic and political partners in interstate relations. 
  The market cannot be built without the masses' recognition 
and acceptance of such categories as economic efficiency, the 
personal economic liberty of the individual, and private 
property. It is obvious that these categories cannot be firmly 
established in the consciousness without the corresponding 
social base, the formation of which is only just beginning. 
Under these conditions it is the state that assumes the function 
of defense of the new economic ideology. Without the active 
ideological support of the state a market mentality simply 
cannot take shape. It is essential to understand here that the 
real market presupposes not only propaganda of its values but 
also a mastery of the essential mechanisms and skills. It is 
obvious that in Kazakhstan only the state can undertake the 
large-scale training of personnel equipped with this set of 
instruments. 
  A strengthening of state principles should be accompanied by 
the building of a society based on the rule of law. This is a 
task of national significance. We are talking primarily about 
questions of legal culture and legal reform in the 
republic, for without them there will be no social progress and 
independence will not be complete. 
  In a civilized society legal culture is an essential 
component of the general culture of each individual and a 
qualifications requirement of each official. There needs to be a 
most serious discussion about this inasmuch as without the 
establishment of the proper rule of law we can hardly reform the 
economy and affirm democratic standards in the life of society. 
  The market implies primarily the self-regulation of the 
relations of the commodity producers and consumers based on 
qualitative laws. Without precisely operating legislation, 
therefore, there is no market, nor can there be. 
  Democracy requires state power clearly protected both 
against 
autocracy and against mob rule. It can only be protected via 
observance of binding legal procedures, for both the violence of 
the minority and the violence of the majority are equally 
dangerous. Without law, therefore, democracy is impossible. 
  Freedom of the individual as the target idea of a state of 
civilization presupposes the sovereignty of the individual and 
protection of his inviolability and dignity, regardless of 
whether he is a child or adult, employer or employed, state 
official or rank and file employee. Such legal equality is 
possible only if there is general observance of the 
democratically adopted laws. Only the court can transform any 
social conflict into a civilized dialogue. That is, without the 
law there is no liberty. 
  It may observed that in terms of its importance and 
complexity legal reform is the equivalent of economic reform. 
The building of a state based on the rule of law needs to begin 
with the state itself. This is a stringent demand of the market 
economy and the democratic society. If high-quality laws are 
lacking, the laws have to be constantly amended and revised. If 
the laws do not operate, "telephone law," as before, will. If 
legal thinking does not become firmly established in the 
consciousness, there will be those wishing to encroach on the 
functions of administration, investigation, and justice. 
  If we truly intend building a civilized society in which the 
ideas of right and ethics triumph, each citizen must from his 
school years assimilate their elementary principles, just as 
each of us knows the elementary principles of mathematics. 
  Like any sovereign state, Kazakhstan will maintain a 
defense capability and strengthen national security. We 
have adopted a military doctrine and a package of military laws, 
which specify both measures to prevent war and methods of 
defense of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the 
republic. Our doctrine has an exclusively defensive focus. We 
take account here of the doctrines of the states of the CIS and 
offer cooperation with them in the accomplishment of joint 
defense assignments. But however the situation in military 
questions shapes up, only political methods taking account of 
the balance of states' interests are a civilized method of the 
solution of international problems and conflict settlement. 
Kazakhstan has confirmed its commitment to this position 
repeatedly. We should also carefully consider the geopolitical 
factor as well. An exceptional balance of decisions in the 
military sphere which do not disturb in the least the continuing 
stability in the region is essential. 
  Maintaining defense capability is a most important state 
function. The political aspect is significant here also. Our 
armed forces are currently in the formation phase. The state has 
rendered and will continue to render them daily support. From 
its first steps the army of the republic is called upon to 
enhance combat readiness, be for the youth a true school of 
devotion to the motherland, and to multiply our people's truly 
illustrious combat and labor traditions. At the same time, on 
the other hand, it is essential to establish in society a 
respectful attitude toward the defenders of the fatherland. 
Military service should possess tremendous prestige, and the 
army's authority among the people must be made unshakable. Much 
will depend here both on the men themselves and on the 
government and public organizations, primarily those that work 
with the youth. We must not allow an unhealthy atmosphere to be 
created around the army or servicemen to feel themselves to be 
second-class citizens. 
  Strengthening the independence of the state, we should 
continue the development of the course in foreign 
policy. We are aware of the close attention to and 
increased interest in the international orientation of 
Kazakhstan. Attempts to predetermine the vector of the 
republic's outlet to the outside world are made openly or 
covertly from time to time. 
  It would seem extraordinarily important in this connection 
to 
adhere to a multipolar orientation on the basis of our 
geographical location and ethnodemographic and other factors. 
The basis of our international relations is an aspiration to 
establish mutually profitable political, socioeconomic, and 
cultural relations with all countries, near and far. 
  Taking account of the salient features of historical 
development, we are undoubtedly paying and will continue to pay 
paramount attention to an expansion of cooperation with Russia, 
the republics of Central Asia, and other states of the CIS, with 
many of which we are bound by close integration and allied, 
including defense, agreements. 
  The creation of the Economic Union will afford favorable 
opportunities for the consolidation of interstate contacts, 
economic interaction, the restoration under the new conditions 
of rational relations, the organization of efficient sectoral 
cooperation, and the expansion of information and cultural 
exchange. 
  We attach enormous significance to the dynamics of 
continental development. It is this that justifies the 
well-known initiatives we have put forward at the United Nations 
and also the steps connected with the convening of the 
Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in 
Asia and the activity of the Asian Economic Cooperation 
Organization. 
  In foreign policy activity we will adhere consistently to 
the 
commonly accepted international standards and comply strictly 
with the commitments we have assumed. 
  And concerning one other most important factor of the 
formation of the sovereignty of Kazakhstan--information 
independence, without which the creation of an efficient 
ideological platform is impossible. 
  We are becoming more and more extensively a part of 
international information exchange, which is undoubtedly a 
positive phenomenon. But this process cannot be interpreted 
simplistically. An expansion of the international system of 
information does not mean an automatic extension of democracy in 
the region. Information channels in the world are distributed 
and loaded unevenly, which is connected with the limited range 
of languages of exposition of the information and the differing 
level of states' financial and technical possibilities. 
  The young independent states frequently find themselves 
under 
the strong pressure of opinions imposed from outside. As a 
result most complex internal processes with their particular 
logic are evaluated by an outside view and frequently explained 
superficially and, at times, tendentiously also. This results in 
a kind of barrier in the way of the establishment of the genuine 
independence of many states. But closing off outside sources of 
information would mean for us self-isolation. 
  The solution is to see behind the information announcements 
the essence of the political principles. The state is required 
to regulate the information balance. This is in no way contrary 
to the principles of an open society and makes it possible at 
the same time to seriously approach the achievement of genuine 
information independence. It is essential here that our mass 
media learn to uphold the interests of the republic and create 
their own information space in the world's political arena. We 
need to win an audience outside of the republic, especially 
since we have impressive arguments in support of our foreign and 
domestic policy steps. 
  Such are the basic national priorities, fidelity to which 
will bring us onto the path leading to the achievement of real 
independence. This is possible only on condition of the creation 
in society of an atmosphere of consolidation, stability, and 
spiritual harmony. 
<H5>  Toward Ideological Consolidation </H5>
  It is hardly necessary today to convince anyone that 
national 
movements, particularly in the young independent states, are 
performing a colossal role. It is they that are to a 
considerable extent upholding national interests expressed in a 
revival of the self-awareness, culture, spirituality, 
traditions, and language of any people. These processes are 
occurring currently in Kazakhstan also. Realization of the 
national idea has produced for society many positive results. 
And it would be a big mistake not to see this and to discern in 
nations' natural aspiration to self-revival merely a limitation 
of the rights of others or a sham appeal, as a tribute to 
fashion, to the past, frequently of a decorative nature. 
  No, this is a return to a normal human condition. And the 
peoples of the republic should on the one hand adopt an 
understanding attitude toward the changes taking place in the 
consciousness of the Kazakh people and render them spiritual and 
intellectual support. On the other, it should be seen that under 
the new conditions other peoples also are undergoing complex 
formation processes, which requires the same understanding and 
attitude on the part of the Kazakh nation. Everyone should 
understand that it is impossible to compel respect for oneself 
and one's national dignity while denying it to others. 
  It is perfectly obvious that under the conditions of 
multinational Kazakhstan there is only one way of realizing 
national interests, which consists of a guarantee of the 
equality of all peoples with the integrating role of the Kazakh 
nation. Any other is fraught with disastrous conflicts and a 
halt to the democratic reforms. The key ideological task for us 
in this connection is the assurance of internation 
harmony. 
  The elaboration of a special integral concept of 
Kazakhstan's 
nationality policy for the transitional period incorporating a 
study of the specific requirements of the nations and 
nationalities living in the republic and realization of the 
provisions of the constitution concerning their free development 
would seem extremely necessary today. It is important here that 
the activity of the state authorities and public organizations 
primordially be geared to the development of the interaction of 
the peoples and their spiritual unity in the name of the 
achievement of the set goals. It is our duty to convert the 
polyethnic nature of society into a stable consolidating factor. 
  An important part in the accomplishment of this task could 
be 
played together with traditional institutions such as the 
educational system, the family, and the work force by 
national-cultural centers. They should be not only focal points 
of the preservation of national self-awareness and the 
development of the distinctive spirituality but also be schools 
of genuine internationalism. Taking advantage of their 
possibilities of work directly with people, the centers could do 
much to overcome national narrowness and exclusiveness and 
manifestations of chauvinism, nationalism, and separatism. There 
is a sphere in which their influence could be particularly 
effective. I refer to our social life, people's everyday mutual 
relations. After all, it is here that conflicts, seemingly 
negligible, but dangerous in their consequences, in internation 
soil at times arise. 
  Together with the state institutions they could do much for 
the development of cultural ties between the peoples and ensure 
a pluralism and the compatibility of the cultures with the free 
development of each. 
  Some nongovernment structure which could assume the 
functions 
of practical realization of the ideas of internation harmony and 
unity and be a directive body of the Forum of Peoples of 
Kazakhstan will be necessary in the future, most likely. Its 
composition should make provision for the representation of all 
ethnic groups, well-known public figures, the most authoritative 
personalities in the republic, and the administration chiefs. 
The national-cultural centers could in conjunction with the 
public organizations channel the energy of all strata of society 
into a creative channel, study the deep-lying processes in the 
relationships of different social and national groups, and 
pursue a consistent policy aimed at excluding internation or 
social tension in any region of the country. 
  An active part in this noble work could be taken by the 
public movements and parties. Primarily those whose program 
principles are aimed at the consolidation of Kazakh society in 
the name of the progress of the reforms. 
  Together with the affirmation of internation harmony the 
strengthening of intranation unity would seem 
important in realization of the idea of the consolidation of 
Kazakhstani society. This problem exists today, and the task is 
to ensure that the national idea perform a unifying, 
constructive role in this case. 
  In the research aspect the history and nature of the 
intra-Kazakh division into zhuzy, clans and territorial 
groupings and the nature of its influence on the development of 
society past and present have still to be conceptualized. But 
the essence is that new and by no means innocuous trends of 
intranation division have emerged. The democratization of social 
life and a certain independence of the regions have come to be 
used as levers of monopoly control over resources by local 
elites. Various forms of clannish protectionism and clannish and 
territorial lobbies are at times manifested in the power 
structures and in the financial and commercial spheres. 
  As a whole, contemporary clan and tribal ideology is a 
highly 
dangerous form of intranation disintegration and disorientation. 
A leitmotiv of state ideology, therefore, should be the 
surmounting of clan stereotypes. The potential for this exists. 
This includes primarily the historically evolved national 
statehood. The unitary state arrangement. The territorial 
integrity of Kazakhstan. The unity of the centuries-old culture. 
The entire population of the republic is united beneath these 
slogans today, and all the more should they call for the 
national unity of the Kazakh people. 
  Another most important ideological mission of ours is the 
fostering of Kazakhstani patriotism and the formation 
of the clear self-determination of each citizen. Specialists use 
for this term "self-identification." And it is by no means a 
question of citizenship as such, which pertains to legal acts 
with a precise juridical meaning. There is an appreciable 
difference between taking out citizenship and recognizing 
oneself to be a citizen. 
  Unfortunately, the understanding that henceforward we shall 
all be citizens of the independent, sovereign state of 
Kazakhstan, not the former USSR or the CIS, is of a very 
superficial nature. Moreover, certain strata of the population, 
having lost their former ideals and not having acquired new 
ones, are today experiencing a certain confusion, which is 
converting them into a sum total of the notorious "social 
atoms." The formation, on the other hand, of genuine patriotism 
and real civicism presupposes the precise political 
self-determination of the personality and a conscious choice of 
one's motherland. 
  It is essential to formulate a system of actions which helps 
each person feel proud of his involvement in our state, its rich 
and illustrious history, and its future. Both the problems and 
prospects of the country should be close and comprehensible to 
all people. 
  This task also concerns the entire system of education, the 
cultural authorities, public organizations, the mass media, and 
each family. And we need to start with the inculcation of a 
reverential attitude toward the country's flag, coat of arms, 
and anthem, obedience to the law, and respect for the 
authorities. We need to ensure that each person assimilate from 
his childhood years the essentially simple idea: Kazakhstan is 
my fatherland, and I am responsible for it, as it is for me. 
  Questions of the establishment in society of high 
linguistic culture should also be in the channel of 
constructive work on ideological consolidation. This problem has 
become heavily politicized as of late, although it should be 
viewed not from the standpoint of the exclusiveness of the 
official language and its counterpoise to others, as people have 
attempted to do, but, on the contrary, from its unifying role. 
The Kazakh language, as a part of the culture, should be an 
additional factor of the consolidation of all Kazakhstanis. It 
is the basis of cognition for all nations and nationalities of 
the culture, traditions, customs, and everyday life of the 
Kazakh people. Study thereof, not compulsory but deliberate, 
should commence for everyone from his childhood years and be 
supported organizationally and methodically. And everyone living 
here should clearly recognize the need for this approach. At the 
same time, on the other hand, all people should know that our 
legislation as a whole and the Language Act in particular 
protect them against all restrictions and persecution based on 
knowledge or ignorance of the official and any other language. 
  The question of an enhancement of the consolidating role of 
the Kazakh language is pertinent for the added reason that in 
recent decades part of the Kazakh youth has come to be divorced 
from its native language environment, which has occurred on 
account of the artificial narrowing of the sphere of use of the 
native language. 
  This problem can be tackled in entirely civilized fashion. 
There is among this part of the Kazakh population a relatively 
great desire and readiness to familiarize itself with its 
national roots. Consequently, we should not be exacerbating the 
situation but creating the conditions for filling in the gaps. 
Moral sensitivity on the part of those for whom national culture 
and language are natural and organic is needed also. 
  Speaking of the language problem, it is essential to link it 
with our general goals. Kazakhstan aspires to join the world 
community on a par with others. Linguistic self-isolation is 
incompatible with this, however. A channel of introduction to 
the immense flow of information in the modern world is Russian. 
For this reason knowledge of Russian is a positive factor for 
the peoples of the republic. 
  On the whole, it is essential to inculcate in young people 
of 
all nationalities an aspiration to the constant enrichment of 
linguistic potential. The study of European and oriental 
languages today together with knowledge of one's own and the 
official language are a command of the times. The state is 
required to create the necessary conditions for study in this 
case also. 
  Any constructive, not destructive, ideology in Kazakhstan 
should also take account of the fact that our state is not only 
multinational but also multicredal. A religious perception of 
the world is characteristic of hundreds of thousands of 
citizens, and the number of followers of various creeds 
continues to grow. There has also been a change in the 
place of religion in society. Even recently it was, 
to put it mildly, on the periphery, now it is a real component 
of social and spiritual life. The sphere of charitable activity 
of religion, specifically in the field of health care, 
education, and culture (the creation of kindergarten and 
retirement homes, hospitals, and educational institutions) is 
expanding. It is common knowledge that values common to all 
mankind are the basis of the moral principles of various 
religions. The religious communities are doing a great deal to 
maintain in society a healthy atmosphere, peace, and harmony and 
to establish spirituality. It is important that the followers of 
various creeds can recognize their involvement in the creation 
of the new statehood and have a vital interest in its 
strengthening and development. The renunciation of the 
ideological confrontation with religion and the adoption of the 
constitution and the Law "On Freedom of Religious Belief and 
Religious Associations" afford extensive opportunities in this 
respect. 
  At the same time it is essential to convey to the 
consciousness of all that the secular nature of the state 
permits the most democratic solution of the questions of free 
choice of any religion or atheism and assures the equality of 
the creeds. Also important is an understanding that the 
separation of religious associations from the state not only 
creates favorable opportunities for the satisfaction of 
religious requirements but also presupposes their 
noninterference in the activity of all state institutions and 
organizations. 
  It is necessary to strive for fulfillment of the provisions 
of the constitution concerning the impermissibility of the 
creation of political parties on a religious basis and the 
political activity of religious associations. We need to 
counteract attempts to use religious feelings for instigating 
conflicts in society and to promote the positive directions in 
the activity of the religions. The effectiveness of the new 
ideological propositions, on the other hand, will also depend on 
how extensively and successfully the dialogue of the main social 
forces, including the clergy of various creeds, is conducted and 
to what extent its participants display a will to joint search 
for paths of mutual understanding and cooperation in the name of 
the well-being of the multinational people of Kazakhstan. 
  An appreciable influence on a strengthening of the 
consolidation of society is exerted by the creation of an 
atmosphere of stability and civic harmony. Much will 
depend here on the skillfully organized dialogue of the state 
and the new political institutions--political parties and public 
movements. As a whole, it is still too early to speak of 
qualitatively and quantitatively evolved multiparty conditions. 
But we must foster in society a tolerance of the views of 
political opponents. On the whole, the opposition is a normal 
and even useful phenomenon. But the main thing is that parties 
and movements operate in a constructive spirit and engage in 
criticism in the true meaning of this word, not carping. We need 
ideas and versions of this program or the other capable of 
serving the common good, not general arguments and altercations. 
The state authorities are adhering in relation to the parties 
and movements at the present time to a centrism contributing to 
observance of statewide interest, not the interest of a part of 
society. We will continue to actively support structures 
establishing political stability and at the same time to cut 
short anticonstitutional, unlawful actions based on extremist 
ideas. 
  Parties and movements, to whatever orientations they adhere 
and however contradictory their platforms, can do much for the 
consolidation of society. The trend of their unification in the 
form of a roundtable is a fact of positive value. 
  Also extremely important is the role of the parties and 
public movements in the shaping of political culture and the 
creation of political traditions which are new for us. Without 
this, stability and civic accord, as the basis of consolidation, 
become barely attainable. 
  It is essential to understand that we need stability for the 
sake of continuation of the reforms and determination of their 
correct pace corresponding to their particular stage. 
Specifically, a certain cultural adaptation is needed for the 
continuation of privatization. That is, we need to identify the 
"reference points" at which we need to stop and closely analyze 
the path that has been covered. Not only for the purpose of 
adjustment but also with the aim of preparing and acclimatizing 
the public consciousness to them. Such an approach is very 
important in political reform also. We have consciously moved to 
gradually transform the political system, although even this is 
evoking rebukes from the radicals. There should be no haste in 
personnel matters either, incidentally. Stability is 
immeasurably more important to us. 
  The revolutionary leap forward syndrome is a very dangerous 
ailment for society. Sociopolitical revolutions are not the best 
way to develop the state. A task of the present generation of 
Kazakhstanis is the creation of a society in which mechanisms of 
the evolutionary type operate and in which its renewal is 
consistent. 
  The ideology of modernization, which is a complex 
multilevel phenomenon, contains a consolidating principle also. 
This is both the ideological platform of the economic reforms 
and the transformation of political institutions and a new type 
of social behavior. 
  When people speak today about the danger of the 
modernization 
of Kazakhstan and recall the deplorable experience of the 
1930's, they forget two facts. First, we are talking about an 
entirely different modernization, second, it is not of a 
forcible nature. 
  Truly, the forced collectivization and compulsory transition 
to other methods of management struck a colossal blow at the 
people, undermining primarily the entire tenor of life for 
years. Politically, the modernization amounted at that time to 
affirmation of the totalitarian idea in all spheres of society. 
It is this uniformity that we have to overcome. Unless society 
is modernized, we will simply lose the future. There would, at 
worst, be a restoration of totalitarianism in this form or the 
other. 
  Modernization presupposes the formation of a developed civil 
society. And this incorporates primarily the sum total of 
voluntary associations of people: the family, public 
organizations, religious, cultural, and economic associations, 
trade unions, and so forth. Their common characteristic is that 
they are truly voluntary, nonstate, and nonpolitical 
organizations. It means people's entire private property and 
particular customs, habits, and rights. It means the sphere of 
life that is protected against outside interference. 
  The formation of such a civil society requires gradual 
evolution. Economically, the basis thereof are 
nonstate enterprises, that is, all economic associations of the 
citizens on a voluntary basis and in accordance with independent 
initiative. When this sector of the economy becomes just as 
significant as the public sector, the degree of the citizens' 
economic freedom will enable them to determine their future 
themselves. 
  Socially, this means primarily the family and all 
nonstate public associations of the citizens, but formed for 
other than political purposes. They may vary from a fellowship 
of scientists or unofficial mass media through a sports club or 
economic organization. 
  Finally, ideologically, this means ideological 
pluralism and real freedom of speech and freedom of worship. 
  The modernization of Kazakhstan presupposes the formation of 
a civil society which is a condition of the freedom of each 
citizen and the stability of society as a whole. 
  A certain modernization of political institutions and the 
formation of a mass democratic consciousness are essential in 
addition to this. 
  Utopian notions of democracy as some anarchic freedom 
manifestly do not correspond to the political arrangement of 
truly democratic societies. In actual fact, the organization of 
political life in them is somewhat different. Politics there 
becomes a sphere of professional activity, and the population 
participates in it via local government, elections, and the mass 
media. It is such an arrangement, not demonstration anarchy, 
which is the indicator of the stability of democracy. This 
system includes a multiparty arrangement and numerous civic 
movements, national-cultural centers, and economic and cultural 
foundations. But the main thing is that in the civil society the 
state sharply restricts its interference in the economic and 
private life of the individual. 
  It should be considered that the formation of a civil 
society 
is impossible also without a modernization of values. It is 
essential to renounce state paternalism. We have become 
accustomed to the state being responsible for each and 
everything, the subject notwithstanding--the retiree who has 
given the best years of his life to social labor or a perfectly 
able-bodied individual. Henceforward, however, support will be 
rendered only the groups of the population that actually need 
it. The accentuated social policy is aimed primarily at the 
needy, large families, the handicapped, retirees, and students. 
But this is one aspect of the problem. Any economically 
independent person, in the private sector particularly, should 
understand that economic freedom demands responsibility also. A 
person must himself be responsible for his well-being, as long, 
by virtue of different circumstances, as he is not among the 
socially vulnerable strata. This high individual responsibility 
for his material and social position should be a principal 
ethical norm. 
  It is essential also to effect a transition from group to 
individual choice. In the new economic, political, and cultural 
sphere the highest value is individual liberty, individual 
choice. Kazakhstan has subscribed to international legal 
instruments giving individual freedom and choice priority not 
from tactical considerations. It is the ideological axiom of the 
modern world. The former system of group control has already 
been demolished. It is essential to create mechanisms of inner 
self-control, which will require a change in the entire system 
of education. 
  Finally, it is essential to determine the institutions 
of realization of the new ideological platform. 
  In speaking of the ideology that has departed our political 
arena we mean that its institutions and the immense machinery 
that worked on it have disappeared together with it also. Of 
course, there can be no question of its reconstitution inasmuch 
as we have proclaimed entirely different principles and 
approaches not only to the content but also the organization of 
ideological activity. 
  But, as in any democratic society, a system of the 
dissemination of modern knowledge, essential political and 
socioeconomic information, and the propaganda of moral values 
and behavioral standards in keeping with the transformations 
which are being effected must be created here. Professional 
machinery is undoubtedly required for this, and its functions 
consist also of helping people figure out the far from simple 
questions of our life and analyze social and political phenomena 
and economic and international problems. 
  The reform of society should necessarily be based on a 
broadly erudite stratum of propaganda workers and ideologists, 
primarily in the person of public servants. They should be 
active conduits of political and economic strategy and tactics 
to broad strata of the populace, particularly in the localities. 
Incompetent, conservative officials should be replaced by 
progressive specialists, people of the market generation, who 
know the fundamentals of political science, sociology, and 
psychology and who are convinced and energetic and capable of 
in-depth generalizations and independent evaluations. 
  The educational system, science, culture, artistic 
organizations, and the mass media should participate in molding 
the political culture of society and in realizing humanitarian 
ideas contributing to its progressive development. 
  The platform of ideological consolidation requires 
all-around 
discussion. The shaping of a new world outlook of Kazakhstani 
society is only at the initial stage. But we must be able to 
discern the actual outlines of our future concerns. Future 
generations will be able to look even further. 
  We are not today building an epoch-making ideological 
structure. But it is important to understand that the 
transitional period is not a period of stagnation, it has its 
own logic of development, its own long-range goals, its own 
ideological substantiation. It is today that the foundations of 
the civilized development of the country, of the society toward 
which we have begun to move, are being laid. We need to cast off 
the shackles of the former thinking and the fear of the unknown. 
We need to understand that we are treading, generally, the paths 
trodden by world civilization. But our salient feature and 
difficulty is that no one before us has accomplished a 
transition to the market simultaneously with the building of 
statehood and the democratization of society. 
  Kazakhstan has opted conclusively for the path of progress. 
We can negotiate it only by having adopted as allies efficiency 
and purposiveness and by having mobilized the enormous material 
and moral potential.

KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent: "An Investor Gathers 
Momentum"] 
  [Text] The Kazzagotkhlopkoprom Production Association has 
earned a reputation as an active investor in South Kazakhstan 
Oblast. Its capital, invested in several joint ventures with 
Western companies, is helping "develop the economy from within" 
and meet the demands of the consumer market. 
  South Kazakhstan, the most northerly cotton-growing area in 
the CIS, produces high-quality raw material for the textile 
industry. Several mills in France have been using our cotton 
fiber for quite some time now. The fact that excellent cotton 
quality has been achieved is not attributable to the farmers, 
but rather to procurement specialists. They help select the best 
plant types and decide on the optimum planting schedule. Another 
weighty argument has also been added since the arrival of the 
market economy: the dollar. 
  Prior to 1988, each year South Kazakhstan Oblast, like all 
parts of the Central Asian republics, would receive an "order" 
from Moscow, telling it where to ship its cotton, and how much 
to send. Accounts were paid in rubles at stable low prices. 
Later permission was granted to sell an insignificant amount of 
cotton on the world market for dollars. However, the return was 
small. 
  Incidentally, even today, when the export quota for the 
"distant abroad" totals 25,500 tonnes, or one-third of all 
cotton procured, net revenues in dollars and marks is extremely 
small. Customs duties and all sorts of other fees consume more 
than one-half of hard currency receipts, with only 40 percent 
going to the association and cotton farms. 
  There is only one other legal way to make ends meet: barter. 
But in contrast to some other enterprises that have also 
obtained the right to engage in foreign economic operations, 
Kazzagotkhlopkoprom has not gotten into buying pantyhose or 
automobile cassette players. It uses its hard currency to buy 
whole factories at once. 
  When the official opening of a a joint venture with the 
South 
Korean Telbone Company to manufacture VCR-TV combinations was 
held in Shymkent a month ago, many of those attending were 
surprised to learn during the presentation that cotton growers 
were among the founders. Improvements have been made in the 
design of the NAM system. The new Ordabasa videocassette system 
is markedly technically superior to its predecessor. 
  The cotton company was the first in the CIS to assemble 
Rank-Xerox copying equipment, selling more than 1,000 fax 
machines at comparatively low prices in every oblast in the 
republic. The Farat Joint Venture provides servicing and repairs 
for them. 
  The next stage in cooperation was the establishment of a 
joint venture with the English to manufacture cotton wool. The 
raw materials for this facility, located in Turkestan, will be 
noils -- a waste product of cotton processing. The construction 
is being closely watched by Uzbekistan, which at this time has 
no facilities for the manufacture of absorbent sterile cotton. 
  The first unit of the plant should begin operations in 
December. Negotiations are under way regarding the purchase of 
equipment for a second unit which will manufacture various 
cosmetic and medical items. In this way the joint venture will 
have a guaranteed profit both in rubles and in hard currency. 
Kazzagotkhlopkoprom will also get a share of the dividends, and 
that means it will be able to finance the construction of a 
copying equipment plant, a cotton spinning mill and other 
facilities that the oblast and the republic badly need. 
  The South Kazakhstan association currently has companies 
from 
eight developed countries around the world as its partners. Its 
specialists find equipment that other enterprises in the region 
need on the world market at low prices. 
  The production association would seem to be in a very secure 
position. But in these unpredictable times no one can guarantee 
prosperity. The association and its customers were hit hard by 
the introduction of a 30-percent duty on cotton exports to 
countries in the "near abroad." The government has promised to 
repeal this duty for enterprises in those republics which are 
parties to intergovernmental agreements, but that has not 
happened yet. 
  Much time and effort must be expended on filing raw cotton 
procurement prices with the republic's State Committee on 
Prices. Do they not realize that it is simply not to the 
association's advantage to artificially deflate or inflate 
prices? The former would drive a wedge between suppliers and the 
association, and the latter would weaken the cotton's 
competitive position. 
  One constant headache for the association's management is 
connected with directed state loans for raw cotton procurement. 
The new year's cotton harvest has begun, but the R64.5 billion 
[rubles] required to purchase it are not in the Agro-Industrial 
Bank yet. There is no money for fuel or spare parts for cotton 
harvesting combines, nor any money to pay off last year's debts 
to farms. The CIS's epidemic of defaulted payments for products 
has not spared cotton growers either. Payments from customers 
are not being received on time, and so it was not possible to 
pay off last year's debts on schedule. The capital promised to 
extend the term of the loan until 1 October, but did not keep 
its promise -- money was needed immediately for the grain 
harvest. Yet under contracts concluded with the farms any 
default on payments to them will result in substantial fines. 
  The solution, according to Sh. Usmanov, general director of 
Kazzagotkhlopkoprom Production Association, is to issue stock in 
the association as soon as possible and establish a commercial 
bank. The farmers and their authorized representative -- the 
production association -- are fully mature enough for greater 
independence. Even now, foreseeing delays in funding from the 
budget, they have reached agreement with the Telbone Company 
regarding favorable hard currency lending during the harvest 
period. Yet this will only cover less than one-third of their 
financial needs. So at this point there is still no way to get 
by without state support.

correspondent: "Access to the Persian Gulf Will Give Kazakhstan 
a Way To Reach the World Market"] 
  [Text] The Iranian Embassy in Almaty held a press 
conference on the eve of a visit by Iranian President Ali Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani to the Republic of Kazakhstan. Iran's 
ambassador told journalists about his view of the role of the 
press as a means of rapprochement and mutual understanding, 
saying its functions are "to reflect reality as it is, on the 
basis of truth." Complaining that previous reports about Iran 
very often have not corresponded to reality, the ambassador gave 
the media representatives a brief history of his country and a 
report on the state of its economy. Devoting particular 
attention to oil as an export item, Rasul Eslami denied the 
claim that all profits from oil exports are being used to 
purchase weapons. He also analyzed and criticized the former 
Iranian regime and discussed the Iran-Iraq war and the state's 
path of development since the Islamic revolution. As for Iran's 
policy in regard to Kazakhstan and the other former Soviet 
republics, he said that that policy is to help those states 
along the path of independent development. 
  The visit to Kazakhstan by Iranian President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani (who during his 10-day trip will also visit 
Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan) is a 
reciprocal visit after last year's trip to Iran by President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev. The delegation includes minister of 
foreign affairs Ali Akbar Velayati, minister of economics and 
finance Morteza Mohammad-khan, minister of roads and transport 
Akbar Torkan, and other ministers. Iran's delegation of 
representatives will include approximately 100 individuals, 
among them public officials, members of the government, bankers, 
industrialists and businessmen. Mr. Rafsanjani will be 
accompanied on the trip by his wife and daughter (incidentally, 
Miss Rafsanjani is chairman of the Iranian Women's Association). 
  During the visit there are plans for visits to Almaty and 
Karaganda, as well as discussion and signing of a number of 
documents in the areas of economics, politics, cultural 
cooperation and education. In the opinion of Rasul Eslami all 
this will serve to reinforce and expand the agreements reached 
during Nursultan Nazarbayev's trip to Iran. No specific economic 
cooperation projects were mentioned. However, the ambassador did 
invite everyone to a special exhibit by the Islamic Republic of 
Iran that is currently in Almaty and which should provide a 
complete picture of the capabilities of Iran's heavy and light 
industry and of 80 different companies. 
  The ambassador promised to open Iran's borders to 
Kazakhstan's products so they can reach the world market. The 
same will be true of oil and gas when they reach the Persian 
Gulf. 
  In short, the ambassador is convinced that by reaching the 
Persian Gulf Kazakhstan will be able to gain access to the world 
market. An enticing prospect. As is the two sides' stake in it.

correspondent: "In People's Minds Privatization Is Not the Same 
Thing It Is on Paper"] 
  [Text] Oh, if it were only that simple: just say the word 
and -- presto! -- restructuring! Doing things one way today and 
another way tomorrow, and all with equal ease. No, things do not 
work that way. And somewhere in my subconscious mind I knew in 
advance the kind of answer I would get to the question about 
changes in the economics of sovkhozes and kolkhozes since 
privatization that I posed to the Akmolinsk Oblast Agricultural 
Administration. 
  "You ask what has changed?" said V. K. Ilyashchenko, head of 
the oblast agricultural administration's Economics and Planning 
Department, a slight trace of irony in his voice. "Actually 
nothing, or at least not so far. There are many reasons for 
that. Of course, on the one hand only a short time has passed 
since the beginning of privatization; a majority of farms came 
under new types of ownership at the end of last year. But that 
is probably not the most important factor at all, but rather the 
fact that becoming an owner on paper is one thing, and actually 
becoming one, having the sense of being an owner, is something 
else altogether. It is the latter that we still lack. So trends 
in the development of privatized and non-privatized farms by and 
large do not differ at all." 
  Owner... That sounds good, but... What point is there in 
being an owner without freedom and independence, freedom to 
produce, freedom to set prices, freedom to sell one's produce, 
and independence from the dictates of bureaucrats? Our prices 
are still set by the state, and the state continues to issue 
state procurement quotas to farms for three years. Nor does our 
private owner have the right in most cases to sell what he 
produces without instructions from higher up. 
  Judging by what Vladimir Kuzmich said, the idea of 
privatization meets with various kinds of reception from the 
oblast's agricultural enterprises. Relatively large and smoothly 
functioning farms have generally greeted the idea of ownership 
with enthusiasm, while it proved necessary to force most 
unprofitable farms in the direction of happiness, in compliance 
with the president's edict. Later, when amendments were made to 
the edict, privatization proceeded at a more restrained pace. 
And still no one knows when 123 out of 152 farms in the oblast 
will decide whether to become property owners or not. Rural 
residents are not prepared to make that decision, because for 
many people privatization is terra incognita. "The 
state just wants to divide us." "Why privatize, when everything 
is fine the way it is?" "Who needs dividends, which we don't 
know when we'll ever see -- wages are more dependable!" These 
are some of the opinions heard from members of labor collectives 
whenever the topic of conversation turns to changes in the form 
of ownership. And there has been so much trouble stemming from 
incompetence even after privatization: it seems that just as 
soon as the final documents are filed with the state property 
committee someone is already wanting to split off, someone else 
is being thrown out, and claims are being filed against someone 
else -- just look at the kind of owners we have become! 
Naturally this approach to understanding a sense of ownership 
troubles the staff of the oblast agricultural administration, 
just as they are troubled by the possible view that will be 
taken of certain types of agricultural production by the future 
owners. 
  "Naturally any farmer is interested only in growing crops 
that yield a profit," muses V. K. Ilyashchenko. "But what about 
livestock farming, which is currently unprofitable? It is not 
likely that all property owners will behave in a civic-minded 
way, and some might, chasing after profits, stop raising 
livestock altogether, and then we might find ourselves with no 
meat." 
  The state should start deciding now what it should do in 
this 
situation: either order farmers to keep on raising livestock 
(but then what kind of sense of ownership could they have?), or 
provide meat producers with very large subsidies. Incidentally, 
those who think that only the socialist world has subsidized 
farmers are wrong. Even such major industrial powers as the 
United States and Canada provide very substantial support to 
their farmers. 
  All right then, we should help those who operate at a loss 
through no fault of their own and no matter what they do, but 
what about owners who simply do not want to work the way they 
should? During a recent visit to the virgin lands President 
Nazarbayev stated quite firmly that there should be no 
unprofitable farms in our state, and that they should be 
completely dissolved and sold on the auction block to thriftier 
farms or to industrial enterprises. 
  The oblast agricultural administration supports this idea, 
but at this point does not really have a clear perception of how 
the process would actually work. 
  "Well, people are going to say 'we have already had 
something 
like that' -- for example, we did dissolve one unprofitable 
farm. It was combined with another farm, a larger one. As a 
result the first farm's operations did not improve, and a 
once-strong farm got weaker. As for the sale of unprofitable 
farms to enterprises, we do not know whether there will be many 
industrialists interested in acquiring a burden like that: the 
capital investment required is huge, and no one knows when the 
profits will come, or whether they will come at all." 
  Many property owners presently bear a grudge against the 
state, and their reasoning goes somewhat like this: When tenant 
farms were established, they got all kinds of breaks, like 
lending on favorable terms, and funding. But we run into 
obstacles everywhere we go, and we cannot even get loans very 
easily -- we have to put up collateral that is worth some 
dollars! 
  Incidentally, not everything about privatization is bad, nor 
is it bad everywhere. Recently the oblast has seen the process 
of stock issuance by producers with processing enterprises 
occurring at quite a rapid rate. On many privatized farms people 
have realized that now they really must tighten their belts for 
a time and put their profits back into production. Various 
processing facilities and enterprises for the manufacture of 
consumer goods have sprung up on farms like mushrooms after a 
rain. 
  Generally speaking, the market economy is beginning to come 
into its own in rural areas as well. But when will it finally 
take off? The answer to that question depends on many factors. 
Perhaps the most important of these is that when we accept 
privatization in our heads and not just on paper, then we can 
hope for success.

correspondent: "We Are Manufacturing New Products... but Can We 
Sell Them?: The Only Way We Will Be Able To Is by Thinking About 
Markets Now"] 
  [Text] In the past this was never an issue -- there was a 
shortage of everything. Agents from Russia sat in the Balkhash 
Non-Ferrous Metals Refinery director's waiting room from morning 
until night. Balkhash brass was delivered by plane so that 
defense plants would not shut down. Now the warehouse is full of 
brass and bronze rolled stock, and no one wants it. It is no 
longer being sent to Mongolia, Vietnam and Cuba as a form of 
"fraternal assistance." No customers have come forward in 
Kazakhstan. Yet Balkhash is currently completing construction of 
a new rolling-mill department... Where will its products go? 
  The Zhezkazgantsvetmet [Zhezkazgan Non-Ferrous Metals 
Refinery] and Balkhashmed [Balkhash Copper Refinery] 
associations have long been wondering what they are going to do 
with their sulfuric acid. During the first half of the year 
Kazakhstani customers purchased only 52,000 tonnes of acid, and 
Russian customers bought a little more, yet out of environmental 
considerations alone the two associations should be producing 
half a million tonnes. They have the capacity to do that, but 
right now that equipment is idle. 
  In Zhayrem they have mined mountains of barite, but no one 
needs it, either. There has been a sharp drop in demand for lead 
and zinc ore. During a visit to Zhezkazgan Prime Minister S. 
Tereshchenko said: "We need to become a part of the world 
market, but no one there is waiting on us and our products." It 
turns out that the world market is saturated with lead, zinc, 
copper and cable, yet Zhezkazgan Oblast is rapidly creating new 
capacity for the manufacture of copper wire rod, enameled wire 
and cable, and is developing a new tungsten deposit. Where will 
all this be sold, and to whom? The Kumolinskiy Mining and 
Concentration Combine has been under construction for a long 
time and will manufacture rhodusite, but now it turns out that 
no one needs that product, because defense expenditures are 
decreasing. 
  In view of our tremendous natural resources many people 
think 
it should be easy to attract foreign capital to develop them. 
But in reality that is not happening. When they arrive in 
Zhezkazgan Oblast, foreign specialists immediately start asking 
the kind of questions to which we do not have any clear-cut 
answers. These include the details about surveys of mineral 
deposits, the extent to which all useful components are being 
recovered, the availability of advanced technologies and 
infrastructure and -- one of the most important questions -- 
availability of transportation to market. Yet on our side all 
these things are often based on emotion. 
  Someone once said that barite was in demand and began to 
mine 
it, but it turned out that what was in demand was not barite, 
but rather manganese, which had been ignored. At the end of this 
year Zhezkazgan will begin manufacturing copper wire rod, but 
its price on the world market is only 50 percent higher than the 
price of copper, and demand is much lower. When the wire rod 
starts going into cable manufacture, Kazakhstan will be fully 
supplied with cable. Will we be able to sell the surplus? How 
much will Kazakhstan need of various metals and items 
manufactured from them? No one can answer those questions. Our 
enterprises do not know market conditions either on the world 
market or in the CIS. 
  The oblast's economy is very inert and materials-intensive, 
and it is difficult and sometimes impossible to reorient it 
toward new types of manufacture. Currently efforts are being 
made in Sayak, Zhayrem and Karazhal to manufacture marble plates 
and jewelry, but there are plenty of these products on the world 
market already. With new products it will take time for the 
market to recognize and value them. The only thing that is well 
known is Zhezkazgan copper, so that is what people will buy. 
Will our cable be in demand immediately? We have only one hope: 
to sell it at a lower price. But in that case we run the risk of 
anti-dumping sanctions by international organizations. 
  Recently the Zhezkazgantsvetmet Association calculated its 
expenses for the coming year and its potential losses, and they 
totalled R25 billion [rubles]. Even at current prices electric 
power will cost R75 billion. And that is the most profitable 
enterprise in the oblast. At the Balkhashmed Association losses 
are projected to begin this year. 
  Nor are we seeing the emergence of a "natural economy," 
since 
up to 90 percent of the materials and equipment required must be 
imported from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Yet Kazakhstan's 
president has decreed that we can only purchase an amount equal 
to the money we have earned from shipments of our own products 
and equal to the amount of funds in correspondent accounts at 
banks outside the republic. 
  No matter how you look at it, in a market economy sales 
markets are of prime significance. The lack of attention to this 
issue is the weak link in reform.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Zhorov: "Big Changes Anticipated in </F>
the Republic's Financial and Banking Systems and Privatization 
Policy"] 
  [Text] Yesterday Kazakhstan President N. Nazarbayev 
received a group of economic consultants from South Korea. The 
group consisted of leading economic scientists from the Korean 
government's economic planning office, the government's 
institute for development, and the institute for economic 
research. 
  The activities of the group were led by Korea's former 
deputy 
prime minister, Dr Kim Mahn Je. 
  Agreement on the group's work in our republic was reached 
during a meeting on 13 May of this year between N. Nazarbayev 
and Kim Shin Yong, chairman of the South Korean group of the 
Khankhva [transliteration] company. 
  In the course of two months the experts from Korea worked in 
Almaty, where they studied the details of the financial and 
banking systems, foreign exchange relations and privatization 
policy. 
  A report was written on the basis of the collected and 
generalized data characterizing the current situation. In this 
case the South Korean experts made specific proposals regarding 
the matters they studied. 
  The report was presented together with the proposals to N. 
Nazarbayev at a meeting attended by Prime Minister S. 
Tereshchenko and other leaders of interested departments. 
  Kim Mahn Je briefly described the project offered for study, 
which consists of four parts, and suggested that Kazakhstan take 
South Korea's road to establishing market relations. The third 
and fourth parts of the project presented in the report pertain 
to analysis of the problems of privatizing and reorganizing the 
banking system. 
  In the opinion of the leader of the group of experts, 
privatization is being held back in Kazakhstan because little 
capital has yet been accumulated in private hands. 
  A proposal was made to create 20 holding companies that 
could 
help more than 200 large enterprises to travel the road linking 
denationalization to full market relations. Rather than the 
planned 3-year period of mass privatization, the Koreans propose 
a more gradual road over a period of 5 years in order to avoid 
major upheavals. They advise beginning mass privatization with 
competitive, strong enterprises. 
  The experts believe that the existing banking system is the 
largest problem on the road to reform. Presence of a large 
number of small banks is an obstacle to a clear financial policy. 
  In the opinion of Kim Mahn Je capital needs to be 
concentrated in Kazakhstan in one or two large banks. For 
example a large bank for Kazakhstan's reconstruction and 
development possessing authority abroad could be established by 
merging the capital of the Turanbank and Kredsotsbank 
[transliterations] with the National Bank. The capital of the 
Alembank and Kazsberbank [transliterations] could be merged into 
a second bank. 
  A proposal was also made for reorganizing small banks and 
establishing a minimum amount of authorized capital. It was 
revealed in the course of discussion that many of the proposals 
enjoy support among members of the Kazakhstan government. 
  Besides this, N. Nazarbayev said that the republic will have 
to abandon subsidies to unprofitable enterprises. But this 
should not proceed as it did in Russia, the president stressed. 
There, around 10,000 enterprises may go bankrupt in the course 
of such an approach, which is 30 percent of their number. Russia 
is huge, and it can endure, but Kazakhstan couldn't. Some 
enterprises, in the president's words, will receive support from 
the state. Included among them are the giants of 
metallurgy--Karmetkombinat, Balkhashmed, and chromium producers. 
  N. Nazarbayev thanked the group of Korean scientists for the 
work they did, and recommended inviting them to act as experts 
and specialists in banking affairs. They are to provide 
assistance in drafting documents on reforming the banking system. 
  Following the meeting with the South Korean group N. 
Nazarbayev met with 30 directors of the largest enterprises of 
the former defense complex. The hope is that they will lead the 
Kazakh economy out of its stagnation. A huge engineering and 
technical potential capable of solving the most serious problems 
is concentrated at these enterprises. A specific task was posed 
to each director.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Gorbunov: "Not Yet the Masters, but </F>
Working Toward It: The First Steps of Regional Holding 
Companies"] 
  [Text] The rate of privatization in the republic and 
the forms and methods of denationalization will continue to be a 
topic of dispute among legislators, producers and citizens for a 
long time to come. Because despite the seeming simplicity of the 
matter, it is not all that simple to divide up state property 
without infringing upon the interests of both the individual and 
the state as a whole, and without undermining the economic 
foundations of the society in the effort. There can be no debate 
that mistakes and a struggle between departmental, local and 
group interests are not excluded on this road. All of these 
"collisions" may be discerned at the Pavlodar Irtysh Joint-Stock 
Company (formerly a meat-packing plant) and the Pavlodarmoloko 
State Joint-Stock Holding Company (formerly an oblast dairy 
industry association). 
  They became the first-born of denationalization in 
Kazakhstan. Their experience was generalized at a republic 
seminar. In what way is it valuable? First of all in that an 
attempt was undertaken to combine the interests of meat and milk 
producers with those of the processors of these products--the 
meat-packing plants and dairies. 
  "In our joint-stock company," said Zaure Nurmukhanova, the 
director of the Irtysh Joint-Stock Company, "there are presently 
105 sovkhozes and kolkhozes. And each month another 5-6 farms 
submit applications for membership." 
  Zaure Malgazhdarovna, might they be doing this out of 
desperation? Who are they going to give their livestock to, and 
where are they going to process the meat, if your enterprise 
holds a monopoly? 
  "That's not at all the way it is. There's also the Ekibastuz 
Meat-Packing Plant in the oblast, after all, and we don't 
believe that we would have any serious competition if meat 
packing plants and sausage-making shops were to be established 
in the rayons. The simple fact is that our production is 
well-tuned, the procedures are fully developed, and we make 
maximum use of raw materials and by-products of slaughtering the 
animals (horns, hooves, hides, internal organs, blood etc.). 
Naturally the profit is larger as well. The stockholders 
themselves control the schedule of animal deliveries and meat 
prices, and determine the need for production renovation. With 
Almaty's help we have begun construction of a new meat-packing 
plant, and we are currently reorganizing the presently operating 
one for the production of sausages and smoked meats. Together 
with the oblasts's banks we have established a joint-stock 
company for the production of lidaz and other medical 
preparations. We have already erected the building frame, and 
the heat will be turned on in the winter. Or here's another 
example showing that we are taking over as the masters. As you 
know, the price of water has gone up, which has reflected upon 
product cost. So we drilled a well on the territory of the 
packing plant. It seems like a little thing, but last year this 
gave us a savings of 30 million rubles, while this year it will 
be somewhere around 200 million. Let me say one more thing. In 
the beginning some of the stockholders mistrusted us, and they 
sent over their own observers to see if we butcher the carcasses 
properly and if we are not hiding any of the meat products and 
profit. Today there are no misunderstandings, and our partners 
have persuaded themselves that we are working `for the same 
pocket'." 
  But isn't there a merger of interests here between the 
producers and processors at the expense of the customers? 
  "Are you referring to `jacking up' the prices? This also is 
disadvantageous. First of all, given today's wages and the large 
number of poor, the demand for meat products has fallen as it 
is. Second, the oblast agricultural committee has worked out an 
average purchase price for meat. The farms at which livestock 
breeding is not very profitable need to think about how to 
surpass this price. To be honest, though, disputes often arise 
at meetings of the board of stockholders. Citing the high cost 
of fuel, equipment and electric power, farmers demand a higher 
price for the meat they deliver. And so I have to persuade them, 
and at times prove by calculation, the such demands are unfair. 
As an economist, I know that this approach is far afield of 
market methodology, but the people couldn't withstand `shock 
therapy'." 
  The Pavlodarmoloko State Joint-Stock Holding Company was 
born 
out of a conflict between two variants. The former oblast dairy 
association was constituted of independent rayon and city 
dairies, but they were bound together by shared economic 
stimulation funds and capital investments. 
  "This," said Vladimir Samsonov, director of the 
Pavlodarmoloko holding company, "allowed us to build a big plant 
and a whole milk substitute shop in Pavlodar, a city dairy in 
Ekibastuz and an ice cream shop in Aksu, and to renovate several 
rural enterprises. According to the first variant our structure 
should have remained as before, with the one difference that the 
milk producers were to be included as stockholders. In the 
second the rayon and city dairies would have separated from us 
completely, and then joined the holding company on a voluntary 
basis. I am not opposed to such independence in principle, but 
many of them do not have the resources even to make the priority 
payments, and they are putting no thought into renovation and 
new procedures." 
  "Vladimir Yemelyanovich, isn't there a longing here for 
the old methods of leadership? 
  "That's got nothing to do with it! I've been working in the 
sector for more than a decade, and no matter what we are called, 
no matter what structural changes we make, our task is to 
process milk and get it to the customer. But now we've gotten to 
the point were last year we had to import ice cream into the 
oblast all the way from Rostov! Once I said to a certain dairy 
director: `Can't you set up ice cream production at your dairy, 
you do have vacant production space after all, don't you?' To 
which he replied, `Excuse me, but I'm independent and I decide 
for myself what I'm going to do.' All right, so let there be 
`minor principalities,' but then let them also maintain their 
businesses at the proper level, and not come to me with their 
hands outstretched, asking me to pay their debts. Because the 
only thing that they are really concerned about is increasing 
their own wages." 
  Vladimir Samsonov also has his own opinion about mutual 
relations with milk producers. Before, in the words of the 
holding company's director, besides the basic taxes the oblast 
associations commonly transferred a certain percentage of their 
earnings to the producers. Now as much as 51 percent of the 
profit goes to the farmers. And in order to increase their total 
deductions, they inflate the prices of the milk they deliver. As 
in the Irtysh Joint-Stock Company, disputes and mutual 
reproaches are inevitable. Samsonov is making every effort to 
hold back this price race, so as not to be left with unsold 
goods. 
  It should not be thought in this case that Samsonov is a 
conservative, or that he opposes a market economy. "I'm for it," 
he said at the beginning of our interview, "but on a civilized 
basis, and in honest partnership." He and his colleagues are 
seeking markets and the ways of making products cheaper and of 
developing new procedures. Quite simply, he is deeply troubled 
when he sees the tested system falling into ruin with the years, 
and the processing sector failing to receive adequate attention 
and priority consideration from either legislators or the 
government, and how the race for independence is damaging the 
overall effort. But Samsonov does have his opponents as well, 
who are also certain that it is time to abandon gigantomania, 
and to follow the example of developed countries by processing 
milk and other products deep in the countryside, at miniplants, 
thus reducing high transportation costs and product losses 
during shipping and transloading. 
  Such is the content of the first experience of two Pavlodar 
joint-stock companies. They are essentially in the first stage 
of privatization, in which the state is providing support to 
them: by owning the controlling block of stocks, by setting 
prices, and by adopting particular decisions. But the 
stockholders are displaying increasingly greater independence 
and initiative. A contract system and testing of engineers and 
technicians with the purpose of preparing a reserve of 
middle-level executives were introduced at that same Irtysh 
company at Nurmukhanova's suggestion, and a system of 
stimulating the workers under which the theft of meat, which was 
a phenomenon of epidemic proportions in former years, would 
decline is operating. And as Zaure Malgazhdarovna said, the 
workers themselves come to her and suggest particular 
innovations and ideas helping to increase profit. And little by 
little Samsonov is breaking down the psychology of rising 
prices, persuading people that income could also be increased by 
selling relatively inexpensive products--that is, by hastening 
money turnover. The advantages of joint-stock ownership are 
already making themselves evident here. But there are many 
questions as well. No matter how you look at it, joint-stock 
companies--both producers and processors--are still monopolies. 
They dictate prices to the purchasers of their products. And the 
latter are forced to take them, because there are no serious 
alternatives in the oblast to the joint-stock companies. On the 
other hand, were we to do away with them all at once, we could 
be left with an unworkable situation in which small producers 
are unable not only to fight for a place in the market but even 
to maintain themselves. But that is how things will turn out if 
the state fails to adopt a multiprofile program for the 
development of processing industry, and if it does not accept 
the responsibility of supporting small processing enterprises 
for some period of time. After all, given the 10 percent 
profitability established for processors, they will not survive 
in the face of the current price gap between industrial and 
agricultural products. Moreover a large part of the expenses of 
the farmers has been transferred to the republic's citizens in 
the form of legalized deductions from the profits of holding 
companies, because in purchasing the milk and meat, the citizens 
are the ones who create this profit. This is perhaps an item of 
interest for the Antimonopoly Committee. 
  In short, things are not all that simple. Nonetheless, 
privatization has begun in the processing sector, and it must be 
brought to its logical conclusion, as was done in economically 
developed countries. Producers and processors have not yet 
become the full masters of their production operations, but they 
are striving for this.

<F P=106> [Article by Yelbay Saghym: "Relations With China."] </F>
  [Text] Only one idea is now in the mind of Kazakhstan, 
which has achieved its independence and has quickly entered into 
relations with the countries of the world: "we must still become 
known to foreign countries." However, the question: "which kind 
of countries should we choose," has still not been taken up so 
far. Leaving aside the question of a country or a people, is not 
each person a world unto himself? From that point of view, just 
as the establishment of relations with each person is in terms 
of the scope of knowledge, humanity, moral qualities, and 
nationality, similarly we establish relations with separate 
families composed of individuals and even with a nation. For 
that reason the question of the degree of relations with a given 
country, the need to become known to that country and in what 
way are leading questions of diplomacy. To answer these 
questions we must, first of all, before we become known to a 
country, strive to know that country as much as possible. This 
is because becoming known, in other words, means "disclosing 
one's secrets." When secrets have been disclosed, just like the 
proverb: "the Wolf keeps secret his leanness; do not expose a 
dog's fur to the dog," one's leanness cannot but be exposed to 
the light of the day, along with twisted things from a thousand 
places. But if secrets are not disclosed, we say "stay off a 
horse which you do not know about [know the secrets of]" and go 
over to polite [but distant] relations. 
  What a country will do after it has obtained one's secrets, 
or even a country which has not obtained one's secrets, depends 
upon the aims and culture of the country in question. In 
particular, more than distant countries, it is necessary to have 
a deep understanding of neighboring countries which "come to 
your village and help you herd your sheep," share your breath, 
and watch how you lay your pipes. 
  We Kazakhs, who have passed the time taking the view: "a 
neighbor's pay, the pay of Heaven," with regard to individual 
families and neighboring auyl, would seem to think of other 
nations in the same terms. The complicated history of our people 
over many centuries are clear proof of our words. Nothing more 
need be said. Has the lack of concern of we Kazakhs during our 
first relations with the Zhonghar [Dzungar] Khanate not left 
behind any regrets!? Moreover, you might ask how the Zhonghar 
Khanate in the east, so many times smaller than the Kazakh 
Khanate, was able to inflict upon the Kazakh people the disaster 
of "vagrancy with white heals [in the snow], the deviation [from 
the trek] out of great suffering." The Zhonghars, through 
frequent contacts, caught sight of the wide and beautiful Kazakh 
steppe and laid their plans. In such a time of struggle, the 
Kazakhs, with their internal "hostility," being separated into 
hordes and into clans, found out how to carefully exploit their 
"merits" by becoming 40 knives. Later the Russian colonialists 
were able to seize the entire Kazakh steppe. They even took 
special advantage of we Kazakhs' lack of connections with one 
another, our carefreeness. Thus, as a result of our honored 
properties, we could not get free of Russia for three hundred 
years... 
  Leaving other things aside, forgetting that a nation is an 
independent state, we [should] investigate the peoples and 
regions within that country. After we have carried on our 
research, we form many special organizations of various kinds 
and go on researching, wasting a lot of money. For example, 
there appear to be tens of organizations in the Chinese People's 
Republic researching Central Asia (Kazakhstan in particular, as 
its foundation). Kazakhstan has not formed such organization 
since its independence. On the other hand, they were formed 
during the time that the USSR was strong and in its prime. Not 
long after the Republic of Kazakhstan declared its independence, 
a book entitled "General Condition of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan" suddenly appeared in China. When the book was 
published, it represented, to be sure, no general effort. The 
Central Asia Institute of the Academy of Social Sciences of the 
Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region wrote and published the book. 
At present, young students who go to study at institutions of 
higher education must take examinations based upon that book. 
You can understand if intelligent people do not say what is 
really behind the "good will..." It is enough to remember only 
the need to take examinations based upon the book in China. 
  As for Kazakhstan, whether it is research institutions, or 
educational institutions, we are only concerned about ourselves. 
At the most, we learn or research foreign languages. But there 
is no a single organization carrying out special research about 
our near neighbors, or about other countries in the world 
connected with us. On the contrary, there are some unneeded 
organizations now functioning, for example, the Uighur Research 
Institute under the National Academy of sciences. This 
organization is now superfluous. In our view, this institute 
should be reorganized as a Turkology institute. This is because 
it is hard to understand what possible need Kazakhstan should 
have for making special efforts to research our Uighur kinsmen 
among the Turkic peoples. In fact, if state finances improve, it 
would be all the more wonderful if we should create research 
institutes for every one of our Turkic-speaking kinsmen. 
However, everyone understands that just now our young republic 
is utterly without resources. For that reason, if there is not 
an Uighur Research Institute but a Turkology Institute under the 
Republic of Kazakhstan National Academy of Sciences, this would 
make it convenient for us to study the languages, history, 
cultures, literatures, art, national political economies, and 
education of Turkey, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Azerbaijan, Karakalpakistan, the Uighurs, Bashqurt, Tartars, and 
the Turkic- speaking countries and fraternal peoples. One thing 
which we cannot forget to mention in this context is one 
"quality" remaining in Kazakhstan, especially among the Kazakh 
people, from our former irresolution and obsequiousness. And 
what is this: "unreasonable trustfulness." For example, when the 
Uighur Research Institute was formed, Uighurs were hired there 
as a matter of course. If a Korean or German research division 
was established, it was filled up with Koreans and Germans 
gathered from here or there. Does not the question arise of 
exactly whom one wants to study when one establishes Uighur 
research and nationality research departments? One should not 
say, when establishing an institute or opening a division , 
"know yourself;" the Uighur people knows itself very well and 
likewise the Korean and the German people. In this connection we 
must know a people, that is, the Uighurs, the Koreans, the 
Germans, or the Kazakh people. For that purpose the research 
workers of that institute must be Kazakhs. Only then will they 
view the people, who are their subjects, from a Kazakh point of 
view and be able to solve urgent questions in the interests of 
Kazakhs. What this means is research in ideological areas 
serving Kazakhstan. 
  However, it is altogether unfortunate that there is no 
research organization specially intended to study our great 
neighbor to the East, the Chinese People's Republic. The 
establishment as soon as possible of a Chinese research 
division, if need be within the Oriental Research Institute of 
the Republic of Kazakhstan National Academy of Sciences, is 
urgently needed for our young republic. This is because China is 
a country with an age- old culture. Today it has many people and 
a great history. It is a powerful country. Study of its history, 
and knowing the composition of its peoples, understanding the 
secret of the quick prosperity of what was only recently a poor 
country, would doubtless teach Kazakhstan many lessons. For our 
republic to have China as a neighbor is certainly no easy thing. 
This widely known nation caresses the feet of Singapore. This 
unsparing country wears the shroud of Vietnam. For that reason, 
it is proper to follow the path of Japan, Korea, and India in 
maintaining neighborly relations with China. These countries are 
like the greatest friends of China, but do not allow a single 
Chinese to live on their soil. As for us? China, which is 
covered by a billion and a half people without discord, is a 
master of rich economic experience. The whole world market is 
heating up, and, today, when the market simply consumes any 
disorganized nation, we see ourselves quietly passing the time 
as a nation combining few people, a lot of land, and such 
riches. But we have no reason to be complacent. Under such 
circumstances, there is not a little we can learn from China 
where the peoples economy is developing rapidly year by year in 
addition to guaranteeing a billion and a half people work and 
food. Is the Chinese People's Republic at present saying that 
"there are no disputes over land with Kazakhstan, no border 
questions?" No it is not. The idea is that the Zhetisu 
[Semiryechye] and Balqash regions of today's Kazakhstan is our 
land. It was stolen from our country at one time by an unequal 
czarist Russian treaty, which is described in school and higher 
education textbooks, and which continues to be instilled into 
the minds of the younger generation. God only knows what cunning 
things the present younger generation, who have been tempered 
with the understanding that "failing to speak of evil is not 
good thing," and who will inherit the nation in the future, will 
do. For that reason, if our leaders do not deal with these kinds 
of gnawing questions now, it is difficult to say that 
Kazakhstan's future will be quiet. Thus we must carry on a 
thorough research about Chinese history, China's historical 
territories, and the historical circumstances whereby the Kazakh 
steppe was divided up by the bayonet. There are in the Chinese 
People's Republic also, in addition to close Kazakh, Uighyr, 
Kyrgyz, Uzbek, and Tatar relatives, our [other] Turkic-speaking 
kinsmen. To advance a more or less open view about the fate of 
Turkistan, where these peoples live, or to take any sudden 
action, could have a negative influence upon the friendship of 
the two countries. From this point of view, it is proper that 
our Uighur kinsmen do nothing extremely disorganized and that 
the Kazakhs keep their mouths shut. This is because China is a 
"dragon" that one should not come in conflict with. For that 
reason, every citizen of Kazakhstan must offer carefully 
considered thought and views or, as it is written, "measure ten 
times, cut once." It is proper that government delegations, 
trade and cultural organizations, tourists, etc. from Kazakhstan 
be completely prudent and alert. We, Kazakhs, must absolutely 
not joke about this or be negligent, and must always be careful 
about what we say. This is because, as a "consequence" of many 
centuries of close interaction with Russia, Uzbekistan, and 
Kyrgyzstan, and, in particular, as a result of 70 years of 
internationalism, we have come to completely understand these 
peoples. And, whatever the connection, the inhabitants of our 
republic know the characteristics, personalities, cultural, 
feelings, and other sides of these peoples like the five fingers 
on their hands. However, our ancestors (from Uisin to 
Abylaykhan) have had no contact with China. We have no 
experience with such relationships. That is to say, our 
relations with China are starting only now. For that reason we 
cannot enter into relations until we know completely the 
national character, qualities, and personal feelings of the 
Chinese people. Only when this is the case, can Kazakhstan and 
China live together as friendly neighbors in peace. However, if 
we do not understand, and if we do not do our research, if we 
close our eyes in Kazakh foolhardiness, if we say "it really 
does not matter," and sign any kind of agreement or decision, 
and are not careful, it will weigh heavy upon the fate of the 
people. This is the problem. Our contemporaries today, thinking 
about the future of the nation, loving their country, are saying 
and writing that "China is on the move." The concerned 
organizations must make a great effort to take preventive 
measures against this sort of thing. However, there is no once 
concerned with the question "in what ways and how is China on 
the march?" Do we remember the friendship visit of Republic 
Premier S. Tereshchenko to the Chinese Peoples Republic during 
the early spring of 1992 and all the "hoopla?" During that trip 
Tereshchenko signed some 10 treaties. To be sure, such great 
comings and goings in the international arena by Kazakhstan, 
friendly relations with such major countries, are something to 
be proud of. However, it is a well-known fact that every other 
step of an inexperienced young country will not be an entirely 
lucky one. Leaving aside the others, we will discuss one of the 
10 treaties. "Economic, trade, and cultural comings and goings 
between the Chinese People's Republic and Kazakhstan will not 
require visas. Visits by individuals for personal reasons will, 
as before, require visas." That is to say, Chinese "delegations" 
coming for trade, for kin, for an excursion, and for other 
reasons do not have to appear one by one before our chief 
ambassador in Beijing, Murat Awyezov. We were shocked to hear 
from one of our Chinese friends on "trade:" The Chinese People's 
Republic is going to send hundreds and thousands of delegations 
to Kazakhstan... Thus, if the Chinese are not on the march in 
Kazakhstan, who is? Why should the Chinese, who even without 
this are overflowing China's boundaries, not appear in 
multitudes taking advantage of favorable "decisions." Is it not 
a matter of "a stray arrow also hits some sad soul." On the 
other hand, our kinsmen in China never get to the Kazakhstan 
Embassy in Beijing. They have difficulty getting a visa to 
travel on personal business to Kazakhstan. One of our kinsmen 
from China said that, when village people come with bribes to go 
to Beijing, their wish is not granted. See how we have harmed 
out kinsmen through that "agreement" draw up to give unlimited 
rights to China! "If leather rains from the skies, the slave 
will still have no shoes," as the old saying goes. To make the 
matter short, Chinese are flooding into Kazakhstan and the 
Kazakhs cannot come. This is something we "did" to ourselves. 
Since the premier has gone and signed a treaty which "created no 
barriers to those coming for trade, tourism, or excursions," if 
we now say "get out!" to Chinese citizens coming on such 
"business," the Chinese government will come and say to us: "Oh 
Kazakhs, if you are going to be a country you have to keep your 
word. If you are not, be ready to fight." Who can blame them? 
This is because, as we have said above, a billion and a half 
people are pressed for space and having a difficult time. For 
that reason, the primary policy of that government carried out 
by Chinese citizens is: "inside China, or without, be it as it 
may, look out for yourself." For that reason, there seems to be 
no limitation placed on China's citizens wishing to go abroad. 
For China knows well that it cannot find, even if it looks 
everywhere in this world, a[nother] country like Kazakhstan 
which is very rich, which has abundant land, few people, and 
little understanding about itself, and which is furthermore a 
neighbor and a careless, trusting young nation. This is because 
several countries where the Chinese had the possibility of entry 
have had other thoughts after the "Singapore Tragedy." For 
example, Germany once and for all halted the coming of Chinese 
three years ago. Leaving aside other things, the nationality of 
Taiwan and Hong Kong is Chinese, but these countries have begun 
to set limits on those coming from the Chinese People's 
Republic. It has been two or three years since America itself, 
the great country on the other side of the world, enacted a 
resolution preventing Chinese from coming. Judging from this, 
only Kazakhstan opens its arms widely to Chinese and creates 
special opportunities for them. If something is not done about 
our China policy, there is no use saying: "we will clean up the 
Chinese problem." The reason is that if one throws out a 
thousand Chinese for a couple of months, a few thousand more 
arrive in a few weeks. Some thoughtful people are grumbling at 
home, but, as long as the "Beijing Treaty" signed by Li Tan and 
Tereshchenko stands, it will simply not be possible to do 
anything about the Chinese stream flooding in. This is the 
result of the treaty, along with the "love" inside Kazakhs for 
the Chinese. Thus, when the market has us by the throat, in a 
difficult time when the high cost of things tugs at our 
garments, can one take into careful consideration the Kazakh who 
bends down when he sees a dollar in the road. It is no secret 
that the Chinese, who are flooding into Kazakhstan as their 
future home, are buying interesting Kazakh things and Kazakh 
women. When you give your daughter in marriage, it is for love. 
That is what it is. This is because, if we are really Kazakhs, 
from where would we get the idea of "feasting sons-in-law who 
are not Muslims?" Now it is impossible to send back the 
Chinese...however one decides to do it. The only way is to 
review the treaty in question. When it has been reviewed, all 
comings and goings between Kazakhstan and China will be by visa. 
If the treaty in question is annulled, licenses will be sold to 
firms exporting to China and this will be made a source of 
income. Thereby the likes of Kazakhstan business people, 
affected by the entry of thousands of Chinese, will be able to 
get on their feet. 
  That is the sum total of it. We have said a great deal, and 
we have said very little. All of this springs from our not 
knowing the Chinese properly. This is because the Chinese are 
not the Russians you know, who say "thanks brother" in their 
happiness at a five kopek profit. These are not our Uzbek elder 
brothers who set out with their right hands in the robes. They 
are also not our Kirghiz kinsmen who come wandering about and 
who come when we want them and return, saying "Oh Kazakhs, may 
it be so!" The Chinese are a people who do not let others know 
their secrets easily, who are particularly cunning, falsely 
polite, completely vindictive, sullen in character, and who are 
venturesome, carefully fulfilling plans set for the centuries. 
China is a great country to our east. It is not easy to be a 
true neighbor to China. To achieve that, first of all, we need 
to form a special China research institute and have it take part 
in official research in order to obtain correct knowledge and a 
clear view about China. Even if we call it a "China" research 
institute in the old way, we must make a special effort to 
prevent Chinese from filling up the ranks of that organization. 
  In conclusion, today everything is needed for an independent 
Kazakhstan. Among these things, we particularly need knowledge 
about other countries in the world. For this reason, it would be 
good to form organizations to research the countries very much 
connected with the interests and fate of Kazakhstan. If such 
research organizations prepared information and materials for 
the branches of the government, we would avoid the type of 
hastiness described above. For that reason, my brothers, we must 
love our hard-won independence with the sincere love of our 
hearts and learn how to defend it to the utmost of our abilities.

<F P=106> [Article: "Iran Becoming One of Kazakhstan's Biggest </F>
Business Partners"] 
  [Text] President of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, on an official 
visit to Kazakhstan, was given a send-off at the Almaty Airport 
in the morning of 26 October. 
  An honor guard was formed at the runway. The national 
anthems 
of Iran and Kazakhstan were played. Presidents Ali Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani and Nursultan Nazarbayev inspected the honor 
guard. The VIP said his farewells to officials seeing him off. 
  After the honor guard passed in review Nursultan Nazarbayev 
bade a warm and heartfelt farewell to the Iranian leader at the 
airplane ladder, and wished him a safe journey. 
  The head of Kazakhstan said at a subsequent press conference 
improvised then and there that he was fully satisfied with the 
results of talks with the Iranian president, and with the 
agreements they reached, primarily in the economic sphere. There 
is good potential for increasing diverse business ties between 
the two countries, which can now be utilized highly productively 
owing to the extensive transportation system currently being 
established, including rail, motor, air and sea lines of 
communication. In the future, Nursultan Nazarbayev emphasized, 
Iran may become one of the biggest importers of Kazakhstan's 
agricultural products; the exchange of goods is growing in many 
other directions as well. 
  Because of bad weather in Karaganda Oblast, which the 
Iranian 
president had intended to visit, his itinerary was revised. Ali 
Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani stopped in Aktau, where he inspected 
the seaport and acquainted himself with the possibilities of its 
expansion and reconstruction through the efforts of the two 
countries. An infrastructure that will make possible the 
shipment of a large quantity of oil, grain, livestock products, 
industrial goods and equipment by sea across the Caspian between 
Kazakhstan and Iran is to be created here. The guest also 
visited other facilities of the oblast center. 
  He was accompanied on a tour of the city by Minister of 
Power 
and Fuel Resources Kadyr Baykenov, the co-chairman of an 
intergovernment joint Kazakh-Iranian commission on commercial, 
economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation; by 
Myrzatay Zholdasbekov, our republic's ambassador to Iran; and by 
Fedor Novikov, the head of Mangistau Oblast's administration. 
  The Iranian president took off for Baku from Aktau. 
  His first visit to Kazakhstan, which was made at the 
invitation of Nursultan Nazarbayev, occurred in a spirit of 
mutual trust and good will, and it is seen on the whole as 
having been productive for both sides. Nine documents were 
signed on the basis of the results of the talks, including a 
protocol on mutual deliveries of goods in 1993-1994. Thus 
relations between Kazakhstan and Iran are now regulated by 
almost 25 different agreements, which create a strong foundation 
for growth of diverse cooperation. 
  Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani invited Nursultan Nazarbayev to 
make an official visit to Iran at any time convenient to him. 
The invitation was gratefully accepted.

<F P=106> [Article by Col Kim Serikbayev, Cand Mil Sci: "Reform in the </F>
Army: The First Stage Nears Completion"] 
  [Text] As we know the reform of the republic's armed forces 
is proceeding in three stages, each of which is planned to last 
1.5-2 years. Its first stage is nearing completion. Have we been 
able to accomplish what we planned, and what kind of changes are 
happening in the army? It was to these pressing questions that 
an article by L. Bakayev titled "The Kind of Army We Need" in 
this year's 25 August edition of KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA was 
devoted. It illuminated a number of issues rather objectively, 
but I believe that there were some inaccuracies in conclusions 
pertaining to military doctrine. 
  Having had the opportunity to participate both in the 
development of military doctrine and other legal documents and 
in implementing them in the interests of creating the republic's 
own armed forces, I would like to share some of my ideas. 
  L. Bakayev writes that there are three contradictory 
principles in Kazakhstan's military doctrine. Leonid 
Nikolayevich sees the first contradiction in the presence of a 
theater of military operations (TMO) and the possible appearance 
of centers of military tension on one hand, and the assertion 
that there is no adversary on the other. What can I say? The 
obsolete notion that if you have an army, you must have an 
adversary as well, is firmly entrenched in our consciousness, 
especially among the military. But the situation of recent years 
has necessitated new approaches and new conclusions. 
  Coexistence of states in the present stage is unique in that 
the old division of all countries and coalitions into enemies 
and allies has, from our point of view (that of the author's 
collective that wrote the doctrine), become unsuitable. 
Therefore Kazakhstan does not feel any country of the world to 
be its adversary, and it makes neither territorial nor any other 
claims upon them. This is what is new in the foreign political 
activity of our young sovereign state, as expressed in its 
military doctrine. It is an objective fact that Kazakhstan is 
located at the junction of three theaters of military 
operations--European, Near Eastern, Far Eastern. Naturally in 
the event of a military conflict in any of these TMOs, a threat 
of Kazakhstan's involvement in a war against its will may arise. 
But does this really conflict with our belief that no country of 
the world is our adversary? 
  The second contradiction L. N. Bakayev sees is that "despite 
the presence of legislative acts prohibiting the use of Kazakhs 
in military contingents outside the state and participation of 
Kazakh servicemen in 'hot spots,' adherence to collective 
security is proclaimed." However, significant changes have 
occurred since publication of the Supreme Soviet's decree 
prohibiting the transfer of Kazakhs to other regions. A number 
of agreements and a treaty on collective security have been 
signed by the heads of Commonwealth states. This was preceded by 
consultations and meeting within the system of representative, 
legislative and executive power of the CIS. Consequently the 
military doctrine was approved in December 1992 and servicemen 
were sent to defend Tajikistan's borders in June 1993 by a joint 
decision of the Supreme Soviet and the republic's government. 
This is evidence that the Supreme Soviet, the sole supreme 
legislative body of the republic, does not consider its 
decisions, once adopted, to be dogma, and that the corresponding 
changes may be made in support of the interests of both national 
and collective security. 
  And finally, if we consider that the main objective of 
collective security is to adopt effective measures by which to 
prevent any kind of conflict, primarily through political and 
diplomatic resources, then it becomes obvious that there are no 
contradictions of any kind in this case either. 
  "Third," L. Bakayev writes, "it is proclaimed that nuclear 
weapons will not be used, even though Kazakhstan does not have 
its own nuclear forces, it does not possess the right to control 
them, and there are none located within the state." These 
arguments do appear justified at first glance. However, once 
again the advent of new legal documents determining both the 
right of ownership and the agreement on joint development of a 
unified nuclear policy are not accounted for. 
  Presence of a an interlocking system in the hands of the 
leaders of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine allows them to 
participate in the control of nuclear weapons on one hand, and 
blocks the possibility for the president of Russia to 
single-handedly decide to press the nuclear button on the other. 
Under these conditions Kazakhstan's clear position, which is 
spelled out precisely in its doctrine, was met with the approval 
of the world community. 
  Now about military personnel and military science. We have 
an 
extremely urgent need, writes L. Bakayev, "to undertake decisive 
practical steps" to train personnel. The main directions of 
solving this problem were spelled out back in April of last year 
at a conference with the president, and he approved them. 
  We can now summarize some of the results. Some of the 
officers that had been discharged into the reserves have been 
returned to regular ranks, graduates of civilian VUZes who are 
also reserve officers have been called up into the army, and 
Kazakh officers serving in other regions are returning. The 
border and fire engineering schools were reorganized for the 
training of specialists with a higher education, and the Almaty 
Higher Combined Arms Command School was transformed for 
multiprofile training. 
  A five-year agreement was signed with the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Defense for the training of specialists in Russian 
military VUZes. Several graduates of military schools are 
studying in Turkey. There are plans for sending representatives 
of the republic to other states for training. However, these 
measures are not enough to completely solve the personnel 
problem. It is especially difficult to predict the future, after 
the term of the agreement with Russia, mentioned above, expires. 
It would probably be pertinent here to recall the old saying 
"Put your hope in God, but don't make any mistakes yourself." 
  One promising way of eliminating the shortage of national 
military personnel is to train them in military boarding 
schools. There are three such schools in the republic--in 
Almaty, Karaganda and Shymkent. They were opened in 1983, and 
they are still on the balance sheet of the Ministry of 
Education, even though the personnel are trained primarily for 
the Ministry of Defense. These schools need serious and urgent 
assistance. Experience tells us that we need to transfer them to 
the subordination of the Ministry of Defense. 
  A proposal by some veterans who recommend establishing 
junior 
lieutenant training courses in Leninsk, Kurchatov, Priozersk and 
other cities deserves attention. As far as opening our own 
military academy is concerned, as I see it this is still an 
unreachable objective for us. But when it comes to forming 
military faculties under the military departments of civilian 
VUZes and at the Aktyubinsk Civil Aviation School, this is 
something we need to think about. 
  L. N. Bakayev is absolutely correct when he proposes that we 
develop Kazakh military science, upon which the entire personnel 
training system is based. But the first thing we need to do is 
create the science. I feel that it has become urgently necessary 
to establish a special administration of VUZes, military science 
and nonmilitary training in the Ministry of Defense that could 
forecast and develop the concept of personnel training, and 
develop an extensive program of establishing and furthering 
military science. 
  Now about the ways of solving the army's crisis. The facts 
L. 
Bakayev offers as evidence of the crisis do actually exist in 
the army. But I cannot agree with the opinion that "this crisis 
is one not of the soldiering masses but of their command": This 
can lead to the wrong decisions. 
  Analysis shows that "dedovshchina" became widespread in the 
army in the early 1960s, when persons serving terms for criminal 
acts were called up into the army. As for "zemlyachestvo," its 
development is associated with events of recent years. Higher 
political organs that became absorbed with administration by 
injunction, window-dressing and demagoguery lost sight of the 
problems of education. All of this promoted transformation of 
"dedovshchina" and "zemlyachestvo" into an ugly, abnormal army 
tradition, and led to the revelry of violence and brutality and 
the army's demoralization. Termination of military-patriotic 
work and the repeal of all forms of conscript training also 
contributed to the fall in the prestige of military service. 
  It is absolutely clear that criticism alone isn't going to 
solve anything. In our opinion the vacuum in educational work 
could be filled by establishing a new institution in the 
republic's armed forces. The president supported the initiative 
for its establishment by his edict of 18 January of this year, 
which introduced the institution of deputies for educational, 
social and legal work into the armed forces, from the defense 
ministry level down to company commanders and persons equal to 
them. 
  As the president noted in the report he gave at the 
republic's ideological conference, we need to develop our own 
state concept, one which must be based on instilling Kazakh 
patriotism. The president's directives obligate commanders and 
leaders of educational institutions to clearly determine the 
forms and methods of such education. Consequently the problem 
will not be solved without a deeply thought-out concept and a 
detailed plan. 
  The success of any reform depends not only on the 
preparedness of the personnel but also on proper statement of 
personnel policy. Authoritarianism and protectionism, which are 
abnormal phenomena in personnel policy, must give way to 
collective decision making and objectivity in deciding the fate 
of every officer. Analysis of military history shows that as a 
rule, when a commander is ungifted, this has a sharply negative 
effect on troop combat training in peacetime, while in wartime 
it leads to unjustifiable death of people, and defeat. You can't 
hide mediocrity with an officer's trouser stripes and sheepskin 
hat. 
  The adoption of the legal documents only created the 
foundation for the reform. Figuratively speaking, the present 
stage of the army's development may be likened to Kazakh yurt 
with only its wooden frame assembled. 
  Reform in the army is a process that includes numerous 
aspects that fall outside the scope of this article. Its 
implementation requires serious work and a long time. I believe 
that participation of competent persons directly or through the 
mass media in the reform could help to hasten it. Perhaps the 
time has come to organize and conduct a scientific-practical 
conference, to which a wide range of interested persons could be 
invited. As our laws stipulate, security and defense are the 
business of all the people.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Environmental Conditions in Kazakhstan, Facts </F>
From the Press Bulletin Issued in the Third Quarter"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Condition of the Atmosphere </H5>
  During this quarter it was observed that the atmosphere was 
polluted in Leninogorsk City in particular. This was connected 
with pollution by nonferrous metal industries and the occurrence 
of climatic conditions unfavorable for the dispersal of the 
city's air mass. 
  Dust: there was a great deal of dust in the air in Aqtaw 
City 
in particular. It was four times greater than permitted levels. 
At the same time, the amount of airborne dust was three times 
above permitted levels in the cities of Zyryan and Shymkent. In 
comparison to the third quarter of last year, there was no 
appreciable change during the third quarter of this year in 
conditions in these cities other than the accumulation of a 
great deal of dust in Aqtaw City. The administration of Aqtaw 
City is devoting attention to these facts and will carry out 
measures to prevent dust from spreading in the city. 
  Sulfur dioxide: This harmful substance is above permitted 
levels in Leninogorsk City (2.5 times), Oskemen City (two times) 
and Balqash City (1.5 times). By comparison with the third 
quarter of last year, it has been observed that sulfur dioxide 
has decreased in the air of Leninogorsk City. There have no 
appreciable changes in the other cities. 
  Carbon dioxide: in as much as it has accumulated at moderate 
levels, this harmful substance is not above permitted levels in 
Kazakhstan cities. It is at permitted levels in Petropavlovsk, 
Semey, and Oskemen cities where concentrations are greatest. By 
comparison with the third quarter of last year, heavy 
concentrations were observed in Semey City. There were no 
changes in the other cities. 
  Nitrogen dioxide: in half of the cities tested, levels of 
concentration were equal or less than permitted levels. The 
areas where concentrations were greatest were Oskemen City (1.8 
times above permitted levels), Almaty City, and Aktobe City 
(both 1.5 times greater). By comparison with the third quarter 
of 1992, the level of air pollution by nitrogen dioxide had 
increased in Oskemen but decreased in Pavlodar. The other cities 
remained unchanged. 
  Nitrogen oxide: Levels of this dangerous substance were 
noted 
in 10 Kazakh cities. On the average, levels of concentration 
were not above permitted levels. It was most concentrated in 
Oskemen City and levels there were about 70 percent of permitted 
levels. By comparison with the third quarter of last year, 
nitrogen oxide concentrations increased in Almaty, but decreased 
in Zhambyl. Quantities in other cities remained unchanged. 
  Phenol: this harmful substances was also observed in 10 
Kazakhstan cities. In Leninogorsk City it was four times above 
permitted levels, and three times in Temirtaw. Average amounts 
accumulating in Oskemen, Almaty, Zyryan, Qaraghandy, 
Petropavlovsk, and Semey were one-two times above permitted 
levels although concentrations in Pavlodar were at permitted 
levels. By comparison with the third quarter of 1992, phenol 
concentration levels had risen in Oskemen, Semey, and 
Qaraghandy, but there were no appreciable changes in other 
cities. 
  Formaldehyde: it was found in the air of nine cities. It was 
determined that in Zhezqazghan, Leninogorsk, and Almaty 
concentrations were six times above norms (permitted levels). 
Concentrations in Qaraghandy, Aqtobe, Zyryan, Oskemen, and 
Shymkent were four-five times above norms. In Petropavlovsk 
concentrations were twice norms. By comparison to the third 
quarter of last year, formaldehyde concentrations increased in 
Almaty, Zhezqazghan, Qaraghandy, and Oskemen and decreased in 
Zyryan and Leninogorsk. 
  Ammonia: this was observed in five cities. Shymkent was the 
city with the highest concentration, 3.5 times above norms. 
Aqtaw, Zhambyl, Qostanay, and Temirtaw were more or less at norm 
levels. By comparison to the third quarter of 1992, ammonia 
concentrations increased in Shymkent but decreased in Temirtaw. 
  Hydrogen floride: average concentrations of this substance 
were two times above norms in Aqmola City. Concentrations were 
at permitted levels in Zhambyl and Shymkent. By comparison to 
the third quarter of 1992, concentrations were up in Aqmola 
while concentrations were on the decline in Zhambyl. 
  Arsenic: concentrations in Leninogorsk and Oskemen equaled 
norms. 
  Chlorine: chlorine concentrations were not above permitted 
levels in Pavlodar, Oskemen, and Shymkent. 
  Pollution by airborne metals such as cadmium, nickel, 
copper, 
lead, and zinc was determined in 13 cities. In just Shymkent 
alone, lead concentrations were 1.5 times above norms. By 
comparison with the third quarter of last year, a decrease in 
lead pollution was observed in Balqash and Leninogorsk. 
Quantities of copper, nickel, cadmium and zinc in the air were 
at public health levels in all cities. 
<H5>  Water Pollution Levels </H5>
  Research carried out by units of the Kazakh Bureau of 
Climatic Research have shown that in the third quarter of the 
year water was primarily polluted with nitrogen and nitrates, 
oil products, metals (copper and zinc), and phenol. The quality 
of water in the Zhayyq [Ural], Nura, Ile, and Qaratal basins had 
improved compared to the same period last year. However, water 
pollution had become worse in a few places. The Yelek river in 
the vicinity of Algha City was polluted between the fourth and 
the sixth class; that is, it was considered very polluted. The 
flow of the Sherubay and Nura was polluted between the fourth to 
the fifth class. It was observed that water quality in Lake 
Balqash, in the Yertis Canyon, and in Toranghylyq strait of 
Syrdariya had deteriorated considerably. 
  It was not observed in the third quarter that the waters of 
the Zhayyq, the Syrdariya, Shu, Talas, Ile, Qaratal, Nura, 
Sarysu, Tobyl, and Yesil river basins and Lake Balqash were 
polluted above acceptable levels. 
  Facts regarding the pollution of water in the basin of the 
Yertis River were not presented in the third quarter. Due to 
fuel shortage, an analysis of its water chemistry was made at 
the end of the month but there has been not time to analyze the 
materials. 
<H5>  Radioactivity </H5>
  Radiation near natural sources in Kazakhstan was nine-15 
microcuries per hour, and 20-60 microcuries per hour at places 
where there were major layers on cliffs. Increased radiation was 
observed in Kokshetaw Oblast. There are a number of natural 
sources of Uranium there. 
  Contributing to the increase of radiation in Kazakhstan were 
the effects of nuclear tests carried out in Kazakhstan, the 
industrial activities, the Selebe and Chernobyl disasters, and 
the Lobnur Testing Area in China. At the same time radiation was 
connected with precipitation. 
  Since 1949 there were 510 nuclear explosions in Kazakhstan. 
Some 470 were in the Semey Testing Area, eight at Kapustin Yar 
(Ed.: according to other information it has been proved that 
there were 11 tests at Kapustin Yar, that is in the Oral Area), 
one in Aqtobe, 17 in Atyraw (at the Azghyr Testing Area), 17 in 
Aqmola, seven in Western Kazakhstan Oblast (Ed.: one may add in 
the above eight), three in Mangghystaw, three in Shymkent, one 
in Qostanay. The combined power of these explosions, that is 
radioactivity, was 12.9 million curies. Most of this was 
concentrated in the center (epicenter) of the explosions. We are 
currently researching the effects of this radioactivity on the 
environment. 
  It is possible that the technical activities of various 
industries spread radioactive pollution into the environment as 
well. For example, judging from preliminary information, uranium 
production and processing industries have accumulated 419 
million tons (252,000 curies) of radioactive waste. There are 
1.6 million tons (500 curies) in mining industries not producing 
uranium. It is estimated that there are 11.4 thousand units 
(32.6 thousand curies) in industries utilizing products produced 
by the "Izotop" Production Union and 12.3 million tons (12000 
thousand curies) of waste products at energy and experimental 
reactors. Based upon preliminary data, the total amount of 
radioactive waste is 233 million tons with a total radioactivity 
of 13 million curies. 
  Leaving aside nuclear explosions on the surface and in the 
air, highly radioactive substances producing 0.03-700 roentgens 
per hour have been lost and have remained unknown. It is well 
known that such sources were found in 1990 in Almaty and 
Qzylorda. They were found in 1991 at Almaty and in Kokshetaw, 
and in 1992 in Mangghystaw, at the "Ozenmunay" fence (not one 
group but four). Similar radioactive materials have been stolen 
from an oil plant in Atyraw Oblast. There has been observed 
contamination from radioactive sources due to the disintegration 
of storage containers at the Belogor Combine, at the Qaraghandy 
Metallurgical Combine, at the Mangghystaw Expedition. The fact 
that industrial radioactive substances used by oil producing 
plants have been turned over to the people, and that we have 
lost control over them, is extremely dangerous. Such pipes and 
hoses have been used at the "Khimik" and "Qurylysshy" companies 
in Mangghystaw Oblast, at the 58th Mobile Column of the Northern 
Kazakhstan Oblast Water Administration, and by garden crop 
producers in the area of Oskemen City. At the same time, it is 
well known that radioactive equipment was used on 40 occasions 
at the Zhanga Ozen fields, and on 21 occasions at the Zhetibay 
fields. The Republic of Kazakhstan chief procurator is looking 
into the fact that radioactive pipes were given to Taldyqorghan 
Oblast in 1992. 
  Dear reader! If you read this, you must be careful about 
receiving and using whatever you receive, from wherever it comes. 
<H5>  Now What About Our Food and Drink? </H5>
  State sanitary control organs in our republic have continued 
to test specially certified products (i.e., products having 
special permission) to prevent the spread of pesticides and 
nitrates into the environment and likewise to prevent harm to 
human health. Official services are carrying out an internal 
control (veterinarial, in the markets, botanical protection and 
planning-research stations in the fields). 
  Looking at some facts: contamination of food products with 
pesticides during the third quarter of 1993 increased somewhat 
(0.9 percent) over the same period last year. Pesticide residues 
were above republic averages in Kokshetaw and Taldyqorghan 
oblasts (respectively 5.4 and 4.6 percent). Pesticide residues 
have increased in milk products. It is alarming that harmful 
substances in milk products brought to factories in Almaty City 
from Almaty Oblast have not decreased. 
  Pollution of plant agricultural products prepared as food 
has 
remained unchanged. The figure was 3.2 percent for the third 
quarter of this year for the entire republic (compared to 3.1 
percent for the third quarter last year). This indicator is 
higher than the republic average in Northern Kazakhstan Oblast, 
10.5 percent, in Qyzylorda, 9.4 percent, in Eastern Kazakhstan 
Oblast, 8.2 percent, and in Aqtobe Oblast, 5.6 percent. Nitrates 
were especially noticeable in Zhambyl, Aqtobe, Eastern 
Kazakhstan, Northern Kazakhstan, Qaraghandy, and Kokshetaw 
Oblasts. 
<H5>  Some Measures To Protect the Environment </H5>
  Harmful substances issued into the air are decreasing 
primarily due to the decline of industrial production. On the 
other hand, they are increasing in Zhezqazghan, Pavlodar, and 
Almaty Oblasts. Since, during the nine months of the present 
year, the "Balqashmys" Production Union and the 
"Zhezqazghantustimetall" Corporation produced 83.2 thousand 
tonnes of pollution above what was allowed, the chief state 
inspector of the Republic made the decision to stop work at 
"Balqashmys" from 1 July. Only since then have the interested 
parties devoted attention to the problem of the processing of 
sulfur anhydrides and halting the production of pollution above 
norms. A fine of 3 billion rubles has been levied on the 
industry and 1.8 billion rubles has been paid. A complaint has 
been made to the government and to the Republic procurator's 
office. 
  The Shymkent lead plant has violated laws on the protection 
of the atmosphere. (As a result sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid 
vapor have increased excessively in the small Qazyghurt Rayon of 
Shymkent City.) The responsible workers have been punished and a 
fine has been imposed on them. The fact that the public raised 
the alarm allowed measures to be taken against the "Silikat" 
Corporation in Semey City. Since rubber was used to heat bitumen 
in the residential rayons of Oskemen City (when roofs were being 
tarred), the quality of the rayon worsened considerably. This 
method was prohibited at the request of the oblast environmental 
administration. 
  We note that in the process of testing measures were taken 
to 
reduce the issuing of harmful substances into the air at the 
Pavlodar Reinforced Concrete Plant, at Almaty Healing Center No 
1, at the Qaraghandy Metallurgical Combine, etc. 
  However, planned measures and the demands of inspectors were 
not always carried out. Work was ordered stopped at the 
Leninogor Polymetal Corporation on 21 September due to violation 
of environmental laws but this order was not carried out. The 
affair is now being prepared for prosecution by the procurator's 
office. 
  Land is being ruined, polluted, and mineralized in our 
republic. The Shalqar Agricultural Union in Aqmola Oblast has 
dumped trash wherever it wants. The "Aqtobemunay" Union has 
dumped residual fuel at drilling sites. The Qostanay 
Administration for Mechanized Work has obtained soil without 
permission; industrial wastes have been dumped on fertile land 
in Bozvyshen Rayon of Northern Kazakhstan Oblast, etc., etc. 
Fines have been levied as measures against violation of law. 
  Republic cities and urban settlements are still not 
adequately equipped with plumbing. Reservoirs to collect 
drainage water in Oral, Petropavlovsk, Qostanay, Zhambyl, and 
Pavlodar (Bylqyldaq) are overfull. Measures have not been taken 
by the Ministry of Energy and of the Fuel Industry to process 
drainage water at Ekibastuz, and at the Leninogor Thermo-center. 
For these and other deficiencies, the Qaraghandy No 1 Machinery 
Factory, the Taldyqorghan Kazakh-German Union (hide processing) 
Industry and others have been halted. Moreover, the case of the 
chief engineer at the Aqtobe Chrome Fittings Factory has been 
turned over to the procurator's office. 
  There has been no control exercised over the placement of 
wastes in Zhezqazghan, Pavlodar, Qyzylorda, Kokshetaw, Semey, 
and Eastern Kazakhstan Oblasts. 
  On 14 July, 1993, the Cabinet of Ministers issued a 
resolution on "Development of State Resources and National Parks 
in the Republic of Kazakhstan." According to this resolution, 
funds are to be allotted to them and facilitations for workers 
at natural reserves are foreseen. 
  The Ministry for the Environmental and Biological Resources 
has drawn up a "Scheme for the Development and Disposition of 
Republic of Kazakhstan Natural Reserve Resource Projects During 
the Period Up Until the Year 2005" and the scheme has been 
turned over to the Cabinet of Ministers. 
  Chiefs of oblast governments, in collaboration with the 
Ministry of the Environment, have been given until 1 January, 
1994 to produce other organizations out of reserves and national 
parks.

<F P=106> [Article by Dawitali Stambekuly: "The Testing Area Has Been </F>
Closed but the Danger Is Still Present."] 
  [Text] Between 13 and 17 September there took place in the 
region of the Semey Testing Area, more specifically, in 
Kurchatov city that for so many years remained off the map of 
the republic and was surrounded by secret weapons, a scientific 
and technical conference on the theme: "Plans for the 
Development of Nuclear Energy in the Republic of Kazakhstan and 
Its Reliability and Safety." Participating in the conference and 
exchanging views were nuclear energy specialists from the United 
States, Canada, Japan, Russian, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. The 
primary purpose of the conference was to draw up directions for 
the development of nuclear energy in our country under the 
leadership of the Republic National Nuclear Center. What does 
that mean? This means that the former testing area, the 
equipment and reactors used for tests there, will be used for 
peaceful purposes, that is to supply energy to industry and the 
economy. However, there will be nothing easy about this. This 
is something which will be resolved only after a lot of 
discussion. In particular, there is concern about future safety. 
Thus, our reporter shares with us some of his thoughts arising 
from the conference regarding these issues. 
  It cannot be hidden that, towards the end of the 20th 
century 
shortage of energy supplies in all corners of the world are 
cooling the people's economy. It is clear that this crisis is 
giving our country something to think about, along with the 
other Soviet republics which have now achieved their 
independence. 
  This conference taking place in our Republic also discussed 
plans drawn up for the future of energy in our country. Energy, 
in Kazakh terms, light and heat, are certainly sources of life. 
At present it is possible for any thinking citizen of our 
sovereign country not to think about energy? However, if we are 
not to depend on others for the sources of life, are there 
possibilities for us to create them ourselves? 
  Do we need nuclear power plants or do we not need them? We 
need them. If we can develop them in a way not dangerous to our 
lives what is wrong with that? 
  There is a throbbing which has remained behind in the hearts 
of our people. It is the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power 
Plant. No one has yet forgotten it. They cannot forget it. This 
being the case, the most important question is the safety of 
human life. What must we do to achieve this. On this account the 
question must be posed more broadly and more directly. We must 
provide a complete and thorough ecological evaluation of the 
damage to the environment and to the people due to explosions 
and tests in Kazakhstan, and, likewise, in all of the nuclear 
testing areas of the world. Likewise, we must broadly research 
the effects of a nuclear power station on the environment and on 
the people. 
  Together with this, the questions of protection in social 
and 
economic terms of those harmed by explosions in the former 
testing area, of assisting the people in ecological, biomedical 
and psychological terms, of regulating from a legal and 
political standpoint the resolution of very critical 
environmental questions, of creating a mechanism for economic 
security, must assume primary priority. In order to accomplish 
this, we must form an authoritative international commission. 
Without this an uneasy people will make known its alarm at the 
damage, aside from the benefits of a nuclear power station. 
  According to what was said at the conference by the 
scientist-specialists, a nuclear power station built according 
to the work plans of the National Nuclear Center is not 
something that can be completed in the near future. It seems 
that it would take 10-15 years. However, looking very critically 
at preparatory work going on now is something which will be a 
guaranty of the life of the people. This being the case, we must 
not keep the work which has begun out of sight of the people. 
  Indeed, I am not against the objectives for the development 
of the people's industry and enterprise. However, we must not 
forget that nuclear power specialists are subordinates, and we 
must remember that a great deal of secrecy is associated with 
their work. 
  There is another major question which must be discussed 
here. 
That is the danger that Kazakhstan will remain a repository for 
radioactive wastes. This is a problem for Semey Oblast in 
particular. There is no doubt that the former testing area has 
been closed. However, there are still radioactive wastes left 
behind by the explosions. We must not forget that they will 
still present a problem after our time has passed. 
  Burial of these radioactive wastes has now become a major 
issue. Ghadilet Andianuly, director of our Republic's National 
Nuclear Center, in answer to my question, said: "It is right 
that you should be alarmed about this. However, we cannot take 
things which came to life here and bury them in other places. 
Countries will not receive the radioactive wastes of others. 
Bearing this in mind, we must look for the right way, make 
wastes safe and bury them on our own lands. Major measures will 
be needed to achieve this. However, at present we cannot say 
where we will bury these wastes. State permission and a decision 
will be necessary for this. At the same time, the views of local 
people will be heard. 
  On the other hand, the talk of building a nuclear power 
plant 
is something different. It must take place when our Republic is 
suffering economic difficulty. Its importance is very great for 
removing industry and the economy from crisis. A safe nuclear 
power station could have a major influence upon a clean 
environment. The reason is that many thermo-electrical power 
stations in our republic produce massive amounts of dust, smoke, 
and cinders. If we take into consideration that on top of this, 
16 billion tons of wastes from the production and processing of 
valuable resources are collected in the storage areas of 
industrial establishments. All is nothing but poisons. Thus, to 
be free of this a safe electrical station is needed." 
  We listened to the speech of Professor Yoshi Fujie, chief of 
laboratory research for nuclear reactors of the Tokyo Technology 
Institute. According to what Yoshi Fujie said regarding the 
safety of nuclear reactors for humans, there is no nation ahead 
of Japan in this area. For example, while the accident at 
Chernobyl shocked the world, there have also been accidents in 
the United States, Britain, and France. However, there has not, 
up to the present, been a single accident in Japan, which in one 
of the smallest territories in the world has the largest number 
of nuclear energy reactors, 42. It appears that the first 
nuclear power plant was opened [in Japan] during the second half 
of the year 1950. In the future the number of nuclear power 
plants in Japan will reach 55. We thought that we must take our 
example from a country which has so successfully dealt with the 
atom. 
  One interesting thing, is that the dangers of a nuclear 
power 
plant do not frighten the Japanese. The professor proved this 
completely. The reason is that the Japanese seem confidant of 
the knowledge of their nuclear specialists and scientists. When 
we think about this, it becomes apparent that we also need 
scientists and specialists with profound knowledge, who have 
been produced by our people. Whatever we say, we know our own 
souls. This is the reason why we look with less confidence on 
others who come to take advantage of us. 
  In this connection we must speak of the educational 
establishments which are to be opened by the Kazakhstan National 
Nuclear Center. They will prepare future atomic scientists and 
specialists of our own nationality. 
  As for specialist cadres, Fedor Fedorovich Safanov, deputy 
chief scientist for the Semey Testing Area, USSR state prize 
laureate, mentioned, in this connection, that many scientists of 
the former testing area had gone to Russia. When I asked: "what 
will you do now?", the major-general replied: "I will remain in 
Kazakhstan. I will become one of the scientist-specialists of 
the nuclear power plant." 
  This person drew attention to the involvement of the 
National 
Nuclear Center with the area's environment, to questions such as 
turning over the task of investigating the testing area and 
quickly cleaning up the radioactive wastes there, and to 
overcoming the danger when the subterranean riches of the area 
are recovered. In any case these are proper concerns. We will 
have to investigate each of them individually in the future. The 
investigation should begin now. 
  Nuclear energy should inspire not a little fear in human 
beings. In support of this we may mention the accidents at 
nuclear power plants in the United States, Britain, and Ukraine. 
According to official information, nuclear production appears to 
have polluted the surface of the earth at a level of 6 million 
curies. 
  Two and a half thousand of the 60,000 nuclear weapons made 
during the age of nuclear testing have been exploded for test 
purposes. More specifically, it is no secret that almost 1,000 
have been exploded in the United States, and more than 500 in 
the former Soviet Union, most of them in Kazakhstan. Each 
explosion has done irreparable damage to the environment, and to 
the people living in the testing area. Since the closure of the 
Semey testing area, efforts to overcome and clear up the damage 
have gone forward very slowly. The ones responsible have not had 
to explain their guilt before the people. 
  Let us take a quick look at one fact. The United States has 
spent a total of 10 trillion dollars on all types of arms since 
the Second World War. At present, however, up to 200 million 
dollars are appropriated each year to clean up the environment. 
With us there is no money at all for such work. 
  To tell the truth, in our country the ecological rights of 
people are not protected. Due to little oversight, the sources 
of nuclear power and the nuclear industry are continuing to 
increase pollution by radioactivity. First and foremost, the 
ecological rights of citizens must be protected at the state 
level by a special law. 
  "Make no mistake about it. What we are doing is discussing 
now the future of nuclear energy." So said V. Vasilenko, 
chairman of the Council of Experts for Social Ecology of the 
"Nevada-Semey" International Antinuclear Movement. We are on no 
easy path. As we have said, local people must still bear in mind 
one frightening thing. This is the fact that things have not 
been collected from test sites in the testing area. It seems 
that presently the livestock of the people are being pastured in 
these areas. It has been claimed that testing area authorities 
have been forced, because of a lack of funding due to market 
pressures, to leave the area unguarded or otherwise unsecured, 
and that they have no choice but to sit on their hands. But does 
it have to be like this? On 29 August, 1991, our hair stood on 
end when we realized that there was still the danger of an 
explosion prior to Republic of Kazakhstan President Nazarbayev 
issuing an official edict to close the Semey Testing Area. Since 
the Russian and Kazakhstan governments did not quickly made a 
decision about this, the situation remained very difficult. The 
local people were very alarmed at this. In fact, the testing 
area has been closed, but we cannot free ourselves from the 
danger. This being the case, we are thinking of building a 
nuclear power plant in the 21st century. This will prove a 
correct decision. However, when a nuclear power plant remains 
incomplete, how can we clean up the mess in the testing area? 
The thought disturbs us that with one labor remaining incomplete 
and still dangerous, how can we begin a second, new effort?

  [Text] The Uzbeksavdo and Uzbekbrlyashuv state associations 
and the Ministry of Finance have decided to coordinate the new 
levels of contract (free) prices for the main foods sold to the 
public on quotas for the continued progress of economic reform, 
in accordance with Decree No 360 of the Cabinet of Ministers of 
the Republic of Uzbekistan of 16 July 1993 on the gradual 
transition to free prices, with a view to the need to protect 
the domestic consumer market and to stop the attempts to take 
foodstuffs out of the republic illegally. 
  The following average retail prices will go into effect on 1 
December 1993: 
  meat--3,000 rubles per kilogram, 
  milk--200 rubles per liter, 
  vegetable oil--1,000 rubles per kilogram, 
  sugar--1,000 rubles per kilogram, 
  tea--2,000 rubles per kilogram, 
  household soap--100 rubles per bar 
  On 1 December 1993 noodles will be removed from the list of 
quota goods and will be sold to the public at effective current 
prices. 


Retail Price Levels in Some CIS Countries (rubles/kg) 

Cities         Meat       Vegetable oil   Sugar       Tea             Soap (1 
                                                                      bar) 

Almaty         3000       3500            2700        8200            350 

Ashgabad       3600       840             850         4100            300 

Dushanbe       7000       1200            1500        3100            260 

Bishkek        1400       2740            1000        2600            500 

Minsk          2500       4580            1880        3500-9000       400

  It is significant that the new retail prices will not cover 
the increase in actual production costs and the costs of 
purchasing foods in other regions, and the state will have to 
continue allocating large sums to subsidize them. Subsidies for 
December, for example, have been estimated at 9.1 billion rubles 
for meat, 2.1 billion for whole milk, 1.6 billion for tea, and 1 
billion for soap.

<F P=106> [Interview with Samvel Babayan, commander of the armed </F>
forces of Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, by correspondent Maksim 
Hovhannisian] 
  [Excerpts] Samvel Babayan was born in Stepanakert in 1965. 
He is a graduate of the local School No. 7. He served in the 
Soviet army from 1983 through 1985. He has been an active 
participant in the Karabakh movement. He was imprisoned in 1991 
during the Safonov Polyanichko regime. After staying in prison 
for six months he was exchanged with Azerbaijan's deputy chief 
justice who was "kidnaped" by Samvel's comrades headed by his 
brother, Garo. Samvel is one of the organizers of Karabakh's 
first guerrilla squads. During the "Ring" operation his squad 
liberated the Dzamdzor village of the Hadrut region. He then 
participated in the liberation of Khojalu, Kharadakhlu and 
Shushi. Subsequent military operations were planned and 
implemented under his leadership. He is also a deputy in the 
Supreme Council of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR]. He is 
married and has two children. Below is an interview with Samvel 
Babayan, commander of the NKR armed forces, by Maksim 
Hovhannisian, head of the NKR's information and press 
department. The interview was conducted last week just before 
the regrettable incident at Matakhis [involving an attack on the 
Russian envoy] for which the NKR State Defense Committee 
severely criticized the leadership of the defense forces. 
  [Hovhannisian] Let us begin this interview with the most 
important question: Do we or do we not have an army? 
  [Babayan] We do. Despite all of its flaws, today our 
republic 
has a regular army which is able to defend our borders against 
enemy incursions and ensure that people can work in peace. 
Furthermore, if it becomes necessary to strike at the enemy on 
its own territory to ensure the security of the people, our army 
is capable of accomplishing such tasks. 
  [Hovhannisian] How was the idea of creating a regular army 
born? 
  [Babayan] When we liberated Shushi and opened the Lachin 
corridor, we realized that we need to create a regular army in 
order to preserve our military gains over the long run. Many 
agreed with that idea but did not take any concrete steps. At 
this point certain mistakes were made. Then the painful period 
of failures began. First we lost Shahumyan, then most of the 
Martakert region. Many people lost faith in our forces. Despair 
became our greatest enemy. 
  In order to overcome this string of failures it was 
necessary 
to launch a decisive counterstrike against the enemy. That could 
only be done by a well-trained regular army, which we did not 
have. 
  At the beginning it was very difficult. Many of the 
guerrilla 
squads refused to obey general orders, and their forces operated 
in a haphazard manner. It was relatively easy to implement our 
plans in the Askeran region and the results were observed 
quickly. 
  The process of creating an army began to move forward in 
August of last year. Of course, it cannot be said that we have 
solved all the problems associated with the creation of an army. 
However, we have established a barracks regime in the army, 
except that a battle proposal by the general command is not 
considered a battle order. Also, orders are carried out in a 
qualified manner, although not always. That is related to the 
training of the army. Mechanisms of army life are being created 
and perfected with each battle. 
  [Hovhannisian] These days there is much talk in the press 
about the offensive operations of the NKR army. It is said that 
the army has a vested interest in such operations. 
  [Babayan] Yes, some newspapers have written that everyone 
wants peace except the army. That is not true. What the army is 
doing has only two objectives: to ensure the security of the 
population and the inviolability of our state borders and to 
force the enemy to recognize our national rights. All of our 
operations are coordinated with the NKR leadership. Let us take 
the demilitarization of the Kelbajar region. Without that 
operation it would be impossible to return the refugees from 
Martakert to their homes because there was always the danger 
that the enemy could strike from behind. There was a time when 
the panicked residents of Martakert were not only abandoning 
their homes but were also deserting the ranks. Now the situation 
is completely different. Today the borders of that region are 
defended only by the military units of that region. 
  Let us take another example. Why was it necessary to 
demilitarize the city of Agdam? First, it was necessary to stop 
the artillery attacks from Agdam on Askeran and Stepanakert. 
Second, it was necessary to force the enemy to sit at the 
negotiating table. As is known, the first official 
Azeri-Karabakh talks began after the fall of Agdam. However, 
Azerbaijan declined to continue that dialogue at the instigation 
of certain international forces. 
  [Hovhannisian] The world press and international 
organizations hastily condemned the advances of the NKR army. 
Despite those condemnations, we undertook military operations on 
the southern front. How can that be interpreted? Are we thumbing 
our noses at world opinion? Are we confronting international 
forces? Is not our posture defiant? 
  [Babayan] That is how it appears at first glance, but the 
actual state of affairs tells a completely different story. As 
you know, in 1991 the Azeris occupied 24 villages in Hadrut with 
their "Ring" operation. Second, they were shelling Martuni, 
Hadrut, Edillu and other Armenian population centers as well as 
the Lachin corridor continuously from Fizuli and Kubatlu. Third, 
we made it known to them that things will not end with Agdam and 
that they must reckon with the reality that has been created. It 
is these considerations that prompted the launching of military 
operations on the southwestern front. As a result, there were 
Azeri-Karabakh talks in Moscow sponsored by the Russian 
Federation. It is not a secret for anyone that NKR gained 
international recognition as a party to the conflict only after 
our military successes. People recognize might. I repeat: the 
NKR army wants peace, and, in my opinion, we must have a strong 
and battleworthy army so that peace will come quickly. 
  The Azeri side requested several times to extend the 
ceasefire. We agreed, although we know very well that they are 
using that time to regroup their forces. We are similarly 
preparing to greet the enemy appropriately. 
  [Hovhannisian] Let us return to the problems associated with 
the creation of an army. 
  [Babayan] The [NKR army] must be a battleworthy mobile 
entity 
equipped with modern weaponry; it must be ready to strike at the 
enemy at any point in the republic; and it must be able to 
defend our borders on land and in the air. I do not think that 
it is possible for NKR to survive without such an army. 
  [Hovhannisian] That is how it has turned out to be. Perhaps 
one of the peculiarities of the Karabakh movement is that our 
fedayeen [guerrilla] boys have risen to the highest ranks of the 
army. These boys are patriotic, brave and prepared to defend our 
land, but many of them have no military training. Some of them 
have not even served in the [Soviet] army. 
  [Babayan] That was the case at the beginning. Today we have 
in our army hundreds of senior professional officers who have 
received serious training in the Soviet army. As for the fact 
that many of the commanders are yesterday's fedayeen boys, those 
men have learned the art of war on the battlefield and passed 
muster by hard experience. We have young people who are formally 
trained and who want to serve their homeland in the ranks of the 
NKR army. They are the real future of our army. I would like to 
take this opportunity to appeal to all staff officers from 
Karabakh who serve in the armies of Russia and other countries: 
Brothers, return to Karabakh, and let us defend our homeland 
together. 
  [Hovhannisian] What has been the principal accomplishment in 
the creation of the army? 
  [Babayan] Today every soldier in our army takes a 
ceremonious 
oath, and the orders of the commanders are being executed 
without objections at all levels. We also managed to end the 
practice of serving in the army while staying home. Today we are 
strictly maintaining a barracks regime in our military. 
  I also consider an important accomplishment the creation of 
quite normal, technically satisfactory bases for different 
domains of military service. For example, we take pride in our 
tank repair facility where everything has been built on solid 
foundations. 
  Until recently our barracks were housed in buildings 
formerly 
occupied by schools and kindergartens. We have now built, with 
our own resources, barracks with basic facilities, training 
centers for different military units with their own firing 
ranges and other facilities. 
  [Hovhannisian] Doubts have been expressed in the foreign 
press that little Karabakh does not have the economic means to 
acquire such quantities of military equipment and that Armenia 
is helping us. 
  [Babayan] The first part of that statement is true. It is 
true that economically we are not that strong, especially in 
conditions of a blockade, to acquire as many weapons and as much 
ammunition as we have in our hands today. However, they are 
wrong about the sources of such acquisitions. We have captured 
80 percent, if not more, of our military means from the enemy. 
Various anectodes circulate among our soldiers about this 
subject. 
  [Hovhannisian] For example, about one-time-use aircraft and 
tanks provided to us by Ukraine and Turkey through Azerbaijan. 
  [Babayan] As for the question of what is our military 
leadership focusing its attention on at this time, we believe 
that, having been defeated on land, the enemy will try to attack 
by air. Now we are working in that direction, with some success.

  [Text] Yesterday President Levon Ter Petrosian signed a 
decree releasing Norat Ter Grigoriants, first deputy minister of 
defense and chief of the general staff, from his 
responsibilities at his request and appointing Lt Gen Hrach 
Hmayaki Andreasian to replace him. Circles close to the 
president's staff maintained that this replacement does not 
imply any changes in military policy. The same sources also 
indicated that Norat Ter Grigoriants has not yet been offered a 
new position.

<F P=106> [Article by Armen Baghdasarian: "Is the Railway Explosion </F>
First of a New Series?"] 
  [Text] As is known, the rail line entering Armenia was 
blown up in the Azeri-populated Marneuli region of Georgia early 
in the morning of 18 November. While Russian mass media reported 
that a 27-meter segment of the rail line was blown up, Armenian 
sources reported a 100-meter segment destroyed. It would not be 
correct to say that the explosion was unexpected, because it is 
easy to see that with the onset of the cold the gas pipeline and 
the railway entering Armenia from Georgia should become the 
favorite target of Azeri diversionists, given that the problem 
of guarding these lines of vital importance to the republic has 
not been solved. 
  On 18 November, the Armenian foreign ministry issued a 
statement in connection with the explosion saying: "This 
terrorist diversion operation was planned and executed by the 
authorities of the Republic of Azerbaijan. This criminal act 
against the Armenian Republic and its people, a new 
manifestation of the policy of state terrorism endorsed by 
Azerbaijan, is an attempt by the warmongering circles of that 
state to bring the Armenian nation to its knees and to force the 
Armenian authorities to abandon the principle of finding a just 
and civilized solution to the Karabakh problem by methods that 
are categorically rejected by the international community. 
Azerbaijan has once again confirmed that political elements who 
are bent on solving the current conflict by the force of arms 
still enjoy strong influence in governing circles." In this 
particular instance the railway was repaired relatively quickly, 
and train traffic from Georgia into Armenia has resumed. 
However, nobody would be especially surprised if the explosions 
continue. While the explosions had two targets last year, the 
gas and the railway line, this year they have a third target: 
the Caucasian electrical power transmission line through which 
the Sakenergo administration is obligated to supply Armenia with 
electricity from Russia at the rate of 100 megawatts. 
  It is nice to have trust, but it would not be bad if there 
were more substantial guarantees on issues that are of vital 
importance. Experience shows that such guarantees can only be 
had with the military control of communication routes. Once 
again we have to broach this issue because, despite various 
agreements, the gas pipeline and the rail line are generally not 
protected. Meanwhile, the situation in the republic is much 
worse than what it was last year despite the assurances given by 
the authorities. It turns out that the constantly-heard phrase 
"this is our last winter" also depends on the good will of our 
neighbors. Of course the Armenian gas repairmen have already 
rushed to the scene of the explosion. Of course, the prime 
ministers of Armenia and Georgia are having serious talks and 
will eventually remember the age-old friendship between our 
nations. However, those do not change anything and are not 
likely to change anything ever. 
  The situation in the Azeri-populated eastern regions of 
Georgia is extremely tense, and the explosion of the railway 
line is an excellent opportunity to send [Georgian] military 
forces to protect that segment of the railway. Armenian units 
could join those forces thus reducing Georgia's burden 
significantly. After all it is not that hard to protect a 
40-kilometer railway segment, and as they say: "If the mountain 
will not come to Mohammed... [Mohammed has to go to the 
mountain]."

  [Text] Two years ago the special republic boarding school 
named after Field Marshal Hamazasp Babajanian, a former 
commander of armored and tank forces, was converted into a 
boarding school for military training by the decision of the 
Armenian government. On October 18, the school will hold a 
ceremony whereby 100 students who have passed their examinations 
will take their oath to serve their homeland selflessly. Vrezh 
Hovhannisian, the commandant of the [school] battalion, told the 
correspondent of NOYYAN TAPAN: "The students at the school have 
their own special military uniform. They specialize in military 
science and physical education. The young men are trained in 
judo, hand-to-hand combat, mountain climbing, swimming, light 
athletics and skiing. The specialization subjects are taught by 
officers and athletics instructors. Special attention is paid to 
the teaching of English and Russian. In the future it is planned 
to teach the languages of countries neighboring Armenia. The 
school admits those 14 to 16-year-old young men who possess the 
appropriate physical and mental capabilities." The director of 
the school has visited a U.S. military base where he observed 
first-hand the methods of training American professional 
soldiers. According to the commandant, some of the school's 
graduates have entered the school of the Karabakh liberation 
struggle and participated in numerous tough battles. The school 
has also signed agreements with Russian military training 
institutions, whereby the graduates of the school are able to 
continue their education at those institutions. The Armenian 
Ministry of Defense will pay for the expenses of such continued 
training.

<F P=106> [Interview with I. Isahakian, governor of the Bank of </F>
Armenia; date and place not specified] 
  [Excerpts] 
  [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Mr Isahakian, could you first say 
a 
few words about the situation preceding the decision of the 
State Commission on Money Circulation and the organizational 
measures that the central bank undertook? 
  [Isahakian] In earlier statements I mentioned a few times 
that, based on all classical examples and the experience of 
other nations, before putting a new national currency into 
circulation it is necessary to have an intermediate means of 
payment which will take upon itself the full weight of 
inflation. During that period, the government, the central bank 
and the entire public must take steps to prevent the decline of 
the economy and to stabilize it. Only after that can genuine 
monetary reform take place. 
  However, in recent weeks events unfolded very rapidly, as 
the 
president of the republic noted with justification. We were 
forced to replace the 1991-1992 issue 1,000, 5,000 and 
10,000-ruble notes with dram bills. Thus we were unable to 
implement the classical method--we could not have done it. I 
must say that we had only 1 to 1 and 1/2 weeks for 
organizational and preparatory work. During that time, the State 
Commission on Money Circulation and the working group associated 
with it performed important work. [passage omitted] 
  [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Mr Isahakian, although the 
Commission's decision is quite clearly drafted, some issues need 
to be made more comprehensible to our people. For example, if a 
citizen buys something and pays 10 dram, should that be 
interpreted as 10 dram or 2,000 rubles? 
  [Isahakian] It should be interpreted as 2,000 rubles. For 
example, if a citizen buys something that is worth 100 rubles 
and pays with a 10-dram bill, then the seller must return 1,900 
rubles. Similarly 25 dram is equivalent to 5,000 rubles, 50 dram 
to 10,000 rubles, 100 dram to 20,000 rubles, 200 dram to 40,000 
rubles and 500 dram to 100,000 rubles. 
  [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Will not the concurrent 
circulation 
of 1, 3, 5, 25, 100, 200 and 500-ruble bills with the Armenian 
notes create a certain confusion? 
  [Isahakian] Of course, there will be certain difficulties at 
the beginning. However, both the buyers and the sellers must be 
very careful. I think that they will get accustomed fairly 
quickly. This issue is also of immediate concern to the 
directors and accountants of enterprises and corporations. I 
must say that nothing has changed. If they had, say, 100,000 
rubles on their books, that should be counted the same way as 
before. In the future, when we make a full transition to a 
national currency and introduce notes and coins with lower 
denominations and in luma [presumably a subdivision of dram], 
then all accounting can be done in terms of dram. For the 
moment, ruble notes in lower denominations will perform the 
function of the notes I mentioned. 
  [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] This means that this is the first 
stage of a full transition to a national currency. 
  [Isahakian] Yes, it is an intermediate stage. We will have 
entered the final stage when we introduce notes with lower 
denominations and coins. At this time we are embarking on a new 
era in the life of our republic. The government and the central 
bank must take all necessary steps to ensure the stability of 
our currency and to raise its exchange value. That is not 
dependent on the currency's name or looks. That depends on our 
economic base and productivity of our economy. We are all 
committed to strengthen the dram. That means encouraging 
exports, the production of goods that consumers demand and 
making imports manageable. It is also important that we cut the 
budget deficit by correct financial policies and that we build 
hard-currency reserves. Thus our financial situation and the 
stability of our currency depends on us. 
  [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Here is another issue that needs 
to 
be explained to the people: according to the Commission's 
decision, sums of more than 50,000 rubles will be deposited in a 
savings bank for six months with an interest rate of 48 percent 
per annum. Based on the experience of past years, the people are 
a little worried. To what extent is the repayment of those funds 
guaranteed? Can the people be certain that they will not lose 
their money? 
  [Isahakian] The people can rest assured that their deposits 
will be returned. I believe that the people trust the savings 
banks because the indexation of funds deposited in August has 
already inspired some confidence. Confidence in the savings 
banks increased especially among rural people who received their 
payment for their produce from the savings banks without any 
problems this year. If we could pay those sums in conditions of 
dependence on the Bank of Russia, we can be more certain making 
those payments on time now. 
  [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Can the people use those deposits 
to pay, for example, for certain services in noncash form? 
  [Isahakian] We are thinking about that issue. After 27 
November, when we will know how much money was changed and how 
much money was deposited, those issues will be examined and 
somehow resolved. 
  [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Now a technical question: Can 
those 
citizens of the republic who have not had the time to obtain an 
identity card or who have lost theirs exchange their rubles for 
dram? How about those who are away from the republic on business 
or who are away from their homes in hospitals or sanatoriums? 
  [Isahakian] First, if a person does not have an identity 
card 
he or she cannot exchange his or her money. This does not apply 
to military servicemen. 
  Those individuals who are outside the republic because of 
their work can apply to the appropriate exchange boards provided 
that they have the necessary documents. As for those citizens 
who are in hospitals or sanatoriums or away from their permanent 
homes in other parts of the republic, if they do not return to 
their permanent homes by the expiration of the deadline for 
exchanging their money, they can exchange their money by 
presenting their identity documents to the post office or 
savings bank at their location. The procedure is the same. The 
exchange is done only once and their identity documents are 
stamped as appropriate. 
  [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Would you like to say anything 
else 
to the people? 
  [Isahakian] Based on the experience of exchanging 50 and 
100-ruble notes in 1991, I would like to ask the people to be 
very careful, to remember where they have kept their ruble 
notes--excuse the expression, under pillows or inside cracks in 
walls (although I do not think that in conditions of rapid 
devaluation anybody would have kept large sums)--so that 
complications do not arise in the future. I would also like to 
remind them that there will be only one exchange and one chance 
to open a deposit account.

<F P=106> [Interview with Karen Nersisian, head of the finance and </F>
credit department of the Council of Ministers of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, by HAYLUR correspondent Shushanik 
Abrahamian; date and place not specified] 
  [Text] The Armenians of Artsakh face the reality of 
changing their currency. Doubts about whether we will remain in 
the Russian ruble zone or whether we will adopt the Armenian 
dram have been finally settled. The Council of Ministers decided 
to put the Armenian dram into circulation in Stepanakert. 
  Karen Nersisian, head of the finance and credit department 
of 
the council of ministers of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, 
answered the question of HAYLUR correspondent Shushanik 
Abrahamian. 
  [HAYLUR] Mr Nersisian, a decision has already been made to 
put the Armenian dram into circulation in Stepanakert. 
  [Nersisian] The exchange of currency will take place in 
Stepanakert in the same way it will proceed in Armenia. 
  [HAYLUR] Have any preparatory steps been taken, because the 
people of Artsakh were in chaos in the preceding days? 
  [Nersisian] Yes, we have also created exchange boards. There 
is also a central board which is headed by Minister of Finance 
Spartak Tevosian. 
  All the money safes have been sealed so that there will be 
no 
circulation of the old currency. A special commission has been 
sent to customs inspection points so that there will be no flow 
of old currency from the outside. The corporations and 
enterprises of the republic have been given instructions to 
create their own appropriate boards. 
  [HAYLUR] You said that the exchange of currency will proceed 
in the same way as it will in Armenia, that is, 1 dram will be 
exchanged for 200 rubles. There are no collective farms in 
Armenia. How will the workers of collective farms [in Karabakh] 
be paid for their labor? 
  [Nersisian] There are many special cases which have been 
taken into account. Eventually everything will come out fine. 
  [HAYLUR] What about the case of people who are serving in 
the 
army or on the front? 
  [Nersisian] The army also has its exchange board which will 
take care of everything. 
  I think that everything in our republic will proceed 
smoothly 
without any unnecessary confusion.

<F P=106> [Interview with Academician Mikayel Kotanyan by Candidate of </F>
Economic Sciences Suren Gevorgyan: "Market Economy: An End or a 
Means?" 
  [Text] Academician Mikayel Kotanyan, a well-known 
economist in this republic, heads the National Academy's 
Institute of Economic Sciences. At a time when the young and 
inexperienced leaders in power were breaking all economic ties 
with Russia one after another, in the naive belief that this 
meant liberation from colonial rule, M. Kotanyan was one of the 
few economists to raise a voice against that naive policy, the 
bitter fruits of which we are now tasting. It is not too late to 
make use of his knowledge and experience. We present below an 
interview with Mikayel Kotanyan by Candidate of Economic 
Sciences Suren Gevorgyan. 
  [Gevorgyan] Mikayel Khachiki, it has been almost three 
years now that the republic's leadership has been trying to 
change over to a market economy. What is the present level of 
the economy? 
  [Kotanyan] First of all we must bear in mind that 
in governmental and economic policy the market is not simply a 
goal but rather a means of achieving improvement in public 
affairs, of raising living standards, and of satisfying needs. 
Therefore the transition to a market economy must be 
accomplished by means of raising the level of prosperity, not by 
worsening living standards. Living standards have declined in 
particular this past year. This was a result of an incorrect 
economic policy. Under conditions of freeing of prices and an 
economic decline, retail prices on necessities sharply increased 
in comparison with the same period last year. Armenia showed the 
highest prices for foodstuffs among all the CIS member states. 
It was calculated that, according to figures for the first 
quarter of 1993, the per capita cost of a minimum market basket 
in Armenia amounted to 12,476 rubles per month. And this was in 
conditions where the average pay for a state employee for the 
first quarter of 1993 was 4508 rubles, an average of 2500 rubles 
per person per month, while consumer spending was a mere 950 
rubles (1490 rubles when counting in the month of June). 
  Unemployment in this republic is growing day by day. These 
government figures represent the true state of affairs as 
regards the people's living standards. All this attests to the 
fact that this republic is at a critical point in the decline of 
living standards. 
  [Gevorgyan] The government considers transition to a 
market economy to be the cornerstone of privatization.... 
  [Kotanyan] Ensuring diversity of property 
ownership is one of the important conditions of a transition to 
a market economy. The issue at hand is by what method diversity 
of property ownership is being accomplished, by what principles 
of social justice, and under conditions of what socioeconomic 
situation. To accomplish this, those conditions selected as a 
point of departure must not worsen the condition of the people, 
but should ensure a stable rise in living standards, rather than 
putting additional stress into the social situation. Thus 
privatization and multiple ownership is merely a precondition 
for transition to a market economy, not a solution to the 
problem, as is naively believed by the top people in our 
republic's economy. They believe that privatization will solve 
the problems of transition to a market economy and that we shall 
immediately find ourselves in a common market-economy 
association with countries that enjoy a high level of 
production, technological sophistication, and civilized 
socioeconomic relations. All this is merely a pipe dream. There 
are many countries in the world that have private ownership of 
one type or another but still cannot even think about 
transitioning from a simple bazaar-type economy to sophisticated 
market relations. 
  [Gevorgyan] Are the results of land privatization not 
proof of what you say? The republic's agriculture has been 
thrown back to the level of the 1960's. 
  [Kotanyan] Land privatization in this republic was 
carried out in a most unsophisticated fashion; its purpose was 
not so much the development of agriculture as the speedy 
dismantling of the existing economic system. This task was 
entrusted to persons who had no knowledge whatsoever of the 
village or of agriculture. The land, livestock, and property 
were simply squandered, farms and agricultural complexes ruined, 
with nobody giving any thought to the question of what food 
supplies the government would use to feed the urban population 
and the military or what raw materials would be supplied to 
light industry and food processing industry still under 
government operation. Incidentally, land privatization has not 
been carried out at such a bold pace and scale in any other 
country. Even in the German states following reunification, in 
conditions of a powerful West German economy, East Germany's 
economic structures were not demolished. They have been 
maintained, and are gradually being restructured. 80 percent of 
the farm operations are being maintained, in spite of the fact 
that the state is providing economic incentive to stimulate 
development of the farm economy. This is due to the fact that 
certain economic conditions are necessary for transition to a 
privatized farm economy, and certain economic conditions are 
essential as well to ensure that people are psychologically 
prepared to work as independent individuals. 
  [Gevorgyan] Efforts are presently being made to argue 
that if collective farms and state farms had been preserved, by 
now they would have been looted and plundered. Is this not an 
involuntary admission of the government's powerlessness to 
preserve state property? 
  [Kotanyan] That is truly a result of self-delusion 
and ignorance. Even today the state farms which were preserved 
to one extent or another are the only sources for replenishing 
meager state food supplies. One can read statistics to become 
convinced of this. The fact is that state farms, in addition to 
"feeding" themselves, also allocate food supplies to the state, 
while the contemporary farmer is accumulating assets; the farmer 
has forgotten his duty to give a portion to the state.... 
  On the whole the economy has become a system out of control, 
which is careening toward the abyss. Suffice it to note that 
generated national income in 1992 was approximately equal to the 
1975 level, declining by 42.6 percent in comparison with 1991, 
while gross output has dropped correspondingly by 39.4 percent. 
  [Gevorgyan] This decline has continued in the first 
quarter of this year, while the newly-appointed prime minister 
had promised to halt the economic downswing within this period 
of time. 
  [Kotanyan] That is absolutely right. According to 
the 1993 socioeconomic development program submitted by the 
government, the target is to boost industrial output volume 32.3 
percent, while according to figures for the first quarter it 
amounts to only 48.6 percent of the total for the corresponding 
period in 1992. This means that the new government has failed to 
halt the swift decline of the economy. All figures pertaining to 
economic results in comparison with the previous year are 
negative numbers. There is no point in speaking about growth or 
even about stabilizing the economy. 
  [Gevorgyan] Incidentally, the prime minister has 
addressed the Supreme Council requesting postponement of this 
month's accountability report.... 
  [Kotanyan] He is doing the appropriate thing, 
since he has nothing to say.... The previous prime minister 
resigned because of the flimsiness of the present prime 
minister's submitted plan, which was approved by the 
parliament.... The new prime minister, however, has not 
implemented any part of this plan. None of the economic 
statistics are positive. This, as well as what the people think 
about the situation, are of no importance to the prime minister. 
Of importance is the fact that the president of the republic is 
pleased with his work. It is "God's" will, not the people's 
will.... 
  It is simply amazing how, after all of this, government 
officials, including the president and the prime minister, can 
calmly tell the people that progress has occurred in our 
societal and economic affairs. Can they really believe that the 
people have lost their ability to reason and that they believe 
"their chosen saviors"? 
  [Gevorgyan] Mr Kotanyan, do you see any way out of this 
difficult economic situation? 
  [Kotanyan] Ensuring the physical survival of the 
people and solving the fundamental issue of social protection 
have become a matter of paramount importance in this republic 
today. In past years, however, this issue was not substantially 
addressed in the government's plan of action, while it was 
totally absent in the plan for 1993. The goal can be achieved 
through a system of state guarantee of minimum means of 
existence. There must be established on the one hand a certain 
relationship between prices for the minimum means of existence 
and fixed prices, and on the other hand between wages, minimum 
pension and subsidy amounts. Each and every citizen must be 
provided with foodstuffs of various types, in a guaranteed 
manner, by the state, and this also applies to an assured annual 
ration of clothing, including footwear, which should be provided 
at very low prices on a quota basis to every citizen of this 
republic, with the addition of a system of compensation for paid 
and municipal services. The state must take over the task of 
solving the problem of ensuring physical means of existence, 
securing the necessary resources by means of state procurement, 
humanitarian aid, and other means. This is the foremost, urgent 
item in this republic under present conditions. 
  The next most important issue is the drawing up of a complex 
program of the republic's economic development. This must be 
grounded on the preservation and further development of the 
genetic resources of our people. With its centuries-old history, 
the Armenian people have proven that it displays exceptional 
skills in the fields of science and education, literature and 
music, the applied arts, aesthetics and sculpture, architecture 
and construction, engineering, and commerce. Securing and 
further development of the above by the state is the most rapid 
and reliable way to implement reforms in this republic and to 
make an early entry into the world market. Unfortunately the 
state is promoting primarily an unregulated, profiteering system 
of commerce, and this greatly aggravates the social situation. 
  Finally, one must clearly recognize that the long duration 
of 
the process of worsening of the people's standard of living and 
the absence of programs to correct the situation at the present 
time seriously endanger the prospects of transition to a market 
economy, and it becomes unacceptable to people. This situation 
essentially means collapse of the process of reforms, and this 
can be of fateful significance to the future of the republic. 
  [Gevorgyan] Development of the economy is essentially 
dictated by the system of government management. Can one 
consider the presently functioning system to be productive? 
  [Kotanyan] Essentially the republic and economic 
management model is a repeat of the Russian Federation model. 
Russia is an extremely large state, with its population as well 
as its resources and territory. It therefore definitely needed 
substantial decentralization of the economic management system 
and a broadening of local (state, autonomous republics, etc) 
functions, in order to give many of the entities below the 
national level a status of specific economic management and 
regulation. This is a characteristic of a multinational state 
which possesses ethnic and territorial integrity. 
  The Republic of Armenia is a small state, which assumes, 
based on the scale of the state, a state system of government, 
and therefore it requires a very limited decentralization of 
economic management. If we add to this our distinctive, specific 
geopolitical requirements, it will become apparent that the 
Russian variation of decentralization of economic management is 
unacceptable for our republic. The group which is carrying out 
our "economic reforms," however, lacking knowledge of our 
republic, failed to grasp those distinctive features and was 
unable to tailor legislative formulations to these features. The 
only solution was to repeat (with cursing and adjustment to the 
Armenian pattern) the Russian orientation, Russia's adopted 
resolutions, laws and decisions. 
  One other important and disturbing question deals with 
choosing a system of state management which will further promote 
democratization of the country's political and economic affairs 
and will ensure further growth. We should note in this regard 
that none of the CIS countries, including Armenia, is ready for 
a presidential system of government. 
  Presidential government requires an appropriate political 
sophistication, an arena for economic and law-related activities 
in which each citizen, political and public organization 
functions only following laws developed on the basis of a 
democratic constitution, and where there is no possibility of 
violation of the constitution at all levels of government. In 
order to create such a situation, a certain period of time is 
required for psychological restructuring of the people. 
  This applies in equal measure both to the masses and to 
officials involved in economic management. It follows from this 
that in Armenia the parliamentary system of government must be 
maintained for the foreseeable future.

  [Editorial Report] Istanbul JAMANAK and MARMARA in Armenian 
report on their front pages on 11 November that a year-old 
dispute between Armenian schools and the Turkish Ministry of 
Education ended with a final decision from the Ministry of 
Education (Decree No. 434 dated 23 September 1993) declaring 
that "all subjects, except Armenian language, will be taught in 
Turkish" in Armenian schools. The papers report that Armenian 
parents, upset with the latest decision, urged the Armenian 
Patriarchate in Istanbul to appeal the decision. 
  The two dailies publish on their front pages on 23 November 
the text of an appeal, in Turkish, by the boards of trustees of 
Armenian schools in Istanbul to the Ministry of Education. 
Copies of the appeal were sent to Turkey's president, the 
speaker of the Turkish parliament and the Turkish Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. The appeal states that the right of private 
Armenian schools in Turkey to teach in Armenian stems from the 
Treaty of Lausanne which Turkey signed in 1923 with Allied 
Powers ending all hostilities. The appeal quotes the relevant 
articles of the treaty guaranteeing the right of the use of 
Armenian in private Armenian schools and adds that this right 
was codified by Law No. 625 on Private Educational Institutions 
and that it is also enshrined in the 1982 Constitution. The 
appeal concludes that, as a result, "the administrative measure 
dispatched to our schools by the Training and Education Council 
[of the Ministry of Education] has no legal or judicial basis." 
  The appeal adds: "We request respectfully that, in view of 
the reasons enumerated above, this administrative measure which 
has caused great distress to our schools, students, their 
parents and our community be reviewed and repealed." 
  A front-page editorial in MARMARA by the paper's publisher 
Robert Haddeciyan on 26 November says that the controversial 
decision by the Ministry of Education jeopardizes the mission of 
the Armenian schools in Turkey and notes that no Turkish 
government, even during the "darkest days for democracy," 
repressed the right of Armenian schools to teach in Armenian. 
The editorial says: "We do not wish to mention the Treaty of 
Lausanne here, because even if there was no Treaty of Lausanne, 
today's democratic Turkey would gladly permit our schools to use 
Armenian as their language of instruction without hindrance 
because this is what the doctrine of this era requires even in 
the case of groups which are not considered minorities. In any 
event Turkey did not wait for the democratic ideas of today to 
bloom to respect the principle of permitting Armenian 
instruction for 70 years. However, today, with an unexpected and 
astounding step and an approach that contravenes principles of 
the modern era, our schools have been instructed to stop 
teaching in Armenian, except for the Armenian language. It is 
very odd." 
  The editorial questions the motives for such a decision 
saying that the use of Armenian in Armenian schools has not in 
any way harmed Turkey or instilled disloyalty among Turkish 
citizens of Armenian ancestry. The editorial concludes: 
  "We would like to hope that the appeal of His Holiness the 
Patriarch to the Governor [of Istanbul] will have a favorable 
outcome, although we believe that the Governor's Office is not 
the correct authority to which such appeal should be addressed 
because the issue arises at the level of the Ministry of 
Education. However, if the said appeal does not produce the 
desired outcome, His Holiness the Patriarch must think about 
other appeals and measures."

  [Excerpts] The third session of the Court of Ancient 
Armenian Princes convened at the Armenia Hotel on 24 October. 
  At the session, attended by Grand Prince Roland-Hovsep I, an 
appeal was issued to all Armenian political parties, religious, 
political, cultural and public organizations and businessmen. 
The participants also endorsed the bylaws of the Court of 
Ancient Armenian Princes. The bylaws will soon be submitted to 
Armenia's Ministry of Justice, the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and 
the Kingdom of Western Armenia [as published] for registration. 
  The session also endorsed the following resolution: "The 
Court of Ancient Armenian Princes recognizes fully and without 
qualification Roland-Hovsep I Vladislav-Anton-Paul von 
Bagratuni-Antonian-Antonyevich Poghos Anetsi (who lives in 
Budapest, Hungary) as the head of the Royal House of Bagratuni, 
prince of princes, king of kings, the legitimate heir of the 
royal throne. The members of the Court pledge to trust, to be 
loyal and to be subject to His Excellency and elect him, on an 
inheritance basis, as the head of the Court of the Ancient 
Armenian Princes." [passage omitted] 
  It was also decided at the session to recognize the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic as an independent and autonomous 
Armenian state. 
  The session also elected first deputies and deputies to the 
president of the court as well as the court's chief secretary 
and secretary. The session was attended by 42 Armenian princes 
and princesses, members of Armenian princely families dating 
back 3,000 to 4,000 years, such as the Artsruni, Mamikonian, 
Pahlavuni, Bagratuni, Voshtuni, Benkliants, Amatuni, Gnuni, 
Gntuni, Slkuni, Khorkhoruni, Urtsayts and Havnuni families. Also 
attending the meeting was Prince Norair Pahlavuni, the 
well-known Armenian reporter from Washington's "Liberty" radio 
station. The head of the Pahlavuni family was elected as one of 
the first deputies of the president of the court.

<F P=106> [Article by Arpi Totoyan: "The Savior of Western Armenia: </F>
Don Quixote II Bagratuni"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The 15 October issue of BANBER 
in the latest batch of papers from Armenia features a gem of a 
page for those who are not satisfied with important subjects. 
  BANBER bills itself as the "press organ of Armenia's 
Christian Democratic Union." It is a compact weekly in four 
pages and circulation of 5,000 edited by Khachatur Dadayan. 
[passage omitted] 
  The second page of the said issue features an "Appeal" which 
is designed to impress in the reader's mind the unique nature of 
the weekly for a long time. The "Appeal" is addressed to "all 
the Armenian political parties, ecclesiastical, political, 
cultural, scientific and public organizations and businessmen of 
the world." [passage omitted] 
  The "Appeal" is signed by "the grand prince of the Armenian 
kingdom, Roland I Bagratuni-Antonian-Anetsi, heir to the 
Armenian throne, king of kings, prince of princes, heir to the 
throne of the Kingdom of Western Armenia." The most visible 
participation of this person to the said "Appeal" seems to have 
been the drawing "Roland I" at the bottom of the page. We call 
it a "drawing" because the grand prince probably made his first 
attempt to write in the Armenian script by drawing the letters 
of his name possibly copying them from a signature given to 
him--as I would have done if I had to sign my name in Japanese. 
[passage omitted] 
  As for the contents of the "Appeal," it proclaims: "On 10 
February 1994 we will create the emigre coalition government of 
the Kingdom of Western Armenia and we will appoint the leaders 
of provinces, kingdoms and principalities." Roland I found bases 
for this step during his tour of Armenia and Karabakh, when it 
was revealed during his "meetings with the leaders of most of 
the political parties and organizations and representatives of 
cultural, scientific and economic circles" that "the ancestors 
of most Armenians are the victims of the 1915 genocide or have 
been deported from their homes, and the Armenian question awaits 
a solution to this day." [passage omitted] 
  Roland I's revelations are not limited to the fact that the 
Armenian question remains unresolved. He was greatly rejoiced 
when he "heard that Armenia won independence following the 
dissolution of the Soviet Union." Unfortunately that joy was not 
unmitigated because "the Armenian republic has not done anything 
so far to find a solution to the problem of the 1915 genocide 
through political and diplomatic means and to have western 
Armenia returned to the homeland." Fortunately, this descendant 
of the Bagratunis declares with a populism that does not befit a 
man who aspires to become monarch: "Considering the will of the 
Armenians of the entire world, we decided to participate 
actively in this matter." This is followed by the declaration of 
the formation of the emigre coalition government of the Kingdom 
of Armenia and details are provided. The declaration says that a 
constitution must be endorsed until 1995 by a "bicameral or 
tricameral National Assembly" whose "deputies and senators, 
numbering 250 to 350, will have been elected by the Armenian 
communities of the world." The declaration adds that "the 
Kingdom of Western Armenia must join the UN, NATO, the CIS and 
the European Union." [passage omitted] 
  Despite its generally comical appearance, the "Appeal" 
outlined above has a serious and disturbing aspect. The "ideas" 
expressed, in their distorted western Armenian edited and 
typeset by an eastern Armenian, betray the presence of a ladle 
sticking in from outside--a ladle that does not belong to the 
community that was dreamt by [19th century Catholicos] Khrimian. 
The effect of that ladle is to disturb and to create discord. 
The "Appeal" is also notable for its supportive attitude toward 
the "Kurdish people" and an "independent Kurdish state." The 
former is mentioned as a group that "is subjected to massive 
brutality by Turkey," and the latter is given the same weight as 
western Armenia: "This government must resolve the issue of 
independence peacefully, in conjunction with the issue of 
creating an independent Kurdish state." Can these propositions 
be explained by compassion or a sense of justice toward an 
oppressed people? There is also a question of timing: Why does 
such an appeal come at a time when the Turkish press does 
everything possible to gain credibility for its charges of 
collaboration between Armenians and Kurds? 
  The list of such questions can grow much longer, and they 
can 
only cause more concern. One of the most important of such 
questions, however, concerns the propriety and responsibility of 
the press. How can a newspaper that bills itself as the press 
organ of a political organization undertake such dangerous 
steps? [passage omitted]

  An election of deputies of the State Duma of the Russian 
Federation Federal Assembly was held on 12 December. 
  Based on a protocol of the Central Electoral Commission of 
the Russian Federation on the results of the election in the 
federation-wide electoral district, dated 25 December 1993, 
protocols of district electoral commissions for elections to the 
State Duma of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly, and in

225 were elected in the federation-wide electoral district and 
219 were elected in single-seat electoral districts.

Association of Light Industry Enterprises of Lithuania: "A 
Glimpse into Lithuanian Light Industry"] 
  [Text] The light industry is one of the oldest and most 
developed industries in Lithuania. At present, about 100 large- 
and 5,000 small-scale enterprises belong to the light industry, 
with over 140,000 people employed in them. Its production 
accounts for 26% of the total industrial output of 
Lithuania 
with textile, knitwear and sewing industries predominating. 
  Likewise the whole national economy, Lithuanian light 
industry faces a critical economic situation in the transition 
process to a market economy. During the first years of 
independence, the output of light industry went down slower than 
that of other industries. This was determined by several 
factors. During the last decade, about 70% of obsolete 
technological equipment was renovated by modern Western 
machinery. In principle, the previous contacts regarding 
purchase of raw materials and sales of products have been 
retained. Experienced managers and high-skilled specialists have 
not been replaced in respect to a new political situation. 
  The reasons behind the general decline of industrial 
production which recently became especially evident (high prices 
for raw materials and energy resources, unsettled interstate 
payments and an artificially high exchange rate of the litas 
against the dollar) have considerably weakened the state of 
light industry enterprises as well. During the last nine months, 
sales of light industry products in Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia 
and the CIS countries have dropped significantly. In spite of 
this, the first positive steps in co-operation with Western 
states can be observed. During the three quarters of 1992, 
56% 
of light industry goods were sold within the republic, 
39% in 
Estonia, Latvia, Georgia and the CIS countries. Only 5% 
were 
sold in Western countries in 1992, while during the last nine 
months of 1993 the sales of textile and knitwear products in the 
amounted to 17.2%. A considerable increase in sales has 
been 
observed over the latest few months. Thus, 2.3 times more 
textiles and knitwear goods were sold to Western countries in 
September compared with August. 
  This is primarily due to a consistent and purposeful work of 
light industry enterprises in seeking for contacts with Western 
partners. They have established ties with reliable partners in 
Germany, France, United Kingdom, the U.S.A., Japan, Belgium... 
These contacts are helpful in purchasing technological 
equipment at lower prices and they result in a higher quality of 
products. Managers of light industry enterprises understand well 
that with no sales agents in one or the other country exports to 
the West are actually impossible. The Lithuanian enterprises 
have concluded co-operative contracts with sales agents in 
almost all Western states as well as in many Asian and American 
countries. 
  It should be noted here that over 90% of light 
industry 
enterprises have already become joint-stock companies. 
  The Association of Light Industry Enterprises of Lithuania 
has made a considerable contribution to the promotion of trade 
links with the Eastern and Western partners. At present, it 
includes 87 state, joint-stock and individual companies with 
about 100,000 workers employed in them. During this year alone, 
on the initiative of the Association over 80 managers and 
specialists of light industry enterprises participated in the 
fifth and sixth Leipzig fashion fairs as well as in the trade 
fair "Recontreset Partenariat" in Paris and the international 
exhibition of fabrics "Interstoff" in Frankfurt am Mein. 
Commissioned by the Economics Ministry, the Association has 
recently organized the presentation of the Lithuanian industry 
and business in Odense (Denmark). 
  The Association invites foreign companies and private firms 
to get acquainted with Lithuanian light industry in the 
following forthcoming exhibitions: 
  - CEETEX'94 (England) -- technology and investment 
(May 9-12) 
  - EXPORTEUER'94 (France) -- exhibition (June 15-17) 
  - INTERSTOFF (Germany) -- fabrics fair (October 
25-27) 
  - DIUSSELDORF (Germany) -- fashion fair (March 6-8)

  [Text] Lithuania should officially ask for membership in 
NATO without any delay, said opposition MP Gediminas Vagnorius 
at a press conference on December 1. 
  According to Mr. Vagnorius, the leader of the Conservative 
Party, refusals to make an official request for Lithuania's 
membership in NATO and attempts to negotiate with Russia over 
military transit are the most scandalous facts in Lithuanian 
foreign policy this year. 
  He also sharply criticized Chairman of the Parliament, 
Ceslovas Jursenas, who said that NATO membership would limit 
Lithuania's sovereignty and who indicated the need to hold a 
referendum on the issue.

<F P=106> [Interview with Povilas Gylys, Lithuanian minister of </F>
foreign affairs by Romanas Miliauskas: "Let Us Maintain 
Civilized Relations"] 
  [Text] After your last month's visits to the East and 
the signing of a package of agreements with Russia, the 
East-West balance seems to have been achieved in Lithuania's 
foreign policy. Some politicians fear rapprochement with the 
great Eastern neighbour. Does this correspond to reality? Is it 
right to use the term "balance of interests" in this case? 
  As is known, politics involves many different aspects: 
foreign affairs, diplomatic, economic, cultural, humanistic, 
global, ecological, etc. All these aspects as well as 
territorial and geographic ones should be balanced. And that is, 
in my opinion, the major goal of the present Lithuanian 
government. This is not an easy task for a young diplomacy: even 
more experienced diplomacies sometimes fail to do it. 
  Although the opposition tries to deny it, I think we have 
already made some progress in this sphere and, primarily, in 
reducing political friction with our Eastern neighbours. I mean 
first of all Russia: we signed about ten agreements during Mr. 
Chernomyrdin's visit to Lithuania. I also have in mind our 
relations with Belarus, the Ukraine and Kazakhstan. We hope, the 
list will be lengthened in future. 
  We have serious interests in the West as well. We have 
discovered there many new things we didn't know before. But I 
should say we are also finding the East anew. Previously, we had 
quite different relations with the Eastern countries since all 
of us were a part of the Soviet system. At present, we are 
partners. 
  During the first year after the restoration of 
Lithuania's independence, political motives predominated in our 
sphere of interests. At the moment, economic ones seem to have 
come to the fore. Is this so? 
  That's right. At the beginning of my term in office I was 
criticized sharply for my emphasis on economic aspects of 
foreign policy. I still adhere to my previous opinion. We cannot 
neglect economy in politics. Economy is not a dominating factor 
in politics but still it plays an important role. I believe 
Lithuania's trade and other relations with all political 
partners will further strengthen if nothing happens in future. 
  What do you mean by your last remark? 
  Unfortunately, the situation on the continent is unstable. 
There are several hotbeds of conflict on it. 
  Didn't you have in mind the economic catastrophe the 
rightist opposition sometimes forecasts for Lithuania? 
  In my opinion, an economic catastrophe could be caused by a 
political one in case we decided to resume confrontational 
policy in the region. I think we have already finished this kind 
of politics, or, to be more precise, we are out of the era of 
confrontation. And God forbid to have it back. We should 
continue the development of civilized relations among countries. 
  Lithuania has large emigre communities scattered all 
over the world. Could they be the third force in helping us to 
overcome a political and economic instability? How better could 
we use their assistance in our foreign affairs and 
diplomacy? 
  Yes, there are many Lithuanians abroad. We can meet several 
thousand of them even in Siberia. They found themselves there 
brought by different causes: deportation, the wish to elude the 
past, the search for happiness or the whims of fortune. 
Generally speaking, during the three years of our independence, 
all the former governments were ineffective in dealing with the 
issue of Lithuanian expatriates. To tell the truth, personally I 
was surprised to see unskilled, even adventurously-minded people 
sometimes with Lithuanian names coming to our country. We were 
blind enough to treat them as experts. Now we are more careful. 
  On the other hand, Lithuanians abroad and their 
organizations 
should be more helpful in nominating people who could be most 
useful to our state. There are many spheres in which Lithuania 
lacks experience,for instance, international business relations. 
There are educated and experienced people among emigrants who 
could assist us in working more effectively with the World Bank, 
GATT, the European Community and other worldwide organizations. 
To find such people is one of our most important tasks. We will 
use our embassies in solving this problem. We expect Lithuanian 
communities abroad to be critical and strict in nominating such 
specialists. 
  The new year of 1994 is approaching. May we hope, that 
it will be more successful to Lithuanian's diplomacy? 
  If we succeed in maintaining stability in Lithuania and if 
the international situation is peaceful, Lithuanian diplomacy 
will be able to advance in firmer steps. We will be more 
secure... 
  In relations with our neighbours as well? 
  Of course. In the near future, we shall resume negotiations 
with Poland which were broken off because of elections and 
formation of the new government there. We are ready to be 
active. On the whole, I dare evaluate the current international 
situation positively. The Russian Army has left Lithuania and a 
psychological atmosphere with our neighbours is friendly. This 
creates favourable preconditions for economic and other 
relations. 
  Thank you for your time.

  [Text] The results of privatization for hard currency since 
August 1992 indicated each litas, received for privatized state 
property in Lithuania, earned US $5 to the state and should 
attract 24.4 dollars in investments. 
  35 units were sold for US $19.725 million over the 15 
months. 
The face value of the property privatized is US $4.424 million. 
  Lithuania will continue to follow the present model of 
privatization for hard currency; it is slower but more 
profitable, said Arvydas Darulis, head of the Economics 
Ministry's Privatization Department. A new, accelerated 
privatization method, slightly resembling the Estonian one, will 
be tested in Lithuania in the near future, he said. The so 
called Fast-Track privatization plan is currently under 
preparation in collaboration with consultants from the EC PHARE 
program and the international consortium Roland Berger and 
Partner GmbH. 
  According to the program, ten to twenty strategically 
insignificant enterprises will be chosen for privatization and 
presented in a single list. The list is most likely to include 
several hotels, restaurants, huge shops and small industrial 
companies. The terms of privatization contests will be much more 
liberal compared to the present ones which limit participation 
of foreigners. Mr. Darulis noted greatest advantage the fact is 
of the program that foreigners will be able to privatize 
property fast and without any major hindrances. The method is 
expected to attract more foreign investments.

  [Text] A migration tendency in which emigration prevails is 
still dominant in Lithuania. Around 13,500 people left the 
country and only some 2,200 came to Lithuania over the past 
eight months, the Lithuanian Statistics Department reports. 
  A majority of those leaving are Russians, Ukrainians and 
Belorus sans. Most of the emigrants are aged 40 and over. They 
also include pensioners whose departure does not affect the 
Lithuanian labor market. 
  The highest wave of emigration was registered in 1992 when 
22,200 people left the country. Among the 13,500 emigrants of 
this year, 550 people were Lithuanians. Around 30% of 
them went 
to live in the West. Around 800 Lithuanians came back to their 
homeland, mainly from Siberia, northern regions of Russia, 
Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus. Approximately the same amount 
of Russians, descendants of mixed families of deported 
Lithuanians and locals, have decided to come and live in 
Lithuania. 
  The state covers traveling expenses for ex-political 
prisoners and exiles. These people also have the right to 
participate in the privatization of state property and to get 
housing on preferential terms.

  [Text] President Algirdas Brazauskas has dismissed his 
national security adviser, Alvydas Sadeckas, in the face of a 
rising crime rate in Lithuania. 
  Mr. Brazauskas' chief aid, Raimundas Rajeckas, claims the 
discharge is a considerable loss. Mr. Rajeckas, who is also the 
chief of the president's staff, said Mr. Brazauskas did not 
consult him before making the decision. 
  Mr. Sadeckas himself declined to comment on the president's 
move. He only remarked he felt responsible for the events and 
processes going on in Lithuania. He also asked reporters not to 
interpret his dismissal as a sensational news. 
  Mr. Sadeckas held various posts at the Interior Ministry 
until last year. He was relieved of his duties on allegedly 
direct instructions of the then Prime Minister Gediminas 
Vagnorius.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Parkhomenko: "Impromptu Diplomacy. The </F>
Results of the Ashgabat Summit: `More Unanimous Than Ever 
Before,' and, As Usual, Meaningless"] 
  [Text] Failure. Among the 14 conferences of heads of CIS 
states held up to the present moment, the Ashgabat meeting 
during 23-24 December was not the first that one can confidently 
categorize as a failure for the Russian delegation. 
Representatives of the Russian Federation completed their 
mission quite ignominiously in all four major clubs whose 
sessions make up the traditional program of such summits--the 
councils of defense ministries, foreign affairs ministries, 
government heads, and presidents. 
  There was no dearth of analytical developments, conclusions, 
and recommendations prepared for the opening of the summit by 
specialists from the government apparatus, the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, and the administration, who were well oriented 
for the forthcoming discussion. And probably the simplest thing 
would have been to explain our current failure by the 
indisputable fact that Russian officials of the highest ranks 
who represented the Russian Federation in negotiations with 
their colleagues in the hateful Commonwealth again demonstrated 
their deep scorn for the work of their own experts. Documented 
results of the Ashgabat work of Boris Yeltsin, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, Andrey Kozyrev, and Pavel Grachev are filled with 
the most impressive examples of that "impromptu diplomacy" whose 
unpredictable rules the Russian leaders have been following 
recently, unfortunately, not only in contacts with nearby 
foreign countries. Here are just a couple of examples. 
  For Russian specialists who are reliably informed about the 
political situation in the Central Asian region, there was no 
secret about the completely pragmatic objectives pursued by 
President of Turkmenistan Saparmurad Niyazov in arranging a 
full-scale meeting with Boris Yeltsin. 
  The only political result of the widely advertised program 
"Ten Years of Well-Being," which, according the author's 
intention, was to have transformed the more backward Union 
republics into a flourishing "second Kuwait," was the rapid 
formation of a personality cult of the "father of all Turkmens." 
The efforts of romantics who hoped at least to look beyond its 
beggarly attributes to signs of an eastern autocratic tradition 
consecrated over the centuries ended in failure. The failure of 
the adventure with the hasty exchange of the ruble for the 
"freely convertible" (in fact it seems to be convertible by 
force and at an absurd artificial rate) manat only reinforced 
observers in their conviction that they were dealing with the 
remnants of an attempt to build socialism of the classical 
Soviet type in one separate emirate. It is not surprising that 
attempts by the political relic to establish contacts with the 
civilized world evoked in democratic states a reaction that was 
almost instinctual repulsion. The acquisition by Turkmenistan of 
the status of a full-fledged partner of the Russian Federation 
was intended above all to quell this reaction even though it 
partially legitimized Niyazov's regime in the international 
arena. Hence the persistent initiatives of the Ashgabat leader 
to complete the bilateral Russian-Turmen summit meeting with the 
signing of a large intergovernmental agreement. 
  When preparing for the visit, experts persistently 
recommended to members of the official Russian delegation: A 
firm condition for consent to the solicitation of the Turkmen 
elite must be the presentation of reliable guarantees of 
protection of the civil rights of the republic's 
Russian-speaking population. The policy of planned pressure on 
representatives of nonindigenous nationalities from the sphere 
of state administration, industry, education, and the Army 
leadership is just as typical of the Ashgabat regime as it is of 
the majority of its neighbors. The only difference lies in the 
much more skillful application of demagogic devices to mask 
ethnic purges and in the reliable control of the press, which 
could divulge cases of discrimination as well as the precise 
nullification of the activity of foreign observation missions. 
The flow of emigrants from Turkmenistan is steadily increasing 
all the while. 
  In these conditions to agree to the use of pseudoscientific 
euphemisms that distort the essence of the problem--such as 
"regulation of migration flows" or "parity guarantees of 
assistance to resettlers"--would mean to encourage the outflow 
of the Russian population, forgiving in advance the future 
transgressions of President Niyazov's regime. There is no 
counterflow from Russia to Turkmenistan, and none is anticipated 
in the foreseeable future, the experts reminded them--this has 
to do with casting a policy of segregation in civilized form. 
  Nonetheless, the president of Russia, ignoring common sense, 
agreed to sign an agreement on dual citizenship. And the public 
exercise in a rare genre of political buffoonery--the ceremony 
in which Boris Yeltsin was awarded a Turmen passport, ordained 
"an honored citizen of Turkmenistan," and declared to be the 
first possessor of dual citizenship--was the logical culmination 
of the bilateral division of the Ashgabat program. 
  A similar motif promised to become central at the 
multilateral summit. Specialists in the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and the administration of the president of the Russian 
Federation had prepared carefully for consultation on the draft 
"Convention on Ensuring the Rights of Individuals Belonging to 
National, Ethnic, Linguistic, Cultural, and Religious 
Minorities." The list of agreements suggested for discussion at 
the meeting, as usual, snowballed into almost 30 documents. But 
the draft convention promised to be perhaps the only one for 
which one could see a critical practical need and clear-cut 
political meaning. 
  The briefcase of Andrey Kozyrev, who went to the 
negotiations 
within the framework of the first official meeting of the 
Council of Minister of Foreign Affairs in the entire history of 
the CIS, contained detailed comments on this draft. "Taking into 
account the priority significance of this convention for 
Russia," its authors pointed out, "it would be expedient to work 
for its adoption with a maximum number of participants and to 
have it signed even if other states object...." Objections could 
be expected primarily from the delegations from Ukraine and 
Uzbekistan, who spoke out especially actively against the 
article of the draft according to which the agreeing parties 
would make commitments to "adopt legislative, administrative, 
and other necessary measures on their territory to prevent 
attempts at assimilation of minorities against their will...." 
Arguing this opinion in detail, the experts recommended 
insisting on the fairness of the Russian position and, if 
necessary, applying pressure to partners in the negotiations, 
linking the fate of the national majorities to the prospects for 
economic and military cooperation within the framework of the 
CIS. 
  But the chief of Russian diplomacy was either not in the 
mood 
or not in his best form. Or perhaps he was too impressed by the 
atmosphere of touchingly feigned hospitality created by the 
summit officials for highly placed guests (as distinct from the 
journalists, whose work was organized, let us note, in a simply 
disgraceful way). In brief, the convention did not reach the 
point of being discussed by the "presidential club." Mr. Kozyrev 
allowed it to be sent "for further work to joint groups of 
experts" for an indefinite period of time and with unclear 
prospects. 
  Equally doubtful for the Russian side were the results of 
negotiations on the economic and military sections of the 
program. 
  After congratulating Turkmenistan on its full-fledged (and 
not associated) membership in the economic alliance of the CIS, 
Viktor Chernomyrdin essentially welcomed the expansion of the 
group of contenders for a chunk of the meager pie of Russian 
technical credit. And it would be interesting to know what other 
result Russia could receive from an economic alliance with a 
state whose leader announces without special embarrassment at a 
press conference: "We have stood to gain from entering the CIS. 
We understand. It is just that we would not want for it to be 
mandatory for the country to carry out the decisions made 
there...." Well, of course, that is it in a nutshell.... 
  The diplomatic efforts of Pavel Grachev took an altogether 
unexpected turn. For example, the discussion about protection of 
Russian Army contingents in keeping with international norms and 
about granting them the status of military bases on foreign 
territory suddenly led to a point where Russia took over the 
burdensome and dangerous duties of protecting the borders of 
sovereign Turkmenistan. And the agreement of the minister of 
defense of the Russian Federation to revise the Collective 
Security Treaty at the insistence of the delegations from 
Georgia and Azerbaijan will inevitably bring Russia one step 
closer to direct participation in two open armed conflicts. 
  CIS executive secretary Ivan Korotchenya, it seems, is 
vigilantly keeping track of the adherence to the tradition 
according to which at every press conference that is the 
culmination of another summit they note the "warm atmosphere of 
cooperation and mutual understanding" of the participants. And 
neither did he fail to add the remark that in Ashgabat the 
agreements were adopted "more unanimously than ever before" this 
time. It seems that the Russian delegation was at great pains to 
help the observers describe this conference following the canon 
of the Bible story. If one wished, this form could even be 
considered appropriate for Christmas. Not Catholic Christmas, of 
course--it has nothing to do with this. In the capital of 
Turkmenistan the two-year anniversary of the birth of the 
Commonwealth, and, naturally, the breakup of the USSR, was 
celebrated with pomp. 
  The fate of the CIS at the end of these two years is 
unenviable. They are not being kind to the Commonwealth. They do 
not even sympathize with it. They are laughing at it.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Bekker: "Belarus is Trying to Keep </F>
Russian as a Donor"] 
  [Text] In the very near future the interstate agreement on 
unifying the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus will be 
presented for signing. Government heads Viktor Chernomyrdin and 
Vyacheslav Kebich stated on 5 January that "the necessary 
preparatory work...has been practically completed," and 
certified the "achievement of a high degree of readiness of the 
monetary systems" for unification. Both passages in the 
statement do not seem obvious. Even with all its difficulties, 
the stability of Russian finances is significantly higher than 
that of its "Slavic brother." The negative balance in Belarus' 
trade has reached more than 100 billion rubles [R], its rate of 
inflation is 20-25 percent higher than Russia's and the exchange 
rate of the surrogate "zaychik" to the ruble is 4.5:1. At the 
same time, the level of wages and pensions of our neighbor 
exceeds that of Russia by three times. 
  The motives which are compelling the Belrusian leadership to 
force monetary integration are extremely transparent. First of 
all, union, judging by the words of the Belarusian Central Bank 
chairman Mr. Bogdankevich, is thought of according to the 
artificial exchange rate of 1:1, thus Russia is supposed to 
allocate approximately R1.6 trillion to maintain currency 
circulation. Secondly, the need for our neighbor to pay for 
energy sources in freely covertible currency will disappear, and 
the possibility of raising the question of "brotherly" 
prices--like those for Russian consumers--appears. Thirdly, the 
Belarusian taxpayers are saved from the excise tax, while in 
Russia oil and gas are subject to a strict tax. 
  Despite the optimism of the two countres' prime ministers, 
the Belarusian side has still not expressed its readiness to 
sign the agreement on the single mechanism for managing the 
budget systems, which indicates their wish not to come under 
Russian control. The situation becomes even more understandable 
taking into account the agreement, already signed by 
Gerashchenko and Bogdankevich, on the schedule for unifying the 
mechanism for the function of the common monetary system. 
According to this agreement, the Central Bank of Belarus has 
the right to establish credit limits and to grant licenses to 
banks on its territory, while the Central Bank of Russia "is to 
ensure satisfaction of the basic (? A.B.) requirements...for 
currency bills." 
  Thus Belarus maintains its political independence, including 
an independent emissions bank and an autonomous budget, which, 
as is known, is the main calalyst of inflation. 
  There is no precedent for unifying monetary systems under 
similar conditions. Consequently, it is possible to discuss the 
seamy political issues of what is going on. The striving by the 
high officials of the Russian Central Bank to reanimate, even in 
a truncated version, the monetary-credit [system] of the USSR is 
an open secret. There are supporters and collaboraters in the 
government. However, one must think about the economic 
consequences of such a "mutually beneficial" union for Russia. 
There is still one tricky obstacle. Belarus is not opposed to 
the agreement being implemented by decree of the Russian 
Federation government, bypassing the State Duma. It is not 
difficult to guess that the opposition would not hesitate to use 
this as grounds for accusing the president and the cabinet of 
ministers of betraying national interests. 
  In September during the signing of the agreement on creating 
a ruble zone of a new type, Belarusian Supreme Soviet chairman 
Stanislav Shushkevich delicately posed the question of writing 
off his republic's debt to Russia. Hastening the current 
agreement, Belarus apparently wants to keep Russia as a 
financial donor and achieve with a "caress" what Kazakhstan and 
Uzbekistan did not succeed in with pressure.

  These questions are answered by leaders of the leading 
economic-analytical centers of Russia. The materials will be 
published in full in the international journal DELOVYYE LYUDI

<H3>  Yevgeniy Saurov, Director of the Center for Information and 
Social Technologies under the Government of the Russian 
Federation: "Pouring Dollars into Mercedes Is Not Farsighted" </H3>
  1. The experience of two years of reforms convinces us that 
we have climbed onto an "economic roller coaster." In the 
winter, by compressing the monetary mass we slow up the rates of 
inflation. In the spring, by advancing credit we return to our 
previous positions. Depending on the rates of inflation, the 
level of production increases somewhat or, especially during 
August-September, its decline increases. This is the second year 
in which we have been living in such a cycle. 
  The amplitude of the fluctuations is somewhat less this 
year. 
It is still unrealistic to speak about putting an end to 
inflation. 1993 was a year of in-depth study of the market by 
enterprise leaders. While last year everyone went through what 
might be called the introductory course, now they feel like 
sophomores. There are more enterprises which are not certain 
whether they will survive or not. Those that are not viable, of 
course, do no good for the economy. They must be reprofiled, 
showing concern for retraining the people. This work is already 
underway during the process of privatization. This is a 
gratifying phenomenon. There are also points of great 
tension--the coal industry, for example. 
  I have my doubts about the published data on the decline of 
production. It is fairly great. But it is linked primarily to 
the reduction of military orders. To the reduction of the 
"self-consuming" production of machine building. To the 
reduction of the output of poor-quality products. While a year 
ago there was a plethora in the viable branches, in 1993 signs 
of a positive structural change appeared during the slump. Thus 
things were not bad in the construction materials industry. 
There was a very slight growth in housing construction, mainly 
because of the individual sector. But the situation with 
electric energy is alarming: With all the problems of the 
economy, the consumption of kilowatt-hours is not decreasing. 
The country has forgotten about economizing on resources. What 
prices must we have for energy resources so that consumers will 
finally begin to be concerned about economizing on them?! 
  It is bad that the dollar is not being put to work in the 
country. Entrepreneurs, as before, prefer to keep their hard 
currency abroad. There is a great disparity between exports and 
imports. This is evidence of a prolonged poor condition in the 
economy. The result of distortions in legislation and political 
instability. Measures of law enforcement organs cannot solve 
such economic problems. Russia can obtain a significant influx 
of currency not from foreign investors but from "their own," 
those who are keeping their dollars abroad. Putting them into 
circulation in the West, our ill-starred entrepreneurs have a 
poor idea of the rules of the game in local markets and are not 
aware of the immense risk to themselves. Incidentally, the risk 
in Russia is even greater. This means that we must seriously 
create conditions for business at home. 
  The fact that domestic prices are coming close to world 
prices threatens to strike a blow to exports. Only high-quality 
products can be moved. The game involving cheap raw material and 
a cheap work force is coming to an end. But high quality 
requires expenditures: the purchase of new technologies and so 
forth. Pouring dollars into Mercedes is shortsighted. A new 
reality will be clearly manifested in the forthcoming year. 
  The year 1993 was marked by development of reforms. It 
proceeded as though of its own accord, with less participation 
by the government, and with a smaller degree of state 
regulation. The year showed that a fairly serious, aggressive 
business has appeared in the country although, true, it is not 
very civilized yet. It is in a state of development. 
  2. It is difficult to predict the situation today purely 
economically: a great deal depends on political decisions. In 
the absence of a pro-inflation parliament the government might 
possibly be able to hold down the mass of money better 
throughout the winter. But inflation could be significantly 
encouraged by campaign promises and difficulties in relations 
with the regions. 
  We will not manage to reduce inflation significantly in 
1994. 
The other danger--unemployment--might become serious. Not 
catastrophic, but in any case it is very undesirable. It is 
necessary to make the designation of social protection more 
specific. As one of the developers of the new housing system I 
am particularly against the same low payment for service for 
privatized apartments for low-income families and for Konstantin 
Borovoy. The income level must not be ignored. 
  The year will not bring the country out of its crisis. But I 
hope that there will be more appreciable outcroppings of hope 
than there were this year.

International Fund for Economic and Social Reforms, and Sergey 
Fateyev, Chief of the Department of Reform Strategy of the Fund: 
"It Will Not Be Possible To Compensate for the Collapse of the 
Social Sphere" </H3>
  1. It is not easy to give an assessment during a transition 
period. There are at least two groups of criteria that lie on 
completely different planes. The first are the directly 
macroeconomic indicators of current development, and the second 
are the institutional changes (since we are speaking about 
reforms). 
  As for the first group of criteria, regardless of what has 
been said about signs of "stabilization" in the economy, a sober 
analysis of the results of three quarters of 1993 (there were no 
statistical data for the fourth quarter by the time this text 
was written.--Ed.) shows the opposite. The decline (as compared 
to three quarters of 1992) in the majority of productions did 
indeed slow up, but stabilization as a condition of steady 
equilibrium and the appearance of signs of upsurge did not 
occur. As a rule, the slowing up or even termination of the 
recession in certain months in certain branches was then 
replaced by a drop in production. Based on seasonal and random 
factors it is still impossible to draw a conclusion about 
stabilization. Taking into account the real condition of 
production capital in the majority of branches, and the 
continuing imbalance in the national economy, one can state that 
the "low point" has not yet been reached. Incidentally, if one 
considers the situation in retrospect it is not inappropriate to 
recall that government representatives have already repeatedly 
reported "signs of stabilization," but the time frames for it 
are constantly being moved back. 
  The same thing can be said about inflation, the budget 
deficit, etc. The reduction of the monthly rates of inflation by 
the summer of 1993 from 25 percent to 17-19 percent was replaced 
in August by an increase almost up to 30 percent, and then again 
a certain slowing down. The reduction of the budget deficit was 
again followed by an increase. 
  The standard of living of the population has continued to 
decline. According to our estimates, the inflation index from 
September 1992 through September 1993 was 1,254 percent, while 
the growth of monetary incomes of the population during the same 
period was 1,037 percent. The instability of economic 
development during 1993 was accompanied by a collapse of the 
social sphere, which it has not been possible to compensate for 
in recent years even with the active formation of new principles 
of social policy. 
  In general, economic development throughout almost all of 
1993 proceeded under conditions of a keen political struggle, 
and this fact alone could in no way contribute to economic 
stabilization. 
  As for constitutional changes, that is, reformation as such, 
here without any doubt there have been certain advances. The 
number of privatized enterprises has increased significantly and 
privatization has indeed become irreversible, although it is 
frequently of a formally legal nature. The structure of property 
is changing, all the new elements of the market infrastructure 
are being created, and production is beginning to react to 
demand. Nonetheless, since these processes are taking place in 
an extremely unfavorable general economic situation in which a 
high degree of monopolization is retained in many cases, the 
changes are occurring randomly and without control. 
  Unless there are positive structural changes, under 
conditions where price disproportions remain there is still the 
probability of the creation of a pseudo-market with all the 
consequences that ensue from that. Therefore, in our opinion, 
although 1993 brought certain positive changes on the industrial 
plane, they are still clearly not sufficient to enable us to 
speak about the success of the reforms even in this area. 
  2. Naturally, there is no justification for speaking of any 
economic advancement in 1994. As we know, the future of the 
economy is being set today and yet the investment climate 
throughout 1993 remained extremely unfavorable for the majority 
of branches--the enterprises do not have the reserves for 
successful operation. 
  What features of development in 1994 can be predicted as the 
most probable? The overall decline of production will continue, 
although at slower rates. At the same time the decline in 
certain branches will begin to be partially compensated for by 
advancement in others. There will be increased differentiation 
in the economic position of the regions. The high level of 
inflation will remain. It will be practically impossible to 
reduce it to less than 10 percent per month. The task will be to 
learn to pursue an industrial and social policy with a high 
level of inflation. 
  On the whole, there should be no economic catastrophe next 
year. At the same time, if 1994 does become the beginning of 
stabilization (which is not very likely), the completion of this 
process will take an extremely long time and can by no means be 
done within a year even with the most optimistic predictions. 
  It is extremely likely that we will manage to stop the 
decline of the standard of living of the population. Problems of 
employment will be aggravated, but unemployment will not develop 
to the point of a national catastrophe. 
  The problem of bankruptcy will definitely make itself felt 
in 
1994, including, probably, among enterprises that have undergone 
privatization. Moreover, it is likely that some of the 
bankruptcies will be caused by shortcomings and mistakes that 
occurred during the period of reforms and flaws in the market 
infrastructure that is being formed. It is impossible to rule 
out a series of financial failures in the security market. On 
the whole, 1994 will more likely show a readiness to overcome 
new difficulties rather than the possibility of really "seeing 
the light at the end of the tunnel." 
<H3>  Yakov Urinson, Acting Minister of the Economy of the Russian 
Federation, Director of the Center for Economic Market 
Conditions and Prognostication under the Russian Federation 
Ministry of the Economy: "The Results are Contradictory, But the 
Balance Sheet Is Positive" </H3>
  1. The results of the reform in 1993 are extremely 
contradictory. On the one hand, the elimination of the 
plan-distribution system has been completed and the process of 
liberalization (of prices and domestic and foreign trade) and 
privatization has continued. Goods, although they are much more 
expensive, have filled the shelves of stores and wholesale 
warehouses. Although the ruble has lost value, the functions of 
the main means of payment in cash and noncash settlements lost 
at the beginning of the reform have been restored. At the center 
of public interest directives of the state plan have been 
replaced by finances and budget, monetary circulation and 
credit, hard currency exchange rates, and customs tariffs. 
  People have stably accepted the higher cost of living, the 
weakening of state paternalism, and the economic instability. 
Some have changed the structure of consumption and begun to 
spend most of their income on food, while others have changed 
their employment and found additional earnings, and still others 
have entered into entrepreneurship. 
  After the decline of the gross domestic product by 20 
percent 
in 1992, in 1993 it decreased by no more than 12 percent. In 
1993 investments are decreasing by 10 percent (as against 40 
percent in 1992). A positive foreign trade balance is forming in 
Russia (true, mainly because of a reduction of imports). After 
the sharp reduction in 1992 (approximately twofold) the actual 
monetary incomes at the disposal of the population this year are 
expected to increase somewhat (so far only in the range of 5 
percent). 
  But on the other hand, against the background of the already 
low standard of living, there has been an increase in the 
differentiation in the well-being of groups of the population at 
opposite poles. There have appeared not only legal millionaires, 
but also people who are officially registered as unemployed. 
Certain defense plants have been left without government orders 
and there has been no effective demand for the products of many 
state enterprises. It has turned out to be necessary to interact 
with republics of the former Soviet Union in the economic sphere 
as with foreign states, that is, on a mutually advantageous 
basis, and the maintenance of a ruble space without regulating 
and formalizing monetary-credit relations among the countries 
included in it disorganizes the economy of Russia. 
  In addition to this, subjective factors have manifested 
themselves in a certain way as objective processes, having a 
negative effect on the reformation of the economy. The "gift" 
financial resources aimed at eliminating the consequences but 
not the causes of the nonpayments, cheap credit for state 
enterprises, subsidies for agriculture and the coal industry, 
subsidization of regions, and "technical" credits for republics 
of the former Soviet Union--all these served as an impediment to 
the formation of a mechanism for feedback between production and 
demand. Under conditions of inflation the enterprises began to 
transfer their relatively free monetary funds into a consumption 
fund or to apply for freely convertible currency. The former 
increased the mass of money in the hands of the population and 
stirred up inflation even more while the latter prompted a 
decline in the exchange rate of the ruble on the foreign 
currency market. The situation was exacerbated by the 
unjustified social payments (higher pensions and labor 
compensation in the budget sphere) and a random growth of wages 
(including under pressure from strike ultimatums). 
  It is especially dangerous that in 1993 institutional 
changes 
regulating the behavior of commodity producers slowed up 
drastically. As long as they do not bear real property liability 
for the results of their activity and as long as unviable 
enterprises of the state enterprise continue to receive support 
from the budget, the inflationary process will apply more and 
more pressure to the economy. The consequences of inflationary 
financing of the economy: retardation of the structural 
rearrangement, increased energy and material-intensiveness per 
unit of GDP, growth of the budget deficit, and a new 
(August-fall) cycle of inflation. 
  But still the overall assessment of these positive processes 
and negative phenomena is clearly positive. The country will 
enter 1994 with a significantly altered economy. 
  2. In 1994 it will be necessary to restore a strict 
financial 
policy on a qualitatively new level, consistently reduce the 
state budget deficit to a tolerable level, and hold back the 
growth of the mass of money. As calculations show, this will 
make it possible to limit inflation to 500-600 percent (as 
compared to 1,100 percent in 1993). By regulating the bank 
interest rate at the same time it will be possible to create the 
necessary preconditions for invigorating the capital market and 
stimulating private savings, and in the next cycle--investments 
as well. Such measures must be conducted resolutely, but in a 
balanced way. It is also necessary to give a new impetus to the 
process of privatization and overcome the obstacles that have 
been artificially erected on its path. At the same time it is 
extremely important for enterprises remaining in the state 
sector of the economy to revise the legislative base for their 
economic activity in reduced periods of time. The finances of 
these enterprises must be clearly separated from state finances. 
  Within the framework of the strict restrictions that are 
dictated by the requirements for financial stabilization, 
support (through government orders, preferential credit, and 
direct budget financing) must be given to enterprises with all 
forms of ownership selected in keeping with strict criteria and 
nationwide priorities. 
  During the course of the market transformations there will 
inevitably be an increase in unemployment (in 1994 it will be 
necessary to find work for about 4 million able-bodied citizens) 
and an aggravation of problems of social protection. This means 
payment for structural rearrangement and increased effectiveness 
of the economy. The task of the federal government and local 
authorities is to minimize this payment and render 
special-purpose social support to segments of the population 
that objectively need it, granting capable citizens the broadest 
possibilities of manifesting initiative, increasing labor 
productivity, and participating in entrepreneurial activity. 
  With the implementation of the aforementioned parts of the 
economic reform in 1944 the budget deficit will decrease to an 
acceptable level. The decline in production will not exceed 5-7 
percent and it will assume a structural character. There will be 
some increase in the incomes actually at the disposal of the 
population. The population and enterprises will gradually begin 
to form natural savings. With the achievement of a positive rate 
of bank interest, investment activity will increase. During the 
process of structural rearrangement of production there will be 
new "points of growth" and within two or three years there will 
be a period of stabilization of the economy in its renewed form. 
<H3>  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, Chairman of the Board of the Center for 
Economic and Political Studies (EPITsENTR): "The Situation Will 
Remain Difficult for Entrepreneurs" </H3>
  1. On the whole the process of economic reforms was not 
marked by the achievement of any significant positive results. 
  Inflation (the consumer price index) remained steady at the 
level of 20-25 percent per month. And this is in spite of the 
fact that the government made certain efforts to restrict the 
growth of the mass of money (the issuance of credit, 
expenditures from the state budget). Measures aimed at limiting 
the aggregate demand were relatively successful. But a result of 
this policy was a further decline of industrial production and 
not a reduction of the rates of inflation, whose development was 
generated by inflation of expenditures, against which the policy 
of restricting the aggregate demand had no effect. Therefore the 
Russian economy in 1993 experienced almost constant price shocks 
in various sectors. In the macroeconomic sense the situation was 
exacerbated also by the practice of monopolistic price setting 
and the failure of the antimonopoly policy, in whose 
implementation the government is experiencing many difficulties. 
  As compared to 1992 the decline in industrial production 
slowed up (especially during June-August) but one must keep in 
mind that the recession in 1992 was very severe. All government 
announcements made during February-March 1993 about 
stabilization of the volumes of industrial production ignored 
the seasonal nature of this phenomenon and, as usual, during 
May-June there is a traditional reduction of the volumes of 
production, while August-September is a time of seasonal 
upsurge. On the whole as compared to 1992 the decline in the 
volumes of industrial production amounted to approximately 13-14 
percent. 
  In the area of privatization of industrial enterprises the 
results of the 1993 policy may be characterized by the word 
"collectivization." In essence we are seeing the appearance of 
enterprises that are in the hands of collective owners. The 
result of this kind of privatization is obvious: great 
difficulties in finding investors. For one must keep in mind 
that the position of Russian industry is very 
difficult--underinvestment has become extremely widespread and 
the condition of the equipment in many branches is terrible and 
must be replaced. 
  In trade, privatization has led to the creation of 
monopolistic markets in many cases. These monopolies exist 
because of the fact that trade enterprises are connected to the 
local authorities. Hence all the "charm" of the unregulated 
monopoly: price support to the detriment of the consumers, 
outlays increased because of the absence of competition and a 
high profit norm, sales volumes below those on the competitive 
market, and closing off of access to the market for other 
sellers. 
  In spite of the fact that in 1993 there were successes that 
may be characterized as partial (a large positive trade balance 
and a certain stabilization of the exchange rate of the ruble), 
nonetheless for the entrepreneurial sector of the economy the 
situation remains very difficult. This is largely the result of 
the political uncertainty, the lack of clear guarantees for 
private property, the imperfection of legislation, corruption in 
all echelons of power, an increased number of crimes against 
entrepreneurs, and the impossibility of engaging in business on 
the basis of honest competition. 
  2. Government actions will have a large impact on the 
condition of the economy in 1994. Nonetheless there are 
macroeconomic variables that are relatively unaffected by any 
actions of state power. 
  Under today's conditions this is primarily inflation. In 
1994 
it will be high as usual--high and unpredictable enough so as to 
impede the development of the medium- and long-term credit 
market, and this means that we have little hope of modernizing 
industry relying on the mechanism of positive interest rates. 
  In the second place, this means a decline in industrial 
production. Even according to the most optimistic version, the 
slump will continue. True, apparently it will not be as deep as 
in 1933, and the more so in 1992. But one should keep in mind 
that even if stabilization is achieved at the end of the year 
(which is not very likely), it will occur at the level of only 
50 percent of the physical volume of industrial production of 
1989! 
  A great deal depends on the policy the government pursues in 
the area of demonopolization and control of monopolies and 
whether or not it decides to recognize in both word and deed the 
adaptation of economic institutions to the conditions of high 
inflation without abandoning the cautious fight against 
inflation through restricting aggregate demand, and also on the 
reform of economic legislation. Within the designated framework 
it is possible to have a broad choice of measures of economic 
policy. And the results of 1994 could vary a great deal 
depending on the decisions that are made.

<F P=106> [Article by Vasiliy Selyunin: "After the Elections: Whose </F>
Program Is Realistic?"] 
  [Text] At KURANTY's request, noted economist and 
commentator Vasiliy Selyunin has researched and compared the 
feasibility of the three electoral coalitions that got a 
considerable number of seats in the State Duma fulfilling their 
economic programs. 
  I will deal with only the main directions of the programs. 
  Let us start with the Russia's Choice program. It does not 
contain populist promises or idle talk. Priority problems are 
clearly identified, and the program says what needs to be done 
and how. 
  The cornerstone is bringing down inflation, that is, 
bringing 
it down to 3 percent a month by the end of 1994. This is a bit 
too much as compared to countries with stable economies (which 
have 2-4 percent a year), but it would still make our life 
easier than it is now. In August inflation was 28 percent; in 
September a little less--22 percent; in October--24 percent; and 
in November--15 percent. I should note that how steadily 
inflation subsides will depend on how we all work. 
  It was inflation more than anything else that pushed the 
voters into Zhirinovskiy's embrace. It irritates people more 
than high prices and a low standard of living, especially 
considering that in 1993 the latter rose somewhat as compared to 
1992, although we still have not returned to the standard of 
living of the relatively prosperous years. The entire decline in 
the standard of living occurred during the first year of reforms. 
  Our country is not the first or the last to fall into the 
inflation trap. Inflation, like an invisible thief, picks every 
pocket. It would seem that people are already paid relatively 
well--the average monthly wage in Russia has long exceeded the 
100,000-ruble [R] mark, but this money melts away in front of 
our very eyes. You have to run and buy something quick, because 
prices go up instantly. I would not even mention that at this 
level of inflation it is impossible to save rubles. Every family 
loses in this respect, and the poor more than all the others. 
  If we manage to bring inflation down, every family will 
benefit, too. This will by itself raise the standard of living. 
Besides, capital investment is only possible after inflation has 
been reined in. There are no precedents in the immense history 
of the world of investment and growth of production beginning 
before inflation is brought down. This does not happen. 
  That is why Russia's Choice did not promise that next year 
would be a year of economic growth, rather that the work of the 
government should create the preconditions for it beginning in 
1995, provided there is stability in the country. Do not jerk 
the government; give it a year to work normally, and the 
conditions will be laid down for Russia's development for the 
next 10-15 years. Then you will not recognize our country. After 
all, there has been a Japanese miracle, Italian, Spanish, and 
German... There will be a Russian one, too. But it took every 
country 10-15 years. This is a normal time frame. It is silly to 
believe in a fast--and double at that--increase in the 
population's income, as LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia] leader Zhirinovskiy promised. 
  Taxes are another acute issue in the programs, which 
affected 
voter sympathies. Russia's Choice said honestly: It is 
impossible to cut taxes right now. And I will add that lowering 
them would be useless from the standpoint of economic 
development. Until inflation is brought down, the benefits 
accrued to tax-paying goods producers would immediately go into 
raising salaries rather than investment. Income freed from taxes 
would be converted to wages. And nothing else. 
  The Russia's Choice program envisages three kinds of taxes. 
The greater part of the tax on profit and value-added tax 
remains in local budgets. These are local, or municipal, taxes. 
There are regional taxes, which are collected, for instance, 
into the budget of an oblast, kray, or republic. In my 
estimation, approximately one-third of all taxes should be 
transferred into the federal budget. This sensible taxation 
creates an economic foundation for staving off sovereignization 
of Russia's regions. Create conditions for local enterprises' 
operations and collect taxes from them for the local budget, 
because they are mostly local. 
  Draft laws are ready on real estate taxes and introducing a 
tax for use of natural resources. Most countries do this. The 
total sum of taxes does not increase; it is simply that part of 
it is shifted from tax on profit into tax on real estate and 
natural resources. 
  The program for bringing inflation down is realistic, and it 
is already being implemented. Taking advantage of the fact that 
nobody interfered with the government's work over the past few 
months, preferential credits to sectors and enterprises were 
suspended already in September. I was baffled, though, to see 
the president sign an edict giving agriculture preferential 
credit in the amount in excess of R300 billion a few days ago. 
This is an unpleasant deviation from the program, but not a 
catastrophic one. In essence, it is again propping up kolkhozes 
and sovkhozes, and one can see why: the agrarian lobby is 
pushing it. 
  Tax preferences with respect to tax on profit and 
value-added 
tax have been reduced. So many preferences have proliferated 
that nobody knew any more who was supposed to pay taxes to the 
treasury, and how much. 
  Another anti-inflation measure: All import subsidies have 
been removed, except subsidies for purchases of medications and 
medical equipment. Until recently such subsidies consumed 12 
percent of total national income. Now if you want to buy 
something for dollars--be my guest, but buy your dollars at the 
current exchange rate like everybody else and stop begging the 
treasury for cheap hard currency. There had been incidents when 
the treasury, sympathetic to someone in a bind--textile 
producers need to buy dyes, they would say, and car makers need 
to buy equipment (everyone had a good reason)--sold dollars tens 
or even hundreds times below their market value. 
  Various nonbudget funds have been merged into budget funds, 
that is, they came under the jurisdiction of the government. 
This is also a serious anti-inflation measure. It is outrageous 
when the means of nonbudget funds exceed the entire Russian 
budget, as happened last year. The pension fund had been under 
the control of the Supreme Soviet; social security by tradition 
was the province of trade unions; the fuel and energy complex 
had its own fund; and so on... The result was that the 
government had under its control a smaller part of national 
finances than the agencies that controlled nonbudget funds. It 
is impermissible for several financial systems to operate within 
one country. 
  I am enumerating only those anti-inflation measures that 
have 
already been implemented or are in the process of being 
implemented; this means that the Russia's Choice program is 
quite realistic as long as they stick to it. 
  Of course, anti-inflation measures are harsh. If, for 
instance, a defense enterprise does not get preferential credit, 
it may potentially face bankruptcy, which will cause 
unemployment and possibly a social explosion. But unless tough 
anti-inflation measures are taken, we will see a Ukrainization 
of the Russian economy. What this entails is quite graphic. 
There is no alternative, and Russia's Choice said so honestly, 
which is the main distinguishing feature of this program as 
compared to others. 
  Ninety percent of the major program planks of G. 
Yavlinskiy's 
bloc probably coincide with the Russia's Choice program. 
Nevertheless, each plank in Yavlinskiy's program is preceded by 
berating the government: We would have done it better! 
Naturally, they do not say how. 
  There is, however, one principal difference. G. Yavlinskiy 
proposes to stretch the anti-inflation program through 1997. 
Broken down by year, it looks like this: 1994--monthly inflation 
at 15-20 percent, that is, it remains at the current level. In 
1995--10-15 percent a month. In 1996 inflation will be reduced 
to 3-8 percent, and in 1997--2 percent a month. 
  Now let us look what a monthly inflation of 15-20 percent 
will bring us next year. Prices will rise 10-fold over the year. 
This year we also had a ninefold increase in prices, and we say 
quite correctly that it is impossible to go on living this way. 
  If the current rate of inflation remains for the entire 
1994, 
as G. Yavlinskiy's program proposes, it will, of course, create 
a reserve for the implementation of social programs and support 
for priority sectors in production. But this will be support 
provided by paper money not backed up by anything, or by empty 
figures in noncash transactions. 
  I cannot say that stretching the anti-inflation thrust is 
the 
result of evil intentions or thoughtlessness. The leaders of 
this bloc see the situation differently and, in my opinion, 
overestimate the potential for social explosion resulting from 
some sector not getting subsidies or the absence of new social 
programs. But it has already become clear to the population that 
when production declines, handing money out to enterprises does 
not raise the standard of living. 
  G. Yavlinskiy's program envisages budget investment in 
sectors that act as locomotives, that is, those that will pull 
along other sectors and bring them up. At the top of the list, 
however, are budget investments in....the space program and 
aviation industry, followed by housing construction. Of course, 
the Russia's Choice program, too, envisages support for some 
sectors, but why give the space program priority? Such priority 
seems very questionable to me, because the treasury's ability is 
very limited. And, as I have already mentioned, budget 
investment is completely impermissible. We are already fed up 
with it. Practically all investment in the Soviet economy came 
from the budget, that is, from the state. 
  We had 500,000 ongoing construction projects, spreading the 
money thin, burying it into the soil and foundations, and did 
not properly complete a single needed construction project. And 
what we did build turned out to either be harmful, such as 
canals, or a nonpriority, such as the BAM [Baykal-Amur Main 
Line], because it was the state that decided where to put the 
money. 
  Budget investment may be justified perhaps in construction 
of 
housing for the poor and perhaps in railroads with the 
participation of private joint-stock capital. But, I repeat, 
investment, especially private (which should comprise the 
predominant part of it), is only possible when the ruble is 
stable, not in the conditions of 15-20 percent a month 
inflation. There are no fools. 
  G. Yavlinskiy's program also contains purely populist 
promises; for instance, it promises--and at a rather high level 
at that--budget support for science and culture. If this is so, 
it would be good to be more precise regarding at whose expense 
such support would be achieved. Science will get support, but 
someone else's share in the budget will be reduced. Whose? 
Pensioners? Teachers or doctors; builders or miners? There is no 
other method of budget financing. 
  Over the past three years the share of science and culture 
in 
the budget has not diminished, but remained at the same level. 
But in real rubles, of course, the magnitude of appropriations 
has dropped by about 30 percent. The share of science and 
culture in the budget will be filled with increasingly greater 
amounts of money not expropriated from others only as the 
economy begins to pick up. 
  It is more difficult to comment on Zhirinovskiy's economic 
program, since it is scattered all over in verbal statements and 
publications, although some points of it have been announced. As 
an economist, however, I cannot seriously analyze it. The 
program consists of a bunch of populist promises, most of which 
cannot be fulfilled. Those that are in fact realistic already 
have been or are being implemented by the government, but 
Vladimir Volfovich still makes these promises. 
  His biggest promise to the voters is to double the 
population's real income in a matter of six months. 
  "How do we do that?" Zhirinovskiy was asked. He named two 
major, in his opinion, sources. 
  First--stop nonrepayable aid to CIS countries. But the 
government has already done this. Beginning 1 January 1994 
Russia will trade with CIS countries only at world prices. 
Nonpayments or debts of former republics have been converted 
into credits. True, the interest rate is a bit low, but we 
cannot get more from them. So, the first source of immediate 
enrichment for the population named by Zhirinovskiy already has 
been exhausted. 
  The second source, in his opinion, is to stop conversion and 
sell arms. He told the public the figure of earnings from arms 
sales: allegedly $30-32 billion a year. Such earnings have never 
existed, and cannot be real. Theoretically, the USSR sold this 
much worth of arms. But last year income from arms sales was 
slightly less than $2 billion. And prior to that Russia did not 
get anything for arms deliveries to regimes friendly to the 
USSR. All in all, the Communists left Russia an "inheritance" of 
$130 billion. This is how much has been handed out to other 
countries, and mainly it is debts for arms shipments. None of 
the debtors has ever paid or intends to pay. It is hardly 
realistic to demand these billions in payments. India and Egypt 
pay some, but this is small change. Cuba alone owes us $18 
billion, and they are merely laughing: the debt we incurred was 
not to Russia, they say. Thus, earnings of $30-32 billion a year 
from arms sales belongs in the realm of nonscientific fiction. 
  Thus, the sources through which Zhirinovskiy promised to 
double the population's real income in six months simply do not 
exist. 
  His program also promises support for state enterprises, but 
it does not say how this would be done. If it is support through 
preferential credits, inflation will have to be let loose. 
  I do not think I need to repeat what will happen next.... 
  V. Zhirinovskiy promises regulated prices. As it turned out, 
this is the most desirable device in the understanding of most 
voters. But if we begin regulating prices, we will inevitably 
have to freeze wages. Otherwise, wages will jump, and with fixed 
prices the population will sweep the stores clean. As a result, 
the stores will be empty and money will be worth absolutely 
nothing. In this respect, too, Zhirinovskiy proposes a 
Ukrainization of the Russian economy without using this 
particular word. 
  The harm done to Russia by Zhirinovskiy's foreign policy 
statements is already obvious; this is being enunciated quite 
clearly. Through Zhirinovskiy's efforts, NATO is moving closer 
to Russia's borders; Ukraine has practically rejected nuclear 
disarmament; he has threatened Japan with a nuclear bomb, and 
all of us--with friendship with S. Husayn. 
  Zhirinovskiy is war, poverty, complete disintegration of the 
economy, and hyperinflation.

Sociology of Parliamentarianism: "Predictable `Sensation'"] 
  [Text] Such a thing cannot be because it cannot 
be--such was the reaction of certain politicians to the drop in 
ratings of democratic blocs before the elections. 
  Elections to the Federal Assembly have been held, but 
the political situation in Russia has heated up to boiling point 
again. Numerous discussions, of which there have been so many in 
this century, have been concentrated around ancient Russian 
problems: "Why did `some' win and `others' lose?" "Who is to 
blame?" And so forth. Understandably, historians and political 
scientists will be able dispassionately to answer these and many 
other questions much later, when the passions have died down, 
and when the gaze of the observer, his personal evaluations 
suspended, sees "only the facts." But both "then" and "now" it 
is useful to know the social attitudes of the voters. And what 
predetermined precisely this development of events in the 
country. 
  Weekly public opinion polls conducted by the Institute of 
Sociology of Parliamentarianism in Moscow over two years now 
made it possible to note long before the present day many 
sociopsychological peculiarities and tendencies in the 
development of the current political situation. Some of them 
were confirmed once again on the eve of the elections--as a 
result of a comparative analysis of the figures from two 
large-scale public opinion polls of the adult city and rural 
population of Russia (the first poll was taken during 25-30 
November, the second poll during 2-7 December). The polls were 
conducted by the Institute according to a standard methodology 
in all 12 of the country's main economic regions: Northern, 
Northwestern, Central, Volga-Vyatka, Central-Chernozem, Volga, 
Northern Caucasus, Ural, Western Siberian, Eastern Siberian, Far 
Eastern, and Kaliningrad Oblast, including Moscow and St. 
Petersburg. The samples--6,000 respondents each--reflect the 
main sociodemographic characteristics of the general totality of 
the country's adult population. 
  As the analysis showed, the results of the election to the 
Federal Assembly depended on two polar and, seemingly, mutually 
exclusive tendencies. On the one hand, in the society at the 
level of mass consciousness and self-awareness there was a clear 
uncertainty and instability of political preferences of the 
voters. Many "were prepared to vote" but did not know "for whom" 
and were "considering" right up until the last moment. All this 
increased the significance and decisive role of persuasion and 
preelection propaganda. 
  On the other hand, on the level of the mass subconscious, 
the 
behavior of the voters was influenced by a fairly rigid "system" 
of sociopsychological principles that were already in place. And 
this, in turn, threatened to neutralize the effectiveness of any 
propaganda unless it corresponded to the expectations of the 
audience. In other words, people were inclined to perceive only 
that which corresponded to their views. Therefore the outcome of 
the elections depended largely on the degree to which the 
parties and blocs were able to take advantage of these and other 
tendencies. Judge for yourselves. 
  Both the polls and the elections revealed a fairly high 
degree of political activity on the part of the country's 
voters. Incidentally, half of them (52 percent) simply intended 
to participate in the voting, while another 12 percent were 
inclined "to participate rather than not participate." The 
problem, however, consisted in that even on the eve of the 
elections public opinion was not sufficiently formed. At least 
by 7 December, 65 percent of Russian voters (according to their 
own self-assessments) had not made a final decision about whom 
to vote for, and only 35 percent of the voters had already made 
this decision. But even the voters who had decided to 
participate in the elections and named their possible "elected 
officials" during the poll did not have finally formed opinions 
either. Approximately 50-70 percent of the supporters of one 
party or bloc said that they had not finally decided who to vote 
for. 
  Moreover, many voters did not understand the principal 
differences in the party programs, and the set of campaign 
promises for a "better life" among the majority of candidates 
was fairly standard. It is not surprising that under these 
conditions a decisive role began to be played not so much by 
political programs and platforms as by the "acting mastery" of 
the politicians. 
  It is curious that, according to the assessment of Moscow 
voters at the end of November, the statements and political 
advertising they remembered most were those of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia (V. Zhirinovskiy)--indicated by 14 
percent, the Russia's Choice bloc (Ye. Gaydar)--11 percent, and 
the Democratic Party of Russia (N. Travkin)--9 percent. The 
statements of other parties were remembered by many fewer. 
Incidentally, according to the assessment of 17 percent, "they 
did not remember anything," and 21 percent--out of principle 
"did not look, did not listen, and did not read all that," and 
21 percent--"found it difficult to determine their opinion." 
  Incidentally, many thought and still think that the ones 
that 
could win the election were those that have "money" (this is 
what 28 percent of the Moscow voters thought), "press, radio, 
and television" (23 percent), "power" (21 percent), and "the 
support of B.N. Yeltsin" (20 percent) and not those "who defend 
the interests of the people" (16 percent) or "who have more of 
the truth" (9 percent). 
  But nonetheless, as life showed, "money," "propaganda," 
etc., 
with all their significance, were clearly inadequate factors. 
The mechanism of social principles and social expectations of 
the voters entered into the "fate" of the elections. 
  According to predictions of the Institute of the Sociology 
of 
Parliamentarianism, in the elections to the State Duma "in terms 
of the party slates" the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia led, 
and it was followed by the Russia's Choice bloc. The basis for 
this assumption was, in particular, the fact that on the eve of 
the elections to the State Duma (poll of 2-7 December) 17 
percent of the voters who voted were inclined to cast their vote 
for the LDPR, for Russia's Choice--16 percent, for the 
Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc--13 percent, the Communist Party 
of the Russian Federation--12 percent, the Democratic Party of 
Russia--10 percent, Women of Russia--6 percent, the Agrarian 
Party--5 percent, and the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord]--5 percent. 
  Let me remind you that according to the data of many 
respected sociology colleagues, the success of the LDPR in terms 
of the party slates did not significantly exceed the 5-percent 
mark, and Russia's Choice received barely a third of the votes 
from Russian voters. It is clear that this is not about the 
arithmetic precision of the predictions but about tendencies 
that were observed. And the attempt of the Institute of the 
Sociology of Parliamentarianism ("Novosti," Ostankino 25 
November) to draw the public's attention to the drop in the 
rating of Russia's Choice met not only with a complete lack of 
understanding but even attacks from certain upstart 
"sociologists." Incidentally, now that our Institute's 
prediction, according to the preliminary results of the voting, 
was basically right, none of this is of interest any longer. 
  Something else is crucial: a comparative analysis of the 
data 
from the two all-Russian polls shows that even at the end of 
November (the poll of 25-30 November) the level of support for 
the LDPR from Russian voters was 16 percent of those that 
intended to vote, and Russia's Choice--also 16 percent. And the 
key to the analysis of the results of the election must be 
sought not only in the "good television propaganda" of some and 
the "poor propaganda" of others, but also in deeper processes in 
the social psychology. 
  Thus the majority of Russians (75 percent) are dissatisfied 
with their present life to one degree or another. Of these, 23 
percent "are more dissatisfied" and 52 percent are simply 
"dissatisfied" with it, while another 5 percent "find it 
difficult to decide" and only 20 percent are satisfied with 
their life to one degree or another: 8 percent--"satisfied," 12 
percent--"more satisfied than dissatisfied." 
  The prolonged economic crisis and the growth of crime have 
led to a situation where in the structure of the values of the 
population of Russia there is a marked predominance of an 
orientation toward a "high standard of living" (73 percent) and 
"public law and order" (67 percent). Although values of material 
well-being and order are traditional both for Russia and for the 
Western countries, never before in recent years has the demand 
for democracy and freedom of speech been expressed so weakly: 
"Participation in the adoption of important political decisions" 
was significant for only 4 percent of the Russian voters and 
"openness and freedom of speech"--12 percent. I wish to 
emphasize that all this by no means indicates that the citizens 
of Russia are against democracy, openness, and freedom of 
speech. The problem is that the existing living conditions are 
forcing people to live at a level different from that of 
elementary social needs. 
  The social situation in the country is becoming fairly 
tense. 
The majority of people are finding it difficult to adapt to the 
current economic situation and feel socially and politically 
defenseless and alienated. Therefore they frequently do not 
perceive the changes that are taking place. Thus to the question 
"can you say that your time has come now?" most of the country's 
adult population (79 percent) answer "no," with 63 percent 
saying simply "no," while 16 percent say "more no than yes," and 
another 11 percent find it difficult to answer this question, 
and only 10 percent think that now "their time has come" to one 
degree or another. 
  It is worth paying attention to the fact that support for 
the 
LDPR was greater among the disenfranchised, those who, according 
to their self-assessments, "cannot withstand the so-called 
liberalization of prices." And there are a considerable number 
of people who have been impoverished and cannot withstand the 
"shock therapy" of reforms in present day Russia: 37 percent of 
the adult population. Incidentally, 45 percent think that this 
is "difficult but tolerable," for 10 percent--"not as terrible 
as it seemed," 4 percent note that "this does not suit them," 
and 4 percent "found it difficult to determine" their opinion.

<F P=106> [Article by Academician Georgiy Arbatov, under the "Opinion" </F>
rubric: "Are We Doomed to Fascism? The Time Has Come To Climb 
Down From the Tanks and To Work Normally"] 
  [Text] When things are going badly in the country, 
and the ruling party leads the economy and social relations into 
a dead end, the people suffer national humiliation, and a 
considerable part of the voters rush into the arms of extreme 
rightists or leftists. Such is the long-standing law of 
political life and, while this has happened here for the first 
time, this is still not a reason for hysterics. As went the 
politics (and there were warnings about this more than once), so 
went the results of the elections. In the course of two years, 
after the victory over the putsch, which, it would seem, opened 
unprecedented prospects for social progress, the country went 
downhill faster and faster, and at the same time the process 
became more and more unmanageable. 
  I got the firm impression that over the last year the higher 
leadership and its immediate circle, and the executive and 
legislative authorities of the economy, almost stopped working 
completely on other substantive matters and switched over to 
political confrontations. They followed one after the other, 
right up to the culmination--the dissolution of parliament, 
street fights, the tank firing on the White House, and the 
December elections. Elections that, according to the party 
rolls, brought success to V. Zhirinovskiy--an extreme 
nationalist--which stunned the people, but if we speak in the 
vernacular--it brought success to the fascists. (It would be 
interesting to know who from his close circle contrived to 
convince the president that, despite the worsening economic 
decline, crime, corruption, and general desolation, he and his 
supporters would absolutely win in the parliamentary elections, 
and whether these liars and sycophants are still in his retinue?) 
  For me, the events of December 1993 proved to be, perhaps, 
especially impressive--over the period of my life I have seen 
the successful movement of fascism to power for a second time 
already. (It happened that I lived with my parents in Germany, 
who were there on official business from 1930 to 1935; I saw a 
lot, and, naturally I heard a lot, and I understood quite a lot, 
for my 13 years, in this highly politicized situation. I 
understood, in particular, how horrible crimes are committed 
under the cloak of lofty words, and that even highly placed 
politicians commit fatal mistakes and stupidities out of hand. I 
understood how even an ordinary citizen who is good-natured in 
his personal life is transformed into a fanatic, with eyes that 
are glazed over with zeal, who is ready for any crimes in the 
service of the fuhrer, and how this then leads step by step to 
bloody slaughter. It also did not bypass my generation, 
including me personally. On the eve of fascism in Germany, an 
economic crisis was raging, as it is here now also; the majority 
was destitute, a handful of rich men was bursting with wealth, 
the authority of the leadership was rapidly falling, the people 
were suffering from poverty and from national humiliation, the 
politicians were bogged down in a struggle for power and in a 
game of brute instincts, inflaming the nationalism of the 
lumpenized layer of the population.) 
  I shudder inside thinking that I will have occasion to see 
all of this and, what is more, to live through it a second time. 
I am somehow not reassured by talk that, it is said, after a 
final vote count Zhirinovsky does not have a relative majority 
in the Duma and in general has nobody in the Federation Council. 
This is self-deception, and an attempt to conceal the main 
point. And it consists in the fact that numerous mistakes and a 
thoughtless and untalented policy has led to the fact that 
fascism has appeared among us, which today already has become an 
appreciable political force that has acquired not only millions 
of supporters among the voters, but also support (or at least 
the sympathy) in important state structures, foreign ties, and 
important sources of financing inside the country and, perhaps, 
abroad as well. 
  This is an event that is radically changing the political 
landscape and the political climate in the country. It also has 
an appreciable influence on our international position and on 
the attitude toward us in the world. We are again becoming a 
source of international danger for others, or, at a minimum, a 
pretext for someone to retain nuclear weapons and for someone, 
nevertheless, to squeeze into NATO. And many have refused, or 
will refuse at least some of the already planned reductions in 
military expenditures. In short, we have gotten ourselves into a 
mess along all lines. Only a blind man could fail to see all of 
this. And it will hardly be possible to shake up this change 
even after the replacement of the leadership of Ostankino. 
  I am somehow also not reassured by positive statements that 
Zhirinovskiy will get on with Yeltsin beautifully--if this 
occurs, this means that I (like a majority of the others) erred 
severely either in Vladimir Volfovich or in Boris Nikolayevich. 
  The situation is being complicated by the fact that the 
Communist Party, and the Agrarian Union (the other pole of the 
political spectrum that is getting stronger), which has joined 
it, have not yet made a determination on a fundamental 
question--whether they will be leftist or rightist parties. I 
personally think that besides a move toward a social-democratic 
platform, that they have no independent political future, but 
they, after all, might judge entirely differently. 
  A lot has already been written on the subject of the 
elections and Zhirinovskiy, and I would not like to repeat 
myself, including the fact that, as I surmised, in spite of his 
personal desires, Gaydar, his team, his benefactors, and his 
economic policy have become the godfather of our homegrown 
fascism. 
  Therefore, I will turn to the answer to the question raised 
in the headline. I am profoundly convinced that we are not 
doomed to fascism. There is a solution. It lies in the unity of 
all democratic forces and in a broad democratic coalition. 
(Somehow it turned out in previous years that our "primary" 
democrats in a purely Bolshevist way beat on potential allies 
most zealously of all, almost not touching their most bitter 
enemies.) But only a sincere, really honest, and a mandatory 
public admission of the mistakes made in the two years can 
become the condition for such a unity and coalition (otherwise 
nobody will believe anybody). And, moreover, unity on a new 
radically revised platform--economic and political (unity and 
coalition are otherwise inconceivable)--none of the sensible 
economists will agree to participate in a continuation of the 
ruinous monetarist experiments of Gaydar, Boris Fedorov, and 
Jeffrey Sachs). 
  With respect to economics, not being a professional, I will 
limit myself to only several passing remarks. Can it really be 
that difficult, if this is really desired, to gain an 
understanding of these price spirals and impetuous grabbing, and 
to set up a barrier against depredation, irresponsibility, and 
sometimes even simply stupidity. And to conduct intelligent 
measures (but again not requisition measures, but with the help 
of taxes, privileges, the removal of excessive rights of 
officials, and privatization somewhere, and so on) that are able 
to bring life to a civilized form, when we would be able to do 
everything in full view of the people, not allow anyone to 
produce [as published] and at least more or less specifically, 
but without deceit and demagogy, establish dates when the 
situation will begin to improve. It is necessary to see clearly 
that the solution to the crisis does not lie in a monetarist 
focus, but in a growth in production--but this is precisely 
where almost nothing in fact was done. A revision of the tax 
system is necessary so that it does not impede production, but 
encourages it, and a system for extending credits and a broader 
and more sensible involvement of foreign investments. We should 
not encourage laziness in the domestic producer who hopes as 
before to live without being in a hurry and exerting himself, 
owing to the fact that, as before, he will fleece his consumer. 
It is necessary to protect oneself from foreign competition on a 
scale that is reasonable and advantageous to the country, 
without losing sight of the fact that the ultimate objective 
will be the widest possible free trade. Otherwise, we will die 
as suppliers of raw materials. 
  A well-thought-out industrial policy is needed (a kind of 
elaboration of this has been started), as well as a system of 
measures that will bring a real revolution in agriculture. 
Today, in this transition period to a market, the government, 
the state, and local authorities must in this sense rely not on 
the "invisible hand" of Adam Smith, which, it is said, will do 
everything itself under price liberalization, but to work by the 
sweat of the brow, as is being done in South Korea, Japan, 
Mexico, Singapore, and other countries where there is a serious 
resolve to forge ahead. 
  I will not write anymore about economics--I am confident 
that 
the subject has been adequately developed by G. Yavlinskiy, N. 
Petrakov, O. Bogomolov, and also the department of economics of 
the Russian Academy of Sciences, to which in these two years, 
unfortunately, no one found the time to listen. I heard with 
hope that recently the prime minister and his deputies are 
beginning to incline to the side of a true economic policy. But 
I will talk about social programs in more detail. In many of 
them during the Bolshevist years that we are damning (frequently 
for a reason), we nevertheless set an example for the developed 
world. But now we are shamefully going back--in education, in 
health services, and in people's access to culture. In contrast 
to many countries of the West, property polarization is taking 
place, and together with it--a dangerous social tension (also a 
feeding ground for fascism). Previously, the privileges of the 
leadership were concealed (with which, judging by his recent 
television interview, the president reconciled himself), and 
now--even its pay. You learn with amazement that the director of 
an average-sized plant can set a salary for himself of a couple 
and even dozens of millions of rubles a month. Any transparency 
has been deliberately covered here. 
  As for the "lower levels," it would seem that not even an 
objective is being established to create a decent subsistence 
minimum for current conditions, guaranteed humane living 
conditions for old age and disability, and even for burials that 
are worthy of a person, and not for cattle dying on the roadside. 
  Transportation, communications, and other services have 
become luxury items that are accessible only to the wealthiest, 
without any justification. Rents in the city are increasing 
astronomically, and many cities, nonetheless, are falling into 
decay. 
  It is nonetheless impossible to compel the government to 
analyze this ratcheting of prices and unrestrained inflation in 
the whole system and to set a barrier against depredation, 
irresponsibility, and sometimes also simple stupidity, but to 
implement intelligent measures (again not requisition measures, 
but with the help of taxes, privileges, withdrawal of excessive 
rights of officials, somewhere privatization, and so on) that 
are capable of arranging life in a civilized form, when we would 
be able to do everything in full view of the people, not permit 
anyone to be arbitrary, and more or less specifically, but 
without deceit and demagogy, to establish dates when the 
situation will begin to improve. 
  I want to say something about policy. First about domestic 
policy. 
  A little more than two years were actually lost, despite the 
unique conditions that developed after the defeat of the putsch 
(in the sense of the development of democracy). If anyone thinks 
that the Constitution, which was adopted without the 
consideration of a fourth of the voters, is democratic and 
legitimate--this is a dubious proposition. In order to make it 
such, we will probably have to do a lot of sweating yet. But 
what is to be said about the much-promised, but already 
forgotten, legal reform that would guarantee life for every one 
of us in a genuine rule-of-law state? Which implies both 
democratism of the legal process and an inexorable struggle with 
crime and corruption--without the latter we will have neither a 
normal economy nor simply a normal life. 
  Putting political life in good order, of course, will 
require 
a lot of other things. I will restrict myself simply to naming 
them in some degree. Normal political parties must finally 
appear, with clear political platforms. A much improved election 
law, which was not concocted in a slapdash way, is needed. I am 
not talking now about such great tasks for us as a rational 
system of relations of the center, regions, and local 
self-government. As well as a normally working parliament and 
government that are smaller in number, but better in ability. 
The time has come to climb down from the tanks and engage in 
professional and normal work honestly and diligently every day. 
  Now about foreign policy. Whether we like it or not, Russia 
will remain a great power. And it cannot get away from its share 
of responsibility (of course, together with other powers) for 
international affairs, including for the very important and very 
responsible task of restructuring the entire system of 
international relations after the end of the Cold War, for the 
creation of regional security systems, especially in regions 
contiguous to us--in Europe, in southern and eastern Asia, in 
the northern part of the Pacific Ocean, and for the 
demilitarization of international relations. We played a 
decisive role in stopping the Cold War, we organized cooperation 
with the major countries of the world, and we can resolve these 
problems. Not assenting to the West in everything, of course, 
displaying will and persistence, and when necessary--initiative 
as well. It is necessary, it is true, to react quickly and with 
adequate resolve to the irresponsible twaddle of some of the 
Russian politicians who are appearing in the arena--given all of 
its foolishness, this political idle talk could do considerable 
damage to Russia's national interests. 
  We still do not have a well-balanced concept nor a 
consistent 
policy in countries of the so-called near abroad--but, after 
all, this is our main priority today. Russia, perhaps, is the 
only one of the former republics of the USSR that can both 
"exist by itself" and even prosper, ensuring its own security, 
normal economic activity, and even a certain increase in the 
standard of living of the people (if, of course, the plundering 
of national property is stopped). However, everything is 
possible in a friendly environment! In a hostile one, it will be 
even more difficult for great Russia to live than in the Cold 
War years. 
  The former Soviet Union was born out of an empire, and for a 
long time it was a totalitarian empire itself, which made it 
intolerable even for Russia, which declared its own sovereignty 
in 1990. The other republics felt the yoke of imperial 
oppression even more. We, like they, have a vital need of normal 
relations. One of the conditions is for us, Russians, to 
convince our neighbors that Russia has no kinds of imperial 
claims with respect to them, and to convince them not with words 
(who believes words today!), but with deeds. Then, the natural 
tendencies toward integration will begin to work in full force, 
as they began to work after the Second World War in Western 
Europe. And out of something that is illusory and neutral, the 
CIS will become a reality, ensuring the mutual interests of 
economic development, security, and cultural and human 
relations, with the full stability of independent states. And it 
is entirely impermissible to make up for obsequiousness to the 
West with pressure, and even rudeness, with respect to our 
neighbors. 
  To sacrifice the prospect of improving relations and a 
genuine alliance with them for the sake of being witty about 
Crimea, and in order to be reputed to be a jingo patriot, is 
unworthy of every true patriot of Russia. 
  And, finally--every nation (and its leader as well) should 
imagine how it wants to see its future and its objectives. The 
replacement of the "developed structure of socialism" by the 
"developed structure of capitalism," for heaven's sake, does not 
accomplish this task. Every Russian--both the ordinary citizen 
and the leader--wants to know, and has a right to know, where we 
are heading today. The democratic coalition should explain this 
to him truthfully, simply, and clearly. Especially because there 
is a good future before our country, if its people work honestly 
and manage the affairs of state skillfully. Few other states 
have such natural and intellectual resources, and such cultural, 
industrial, and agricultural potential. 
  The matter today really lies in proper policy and 
leadership, 
and first and foremost in them. This is the most reliable 
antidote against fascism. Somehow, no one has yet gone from a 
normal, good life to fascism.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Krotkov: "On Chubays in the Role of </F>
Grandfather Frost and the Unlucky Sociologists who Asked the 
Wrong People"] 
  [Text] Privatization, about which the reformer vice 
premiers have talked so long, has come to pass! Such was the 
leitmotiv of the speech of the chairman of the Russian 
Federation State Committee on the Administration of State 
Property at a press conference in the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs press center on Zubovskaya Ploshchad 
in Moscow. It has come to pass despite the oppposition of 
functionaries of all bureaucratic levels and all political 
forces. Anatoliy Chubays appeared as if in the role of a 
Grandfather Frost who had given presents to many Russians. 
  Today, Anatoliy Chubays declared, 67-70 percent of all 
former 
state enterprises in the sphere of small-scale privatization 
(malaya privatizatsiya) (stores, everyday services, hotels) have 
become private. As for large-scale privatization (bolshaya 
privatizatsiya), about 11,000 of the 14,500 largest state 
enterprises had been registered as joint-stock companies by the 
end of the year. More than 600 check investment funds, which 
help the citizens of Russia to take advantage of their 
privatization checks, are operating in the country. On the whole 
about 110 million Russians had already taken advantage of their 
privatization checks at the end of 1993. More than 55 million of 
the country's citizens have become stock holders, i.e., private 
owners. 
  Some 600-800 check auctions, in the possibility of the 
large-scale conducting of which not only our home-bred skeptics 
but even many foreign experts even recently did not believe, are 
held in Russia every month. More than 7,000 enterprises have 
gone through check auctions. 
  On the basis of all this, the chairman of the State 
Committee 
on the Administration of State Property concluded, we can give a 
firm guarantee that the last privatization check of a Russian 
citizen will be utilized by 30 June 1994. 
  Well, what will happen in July when the voucher disappears, 
the journalists asked A. Chubays. To this Anatoliy Borisovich 
answered merrily that he personally doesn't like the word 
"disappear," but rather--"will triumphantly conclude its 
functions"... As for further plans, a new stage of so-called 
paid privatization (platnaya privatizatsiya) awaits the country, 
when state property will be sold off no longer for privatization 
checks issued to everyone free of charge, but solely for money. 
  "But don't the intentions of the government to give up 
voucher privatization from the middle of next year contradict 
the idea of the social protection of the citizens of Russia 
under reform conditions?"--RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA put such a question 
to A. Chubays. 
  "The government doesn't intend to give up voucher 
privatization," Anatoliy Borisovich answered without batting an 
eyelid. "On the contrary, it intends to implement in full those 
obligations which it voluntarily undertook beginning with the 
August (1992) presidential edict which the Supreme Soviet 
attempted to revoke three times and which your newspaper and 
other such publications repeatedly severely criticized. Our plan 
is to discharge our obligations despite any criticism whatever 
of any political forces." 
  And such majestic dignity, such passion for social justice 
resounded in these words that my first impulse was to go up to 
Anatoliy Borisovich, shake his manly hand and... to confess in 
the presence of everyone to all that he would just wish. 
  But then, when the magic of his words dissipated in the air 
of the well ventilated conference hall and those present again 
were able to soberly evaluate what had been said from the stage, 
an inner voice stopped me: we were talking about different 
things. I asked about what will happen from the middle of next 
year--that is, after the completion of voucher privatization and 
not before it! 
  And Mister Chubays himself had just now talked again about 
the triumphal conclusion of the check's functions. Since 
nevertheless the idea of the social protection of the 
population, the principle of social justice will then be 
fulfilled? Or will only the "money bags" be admitted to the 
division of the most tasty remains of the state pie (the 
leftovers--the sweetmeats), and will the destitute majority of 
Russians, who have created this wealth by their own sweat and 
blood, have to just smack their lips at someone else's feast? In 
point of fact Mister Chubays simply didn't give an answer to 
this question. Why? Is it because he did not catch what in fact 
they asked him (with whom doesn't this happen...)? Or because he 
had nothing to say essentially? Although one may think that he 
answered precisely and clearly: the remaining property will be 
sold off for cash. Naturally, to those who have it. Including to 
the one who has become rich from machinations with vouchers. 
  That is why the chief Russian privatizer so coldly "kicked" 
RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA. And was it not in order to divert the 
attention of the hall from problems of social protection and to 
turn it to anxious thoughts about perfidious "opponents of 
reform"? 
  The chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee on 
the 
Administration of State Property continually emphasizes that, 
according to the data of sociological surveys, more than 60 
percent of Russians simultaneously approve his privatization 
offspring. There it is, he says, the people's love, the support 
of the people of labor. But if everything is in fact so good, 
why then did this strange people vote so in unison against the 
"Russia's Choice" bloc, one of whose leaders is the respected 
Mister Chubays? Why then did Gaydar, Chubays and others start 
fussing so after the elections, promising the people 
considerably more concern about their social rights than now? 
  Or were these promises only words? 
  As for the favorite references to sociological questions, 
then here we haven't a leg to stand on. The fact is that these 
same sociologists predicted a smashing victory for "Russia's 
Choice" in the elections. 
  Would it appear that the sociologists are asking the wrong 
people?

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Yurlov, editor of the RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA </F>
economics department: "The One who Pays is the One who is for 
the Market"] 
  [Text] "If any sector exists which should prosper in 
Russia it is power engineering,"--the well-known political 
analyst of the Russian economy, John Guardino, exclaimed 
recently. Unlike many of our compatriots who have been taken 
prisoner of the populist criticism of Russia's fuel and energy 
complex, supposedly guilty of all the defects of the transition 
period, J. Guardino knows the subject of his research 
thoroughly. And we ourselves know it. But to be sure one wants 
very much to find a specific culprit for all misfortunes among 
those at the helm. Let's recall how many indignant attacks were 
made against just the miners alone, that it cost them to demand 
that the government settle up with them regarding debts... 
  Let's recall that as regards energy-bearing resources, 
Russia 
is in a natural preeminent position in comparison with all the 
rest of the world. For example, we have more than 40 percent of 
the world's reserves of natural gas and coal and 20 percent of 
the oil. And what is more, the exportation of energy-bearing 
resources is a natural very important source of Russia's hard 
currency revenues. We export about 40 percent of the energy 
products produced, which constitutes almost half of all currency 
earnings. 
  It would seem that given such a situation the fuel and 
energy 
complex should be the most prosperous sector of the Russian 
economy. In fact it is the sector with the most problems. The 
production of oil and coal is dropping every year. According to 
the forecasts of the specialists of the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Fuel and Energy, if such a trend is maintained then 
the country may turn into an importer of oil by 1995. It is 
difficult today to even imagine the consequences of such a 
situation. One can assume with a large share of probability that 
it will be simply impossible to carry out any reforms whatsoever 
under such conditions. 
  At a pre-New Year meeting of the leaders of the most 
important enterprises of the fuel and energy complex the 
incorrect system of price formation was named as the chief cause 
of the sector's decline. Let's recall that the central 
government of Russia set the prices for almost 90 percent of all 
goods and services free in January 1992. However, it retained 
control of the prices for energy products. In fact fuel and 
energy rose in price more than 80 times that year by 
"administrative order." However, in spite of that the prices for 
coal, oil, and other domestic energy products remain far lower 
than the normal market level. They come to approximately 40 
percent in comparison with international prices. Partially this 
is related to the sharp fall in the value of the ruble when the 
rubles in circulation were used for the payment of compensations 
when the prices for energy products in Russia increased. 
  However, regardless of how much they have grown, 
administratively increased prices cannot be comparable with free 
market prices. Although it is clear that properly free prices, 
or the opportunity to set them, naturally will lead to an 
increase in the price of energy products on the domestic market. 
Terrible? Of course. However, as Yuriy Shafranik, Minister of 
Fuel and Energy, has cleverly observed concerning debtors "the 
one who pays is the one who is for reform. And the one who 
doesn't pay--although he shouts, he is not for reform. And no 
litmus papers whatever in the form of the LDP [Liberal 
Democratic Party], PDP [not further identified] and any PRES 
[Party of Russian Unity and Accord] are needed here." 
  Of course, control over prices has substantially reduced the 
cost of energy for the Russians. But as a result we are using it 
carelessly and not at all as efficiently as the majority of the 
world's population. And here you can't do without strong 
economic levers. 
  And, finally, a last consideration. An economy, all of whose 
sectors have been switched to market rails while power 
engineering, that locomotive of the entire economy, remains in 
administrative rods of iron, cannot in fact develop normally. 
There is no choice here. The rules of the game must be the same 
for all. Otherwise misfortune. 
  This is only a small portion of the problems which were 
discussed at the meeting of the leaders of the fuel and energy 
complex. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA intends to watch the course of the 
reform in this leading branch of the country's economy very 
carefully. And already in the next few issues we will grant the 
floor to the most authoritative specialists and experts in this 
field.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Pachegina: "The Country's Goods </F>
Producers Propose Their Own Path for Pulling Out of the Crisis: 
At the Same Time, They Are Not Counting on the Government"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  The Event </H5>
  "A national catastrophe is approaching"--this forecast, 
despite the bravura reports of the government on the "victorious 
procession of the market throughout the country," was made by 
the second congress of the Federation of Goods Producers of 
Russia (FTR) held last week in Krasnoyarsk. Representatives of 
collectives of enterprises, directors (managers), and owners 
assembled--all those who are engaged in the sphere of goods 
production, regardless of form of ownership and type of economic 
activity. Established in 1992 by the Association of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Russia, the Agrarian Union 
of the country, the League of Assistance to Defense Enterprises, 
the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, and the 
Russian Union of Workers Collectives, the FTR today, 
undoubtedly, not without the energetic efforts of Yuriy Skokov, 
its leader, represents the interests of the federal, republic, 
regional, kray, and oblast branches of unions of goods 
producers, which united, as the congress showed, by no means for 
the sake of selfish opposition as such. Their unification was 
prompted by the policy of the present government, expressed in a 
reprisal against national industry, which, in the opinion of 
congress participants and the leadership, does not at all appear 
to be a mandatory and necessary victim for a country that has 
taken the path of political and economic reformation. Not 
denying the need for economic transformations, the congress of 
goods producers evaluated the path of economic reforms in Russia 
in its own way. As was obvious from the report of FTR Chairman 
Yu. Skokov, there were in fact none. The political reforms 
absorbed everything, for which there was a consistent need for 
the president, people's deputies, and parliament... Meanwhile, 
an analysis of the state of the economy of Russia based on the 
results of the year presented to the congress by FTR experts 
shows that the drop in domestic production, without which the 
preservation and strengthening of Russian statehood is 
inconceivable, exceeded the planned level by more than a factor 
of two. The FTR chairman cited figures: the national food 
basket, consisting of 19 (!) descriptions of goods (for 
comparison, it is made up of 300 paragraphs in the United 
States), is applicable to only 30 percent of the population of 
Russia. The growth in unemployment is indicated by the 2,400 
plants in this country that died out this year. Against the 
background of general instability of economic life and 
administration, there is a continuing flow of a significant part 
of our national wealth abroad, and the export of capital from 
the country in legal and illegal form amounted to $12-15 billion 
this year. An economic and legal environment that is hostile to 
native goods production, whose direct result was the disruption 
of economic relations and a reduction in the volume of products, 
created such conditions that it simply became unprofitable to 
work. Thus, in branches that determine the competitiveness of 
the Russian economy (electronics, electronic equipment, and 
instrumentation) in the last three years the output of products 
has dropped by more than 40 percent, which indicates that a 
process of the deindustrialization of the country is beginning. 
  In the meantime, the congress of goods producers of Russia 
(not anticipating tangible progress for the better, not only in 
the first quarter but also in the first half of 1994, when, in 
the opinion of FTR experts, there will continue to be a further 
listless decline in production, inflation in costs in connection 
with continuous price increases for energy sources and 
agricultural raw materials, an increase in transport rates and 
wages, mutual indebtedness of enterprises, and the depreciation 
of money), is coming out in support of signing agreements with 
the government of the Russian Federation and organs of authority 
of the components of the Federation concerning a qualitatively 
new system of mutual relations that regulates the procedure of 
implementing the stages for conducting economic transformations. 
In the FTR's opinion, the state should guarantee the native 
goods producer the unconditional right to direct participation 
in determining the strategy of development of the national 
economy and in legislative initiatives on questions of goods 
production and expert analysis of all normative acts at the 
federal and regional level in this sphere. Arkadiy Volskiy, 
chairman of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of 
Russia and leader of the Civic Union, remarked in his speech to 
the congress that goods producers can credit themselves with the 
fact that the government, which until recently demonstratively 
had withdrawn from tasks of support of domestic production, 
today agrees with the need to regulate the economy of the 
country. However, the present state of Russian industry, the FTR 
leadership thinks, will not permit restriction to 
"consultations" with the government. Correctly relying on the 
intellectual and production potential of the regions, and also 
emphasizing the cementing role of the "class" of goods producers 
in the regional policy of the state, the FTR chairman sees the 
Party of Russian Unity and Accord (PRES), the Agrarian Party, 
and the Women of Russia Movement as possible and real allies in 
the federal organs of power who could be interested in 
supporting domestic goods producers. It is obvious that the 
representation of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs 
of Russia in federal organs of authority by one plant director 
can hardly be adequate for an expression of the interests of a 
multimillion-strong social group. But the question of the 
political formation of a movement of goods producers, as the FTR 
leader let it be known, is not yet urgent. Today, Yuriy Skokov 
believes, it is far more important to conduct a staged 
restructuring of the economy of Russia that is as painless as 
possible for the population, and which, in spite of everything, 
the FTR leader sees in the future as being among the first in 
the world.

<F P=106> [Interview with Doctor of Commerce A.V. Vasilyev, president </F>
of the Selkhoztrast joint-stock company and president of the 
Russian Agricultural Exchange, by SELSKAYA ZHIZN correspondent 
Mikhail Sharov, under the rubric "Interview of Current 
Interest"; place and date not given: "Futures Are Advantageous 
to All"] 
  [Text] We have already reported that a conference on 
the issues of organizing a grain futures market has been held at 
the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation. The main 
developer of this program, Doctor of Commerce A.V. Vasilyev, 
president of the Selkhoztrast joint-stock company and 
simultaneously the president of the Russian Agricultural 
Exchange, has answered questions put by SELSKAYA ZHIZN. 
  [Sharov] Aleksandr Vasilyevich, organization of the grain 
futures market is a completely new endeavor both for commodity 
producers and the state as a whole. We would like you to discuss 
it because many readers do not know what futures are. 
  [Vasilyev] Translated into Russian, futures means the 
future, 
transactions concluded for the purchase of future products. 
Exchanges in Russia had not previously engaged in futures 
trading; however, they had advanced to the level of a highly 
organized wholesale market for grain. Exchanges set prices for 
grain that were published in all the newspapers. Peasants knew 
precisely what grain cost on the market. Meanwhile, in our 
country, the general customer (the Roskhleboprodukt [Russian 
Federation Committee for Grain Products]), the Ministry of 
Agriculture of Russia, the AKKOR [Association of Peasant Farms 
and Agricultural Cooperatives of Russia], and the Agrarian Union 
get together at the beginning of the year and set the price, and 
the government subsequently confirms it. Is this not theater of 
the absurd?! 
  We have now begun to foster a new wholesale market, which 
consists of two main elements: these are the market for real 
goods and the market for the sale of the right to goods. The 
latter is the futures market. It may also be called a term 
contract market, that is, a market of contracts for a definite 
period. A peasant may sell his grain three, six, nine, or 12 
months in advance. 
  [Sharov] Grain that has not yet been grown? That has not 
even 
been planted? 
  [Vasilyev] Precisely. Having sold a contract for a certain 
amount of grain at a price projected for the next year, he 
receives money for this grain, which has not yet been grown (and 
this is very important!) in order to buy fuel, good seeds, 
fertilizer, and machinery. Therefore, the commodity producer is 
a winner, and the state also has an advantage; after all, the 
buyer pays for grain, and funds from the budget are not spent to 
this end. 
  Buyers in Western markets are speculators pure and simple, 
and in the genuine, favorable sense of the word, rather than in 
ours. So, two speculator-buyers meet on the exchange. One of 
them believes that grain will be expensive because its gross 
production will fall due to poor weather conditions. The other 
one believes that on the contrary, the cost of grain will be 
reduced because the crop will be large. That is, two contrary 
opinions are apparent. One speculator says: I will stock up on 
grain, whereas the other one says: I will sell it. These 
interests are reflected, in monetary terms, in sales and 
purchases on the exchange. Those playing for a rise are called 
"bulls," and those playing for a fall are called "bears." The 
peasant stays on the sidelines, looks at them fighting on the 
exchange, and is plainly happy. This means that the price for 
grain is being stabilized. If any one of them is winning, the 
peasant understands that yes, indeed, the grain situation at 
present is bad. Apparently, contracts need to be bought out in 
order to hedge against a fall in value. Or else, on the 
contrary, try to sell as many contracts as possible, because 
prices for grain will go up. 
  [Sharov] At present, there are a great many insinuations of 
all kinds concerning grain prices. They say that the prices have 
been unjustifiably overstated.... 
  [Vasilyev] As early as January of this year, we projected 
for 
September a grain price of approximately 90 rubles [R], with the 
value-added tax included. 
  [Sharov] You mean price per kilogram.... 
  [Vasilyev] Of course. So had a peasant sold grain at this 
price at the beginning of the year and received money as early 
as January, I am convinced that his mood would be good now, and 
the crop would have certainly been harvested in its entirety. 
Meanwhile, this is what it has come to: a tiller cannot buy what 
is necessary to till the land, grow the crop, and bring it in. 
  [Sharov] Is this, in essence, an interest-free loan? 
  [Vasilyev] Essentially so. It would vindicate the peasants 
from all unjustified and malevolent accusations. 
  Of course, there is a risk factor involved here. It is easy 
to understand a peasant if deep down he harbors the thought that 
he will be cheated about the price being precisely R90. 
  [Sharov] However, these apprehensions are not groundless. 
The 
risk factor indeed exists. Imagine that early in the year a 
peasant sells grain at a high price, and in September it becomes 
cheaper.... 
  [Vasilyev] Yes, in this case, the peasant loses. What should 
he do? He either leaves the sold contracts open for sale, or 
buys them out and sells grain at its actual price on the 
exchange. 
  This is where one more aspect, a very powerful aspect of the 
futures exchange, comes in: it is so-called hedging or, in other 
words, insurance against unfavorable changes in prices. 
  If insurance exists, the peasant will get the price for 
which 
he sold grain on the exchange in any event--in any event if his 
grain is purchased. 
  [Sharov] Aleksandr Vasilyevich, when the issue was being 
discussed at the Ministry of Agriculture, you illustrated your 
arguments with a chart that vividly showed the mechanism of 
operation of the grain futures market. 
  [Vasilyev] What is the most fundamental provision with 
regard 
to price setting for grain? It is that nobody knows how much 
grain will cost 12 months from now, because the futures market 
is not yet in operation in our country. This is why we 
approached this from a scientific point of view and established 
that in October of the next year, 1994, the cost of grain may 
range between R180 and R250 per kilogram. 
  According to our calculations, these fluctuations in 
December 
will already be within the range of R190-R260. However, let us 
discuss the October prices for which R180 is the minimum price 
limit and R250 is the maximum price limit. A peasant takes a 
look at the chart and decides to put up his grain at the maximum 
price. He is told: "Go ahead, but you will get only 50 percent 
down." This variant may not satisfy him, and he will wish to 
receive all of 90 percent (we cannot pay 100 percent, because we 
would like to build up reserve stocks of grain out of the 10 
percent). He is told once again: "Go ahead, but in this case you 
must put up the merchandise at R180, that is, at the lowest end 
of the scale" (final settlement will be effected at the time of 
actually turning in the grain). At this point, the peasant 
begins to think: Let me take the golden mean, R200, and receive 
80 percent down. This price satisfies the peasant--he was the 
one to set it. 
  [Sharov] Does this important endeavor take into account the 
role of the state and public organizations representing the 
interests of the peasantry? 
  [Vasilyev] Definitely. The chart we are talking about should 
be approved by the government after a thorough discussion at the 
Ministry of Agriculture and the Agrarian Union. In the process, 
the state will retain a regulatory function--after all, bread is 
at stake! 
  Imagine that grain prices have exceeded the maximum limit. 
What does the state do? It releases onto the market a large 
amount of grain from reserves. Since more of it appears on the 
exchange, it means that prices for grain will fall. Once again, 
this chart is brought into conformity. However, the opposite 
situation may also occur, whereby they begin to sell grain at 
R160 rather than at R180. In this case, the state dumps a large 
amount of money on the grain market and purchases the grain to 
meet state needs. This means that prices will return to those on 
the chart once again. 
  [Sharov] Aleksandr Vasilyevich, everything is always 
impeccably smooth in theory.... What about reality? 
  [Vasilyev] Indeed, in practice everything is considerably 
more complicated. The most difficult issue in this instance is 
that of the buyer. 
  For example, who will now buy grain at R250 per kilogram if 
it is suddenly put up for sale? There will be no takers, because 
cattle breeders who need this grain are beggars now. Private 
farms will not buy at this price either, nor, perhaps, will mill 
operators. So we started thinking about how to cut this Gordian 
knot. The following thought occurred to us: What if these 
contracts are sold at 10 percent of the value, or even five 
percent, that is to say, one-tenth to one-twentieth of the 
contract rather than at full value? An opportunity will appear 
to sell this grain to a larger circle of consumers. 
  Peasants need manufactured feed concentrates rather than 
grain in order to raise farm animals. Esteemed buyers of futures 
contracts, we propose to replace grain with any manufactured 
feed concentrate, and then at your manufactured-feed plants 
located nearby. We have signed an agreement with the 
Roskombikorm association, which has been set up by these 
manufactured-feed plants. You may buy manufactured feed 
concentrates from them towards a grain contract. At present, we 
specify the values of one-tenth or one-twentieth of the cost on 
only one condition, that of the opportunity we will have to 
build an insurance reserve of grain. If contracts are sold for 
one-tenth of the cost, we will need to place no less than 1 
million tonnes of grain in reserve stocks. If they are sold for 
one-twentieth, we should place no less than 2 million tonnes. 
Everything depends on what arrangements we make and where we 
find the money to purchase this segment of the emergency fund at 
present. Everyone who makes a purchase under a contract should 
be sure that the delivery to himself of grain or manufactured 
feed concentrates is guaranteed. We will be able to guarantee it 
when we have a reserve stock. 
  [Sharov] Do you mean the amount of grain that is necessary 
in 
order to set in motion the mechanism of the futures market 
itself next year? Is it realistic to be discussing it already? 
  [Vasilyev] Yes, it is realistic. We have prepared virtually 
all documentation, refined the contract itself, and refined the 
implementation program. To be sure, at present we will not be 
able to do this in all regions of Russia. For now, we will only 
use a few grain-producing and grain-consuming oblasts in which 
we will refine this mechanism. As soon as it gets going, we will 
extend it to all of Russia. 
  However, this will happen tomorrow, but today we badly need 
support from the mass media in explaining the very mechanism of 
the futures market. This is a very, very complicated business. 
The main point is for the people to understand that if they buy 
contracts for grain, the latter will be delivered in the 
necessary amount and on schedule--a tonne in December, a tonne 
in January, February, and so on, that is, at a rate that 
supports, on a monthly basis, the technical cycle of production 
or animal feeding. The state should provide assistance in 
setting this mechanism in motion, if not in funds, then in 
grain. We should be told: We are allocating 1 million tonnes for 
the futures mechanism to the five or six exchanges in which they 
have confidence now, and guarantee that this grain will be 
provided from state reserves in any case. Our farmer or peasant 
may suddenly fail to get the crop. In this case, all of us are 
bankrupt and unable to honor commitments made under the 
contracts. Support from the state and a reserve fund are needed 
to ensure that this does not happen. 
  To be sure, Americans propose to give us the necessary 
amount 
of grain as charitable aid. However, frankly, I would not want 
it, because we will thus punish our own commodity producers. 
When charitable-aid grain was dumped in March on the Saratov 
exchange, its price fell from R35-R40 to R27 right away. This is 
what the infusion of a large delivery of grain means. 
  Generally, my notion is that purchasing grain abroad is just 
a catastrophe for Russia. Why? Because we ruin the domestic 
commodity producer in this manner, paying him for grain three to 
four times less than a Western grain producer. Would it not be 
better to purchase elite grades of seeds, of which we do not 
have enough, and various kinds of defoliants and herbicides, 
that is, everything that improves the grade and quality of the 
crop? This would be a statesmanlike approach!

Valeriy Galitskiy, Aris Zakharov, and Aleksandr Frenkel, the 
Russian State Committee on Statistics: "Is the Rate of Inflation 
Falling?"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Prices for Consumer Goods and Services </H5>
  A decrease in the rate of inflation that manifested itself 
in 
November continued in December as well. Over the 7-14 December 
period prices and rates for basic goods and services rose by 2.3 
percent, including by 2.2 percent for foodstuffs and by 2.5 
percent for nonfood items. Rates for paid services to the 
population rose by 2.6 percent. The greatest rates of price 
increases were registered in the cities of Western and Eastern 
Siberia--4.1 to 4.8 percent; the lowest in the cities of the 
Volgo-Vyatka and North Caucasus regions and in Kaliningrad 
Oblast--by 1.4 percent. 
  The dynamics of weekly price increases over the past four 
weeks were as follows: 


                    11/23           11/30          12/07          12/14

goods and 
services 

including:

the population 


<H5>  Food </H5>
  Prices for basic foodstuffs rose by 2.2 percent; over the 
preceding week they rose by 2.9 percent. Over the elapsed week 
the greatest prices increases were registered with respect to 
eggs (by 6.0 percent), as well as fish and fish products (by 4.6 
percent). Prices increased by more than one-third: for eggs--in 
Roston-on-Don, Orenburg, Vladivostok, and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk; for 
frozen fish--in Penza and Orenburg. 
  Prices for macaroni items and cereals, butter, vegetable 
oil, 
salt, and vegetables rose by 3-4 percent. Price increases of a 
lesser magnitude--by 1.5 to 2.9 percent--occurred with respect 
to milk products, confectionery items, flour, bread and bakery 
products, and fruit. 
  Price rises settled into a stable pace (no more than 1 
percent a week) with respect to meat and meat products, sugar, 
and vodka. 
<H5>  Nonfood Items </H5>
  Prices for these items rose over the week by 2.5 percent. 
This rate of price increases remained stable over the past four 
weeks. Over the week prices for sewn items and knitwear 
increased by 3.0-3.6 percent, and for footwear, cultural, 
personal, and household items, as well as fuel sold to the 
population by 1.6-2.0 percent. 
<H5>  Services </H5>
  Fees for paid services to the population rose by 2.6 percent 
over the second week of December. The greatest price increase 
was registered with respect to notary services (by 48 percent). 
In 80 out of 132 monitored cities of Russia the cost of 
certifying a will by a notary public increased 1.9-fold. Fees 
for some varieties of paid health care services increased by 
8-15 percent. Apartment rents remained at the same level in all 
cities except Berdsk. In Berdsk they increased 58.8-fold (from 
17 kopeks to 10 rubles [R]). 
<H5>  Industrial Production </H5>
  Over the first 10 days of December 1993 production of most 
varieties of products counted in periodic reports has declined, 
which may be seen from the following table:

  In the fuels and power generation sectors, over 12 
days of December of this year production of the main kinds of 
energy resources is characterized by the following data: 


                         In Real Volume     Average Daily Production as a 
                         Since the          Percentage of the Corresponding

cubic meters 

Oil--million tonnes      9.9                88               98 


  Over 12 days of December of this year, 7 million tonnes of 
oil were refined, which is 7 percent more than over the 
corresponding period of this year's November, including in the 
following associations: Omsknefteorgsintez--by 11 percent, 
Salavatnefteorgsintez--by 14 percent, and 
Bashneftekhimzavody--by 29 percent. The output of automotive 
gasoline increased over this period by 10 percent, and of boiler 
oil--by 7 percent. Overall, as compared to the level of 13 days 
of last year's December, the volume of refining increased by 2 
percent. 
  The increase in the volume of oil refining resulted to a 
considerable extent from the fact that greater quantities of oil 
previously intended for exports now are being delivered to oil 
refining enterprises. 
  Out of 12 associations of the Gazprom RAO [All-Russia 
Joint-Stock Society], seven increased the volume of gas 
production as compared to the first half of the preceding month, 
including Surgutgazprom by 3 percent and Nadymgazprom by 2 
percent. 
  As compared with the corresponding period of this year's 
November, coal production has increased at almost all 
coal-producing enterprises with the exception of the Vorkutaugol 
association, where because of recent strikes it fell off by 
one-quarter. 
  In ferrous metallurgy over 12 days of December the 
production of iron ore declined by 14 percent as compared to the 
analogous period of November, including at the Lebedinskiy 
(Belgorod Oblast), Kachkanarskiy (Sverdlovsk Oblast), and 
Korshunovskiy (Irkutsk Oblast) ore mining and processing 
combines by 20-30 percent and at Kostomukshskiy by 48 percent, 
which is due to restrictions on delivery of electric power to 
the aforementioned combines because of arrears in payments. 
  Production of steel and finished rolled metal has declined 
as 
compared with the level of the analogous period of November by 2 
percent, and that of last year by one-quarter; of steel pipe, 
respectively, by 9 percent and 55 percent. 
  The data on the output of most important items in 
machine building are shown below:

  Over the elapsed days of December, there has been an 
increase 
in the average daily production of special, specialized, and 
component system machine tools, city telephone cables, and 
trolley buses as compared with both the corresponding period of 
last year and the preceding month. At the same time, with 
respect to most items the current level of daily production was 
below that for the corresponding period of 1992, including 
diesels and diesel generators, metal-cutting lathes, bridge 
electric cranes, trucks, friction-free ball bearings (declined 
by half), drop forges, mainline freight railcars, automotive 
trailers and semi-trailers, and tractors (by a factor of 6-10), 
which to a large extent is the result of a decline in solvent 
demand for products. 
  In the chemical and petrochemical industry the 
current situation is as follows: 


                              In Physical       Average Daily Production as a

  As compared with the first half of last year's December, 
there has been a considerable decline in the output of 
calcinated soda, polyethylene, synthetic rubbers, and 
microbiological fodder protein (by 32-43 percent). Production of 
polyvynilchloride resin, pipe and pipeline components made of 
thermoplastics, polyvynilchloride-based plastics, and tires for 
agricultural vehicles amounted to less than half of last year's 
volume. 
  The volume of average daily output of a majority of 
indicated, as well as other varieties, of products also was 
below that for the corresponding period of this year's November, 
with the exception of polypropylene, whose daily output exceeded 
November level by 13 percent, and movie film (by a factor of 
three); production of calcinated soda remained at the same level. 
  In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper 
industry, over the elapsed 12 days of December as compared 
with the analogous period of this year's November, the average 
daily production increased with respect to practically all of 
the most important varieties of products (with the exception of 
wood-chip board and cardboard):

  The average output of commercial timber over the elapsed 10 
days of December amounted to 198,000 cubic meters, which is 
one-third less than over the same period of last year. 
  Cutbacks in deliveries of timber to sawmills and 
wood-processing plants has led to a decline over the period 
since the beginning of the month in the output of mine props (by 
37 percent), wood-fiber board (by 28 percent), and matches (by 
51 percent). 
  In the construction materials industry over the 
elapsed period of December the average daily production of all 
varieties of products counted in periodic reports (with the 
exception of ground lime and dolomite) has declined over the 
elapsed period of December as compared with the analogous period 
of this year's November:

  In the cement sector, the average daily product output was 
the lowest over the entire elapsed period of the year--110,500 
tonnes as compared with 127,000 tonnes over the corresponding 
period of last year's December. The average daily production of 
roof slate, high-grade asbestos, asbestos-cement pipe and 
couplers amounted to 60-74 percent of the level of 13 days of 
last year's December. 
  At the same time, in the first half of December Rosstrom AO 
[Joint-Stock Society] enterprises, which produces two-thirds of 
the total output of decorative ceramic tile in Russia, increased 
their production by 6.5 percent as compared to the first half of 
last year's December. 
  In the light industry over the elapsed period of 
December as compared with the analogous period of November there 
has been an increase in the average daily production of cotton 
and linen fabrics and sack cloth. However, as compared with the 
corresponding period of 1992, the output of all items counted in 
weekly reports has declined: of children's footwear--by 61 
percent; woolen fabrics--by half; silk fabrics, jackets, and 
footwear--by 40-42 percent; knitwear--by one-third; and 
hosiery--by one-quarter. 
  In the production of complex home appliances, over the 
elapsed period of December as compared to the corresponding 
period of November there was an increase in the daily production 
of television sets and sewing machines (by 2-14 percent), tape 
recorders, video tape recorders, and bicycles (by 24-31 
percent). At the same time, the average daily production of 
refrigerators and freezers, washing machines, electric irons, 
and radio receivers declined by 11-19 percent; electric vacuum 
cleaners, by 28 percent; and motorcycles, almost by half. As 
compared with the analogous period of last year, production 
declined with respect to all categories of goods (with the 
exception of color television sets). There has been no 
production of radio receivers since the beginning of the month 
at the Mayak plant (Kursk Oblast) and the Irkutsk radio plant 
and of electric vacuum cleaners at the Omsk electromechanical 
plant. 
  Production of basic foodstuffs over the elapsed 
days of December amounted to:

  The only item where an increase in production was registered 
as compared to both the corresponding period of last year and 
that of the preceding month was vegetable oil--by 21 percent and 
24 percent, respectively. 
  With respect to most varieties of foodstuffs, the daily 
output has declined as compared to the same period in November, 
which in a number of instances is due to the seasonal nature of 
production. For instance, with respect to commercial edible fish 
and canned fruit and vegetables production declined, 
respectively, by 20 percent and 26 percent; the output of 
granulated sugar fell off by more than one-third. 
  As compared to the corresponding period of last year there 
has been a considerable decline in the production of bakers' 
yeast--by 20 percent, macaroni items--by 40 percent, and mineral 
water--by 44 percent. 
  With respect to butter, canned meat, tea, and food 
concentrates neither the level of the corresponding period of 
last year nor that of the preceding month has been reached. 
<H5>  Housing construction </H5>
  In January-November 1993 commissioning of housing in the 
Russian Federation was characterized by the following data: 


                    Commissioned,       January-November       Share in

  As compared to the corresponding period of 1990 the volume 
of 
housing construction has declined by 40 percent. 
  The private sector (individual housing construction and 
cooperatives) accounted for approximately one-fifth of the total 
volume of the housing commissioned. The pace of construction in 
this sector will increase by more than 3 percent as compared to 
the preceding year. 
  Overall over 1993, it is planned to put into place more than 
42 million square meters of housing. The volume of housing 
construction is expected to increase in a majority of regions in 
Russia; an especially high pace of housing construction is being 
observed in Tomsk, Ivanovo, Kostroma, and Ulyanovsk Oblasts and 
the city of St. Petersburg. 
<H3>  Construction of Most Important Objects in the 
Agro-Industrial Complex </H3>
  Capital investment worth R3.2 trillion from all sources of 
financing was put into strengthening the material and technical 
base of the agro-industrial complex [APK] and improving the 
social and living conditions of its workers in January-November 
of this year, which is 28 percent less than over the 
corresponding period of last year. 
  Money from the state budget of the Russian Federation 
comprises one-fifth of the total volume; it is directed mostly 
at construction of the APK's most important production objects 
in accordance with federal targeted programs. In 1993, 
construction of 910 such objects is envisaged at 709 
construction sites in the Russian Federation. As of 1 December 
1993, only 19 were actually put on line, including partial 
operation. The level of commissioning of the APK's most 
important production capacities and facilities comprised about 6 
percent of the annual start-up program, which is seen from the 
following data:

  As of 1 December 1993, work on 94 extremely important APK 
construction projects has not yet started; almost one-half of 
them are part of the "Development of the Baby Food Industry" and 
"Fish" programs. No construction is being done at a baby food 
plant in Kaluga, a baby food production department in Astrakhan, 
a city milk plant in Anapa in Krasnodar Kray, and a canned meat 
for babies production line at the meat packing combine in 
Neftekamsk in the Republic of Bashkortostan; reconstruction has 
not begun at Nikolskiy fish-breeding plant in Novgorod Oblast, 
at the production base of the Novyy Oskol zone-wide fish breeder 
in Belgorod Oblast, at the expansion of Ruyga fish farm in Tver 
Oblast, and others. 
<H5>  Export Cargo at Border Points at Railroads and in Ports </H5>
  As a result of the uncoordinated work of enterprises and 
organizations participating in the transportation of export 
cargo, on average 13,000 railcars a day with export cargo were 
present in November of this year at border point and 
harbor-adjacent tracks of the Russian Federation railroads; 
2,600 of them were railcars with timber, 1,700, with bituminous 
coal, and 1,300, with ferrous metals.

  The greatest number of railcars with export cargo were at 
the 
Far-Eastern railroad, 9,000 railcars (68 percent), including 
about 7,500 railcars destined for the ports and 1,500 railcars 
destined for border stations, which exceeded the established 
norms 2.1-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively. 
  As of 1 December of this year, 2.7 million tonnes of 
sea-bound export cargo have accumulated in the main sea ports in 
Russia, which is 37 percent more than on this date last year. 
The greatest remainders of this cargo were in the ports 
Nakhodka--561,000 tonnes (19 percent more than during the 
corresponding period of last year), Vostochnyy--480,000 tonnes, 
Vladivostok--282,000 tonnes, Vanino--246,000 tonnes (twice as 
much), St. Petersburg--354,000 tonnes (by 8 percent), and 
Kaliningrad--188,000 tonnes (1.7-fold). 
  Overall, remainders of export cargo awaiting shipping in the 
main sea ports increased by 1.4 percent as compared to 1 
November of this year; they decreased in the ports of St. 
Petersburg, Vostochnyy, and Novorossiysk (by 4-11 percent), and 
increased in the ports of Kaliningrad, Vanino, and Vladivostok 
(by 9-16 percent). 
<H3>  Deliveries by Waterway Transport to the Regions of the Far 
North </H3>
  As of 1 December of this year, about 43 million tonnes of 
cargo had been shipped to the regions of the Far North and areas 
equated to them, which is 25 percent less than the volume of the 
cargo shipped as of the same date last year.

  As compared to last year, the greatest decline in the volume 
of sea cargo deliveries was to the following ports: Dudinka (by 
38 percent), Magadan (by 27 percent), and 
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy (by 24 percent), to the ports of the 
White (by 48 percent) and Barents (by 27 percent) Seas, to 
Sakhalin (by 36 percent) and Chukotka (by 31 percent), and to 
the Eastern Arctic region (by 22 percent) and Eastern Kamchatka 
(by 21 percent). 
  Less liquid cargo has been delivered to the ports on the 
Barents Sea (by a factor of 2.4), the White Sea ports (by a 
factor of 1.7), to the Kuril Islands (by a factor of 1.9), 
Sakhalin (by a factor of 1.6), and Eastern Kamchatka (by a 
factor of 1.3), to the ports of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy (by a 
factor of 1.3) and Magadan (by a factor of 1.2) than as of the 
same date last year. 
  As of 1 December of this year, 22,000 tonnes of products and 
goods earmarked for coasting transportation (85 percent as 
compared with 1 December 1992) accumulated in the port of 
Vladivostok, which handles delivery of cargo to the northern 
ports that are open year-round; 22,000 tonnes were waiting in 
the port of Vostochnyy (136 percent), and 10,000 tonnes in the 
port of Vanino (63 percent). 
<H5>  Collection of Ferrous and Nonferrous Metal Scrap </H5>

  Sales of metal scrap to the Vtorchermet and Investortsvetmet 
procurement organizations have declined everywhere in the 
current year, and especially in the regions with high 
consumption of metal. In January-November, the procurement of 
ferrous metals scrap in Kemerovo, Lipetsk, and Yaroslavl Oblast 
amounted to less than 50 percent of the last year's level; in 
Tula, Orenburg, Chelyabinsk, Saratov, and Kirov Oblasts and the 
city of Moscow--between 52 and 64 percent. Procurement of 
nonferrous metals scrap dropped by half in Maritime and 
Khabarovsk Krays, the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg, and 
Leningrad Oblast.

automotive gasoline increased by 5 percent as compared to the 
same period of the preceding month, and of boiler oil--by 7 
percent. The level of diesel fuel production remained 
practically unchanged. Because of arrears in payments, there has 
been a cutback in oil deliveries to the Ryazan refinery plant; 
as a result, at this oil-refining enterprise that used to 
operate in a stable mode, the volume of primary oil refining 
dropped off by 17 percent, production of boiler oil decreased by 
22 percent, and that of diesel fuel, by 14 percent. 
  Nine out of the 12 associations in the RAO [all-Russia 
joint-stock society] Gazprom have increased their production of 
gas; nevertheless, it is still 8 percent below last year's 
level, including in Urengoygazprom--by 7 percent, 
Orenburggazprom--by 3 percent, and Nadymgazprom--by 2 percent. 
  Over the elapsed period of December of this year, 
practically 
all enterprises in the coal industry have increased production, 
with the exception of the associations Yakutugol (where 
production fell off by 14 percent), and Vorkutaugol (where it 
fell by 11 percent), and the Severokuzbassugol concern--by 13 
percent. 
  In ferrous metallurgy, the output of pig iron, steel, and 
rolled metal over 19 days of December declined by 2-4 percent as 
compared to the corresponding period of this year's November and 
by one-quarter as compared with last year. 
  Production in the metallurgical process is seriously 
affected 
by the shortage of scrap metal, the deliveries of which to the 
sector's enterprises amounted to only one-half of normal 
requirements. The situation with respect to the supply of coking 
coal has improved somewhat. In December their reserves at 
metallurgical enterprises amounted to 67 percent of the norm, 
while in November the figure was only 56 percent. As a result, 
the burning out of coke over the elapsed period of December 
increased as compared to the corresponding period of November by 
3 percent. 
  The output of steel pipe has declined as compared to the 
corresponding period of November by 9 percent, and that of last 
year--by 54 percent. 
  Over the elapsed days of December of this year, the average 
daily production of the corresponding period of last year has 
been exceeded with respect to one out of three monitored 
machine-building products. The greatest increase 
occurred in the output of large electric machinery (1.3-fold), 
pneumatic-chassis cranes and self-propelled graders (by a factor 
of 2-2.3). With respect to these products, however, there 
remains a considerable lag as compared to the level of the 
corresponding period of last year. 
  Production of special, specialized, and modular 
metal-cutting 
machine tools remains at last year's level. 
  The output of large electric machinery, low-capacity 
electric 
motors, and trucks amounted to almost one-half of that for the 
same period of last year; of traveling cranes, bulldozers, and 
main line freight cars--one-third; and of drop forges, 
automotive trailers and semitrailers, and tractors--less than 
10-25 percent. 
  Over three weeks of December, the output of all varieties of 
chemical and petrochemical industry products counted 
in weekly reports lagged behind the level of the corresponding 
period of December of last year; with respect to some of them, 
the rate of production decline increased in the third week of 
the month:

  There has been a 40-65-percent decline as compared to the 
December level of last year in the average daily output of 
polyvynilchloride resins, pipe and pipeline components made of 
thermoplastics, polyvynilchloride-based plastics, chemical 
filament and fiber, microbiological fodder protein, and 
automotive tires for agricultural vehicles. 
  At the same time, the average daily output of certain 
varieties of products has increased as compared to the 
corresponding period of November of this year, including 
phosphate fertilizer--by 18 percent, and polyvynilchloride resin 
and polypropylene--by 2 percent. 
  In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper 
industry, the daily production of most varieties of timber 
products over the elapsed 19 days of December exceeded the 
volume of the corresponding period of this year's November, with 
the exception of wood-chip board, paper, and cardboard. At the 
same time, as compared to the corresponding period of December 
1992, the output of all categories of the industry's products 
has declined:

Paper--thousands of tonnes   134               79              96 



  The daily production of commercial timber fell off by more 
than one-third as compared to the December level of last year, 
which has led to a reduction in the output of sawn lumber--by 37 
percent, matches and mine props--by half, and cardboard--by 
one-quarter. 
  The situation in the construction materials 
industry was as follows: 


                             In real volume    Average daily production as % 
                             since the         of the corresponding period of

  As a result of a 19-percent decline in the daily production 
of pliable roofing materials over the period from 13 through 19 
December as compared to the first 12 days, their output over the 
entire elapsed period of the month amounted to only 75 percent 
of the December level of last year (79 percent over 12 days of 
December). 
  The output of cement dropped down to 105,000 tonnes a day as 
compared to 111,000 over the first two weeks of the month and 
was the lowest since the beginning of the year. 
  In light industry over the elapsed period of 
December as compared with the analogous period of the preceding 
month, there has been an increase in the average daily 
production of cotton and linen fabrics and sackcloth. At the 
same time, production of woolen and silk fabrics, hosiery, and 
footwear declined by 13-18 percent, and of knitwear--by 5 
percent. The December 1992 level has been exceeded only in 
production of cotton fabrics, while the output of woolen fabrics 
and footwear fell off by half; silk fabrics decreased by 42 
percent; linen fabrics, sack cloth, and knitwear, by almost 
one-third; and hosiery, by 24 percent. There has been a 
considerable decline in the output of footwear for children--by 
58 percent. 
  In the production of radio electronics and complex home 
appliances, as compared with the corresponding period of 
November, there was an increase in the production of electric 
vacuum cleaners, tape recorders, sewing machines, bicycles, and 
other varieties of goods. At the same time, there was a decline 
in the average daily production of refrigerators and freezers, 
television sets, and washing machines (by 2-12 percent), 
knitting machines, radio receivers, and photo cameras (by 11-25 
percent), electric irons (by one-third), and motorcycles (by 
almost one-half). As compared with the analogous period of last 
year, production declined with respect to all categories of 
goods (with the exception of galvanic cells and batteries and 
regular light bulbs): the output of photo cameras and electric 
irons fell off by two-thirds; electric vacuum cleaners, washing 
machines, radio receivers, and video tape recorders, by half; 
and tape recorders and knitting machines, by 40 percent. 
  Due to material and financial difficulties, since the 
beginning of the year there has been no production of washing 
machines at the Nizhniy Novgorod automotive plant, PO 
[industrial association] GPZ-4 (Samara); of radio receivers--at 
PO Radiopribor in Velikiye Luki (Pskov Oblast), radio electronic 
plant Sokol (Moscow), and the Kamensk-Uralsk radio electronics 
plant (Sverdlovsk Oblast). 
  Over 19 days of this December, production of a majority of 
21 
varieties of foodstuffs counted in weekly reports 
(with the exception vegetable oil and canned milk products) has 
declined as compared to both the corresponding period of last 
year and that of the preceding month. Among them are meat, 
butter, cheeses, whole milk products, macaroni items, and others. 
  There has been a considerable decline as compared with the 
corresponding period of last year in the production of canned 
fruit and vegetables, macaroni items, tea, and mineral water (by 
33-41 percent), as well as whole-milk products, margarine, meat, 
butter, and canned meat (by 13-28 percent). Production of food 
concentrates fell off by more than half. 
  Among the daily necessities, over the elapsed days of this 
December as compared to the analogous period of last year the 
output of household soap and creams declined by half; of facial 
soap and creams [as published]--by 42 percent; and synthetic 
detergents--by one-third. 
<H5>  Shipping by Railroad </H5>
  There has been 15 percent less freight loaded on average per 
day at Russian Federation railroads over 20 days of December of 
this year than during the corresponding period of last year, and 
2 percent less than over 20 days of November of this year.

  During seven days--the period from 6 through 12 December of 
this year--in 25 percent of the republic capital cities and kray 
and oblast centers more than 15 percent of the planned trips by 
city ground passenger transportation were not made. The figures

  The cost of a selection is used for calculation of the 
sustenance minimum; the selection consists of 25 basic 
foodstuffs. It is calculated on the basis on consumption norms 
developed by the Nutrition Institute of the Academy of Medical 
Science jointly with the Institute for Demographic Socioeconomic 
Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of 
Labor of the Russian Federation. 
  The aforementioned selection includes: rye-wheat bread (68.7 
kg), wheat bread (62.9 kg), wheat flour (19.5 kg), rice (3.7 
kg), millet (9.8 kg), vermicelli (5.2 kg), potatoes (124.2 kg), 
fresh cabbage (28.1 kg), carrots (37.5 kg), other vegetables 
(28.4 kg), apples (19.4 kg), sugar (20.7 kg), beef (8,4 kg), 
poultry (17.5 kg), bologna (0.45 kg), salami (0.35 kg), frozen 
fish (11.7 kg), milk (123.1 liter), sour cream (1.6 kg), butter 
(2.5 kg), cottage cheese (9.9 kg), hard cheese (2.3 kg), eggs 
(151.4 units), margarine (3.9 kg), and vegetable oil (6.4 kg). 
  The aforementioned consumption volumes are indicated on a 
per-year, per-capita basis and have been approved by the 
Ministry of Labor on 11/10/92 in the Recommendations on the 
Methodology of Calculation of the Sustenance Minimum by Russian 
Regions. 
  Only those cities were taken into consideration where not 
more than four items from the listing were absent during the 
given or preceding price registration. 
  The cost of the basic food products selection is calculated 
on a weekly basis.

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel of Militia Kuzma Shalenkov, chief of </F>
department of the Main Administration on Economic Crimes of the 
MVD of Russia: "How Do We Respond to Bandit Terror?] 
  [Text] Up until 1991 the number of crimes registered in the 
banking system were few in number, but in 1992 the organs of 
Internal Affairs of Russia instituted 617 criminal cases 
involving facts of criminal phenomenon, but for 11 months of 
this year--more than 1,500! The greatest public danger is 
characterized by embezzlement with the use of counterfeit advice 
notes, Rossiya checks, and other payment documents. 
  The first information on embezzlement using fictitious 
advice 
notes began to show up in January-May 1992, when 12 forged 
documents with requisitions of banks of the Chechen Republic 
turned up within the purview of employees of the Main 
Administration for Fighting Economic Crimes. Over 1,400 cash 
centers of the Bank of Russia began to calculate the "Chechen 
advice notes." The Ministry of Internal Affairs proposed that 
the leadership of the former Supreme Soviet make it incumbent 
upon the TsBR [Central Bank of Russia] to verify the payments 
and report on the results obtained, not to the MVD but to the 
Supreme Soviet. 
  More than a year passed. In some regions, payments were not 
yet verified for 1990. 
  V. Gerashchenko, head of the Central Bank of Russia, said 
that somehow employees of the Central Bank of Russia had 
succeeded in "catching" fictitious payments for 1 trillion 
rubles [R], but nonetheless, 5-10 percent, on his admission, got 
through; that is, R50-100 billion was credited this year and the 
money embezzled. However, the Central Bank is not hurrying to 
complete the work on verification of payments, as the results 
obtained will show the ineffectiveness of the bank's activity in 
regulating money circulation. But to place the blame for what 
happened only on the Central Bank would be the height of 
injustice. Evidence was acquired within the scope of specific 
criminal cases that the organizers of acts concerning crediting 
resources according to counterfeit documents were sometimes bank 
employees themselves, and sometimes also the managers of those 
banks that were experiencing a "credit shortage." In just one of 
the criminal cases, criminal proceedings are being instituted 
against Lazarev, who works as the director of the Moscow branch 
of the KB [commercial bank] Terra-Bank, his deputy, Shchebrev, 
and the chief bookkeeper of the Moscow branch of the 
East-Siberian Commercial Bank, Nikishin. In another case, the 
chairman of the board of the Soyuzprombank, Letunov, was 
arrested. Evidence was also obtained regarding participation in 
embezzlement of I. Medkov, manager of the Pragma-Bank, who was 
killed in September of this year. This sorrowful list can be 
continued. 
  Sometimes financial swindling happens out of sympathy for, 
so 
to say, professional solidarity. The former chief bookkeeper of 
the RKTs [cash center] of the Main Administration of the Central 
Bank of Russia for the city of Moscow, Prilepsheva, knew that 
R2.7 billion being earmarked for a client of the Progressbank 
commercial bank were not secured by real resources, but she made 
a temporary credit entry of the indicated sum to a correspondent 
account of the bank. She explained this with the fact that the 
bank was in a difficult financial position, and she felt very 
bad for her good friend who works in this bank as a bookkeeper. 
  The gratuitous use of state resources becomes food for other 
commercial banks. Thus, for example, out of the 10 commercial 
banks being studied by our group, more than R20 billion were 
credited for 45 counterfeit advice notes. The monetary resources 
were at the disposal of the banks from one to eight or nine 
months, after which the "forgery" was "suddenly" found and the 
sums written off. It is perfectly clear that R20 billion in 
October-December 1992 was nowhere near the same as R20 billion 
in August-September 1993. 
  The interests of the bank also require criminal-legal 
protection. A "debit balance" sometimes arises because credits 
are dispensed but the bank cannot get them back--there are no 
capabilities. Swindling borrowers know this, and take advantage 
of it to the utmost. 
  There is only one solution at the stage of forming market 
relations--intensify criminal-legal repression. If you take bank 
credit, you return it with interest at the specified date. If 
you fail to do so--it means jail. Otherwise, order cannot be 
maintained. 
  As a preventive measure, the Main Administration for 
Fighting 
Economic Crimes of the MVD of Russia is developing a mechanism 
for the Association of Russian Banks to access name and 
fingerprint reports on individuals. After all, before doing 
business with a person it is not bad to know at least something 
about his past, especially if it is a criminal past. The second 
step in this direction will be the formation at the 
Interdepartmental Commission on the Coordination of the Actions 
of Banks and Law Enforcement Organs of a federal report of 
structures that are parasites on the market economy, and also 
the same kind of report on persons who work in these structures.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Teslenko: "The Largest Diamond Deposit </F>
Will Not Be Frozen"] 
  [Text] A representative conference on problems 
related to development of one of the world's largest diamond 
deposits in Arkhangelsk Oblast was held at the Roskomdragmet 
[Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious 
Stones] yesterday. The conference considered several alternative 
solutions. The principal discussion centered on a political 
solution of the feasibility of beginning mining operations. 
  The Deposit imeni Lomonosov is situated in an 
ecologically vulnerable area of the Arctic region with poor 
soils and powerful subterranean aquifer beds. The deposit's 
reserves are estimated at 130 million carats. The diamond 
content per metric ton of ore is approximately 0.6 carat, and 
about 50 percent of it is suitable for jewelry. 
  The "Severalmaz" AO [Joint-Stock Company] was formed by 
government decision in 1992 to develop the Deposit imeni 
Lomonosov. The principal stockholders are the Arkhangelsk Oblast 
Property Fund (25 percent), "Arkhangelskgeologiya" (16 percent), 
and "Atomredmetzoloto" (16 percent). The "Severalmaz" AO 
submitted an application on 2 November 1992 to the Roskomnedra 
[Russian Federation State Committee for Geology and the Use of 
Mineral Resources] for a license to develop the deposit. It took 
roughly a year in Moscow to coordinate the business plan, the 
financial report, the operation's ecological feasibility report, 
and other documents. In the opinion of KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts, 
not one of the three alternatives for mining operations (See 
table) is ecologically irreproachable. There has been no final 
decision on the fate of the deposit thus far. This should have 
been reached at yesterday's Roskomdragmet conference, to which 
executives of the Roskomnedra, the Minprirody [Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources], the Arkhangelsk 
Administration, and the "Severalmaz" AO itself were invited. 
Inasmuch as Arkadiy Lechugin, cochairman of the commission on a 
tender to prospect in the seven areas containing diamonds in 
Arkhangelsk Oblast, was present at the conference in Moscow, we 
will report on the results of the bid (See KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 
22 December) in tomorrow's issue.

    KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts believe that several alternative 
solutions could have been considered at the conference. The 
first one is the freezing of operations at the deposit, with the 
possible payment to the Arkhangelsk Administration of 
"compensation" from diamond-mining Yakutia. The second one is a 
recommendation to authorize the "Severalmaz" AO to undertake 
large-scale development. The third alternative is to advertise 
an international competition for the deposit. Finally, the most 
likely alternative is experimental-industrial development in the 
first stage (2 to 3 years) of two small pipes by two different 
technologies (an underground working and an open cut). 
  As Leonid Gurevich, deputy chairman of the Roskomdragmet, 
told a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, the conference managed to 
"make substantial progress." In the opinion of KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
experts, this means that the first alternative (freezing the 
deposit) was turned down.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Leontyev: "Diamond-Trade Zhirinovskiys </F>
Taking Advantage of an Opportunity: Political Chaos Is Allowing 
Destabilization of the World Diamond Market"] 
  [Text] The struggle to destroy the world diamond market was 
not the most prominent, but one of the most subtle pleasures of 
the late Supreme Soviet. A special committee on precious stones 
and metals was established in it, headed by Leonid Guryevich, 
the democratic television personality from Murmansk who somehow 
considered himself a great expert in this area, a sphere that is 
already rather greatly specialized. For his outstanding services 
in the field of destabilization of the diamond market following 
dissolution of the parliament, Mr. Guryevich was appointed 
deputy chairman of the Committee on Precious Metals. While the 
Ministry of Finance attempted long and unsuccessfully to remove 
the chairman of this committee, Yevgeniy Bychkov, from his 
position, accusing him with justification of numerous financial 
transgressions in which that very same Mr. Guryevich 
participated as a partner. Following the lead of the directors 
of the Russian Committee on Precious Metals (the former USSR 
State Valuables Depository), the parliamentary committee began 
to wage a campaign in the finest populist traditions regarding 
the seemingly extortionate agreement with the international De 
Beers corporation, a monopoly that sells all unprocessed Russian 
jewelry diamonds on the world market. 
  Some commentary on the particular features of the diamond 
market is necessary here. Expenditures of producers on the 
extraction and sale of unprocessed diamonds are not only great, 
they also involve a tremendous time lag between initial 
investment and sale. The entirety of diamond production in the 
world is maintained solely through sales of jewelry 
diamonds--the production of industrial-use diamonds in itself is 
unprofitable. The final stage of the diamond market--the sale of 
jewelry items containing cut diamonds--depends strictly on the 
economic situation that exists in the main consumer countries 
(United States, West Europe, Japan). That very "evil De Beers" 
spends more than $300 million on diamond advertisements, though 
not trading in diamonds at all, with the aim of boosting final 
demand. Stability of the economic state of the diamond 
production industry (or more simply--its survivability) is 
directly related to support for the stability of the world 
diamond market, which is provided by the De Beers monopoly and 
its central marketing organization (CMO). De Beers purchases raw 
diamonds from producers at fixed prices within the framework of 
a quota stipulated by agreements and bears a tremendous 
financial load, paying for stocks of raw diamonds during periods 
of poor market conditions. Indeed, De Beers controls the "free" 
diamond market exchange, buying up diamond contraband unloaded 
by diverse international variants of the demagogue Guryevich to 
circumvent existing agreements. Incidentally, one year ago De 
Beers was forced to spend 6-8 million pounds sterling per day to 
buy up contraband Angolan diamonds on the market which found 
their way to Antwerp as a result of the chaos caused by the 
civil war in Angola. 
  For the time being we do not have any civil war in Russia. 
Things are going excellently, however, with respect to chaos. 
Mr. Bychkov, a contender for the record in political 
survivability, and his colleague, Mr. Guryevich, have long been 
obsessed with the idea of increasing the percentage of jewelry 
diamonds sold freely and independently on the world market to 20 
percent. In this regard, these gentlemen are not disturbed by 
the fact that Russia lacks the assets for financing diamond 
stocks and all the commotion on the establishment of Russia's 
own "De Beers" died down after it became clear that the company 
Diamonds of Russia, established for this experiment, was unable 
to find hard currency to purchase the first consignment of 
diamonds from production enterprises. The zealots of diamond 
patriotism are not troubled by the fact that professionals 
engaged in the extraction and trade of raw diamonds are the most 
skeptical in assessing their labors. 
  It must be noted that rumors spread by certain figures with 
respect to some kind of supposedly fantastic CMO margin are 
related to a lack of understanding of the fact that De Beers is 
the largest producer in the world of raw diamonds (Republic of 
South Africa, Botswana) and is vitally concerned with stability 
of the market and market prices. In other words--in supporting 
the interests of the producers, just as Russia is. Let other 
people concern themselves about the diamond consumers--Mr. 
Bychkov and Mr. Guryevich, for example. 
  Until today, against the background of demagoguery and 
dealing in petty contraband through joint enterprises related to 
the Committee on Precious Metals, the fact that the contract 
with De Beers is effective until 1995 has been a restraining 
factor. However, a loophole has been discovered here, entirely 
unexpectedly it seems. First of all, the political state of 
affairs: the government has stated it will support a portion of 
the budget deficit through sales of diamond stocks of the 
Committee on Precious Metals on the domestic market. On the 
other hand, the fairly broad spectrum of low-carat raw diamonds 
previously considered industrial-use has become available for 
processing thanks to the selfless labor of Indian jewelers. It 
is these stones that the Committee on Precious Metals has 
decided to quietly unload on the Antwerp and Tel-Aviv markets. 
In this regard, all the experts of the Committee on Precious 
Metals and its subsidiary organizations, on the one hand, deny 
getting rid of raw diamonds, and on the other, revile the 
existing agreement with De Beers. Stating that "we have never 
unloaded diamonds in Antwerp," Boris Pozdnyakov, deputy chairman 
of the Committee on Precious Metals, strongly undermines the 
value of his guarantees. The USSR State Valuables Depository and 
its partners were once caught engaging in such business. Pavel 
Kovylin, representing Almazyuvelireksport, a branch of the 
company Diamonds of Russia-Sakha, acknowledges "the existence of 
a problem" on the intellectual level. He has not decided to 
express himself more definitively, however. 
  As a result, De Beers is spending money to buy up not 
Angolan 
but Russian diamonds (totaling close to $80 million in value), 
the understanding between Russia and its strategic partner for 
30 years is placed in doubt, and the market--in no way the least 
important from the point of view of Russia's long-term national 
interests--finds itself threatened, while Mr. Bychkov and Mr. 
Guryevich acquire capital based on this, political capital at 
the least. In principle, the logic displayed by the Committee on 
Precious Metals team coincides entirely with Zhirinovskiy's 
patriotic escapades, each of which will inflict real material 
damage to Russia in the form of falling prices for delivered raw 
material, insofar as the stability of shipments and potential 
capacity for reaching agreements with Russian partners are 
placed in doubt. Thus, the political and economic situation 
today has become for some people the long-awaited murky current 
where, as we know, one goes fishing.

<F P=106> [Article by NEZAVISIMOST columnist Yanina Sokolovskaya: "We </F>
Are Reaching Our Boiling Point--Ukraine May Be Overwhelmed 18 
January by an Unprecedented Strike"] 
  [Text] In a single instant, miners, dock workers, railroad 
workers, machinists, textile workers, air traffic controllers, 
and airline pilots flying foreign and domestic routes will cease 
work, city transportation will come to a halt... This is the 
decision made in a session of the executive committee of the 
association Free Trade Unions of Ukraine. The main demand of the 
All-Ukraine strike is the resignation of the Cabinet of 
Ministers and formation of a new government headed by Volodymyr 
Lanovyy, who is supposed to obtain all possible authority over 
the period prior to the elections and set about the conduct of 
economic reform. Resignation of the president is not yet a 
demand--in the opinion of the trade unions, "his task is not to 
interfere." 
  Until such time as these demands are met, Ukraine will 
constitute an appendage and will remain not only without coal, 
but without means of transportation and communications with the 
outside world as well. The scope of losses from such a strike of 
indefinite duration would be difficult to predict. 
  But we know for certain that the epicenter of the impending 
events will not be Donbass, but rather Kiev, where several 
large-scale enterprises will be the first to go on strike. 
Others will immediately follow--in all regions. In the opinion 
of Free Trade Unions, the "higher authorities" will better feel 
the impact of a strike begun in the capital than ordinary miners. 
  Lenin Forge and other industrial "monsters" in the capital 
have already repeatedly declared their desire to take part. 
  "Ukraine is reaching its boiling point"--noted Aleksandr 
Mril, leader of the Independent Trade Union of Miners. "Just one 
more small upheaval and the country will not survive to election 
time. If the trade unions do not today mount a strike, extremist 
forces will take advantage of the disarray of the masses--a 
situation fraught with the prospect of civil war." 
  But right now, independent trade union forces are looking at 
a specific common enemy: "the existing authority, under which 
people cannot live normally." 
  Meanwhile, even the obsolete Cabinet of Ministers has been 
granted a stay of execution of the trade union sentence and been 
given the opportunity to remain in their long-occupied seats, if 
they bring salaries into conformance with price increases in the 
course of a month and introduce a mechanism of anticipatory 
compensation. This is mentioned in the decree of the executive 
committee of Free Trade Unions which was distributed to the 
Supreme Council, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the president. 
  However, the workers do not believe that that which has 
remained undone over two years can be realized over the course 
of one month. Therefore, they are using the time remaining prior 
to 18 January to coordinate strike activities. Talks have been 
held with Volodymyr Lanovyy as well, whose candidacy for the 
position of prime minister elicits no objection from the 
population majority, it has become clear, or from most parties 
and movements, which have long discussed the need for 
professional economic leadership of the country. As the current 
leader of the Center for Market Reforms stated, he "will agree 
to accept the responsibility entrusted, taking into account the 
adversity of the economic situation in the country," and will 
take the first steps on a state level towards extricating the 
country out of crisis and stabilizing the socioeconomic 
situation. 
  In the opinion of the trade unions, this will prevent a 
"witch hunt" from taking place in Ukraine and will give the 
country a period of respite and the opportunity to survive until 
the elections. But here we recall information not as yet refuted 
by anyone: In the event of social conflicts in Ukraine, a state 
of emergency will be introduced and the elections will be 
postponed; a ban will be placed on political parties and 
movements, and other measures of a military nature will be 
enacted. A Ukraine-wide strike of indefinite duration more than 
constitutes suitable cause for a "state of emergency." 
  "Social conflicts in January-February may be used by the 
'higher authorities' as a pretext for introducing an 
illegitimate regime and government and prolonging the authority 
of the president. This will lead the country into a final 
impasse," V. Lanovyy believes. "The impending crisis has to 
yield positive results, for example--a revision of economic 
policy and the reactionary law on elections." 
  But then, in the opinion of trade union leaders, the "higher 
authorities" will be able only to proclaim a state of 
emergency--they will not have the power to implement it. And if 
this does take place, people will just become further convinced 
of the lengths to which their present leaders will go. And in 
that case, the year 1994 in our country will be covered with the 
banner of strike.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the commission </F>
of the Ukrainian parliament for foreign affairs, by Taras 
Petriv, GOLOS UKRAINY correspondent; place and date not given: 
"Dmytro Pavlychko: 'No One Should Dictate His Own Will'"] 
  [Text] Two years have already passed since the 
residents of Ukraine declared for independence on a wave of 
renewal and national enthusiasm. It is well known that any 
transformations do not come easily. But it is even more 
difficult given the significant influence of subjective factors. 
And it is a pity if the paths of social changes are not chosen 
entirely correctly and the existing opportunities are used 
irrationally. However, even in the most difficult times, it is 
not necessary to lose faith and reference points--so thinks 
Dmytro Pavlychko, the chairman of the commission of the 
Ukrainian parliament for foreign affairs, with whom our 
correspondent met--but it is necessary to search for mechanisms 
of resolution for both foreign and domestic problems. 
  [Petriv] Dmitriy Vasilyevich, first of all, let us dwell on 
the relations of Ukraine and Russia--after all, clouds have 
gathered over them in the course of recent years, and they have 
not yet dispersed. Every time the leaders and the ministers of 
foreign affairs of the two states meet, it seems that finally 
common sense will prevail, and that a compromise will be found. 
But everything remains as it was: Russia "presses," and Ukraine 
distrusts its northern ambitious neighbor more and more.... 
  [Pavlychko] At one moment these clouds get thicker and at 
another they scatter. But it is a pity: They are not 
disappearing, and we should not expect that there will be a 
sunny day soon. However, I believe: Everything is in motion; 
therefore, normal relations will be established between Ukraine 
and Russia. For example, the Odessa negotiations of A. Zlenko 
and A. Kozyrev were very positive. At this consultative meeting, 
the parties explained that about which they are guessing, but 
which they are not formulating clearly. The Russian side, for 
example, was always emphasizing: The Black Sea Fleet is an 
integral structure. But today, as it turned out, it can perceive 
the idea of a divisible fleet, and that it is necessary just to 
find the mechanism for this division. And this is 
understandable, for all previous agreements, as in part the last 
one, the Massandra agreement, are unacceptable to both 
countries. Although the Russian leadership is further insisting 
that it is necessary to rely precisely on it. But when it comes 
to the fact that Russia would have to pay more than $15 billion 
for half the Black Sea Fleet, the Russian representatives throw 
up their hands. It is necessary to note that misunderstandings 
keep coming up relative to the nuclear legacy as well. Russia 
does not in any way want to recognize Ukraine as the owner of 
nuclear weapons. 
  [Petriv] After the ratification of the START-1 treaty, 
Moscow 
accused our state of violating agreements. Russian diplomats 
headed a campaign of bringing pressure on Ukraine. A. Zlenko, 
the head of the Ukrainian foreign policy department, was also 
compelled even to declare that there is not a particle of truth 
in Russia's accusations.... 
  [Pavlychko] Ukraine has already given up tactical nuclear 
weapons and did not receive any kind of compensation for them. 
Therefore, we cannot once again agree to the same thing. We also 
think that now the nuclear weapons deployed on our territory 
play a definite deterrent role. And therefore, we insist that 
joining the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons be 
carried over into the future. And, at the same time, we are 
going toward a nuclear-free status. But this road can be 
determined only by us, and no one should dictate his own will to 
us. We should transform the nuclear weapons on our territory 
into political guarantees of independence. For as a people and 
as a nation, we are under a threat. 
  [Petriv] Could not the quick signing of an interstate treaty 
at least somehow stabilize Ukrainian-Russian relations? 
  [Pavlychko] Such a document is already half prepared. Work 
is 
continuing on points that deal with border questions. In our 
view, the existing borders between Ukraine and Russia should be 
guaranteed with this treaty. And it is again strange: The 
Russian side is trying to get by in this case with some general 
phrases, but we are proposing the exact wording that was 
recorded in the Ukrainian-Russian treaty of 1990. Unfortunately, 
this also indicates that the Russian side intends in the future 
to return to the territorial issue. 
  [Petriv] The question arises: Why does Ukraine not come out 
more actively for military cooperation with Western countries, 
and first of all with its neighbors--Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, 
and the Czech Republic? 
  [Pavlychko] Russia is trying in every possible way to 
restore 
the empire: At one time by means of the CIS structure, and at 
another, by means of an economic union. In my opinion, I think 
that it is necessary at any price to develop the closest ties 
with our close neighbors. If we will be able to arrange 
political, cultural, and economic contacts with them, then this 
will gradually free us from an excessive Eastern orientation. 
After all, the newest technologies and social democracy can come 
to us from Europe. 
  However, our strategic path, after uniting with our Western 
neighbors, is not to create an anti-Russian alliance, but, on 
the contrary, to establish good relations with Western Europe in 
the Russian Eurasian space through a Black Sea-Baltic system. 
Through a unique Europeanization of Ukraine, Russia would be 
closer to Europe. Let us recall history. Europe and Russia have 
always adjoined on Ukrainian land, and here European 
civilization was victorious at one time and Russo-Mongolian at 
another time. And, therefore, it is necessary that these two 
planes not destroy each other, but harmonize. 
  We must compel the silence of the Moscow imperialists. And 
it 
is necessary to do this not only with the help of a compromising 
policy, but also through a firm will. Therefore, it is necessary 
to emphasize: If Russia is democratic, Europe will be calm, and 
if it strives to dominate, this will serve as a reason for fear 
among the new independent states and a pull toward NATO. 
  [Petriv] Dmitriy Vasilyevich, the election campaign for 
seats 
in the new parliament is now proceeding at full speed. Is this 
not the reason why the work of your commission has abated? 
  [Pavlychko] Actually, we are not working as intensively as 
formerly. It must be said that over these years the activity of 
the commission has been quite intense. Although its staff is 
rather polarized, and it is very difficult to work. It 
frequently could not reach an agreement. At the same time, in 
critical moments, such as, for example, a decision of the 
Russian parliament regarding Sevastopol, it was able to come 
together. And therefore, I want to note that the commission did 
a lot in its field. 
  [Petriv] In your opinion, what will the new Supreme Council 
of Ukraine be like? 
  [Pavlychko] The first trouble with the old parliament is 
that 
it was not structured. And now the parties have still not grown 
numerically. The fact that the Supreme Council did not go for a 
mixed system, but voted for a majority system, reflects the 
position of the parliamentary majority and, in particular, of 
those who want to speak in their own name, for they are 
brilliant individualities. In their opinion, people will vote 
for them. Therefore, I fear most of all that we will once again 
represent ourselves in the new parliament, when every deputy 
will represent only his personal program, and not a specific 
political force. Then we will again pull each other by the 
forelock ad infinitum, instead of parliamentary groups gathering 
and deciding what should be done. 
  [Petriv] In this case, neither the president nor the 
chairman 
of the Supreme Council insisted on a mixed electoral system.... 
  [Pavlychko] Leonid Kravchuk and Ivan Plyushch, as well as 
the 
representatives of the president in the localities, remain 
indifferent to political parties. But our leaders do not want to 
think of themselves within the framework of any kind of party. 
We say that now there is a so-called party of power. Then let 
these people gather and say that we are organizing into some 
kind of structure, and there is no clarity, but there is 
vacillation. Ukraine is going into the elections when the voters 
are in absolute perplexity. However, despite all of this, I 
believe that the next Supreme Council will be better. 
  [Petriv] Will the democratic forces, given the disunity of 
ideas and leaders, unite in one centrist-reformation bloc that 
would not let either the extreme left wing or the extreme right 
wing win a majority in parliament? 
  [Pavlychko] I think that if we do not go into the elections 
as a united democratic bloc, then we will lose. And it is 
important not only for the parties to unite, but also for 
individuals. Going into the elections, we understand that it is 
necessary for the democrats to establish some kind of 
coordination council so that we would not fight each other, 
because, for example, the situation will be entirely different 
in Western Ukraine than in the East. Is a variant possible where 
democratic forces will come out in the elections as a unified 
political force, and afterwards structure themselves in 
parliament? It is better if we unite in a single political 
party. And it is necessary to conduct a congress even before the 
elections. Then we would easily be able to win seats in 
parliament and be victorious in it. 
  [Petriv] Dmitriy Vasilyevich, have you already decided to 
put 
forward your candidacy for the new parliament? Since it is 
rumored that allegedly you will head the Ukrainian diplomatic 
mission to one of the countries of the West.... 
  [Pavlychko] I will not go as ambassador to any country. For 
I 
would not feel very good. The people are in trouble, and if I 
agreed to a position that, possibly, I have even earned, then I 
would look like a deserter. Therefore, I decided to go into the 
parliament. 
  [Petriv] Are you prepared to put forward your candidacy for 
the post of president of Ukraine in June 1994, if the elections 
are held? 
  [Pavlychko] It is necessary to consider the situation 
realistically. I am convinced that the leader of the state must 
not yet be very old, he must possess economic knowledge, and he 
must have a number of good qualities. I am already 65; 
therefore, I am convinced it is too late to talk about this. I 
think that the elections will be held. Because Leonid 
Makarovych, probably, will not do what was done by the Russian 
leader who at first announced the elections, but afterwards went 
back on his word.

  [Text] And not at just one, furthermore, but simultaneously 
at several congresses, which were held in Kiev last Saturday and 
Sunday. And all parties, from the Greens through the Reds, 
discussed not what the year had been like but plans for the 
future and set their sights on the elections. 
  All their platforms cannot be described (except for a 
separate fee, perhaps). But we do not have the right to pass 
over the forum of the Socialist Party. For if a week ago we 
presented an account of the Fifth Rukh Congress, God himself has 
ordained for balance a description of the Third Socialist Party 
of Ukraine Congress. I was at all its previous congresses and 
have the chance to make comparisons. Whereas previously they 
passed off imperceptibly somehow, semi-clandestinely almost, 
now.... Diplomats' Volvos at the main entrance, almost a hundred 
journalists from many countries of the world, numerous guests, 
greetings in various languages. To save time not all of them 
were read out but A. Moroz, chairman of the Socialist Party, 
acquainted the delegates with one of them as he opened the 
congress. This was a message of congratulations from G. 
Zyuganov--leader of Russia's communists.... 
  The delegates heard two reports: one, very brief, on the 
organizing and political work in the year since the last 
congress, and the second--lengthy, discursive--on the platform 
of the Socialist Party at the future elections. It was discussed 
tumultuously, but without an overstepping of the mark, and the 
majority of observations was to the point and opportune, as they 
say. It was clear from the tone of the speeches that the times 
when a presidential candidate laid his hands on supreme power 
with the aid of five "D's are gone. There is no getting by 
merely with letters today, and for this reason the election 
platforms (with the Rukh people also, incidentally) vie in terms 
of length with the platforms of the suburban-line commuter 
trains almost. 
  The election program of the Socialist Party of Ukraine is 
fully accommodated in its title: "Toward Socialism--Via the 
Power of the People, Prosperity, and Security." It emphasizes 
that the main, urgent method of averting economic catastrophe 
and starvation is control, accounting and regulation on the part 
of the state and the working people of the development of 
production and the distribution of food and the preservation of 
the plant outfits. Liberal, national-democratic, and 
pro-bourgeois parties advocating liberalization and 
privatization are up in arms against this. The socialists are 
opposed to the plunder of the working people beneath verbiage 
about a socially oriented economy. 
  "The moment of truth is at hand. We are beginning each 
individually and all together to recover our sight, recognizing 
how much in our life has been lost and what a difficult future 
awaits us and our children, our Ukraine," the appeal to the 
people of Ukraine adopted at the congress says. Its participants 
emphasized once again that, as distinct from other parties, the 
socialists are not aiming at their party's unfailing assumption 
of office. They will support at the elections any honest 
competent candidate, a nonparty candidate included, who agrees 
with them on what is most important: the basis of the good 
fortune of each individual may only be conscientious and 
productive labor. There must be neither master nor serf in 
Ukraine. 
  In conversation with journalists A. Moroz, who was 
unanimously reelected leader of the Socialist Party of Ukraine, 
said that, in his opinion, the forces of the left would obtain 
more than half the vote at the elections. About 20 percent will 
vote for the Socialist Party, he believes. 
  The special issue of TOVARISHCH put out for the congress 
also 
published the platform of the Communist Party of Ukraine. It is 
entitled "For Social Justice and the Salvation of Spirituality, 
for the True Power of the People and a Life Worthy of Man." The 
Central Electoral Commission the same day registered to 
participate in the elections as entry No. 1 the Ukrainian 
Republican Party, as No. 2, the Communist Party of Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Skachko, observer: "A Lesson of </F>
Post-All-Union Significance. They Called Out in Russia, They 
Responded Everywhere, in Ukraine Too. For the Elections Are 
Close at Hand"] 
  [Text] Kiev-Moscow-Kiev--With assistance from the 
"East-East" program and the international Restoration fund, I 
was in Moscow on 12 December and the night before, and I can 
attest to the fact that if fascism or revisionism came to power 
there, it was surprisingly quietly. Or, as the observant poet 
would say, to the sound of snow falling on Moscow streets, 
transforming certain of them, uncleaned probably since the 
beginning of perestroyka, into an impassable muddy quagmire. It 
is as though the white snow covered up the surface with a 
calming shroud, but the next minute everything clumsy and 
uncouth, nasty and disfigured, could be seen clearly through it. 
Just as the real free elections showed how much darkness there 
is in the souls of Russians and in the attitudes of decent 
citizens and what they can say when there is nobody standing 
behind them, watching them.... 
  The night before the "great day," only the Russian 
anarchists gathered, following tradition, in front of the 
monument to Pushkin; they rallied, and they handed out to 
passersby appeals that clearly "cast down" a plague on all 
Russian political houses: "The December elections will do 
nothing for us; they will merely legalize the dictatorship of 
the apparatchiks and the new rich speculators. But today's 
`communist,' nationalist, and `democratic' opposition is no 
better. The struggle among the politicians is not for freedom 
and democracy, but for power, for the right to grab more, to 
decide which of them will plunder and steal....but if everyone 
has already understood that no elections or referendums will 
change anything--do not go to the elections, do not 
vote--resist!... The parties are fighting to control the people; 
we are for having the people control themselves!" 
  But the Russians did go to the polls, the elections did 
take place, and their results, in my opinion, are of 
significance for all former Union republics where elections are 
still to be held and particularly, of course, for Ukraine. 
<H5>  First Lesson: Zhirinovskiy Did Not Win--the Democrats Lost </H5>
  Even Leon Trotsky called Hitler's Fascist Party a "party of 
counterrevolutionary despair," because the brownshirts came to 
power using populist slogans as, incidentally, the Bolsheviks 
also once did, playing on the atmosphere of government 
instability and attitudes of no confidence either in the present 
or in the future on the part of the majority of simple citizens. 
Vladimir Volfovich's political formula was also simple: If you 
want power, press on the sore spots, on the "pet corns" of the 
Russians, who are suffering from nervous exhaustion, promise 
them a "great Russia" and expose their "traitors" and enemies. 
And it is desirable to do this frequently, persistently, and 
simply enough for a moron to understand. 
  Zhirinovskiy did this. And today it is not so important that 
even before the session of the State Duma he abandoned the 
majority of his propositions. The magic of simple-calming, 
optimistic-encouraging words had done its work. 
  I was told about the following episode at an election 
precinct. One young person was asking another: "Who did you vote 
for?" "For Zhirinovskiy," was the answer. "What do you 
mean?!"--the first one was surprised, making a gesture as though 
the other were crazy. "And why not, look at what this will do to 
the country," the second one defended his position. And this is 
instructive: Zhirinovskiy was operating in a strange mixture of 
hope and hopelessness, belief in the possibility of change and 
disbelief in the idea that any of the current leaders would do 
anything real. 
  And the Russian democrats? They, unfortunately, as we know, 
were unable to join together. Possibly in fact they, as Gaydar 
said, are capable of doing this only two hours before the 
shooting starts, but this is the most important lesson for 
Ukrainian reformers: They need unity. 
  I returned to Kiev with a Ukrainian businessman who has an 
office and a firm in Berlin, works through Moscow, and expects 
Kiev to provide stability and certainty. He explained the 
Russian situation to me in his own way: "If you need a razor to 
shave, you go to the store. And if you see many good razors 
there but they are all of the same kind, differing only in 
appearance, you might not choose any of them but buy one 
somewhere where the selection is simple but there is only one 
choice." Thus the esteemed democrat reformers "a la Ukraine" as 
we already know today are offering us a diversity of political 
views with various nuances. The main mistake of the Russian 
democrats was in tactics: Along with their personal ambitions, 
they were counting on the idea that by separating they could 
offer the voters various versions of the democratic option 
(thus, if Gaydar does not suit you--vote for Shakhray or 
Yavlinskiy), but the voters demanded clarity. The democrats of 
Russia did not take into account the low level of political 
sophistication of the electorate. 
  And there is one more thing which, in my view, requires no 
commentary. Even on the day before the elections, the executive 
committee of Russia's Choice wrote: "It is already possible to 
sum up certain results of the brief but noisy campaign 
(election--V.S.). It is obvious to everyone that it took place 
according to the pattern of '12 against one.' One was the 
Russia's Choice bloc and 12--the other participants in the 
political race. ....The methods of the battle between the 
`people's defenders' and the `strict reformers' was the same as 
before: accusations bursting from the television screens but not 
confirmed by anything, insidious hints anonymously released to 
the mass media, appeals to the very worst instincts." And so, 
esteemed participants in the Ukrainian race, if you really 
believe that Ukraine needs reforms, agree on which specific ones 
and allow as little ambition and underhandedness as possible and 
encourage as much analysis and tolerance as possible. 
<H5>  The Second Lesson: Reforms Are Needed in Any Case </H5>
  The strangest phenomenon in Ukraine after the elections in 
Russia might be the appearance of attitudes indicating something 
like this: You see where the Russian reforms led--first of all, 
the people were impoverished and then, against this background, 
the fascists came to power. Of course, such assertions make a 
certain amount of sense. But on the other hand: Have the people 
in Ukraine been any less impoverished? Probably much more so; 
our standard of living is considerably lower than the Russians'. 
And herein lies the basic and principal distinction between the 
Russian and Ukrainian situations. "Gaydareconomics," which is 
based on "shock therapy," actually did lower the standard of 
living of the people, but it launched the reforms and so it gave 
them a light at the end of the tunnel, namely--hope of 
improvement. 
  But in Ukraine the standard of living has declined without 
any reforms. The external appearance of reforms has frequently 
even discredited the very idea of reforms when they are 
discussed, and property is being quietly stolen under a barrage 
of verbiage. But this kind of "reform Ukrainian-style" should in 
no way deter the future political elite from reforms. The only 
thing that can really be learned from the Russian experience, in 
my opinion, is this formula: as little shock as possible and as 
much therapy as possible. If, of course, this is possible under 
our present conditions. And our voters too must make a certain 
choice and not make a mistake. For we too could have our own 
Zhirinovskiy. But he would capitalize not on the idea of a 
"great Ukraine" but on the need to impose order with a strong 
hand. Both orthodox and turncoat communist-socialists of Ukraine 
fit this role better than others. 
<H3>  The Third Lesson: If You Help the Democrat, You Will Have To 
Deal With His Opposite </H3>
  In Ukraine people have been saying frequently that it is 
necessary to join forces with real Russian democrats because, 
they say, herein lies the guarantee of our independence. And 
even based on Vinnichenko's definition of the Russian democrat, 
which ends where Ukrainian independence begins, this assertion 
has been true. It seems to me that perhaps we should have been 
more oriented toward Russian pragmatists, but we had to find 
political partners among those who, because of various 
convictions, have recognized Ukraine's uniqueness to one degree 
or another. And this had to be done persistently and concretely. 
Then we would not have had today's deficit of the 
Ukrainian-Russian trade balance, which is not in favor of 
Ukraine, such an immense amount of indebtedness, and such a lack 
of regulation of the mechanism for mutual settlements. But, as 
our president says, we have what we have. 
  But joint actions among democrats will become considerably 
more crucial after these elections. Because the Russian 
Government will inevitably have to take into account the 
attitudes of the political forces represented in the State Duma 
of Russia. And we know what Zhirinovskiy, Zyuganov, et al think 
about Ukraine, so economic and political pressure on Ukraine 
will increase. Therefore, official Kiev must prepare for this 
even today and in some way or another be concerned about how we 
will pay for Russian energy sources in January. I personally 
would be in favor of reforms, freedom of the producer, free 
exports, which would provide the necessary freely convertible 
currency, concrete negotiations with Russia, and a business 
alliance with its healthy political forces. But I am a 
journalist, and our leadership, perhaps, has learned different 
lessons....

<F P=106> [Interview with Vitold Pavlovych Fokin, president of the </F>
Ukrainian International Fund of Humanitarian and Economic 
Relations With the Russian Federation, by Lyudmila Menzhulina; 
place and date not given; names as transliterated: "Vitold 
Fokin: `It Is Useless To Try To Pull the Scanty Blanket of 
Social Protection Over Everyone. There Is Only One Way Not To 
Freeze--Get Moving'"] 
  [Text] The announcement concerning the establishment 
in Ukraine of the International Fund of Humanitarian and 
Economic Relations With the Russian Federation has already made 
the rounds of practically all radio, television, and newspaper 
editorial offices. The restraint of the commentaries on the fact 
was absolutely amazingly offset by the tone of voice of the 
announcers, or by the style of exposition of the journalists. So 
one heard or read a suppressed: "Well, at last!" 
  It goes without saying that, although the unnatural 
confrontation of our countries and peoples is brief in an 
historical space of time, it has frayed nerves, and it has very 
strongly dampened spirits. 
  Now people are continually calling up and are asking 
with what and how they can assist the development of the new 
fund, and they are placing great hopes on it. 
  But, apparently, not only hopes. Some are also 
tormented by doubts. Has not its ex-prime minister conceived of 
returning Ukraine to the old times? Vitold Pavlovich himself 
explained during the meeting how during the presentation of the 
fund he had received a note (the only one of its kind) whose 
author--a people's deputy--was amazed by everything: From the 
number of stars in the emblem to the title. He was almost ready 
to accuse the founders of the new formation of espionage in 
favor of Russia, and he did not at all share the happiness of 
those in attendance. 
  In general, our extensive conversation today with the 
ideological inspirer, creator, and president of the fund, Vitold 
Pavlovich Fokin, was prompted both by good wishes and harsh 
necessity. We will also construct it in the same key, 
alternating the free and easy interview "with a line of 
protocol," that is to say, a document that is a report on the 
triumph of the presentation. 
  But, then, whatever one sees in this--nostalgia or very 
sound and timely thoughts--let it be a matter that is left to 
the readers. Thus.... 
<H5>  "Has Life Really Improved Because We Destroyed the Bastille?" </H5>
  [Menzhulina] Vitold Pavlovich, first of all, accept the 
sincerest greetings that arrive at the editorial office for you 
as the head of the fund, and wishes for its prosperity. Now 
allow me to ask, with what kind of wonderful forces were you 
able in such a short period of time (on 16 November, we reported 
on the constituent meeting, and already the registration and 
presentation have taken place) to start such a grandiose 
undertaking--the International Fund for Humanitarian and 
Economic Relations With the Russian Federation?" 
  [Fokin] You know, it would be biased to say that this idea 
arose just now and was instantly implemented. The story here is 
not simple, like everything else that has occurred here in 
recent times. 
  When the first government of an independent Ukraine was 
replaced, the relations between the structures of the executive 
authority of Ukraine and Russia were noticeably "strained." I do 
not want to blame anyone personally, but statements of 
gentlemen--who got into key positions in the Cabinet of 
Ministers on the "general list"--began to be leaked more and 
more frequently to the press. I do not think that this was being 
done, as they say, out of stupidity. They were guided more 
frequently by a desire to do what was in vogue and to curry 
favor with influential politicians, who by virtue of clear 
reasons were unable to comprehend the complicated interweaving 
of the mutual production ties that had developed over dozens of 
years between the subjects of Ukraine and Russia. 
  Some of the mass media organs of both countries also 
prospered in this unseemly matter. 
  And then at that time, the end of last year, the thought 
occurred: Voluntary self-isolation and the policy of 
autonomization of production do not respond to the national 
interests of the state. You must not, as Englishmen say, throw 
stones at your neighbor if you yourself live in a glass house. 
By curtailing the export of products to Russia and violating an 
already strained payments balance with that country, it is 
impossible to count on the stable delivery to Ukraine of oil, 
gas, lumber materials, and other products. Such actions make an 
energy crisis inevitable. Cooperative ties must not be 
disrupted--this will lead only to a complete shutdown of 
enterprises. Is it really possible not to take a real fact into 
consideration: Only 20 percent of the total number of industrial 
enterprises of Ukraine have a closed production cycle? 
  And further. The entire world is fighting for sales markets. 
But we pass off as a great achievement the reduction of exports 
to Russia of such types of products that are traditional for 
Russia as, for example, sugar. The world market is oversaturated 
with favorite commodities, and Russia, having overcome some 
bewilderment, has renewed contracts and begun to receive sugar 
from other importers. What did Ukraine win from this? 
Discussions about the fact that Russia allegedly switched to 
mutual settlements at world prices in a unilateral procedure 
also seem to be idle talk. It is enough to look over the 
protocols of the summit meeting in Dagomys to become convinced 
of the opposite. 
  In short, it became clear as early as in December of last 
year that without close cooperation with enterprises and 
organizations of Russia, and without an honest and businesslike 
partnership on a principally new and mutually beneficial basis, 
the newly constituted government (like, moreover, any other) 
will not be able to lead the state out of the crisis. 
<H5>  From V. Fokin's Report at the Presentation of the Fund </H5>
  To our great regret, the political and economic differences 
between Ukraine and Russia are becoming more noticeable of late. 
The states are literally drifting in opposite directions. This 
is equally unsafe for the people of both countries and is 
equally negatively perceived by the people. Therefore, it is 
necessary to adopt the most decisive measures so that what is 
still a small crack does not become an abyss. 
  That which we have today--cooled-down blast furnaces, idle 
rolling mills, stalled motor vehicles, curtailed television 
programs--all of this will also turn into a misfortune for 
Russian enterprises as well. 
  I believe in the courage and selflessness of our people, and 
in their ability to overcome difficulties and to defend their 
statehood. But is it moral to rely only on the infinite patience 
of the people? Let us recall history. 
  "You have achieved what you wanted," the Parisians told the 
leaders of the great French Revolution, "but what did we get out 
of it? Has life really gotten better because we destroyed the 
Bastille?" 
  Substitute the word "Commonwealth" for the word "Bastille," 
and this question will sound quite pressing. However, it is not 
a question of reviving old ties, and it is not about 
resurrecting the former state structures and the "fraternal 
embrace" imposed from above. It is impossible to restore them. 
It is necessary to establish principally new relations whose 
basis will be economic expediency, mutual gains, reciprocal 
trust, and an honest partnership. 
  Not one government is capable of achieving this without 
public support. The unity and goodwill of the entire society is 
necessary for this. 
<H5>  There Are Questions.... </H5>
  [Menzhulina] A great number of all kinds of treaties and 
agreements were adopted during the period of the creation of the 
CIS. What was the problem, and why did they not work for unity 
and mutually advantageous contacts? 
  [Fokin] Initially, the treaty on cooperation of the 
independent states provided for the creation of a kind of 
coordination center, with its quarters in the capital of 
Belarus--Minsk. After a certain time, this was rejected for 
well-known reasons. Therefore, the state agreements and treaties 
that were being concluded on a bilateral and multilateral basis 
lost even a minimum capability of functioning, inasmuch as there 
was a lack not only of a mechanism of responsibility, but even 
control over its fulfillment. In addition, Russia, while 
conducting a policy of rapid destatization and privatization, 
more than two years ago abandoned the practice of the state 
order, thereby losing (in contrast to Ukraine) the right to 
conclude a treaty concerning mutual deliveries, inasmuch as it 
stopped being the de facto owner of produced products. In 
general, this also led to this kind of conclusion: Cooperation 
between two states, basically, should move to the plane of 
business partnership of enterprises and organizations. 
  This is what was done in practice. After the elimination of 
the central planning and distribution organs, economic life 
continued only where production ties between enterprises were 
preserved. 
  By creating the fund, its founders were not thinking of 
replacing the government, and especially of operating counter to 
its decisions. Our task is to assume functions that are not 
peculiar to the state under the new economic conditions. First 
and foremost, to assist the producer irrespective of the form of 
ownership. Retaining for itself the right of legislative 
initiative, we will submit appropriate drafts to the government 
for examination. 
<H5>  From the Report at the Presentation </H5>
  It is becoming more and more difficult to link up our 
production, financial, and state interests. We are already at 
different levels. Russia, in spite of serious political and 
social shocks, has moved much farther along the path of reform. 
  A majority of the large enterprises have been converted to 
joint-stock companies. Practically the entire population has 
been involved in this. The securities market is working 
energetically, and this is one of the most important indices of 
the market economy. The actual convertibility of the ruble is 
stimulating small and average business. 
  Important changes are occurring in the psychology of the 
people. Russia's public is already thinking in new categories. 
Therefore, it is becoming more and more difficult for a 
director, for example, of a Ukrainian state plant to conduct 
negotiations with his own Russian partner--the head of a 
joint-stock company. 
  But it is necessary and possible to overcome difficulties. 
Labor collectives of former subcontractors remain, and directors 
are left who know their colleagues from what now already are 
neighboring countries, and they maintain friendly relations with 
them. They have all felt the effects of the artificially 
violated cooperation on their own problems. 
  That is why the idea of the creation of a nongovernmental 
organization that would speak in support of the intensification, 
coordination, and development of Ukrainian-Russian relations 
immediately found an enormous number of supporters. 
  Organizing business relations and close partnership with the 
Russian Federation in the most diverse spheres of human endeavor 
is an objectively recognized necessity. 
<H5>  "Every Fruit Should Ripen" </H5>
  [Menzhulina] Did you not have problems with registering the 
fund? I wonder what response the idea on its creation had "at 
the top?" 
  [Fokin] From time to time, I did not want to disclose my 
intention. I was not confident that I would be supported if I 
came out in March or April. At that time, everyone was going 
around with raised spirits and satisfied that they had got 
through the winter and finished the sowing. They could have 
said: Why do we need this fund, which directs its own activity 
at the creation of production and economic relations with 
Russia, when we also were not born yesterday? 
  Now, this will not be said. And not only because a real 
threat hangs over millions of socially unprotected citizens of 
Ukraine. 
  I hope that there will be no starvation. The state does have 
grain. But it is impossible to live day by day. It is necessary 
to think about the coming year, about work under winter 
conditions, and to organize a normal, decent life. Under these 
conditions, I think, with the help of the fund, it will be 
possible to arrive at a resolution of many problems. 
  When I acquainted the president with my desire, I 
immediately 
met with his approval, and I felt support. Leonid Makarovich 
read the first variant of the charter and appended his 
resolution: The matter is very interesting, worth doing, and it 
is necessary to implement it as rapidly as possible. Specialists 
of the Ministry of Justice and Minister V.V. Onopenko himself 
gave us good support. Despite substantial remarks, corrections, 
and additions, there was no barrier against registration. The 
constituent assembly was conducted just as quickly and 
effectively. 
  [Menzhulina] Vitold Pavlovich, could you outline the circle 
of friends of the fund from the Ukrainian and Russian sides? 
  [Fokin] Clearly, the leaders of the most competent and 
largest organizations and enterprises had the final say. I am 
extremely grateful to Boris Yevgenyevich Paton, Larisa Ivanovna 
Khorolets.... 
  We were supported by the metallurgists and machine builders 
and, moreover, by the workers and leadership of such flagships 
of industry as Yuzhmash, the Malyshev Plant, Luganskteplovoz, 
the Dnepropetrovsk electric locomotive building plant, the NPO 
[scientific production association] imeni Korolev, the Kiev 
radio plant, and many others. 
  All at once, a circle of like-thinkers took shape: Gennadiy 
Petrovich Levchenko, Vladimir Ilich Kassov, Yuriy Sergeyevich 
Alekseyev, Bogdan Nikolayevich Lishchin, Dmitriy Gavrilovich 
Topchiy.... Well, I cannot name all of them. 
  The founders of the fund from Russia were: The Russian 
Lumber 
Producers Corporation, the Izhevsk joint-stock company Bummash 
and the joint-stock company Investles, the Krasnoyarsk machine 
building plant, the Kotlass pulp and paper combine, and others. 
<H5>  "If There Is Grain, There Will Be Singing" </H5>
  [Menzhulina] Vitold Pavlovich, the founding documents assign 
first place to humanitarian relations, but life's realities are 
such that the economy, nevertheless, comes first. Does this mean 
that economic relations will have priority? 
  [Fokin] There is a saying among the people: If there is 
grain, there will be singing. Of course, a nation cannot exist 
without spirituality and culture. But the economy really comes 
first, because society, as long as it exists, is compelled to 
consume. But this also means, to produce. As soon as this chain 
is broken, catastrophe is inevitable. 
  [Menzhulina] If you were the head of government today and 
someone established such a fund, how would you perceive this? 
  [Fokin] But of course, I would support such an idea and 
would 
bring the initiators closer, and I would grant them broad 
powers. I also expect the same attitude from the present 
government. I am glad that the Cabinet of Ministers has already 
demonstrated its goodwill, at least by the fact that it was 
almost fully represented at the presentation. 
  But we are only at the start of a long path. There is a sea 
of difficulties. 
  For the time being, we have no material base, we have no 
place to quarter ourselves, and we have not established a 
charter fund. But, as the saying goes, there is a time for 
everything. It is important now to understand and to adopt 
objectively: The fund is created, it exists, and it has begun to 
work. 
<H5>  From the Report at the Presentation </H5>
  One of the reasons for the critical condition of many 
enterprises and organizations is the artificially created 
barriers for ways to process payment documents. One of our tasks 
is to be a reliable helper of the commodity producers in the 
resolution of this problem. I think that we are capable of 
removing this tension, at least partially, from the members of 
the fund. 
  For this purpose, a specially designated bank credit system 
will be established jointly with Russian partners. 
  The fund intends to offer material and methodical assistance 
to state organizations and representatives of the private sector 
of the economy engaged in the creation of new capacities and 
increasing the existing capacities of functioning industries 
that produce industrial and household and cultural commodities. 
  We will conduct a purposeful search for partners for the 
development of projects of destatization, privatization, and 
conversion to joint-stock companies. Appropriate proposals will 
be submitted to government structures. The fund is preparing to 
finance the work of expert groups whose members will be leading 
specialists of Ukraine, Russia, and other countries. 
  We also have one extraordinary function--to perform as the 
guarantor of the founders. The fund has already today united the 
enormous scientific-intellectual and financial-material 
potential that its founders possess. With time, they will be 
joined by new social and scientific organizations, industrial, 
construction, and transport enterprises, and by the agrarian 
economy. I do not doubt that this will be of interest not only 
to domestic, but also to foreign investors. 
  The fund will also be able to assist in the resolution of 
such a complicated problem as providing consumers with 
electricity. 
  We are not relying very much on the effectiveness of 
interstate relations on this question. It seems that a program 
of investment of the energy complex of Russia on joint ownership 
rights is significantly more effective. 
  We are also setting ourselves the task of collecting and 
disseminating truthful and objective information about the 
condition of social life in Ukraine. It is no secret that of 
late both the Ukrainian and Russian mass media seem to be 
competing in prejudices. And for this, it is not at all 
mandatory to misinterpret or distort facts. It is enough to 
permit only those reports on the air or in newspaper columns 
that carry in themselves a frankly negative charge. The 
constituent conference discussed the question of publishing 
Ukrainian newspapers in Russia. With time, proposals will be 
studied regarding the establishment of general Ukrainian-Russian 
information agencies--television and radio channels. 
  Several words regarding the liberalization of foreign 
economic relations. It is not a great honor to be a dependent. 
Therefore, in directing the activity of the fund, we will 
acquire the understanding and support of world opinion, close 
cooperation with all international states, and public, 
religious, and of other organizations that are considering 
overcoming the crisis situation in Ukraine, raising the standard 
of living, and creating conditions for the democratic 
transformation of our society as a problem of international 
significance, and as a guarantee of peace and security in Europe. 
  Our fund also has a humanitarian direction. The difficulties 
of the transition period are hitting first and foremost public 
education and health services specifically. Therefore, among the 
main tasks of the fund is real support of the social and 
cultural sphere. 
<H5>  In Place of an Epilogue </H5>
  [Menzhulina] Vitold Pavlovich, our readers would not 
understand us if we passed over the question in our interview 
with you about today's alarming situation. Ukraine and its 
people are literally feverish from inescapable problems. In your 
opinion, as a former head of the government, where is the error, 
and wherein lies a possible solution? 
  [Fokin] The main thing is to preserve peace and unity, and 
to 
work for the future. That which we now hear from various 
sides--protests, warnings about possible strikes, reproaches 
directed at the leadership of the country--all of this, 
unfortunately, is not groundless. But it is necessary to display 
self-restraint and lawfulness, and we must support the new 
elections to parliament. Of course, the situation is very 
difficult for the leaders of trade unions and the workers' 
movement. Their sacred duty is to defend the interests and to 
achieve the social protection of all elements of society, but, 
first and foremost, of the workers. And nevertheless, while 
insisting on an increase in wages, they must understand that it 
is impossible to pull a very short blanket over everyone. The 
state is not in a condition to protect all members of society 
equally. I, in principle, support the plan of the Cabinet of 
Ministers to develop a program of national salvation, if it only 
determines who specifically the state should take under its 
guardianship. I am convinced that this is pensioners, invalids, 
children in large families, servicemen, and student youth. 
Scientific, cultural, health servicing, and educational 
organizations retain a special status. Only they have a right to 
enjoy subsidies from the budget. And even the super-important 
branches of production should not receive any kind of subsidy. 
At the same time, the focus should be placed on the regional 
organs of administration. And the budget should be developed 
from below, taking into account the local requirements and 
capabilities for social protection. The national salvation 
budget can be developed in half a year with a breakdown into 
quarters. 
  As for able-bodied citizens, let them not be offended by me, 
they will have to work with blood and sweat--apparently there is 
not enough "blanket" for them. They will have to work like the 
people worked in Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and other 
countries. No one there measured the duration of a work week. 
There was no other way out. As it is here now. 
  [Begin boxed item] From the Congratulatory Letters of 
the Presidents of Ukraine and Russia to the Fund Founders 
  "Ukraine attaches exceptional significance to the 
development 
of multilateral and equal relations with all countries of the 
world and at all levels: interstate, interdepartmental, and 
between individual people, organizations, and enterprises. But 
it is my profound conviction that we should have special 
partnership relations with Russia. Therefore, achievement of the 
objectives that the fund has set for itself--to promote the 
improvement and development of Ukrainian-Russian ties on a 
nongovernmental level and in the humanitarian, economic, and 
ecological spheres--will, undoubtedly, be very useful for the 
strengthening of mutual understanding, friendship, and 
all-around cooperation between Ukraine and the Russian 
Federation. 
  "I sincerely congratulate your founders on the initiation of 
activity. 
  [Signed] Leonid KRAVCHUK" 
<H5>  * * * </H5>
  "I think that your fund, by uniting its efforts with the 
Fund 
of Humanitarian and Economic Cooperation With Ukraine that is 
now being formed in Russia, can bring many benefits. 
Communications between the citizens of our countries and the 
development of Russian-Ukrainian economic contacts and ties are 
really capable of bettering the life of the people. 
  "I sincerely congratulate you and all of the participants in 
the fund with its presentation, and I wish you great success. 
With a profound belief in friendship between Russia and Ukraine. 
  [Signed] Boris Yeltsin"[End boxed item]

<F P=106> [Interview with Igor Turyansky, ambassador extraordinary and </F>
plenipotentiary of Ukraine to Turkey, by Valentina Pisanskaya; 
place and date not given: "Bid Farewell to Illusions Once and 
for All..."] 
  [Text] I met Igor Turyansky, ambassador extraordinary 
and plenipotentiary of Ukraine to Turkey, at the beginning of 
the regular Kiev-Istanbul-Kiev flight made by the Avialiniya 
Ukrainy company. 
  Igor Mefodyevich was glad to grant an interview to 
GOLOS UKRAINY. 
  [Pisanskaya] We have heard about the "Turkish miracle"--the 
economic reforms which, if they have not transformed this not 
very rich country into a civilized paradise, have at least led 
its citizens onto the path of abundance. And indeed even with a 
brief acquaintance with Turkey one is struck by its immense 
commercial market. It would probably be logical for Ukraine to 
arrange economic relations with this neighbor of ours as quickly 
as possible. 
  [Turyansky] As logical as it gets... And I understood this 
the first day I worked here: The immense prospects for economic 
cooperation are practically not being realized, mainly because 
of the passivity of Ukrainian entrepreneurs. But the Turks are 
extremely efficient people. For them their word is like law. If 
we have discussed some proposal on the telephone in the morning, 
in the evening a fax of a joint agreement is sure to arrive. 
They have an excellent understanding of our difficulties and are 
trying to help. But we, unfortunately, are not prepared to 
accept this help. And we are unprepared at the very highest 
levels. 
  [Pisanskaya] And is Turkey prepared to cooperate? 
  [Turyansky] Yes. Business people here are well aware that 
Ukraine is renowned for its metallurgical industry, coal, and 
sugar. These are traditional items in our exports and the Turks 
are interested in them. And it would not hurt Ukraine to have 
the consumer goods which are plentiful in Turkey. Moreover, the 
Turks are excellent builders and cooperation is possible here as 
well. 
  [Pisanskaya] Have there been any concrete proposals from 
Turkish enterprises? 
  [Turyansky] Of course. But they are being realized extremely 
unsatisfactorily. For instance, in May a Turkish company 
proposed to invest $50 million in Ukraine. Within two days I had 
sent the documented information to Kiev. And what do you think 
happened? Specialists from the Eksimbank did not arrive for 
negotiations until the end of October... 
  [Pisanskaya] It took Turkey 13 years to carry out its 
reforms. What do you think--will it take Ukraine just as long? 
  [Turyansky] Ukraine does not have that possibility. We are 
so 
far behind in our development that we have to make haste. And to 
do this we must say farewell to our illusions once and for all. 
We must have patience and build partnership relations with the 
surrounding world. 
  [Pisanskaya] What part of Turkey's experience in economic 
reform may be used by Ukraine? 
  [Turyansky] I would put the question differently. The now 
late president of Turkey, Turgut Ozal, during my meeting with 
him named several factors that are keeping Ukraine from moving 
forward. They include, first, the dependency on a single source 
of energy. He was convinced that energy sources must be 
diversified. And he gave an example: At the beginning of the 
reforms Turkey was unable to cover the cost of imported energy 
sources with exports--this took 120 percent of them. Now Turkey 
is paying for its energy sources with just 18 percent of its 
exports. 
  Second, Ukraine is still not relying on small and 
medium-sized enterprises. Is it really so difficult to 
understand that if a person has something of his own he does not 
have time to wave flags and banners and he will no longer have 
to take it away from someone else? 
  Incidentally, in the sphere of services and trade the Turks 
work from 0700 until 2300. They are aware that each client means 
a kopek in their pockets. 
  [Pisanskaya] You tell me about the great prospects for 
Ukrainian-Turkish cooperation, and yet it has already turned out 
that our politicians and entrepreneurs have been and still are 
oriented more toward Western countries... 
  [Turyansky] You see, it is not so much that they have been 
oriented that way as that they have been expecting that the West 
will help us, give us something. This is a mistake. It is 
possible to give, but only a little. 
  Relations with Turkey are no panacea either, but it is 
extremely advantageous partner and, the most important thing, it 
is interested in cooperation, and we are linked by excellent sea 
transportation arteries. Regular air communications have now 
been opened up. But for now we are losing great opportunities 
for cooperation. It is already uncomfortable to look in the eyes 
of Turkish entrepreneurs who, on my recommendations, are 
traveling to Ukraine and returning from there with empty hands 
without even having found any interest in their proposals. 
  [Pisanskaya] But there are lively communications with bazaar 
merchants--the so-called wild financial-trade tourism. Is there 
a problem with this? 
  [Turyansky] There is. Each year about a half million people 
travel from Ukraine to Turkey--to buy some things and to sell 
some things. I thought that everything had already been shipped 
from Ukraine to Poland. It turns out that this is not the case. 
Hammers, nails, watches, cigarettes--you can see everything in 
the Turkish bazaars. And even when our compatriots are guests 
they sometimes act as though they are at home, and sometimes so 
rudely that it is difficult for the embassy to straighten things 
out. Some people lose their passports and money, others have 
them stolen, and others connive to save money on their ticket 
home. There are also those who bring in contraband and violate 
customs rules. There are now 15 citizens of Ukraine serving time 
in Turkish jails. 
  But the telephones in the embassy are never quiet and the 
doors never close for other reasons as well--the entrepreneurs 
of Turkey are trying to set up relations with us. I believe that 
this interest will serve both countries for a long time to come.

<F P=106> [Article by Andriy Berezniyy and Valeriy Novytskyy, members </F>
of the inter-departmental working group on trade and industrial 
cooperation issues of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation 
Organization: "Black Sea Cooperation: Time for Action"] 
  [Text] The Black Sea Economic Cooperation 
Organization (ChES), one of the newest international 
organizations to start to have a considerable impact on the 
dislocation of forces and alliances on world stage, is 
attracting considerable attention to itself. 
  The idea of forming such a group had been mooted long ago, 
but only in recent years, mainly thanks to efforts by Turkey, it 
has attracted wide recognition which was implemented with the 
signing of the relevant declaration by leaders of 11 countries 
on 25 June 1992. That day in effect became the founding date of 
the ChES; among the founding members of that organization, in 
addition to Ukraine, were Azerbaijan, Albania, Bulgaria, 
Armenia, Greece, Georgia, Moldova, the Russian Federation, 
Romania and Turkey. 
  Most of those countries fully support the concept of the 
ChES 
and have serious, although sometimes dissimilar, intentions to 
build the necessary legal foundations for economic integration, 
growth of trade and implementation of joint investment projects. 
For instance, the position of Greece, Romania and Bulgaria on 
investing ChES organizations with considerable powers and 
creating special favorable conditions for economic cooperation 
in the region has been cautious and reserved. As to creating the 
appropriate legal foundations, modifying existing foreign trade 
regimes and establishing a free trade zone and other 
institutional structures, all this would seriously impact their 
status in another, for them more significant organization: the 
European Union (EU). (Greece is its full member and Bulgaria and 
Romania hold associate membership.) 
  Ukraine has its own interest in this, and its candidacy as a 
leader of the ChES could become an acceptable compromise. 
(Initiatives to that effect are the responsibility of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.) Other solutions are also possible: 
representatives of different states could hold this position by 
turns. 
  While discussing the role of Ukraine in the ChES, it should 
be mentioned that on Turkish initiative our country was chosen 
as the site of a parliamentary session of that organization at 
the start of December. Analysts have noted that the ChES 
parliamentary session, which took place in Kiev, was very 
productive. 
  Sometimes one hears doubt whether attention should be 
focused 
on the problems of Black Sea cooperation if for Ukraine, as well 
as for other countries in the region, the geopolitical goal is 
to become integrated into the EU, or whether hopes to bring 
together dissimilar member states within the ChES might not be 
Utopian. 
  Responding to the first of these general questions, we 
should 
note that it would be irresponsible to define the issue in 
either-or terms. For Ukraine to claim a full EU membership 
status that would allow it to participate in its integration 
processes and make use of all the related advantages, subsidies 
and a wide range of favorable opportunities for economic 
development would be impossible for many years to come. Yet, the 
task of overcoming a severe socio-economic crisis is already 
facing our country today. Moreover, strengthening cooperation 
with other countries of the "European underbelly" as a way 
toward Brussels would only give us more weight in the eyes of 
desirable partners. Incidentally, these considerations are very 
important for Turkish politicians. Thus, we think that Ukraine 
should look at the problem more broadly, in the context of its 
officially declared intention to seek widest possible 
geographical ties and to overcome distortions resulting from a 
one-sided orientation. 
  Clearly, it would be much easier to build economic 
cooperation in the Black Sea region as a series of bilateral 
projects or broader geographical projects focused on a single 
industry. But this does not preclude the possibility, or removes 
the need, to build a system of multilateral cooperation, which 
would encourage many forms of localized cooperation while, on 
the other hand, assuming a much broader form. 
  During negotiations within the ChES, member states expressed 
their interest in cooperating in such areas as construction and 
modernization of highway and railway networks; rational 
utilization of Black Sea fishery resources; construction, 
modernization and improved use of Black Sea ports; improvement 
of telecommunications links between ChES members and laying of 
the fiber-optic cable between Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria and 
Ukraine. 
  On its part, Ukraine expressed an interest in working within 
the ChES framework on modernizing oil refining plants, building 
terminals on the shores of the Black Sea for receiving shipments 
of oil and liquefied gas, cooperating with foreign companies on 
the development of non-traditional energy sources, technical 
retooling of metallurgical plants, building new capacities, 
implementing a multilateral program to produce electronic 
equipment for various sectors of the economy using 
semiconductors produced in Ukraine, etc. 
  At this stage, Ukraine must develop a general conceptual 
vision of its economic interests in the ChES, set a target level 
for integration into ChES and its organizations and find 
practical ways to achieve expected results. The latter task is 
related to the need to find out, at last, who is responsible for 
what in the context of goals being considered, since it must be 
acknowledged that, as a rule, the Ukrainian side does not 
generate initiative in developing various business proposals, 
and that in our country those who are responsible for this are 
often insufficiently active or incompetent. 
  This is why we must now start serious analytical and 
organizational work at state organizations and enterprises. The 
future of Ukraine is closely linked to the Black Sea region and 
at the early stages it is important not to err in selecting 
strategy and tactics, for in no time at all we may find 
ourselves on the "dustheap of history."

<F P=106> [Report by the Economic Administration of the Ukraine </F>
Cabinet of Ministers: "The Ukrainian Economy in January-November 
1993"] 
  [Text] At the end of the year, the economic situation 
in Ukraine remains extremely difficult. The total level of 
output continues to fall, the government budget deficit 
continues to increase and excessive emission of money goes on, 
leading to further deepening of the economic crisis in the 
country. 
<H5>  Implementation of the Budget </H5>
  Revenues of the consolidated budget for the 
January-October period amounted to K26.065 trillion. In 
addition, to cover the projected budget deficit and other 
budgetary expenditures, K8.465 trillion was borrowed from the 
National Bank of Ukraine. 
  Value-added taxes raised K9.212 trillion, taxes on revenues 
(profits) of enterprises and organizations K7.9 trillion, 
indirect taxes K1.132 trillion, individual income taxes K1.099 
trillion, contributions from enterprises and organizations to 
the Fund for the Implementation of Measures to Overcome the 
Consequences of the Chernobyl Disaster and for Social Security 
K1.087 trillion and revenues from foreign economic activities 
K960 billion. 
  Expenditures of the consolidated budget during 
January-October amounted to K28.947 trillion, of which K3.957 
trillion (or 13.7 percent of the total) was used for social 
security purposes, K6.423 trillion (22.2 percent) for social and 
cultural purposes and K6.317 trillion (21.8 percent) for the 
economy. 
  In the current year, support for enterprises and entities 
experiencing financial difficulties was effected by means of 
soft loans from the budget. During the first 10 months, K6.638 
trillion of such loans has been issued, including K1.065 
trillion to the Pension Fund and K4.978 trillion to the Ministry 
of the Agricultural Industry. 
  Spending on defense totaled K1.224 trillion, and on law 
enforcement K845 billion. The construction of housing for 
servicemen was funded with proceeds from the sale of military 
equipment, amounting to K86 billion. 
  The consolidated budget deficit totaled K2.882 trillion. 
  The government budget in January-October had 
revenues of K13.954 trillion and outlays of K18.817 trillion. 
<H5>  Lending in the Economy </H5>
  Total assets of Ukrainian banks (loans 
outstanding) at 1 November amounted to K44.8 trillion, including 
K9.9 trillion at the National Bank and K34.9 trillion at 
commercial banks. 
  Assets of affiliates of commercial banks from countries of 
the former USSR totaled K93.9 trillion. 
  In October, loans increased by K6.9 trillion, or 18 percent 
(compared to a K9.1 trillion, or 32 percent, rise in September); 
of these, National Bank loans rose by K2.4 trillion, or 32 
percent (compared to 25 percent in September), and commercial 
bank loans by K4.5 trillion, or 15 percent (33 percent in 
September). The share of commercial bank loans at the start of 
November was 78 percent, vs. 80 percent at 1 October and 56 
percent at the start of the year. 
  Of the total amount of loans at the National Bank, K9.5 
trillion, or 96 percent, were credits provided to Ukrainian 
government to cover its budget deficit and domestic government 
debt. 
  To finance commercial banks, the National Bank 
issued loans totaling K10 trillion since the start of the year, 
97 percent of which went to Ukrayna Bank to cover credit lines. 
During October, the volume of bank financing increased by 10 
percent. 
  Given that interest rates on commercial bank financing were 
240 percent, average interest rates during October were 94 
percent, due to soft credits provided mainly to Ukrayna Bank to 
cover loans to purchasing organizations and enterprises involved 
in processing agricultural products. 
  The average interest rate charged on commercial bank loans 
rose by 13.8 percentage points during October, to 246.2 percent, 
compared to 222.5 percent in September. The highest rate charged 
in October was 770 percent (480 percent in August and 600 
percent in September), while the lowest 5% (1 percent and 5 
percent, respectively, in August and September) 
<H5>  Inflationary Processes </H5>
  In the 12 months to November wholesale prices on 
industrial output rose 74 times, including on electric energy 
100 times, on construction materials 92 times, on machinery 79 
times, on petroleum products 73 times, on meat products 66 times 
and on dairy products 63 times. 
  In November, wholesale prices charged by industrial 
enterprises rose 1.3 times compared to the previous month, 
including on electric energy 2.4 times, on building materials 
1.5 times, on light industry products 1.6 times, on wood and 
paper products 1.8 times, on oil and chemical industry products 
1.7 times, on machinery 1.4 times and on food and dairy products 
1.2 times. 
  Agricultural prices rose 40 times in the past 12 
months, including on grain and oilseeds 77 times, on sugar beets 
42 times, on cattle and poultry 38 times, on milk and dairy 
products 39 times and on eggs 63 times. 
  Prices for construction and installation work rose 
in the 12 months to September 26 times, and 16 times from the 
end of last year. 
  It should be noted that the growth of wholesale prices 
charged by industrial enterprises considerably outpaces the 
growth of retail prices. 
  In the first 10 months (December 1992 to October 1993), 
wholesale prices increased 45 times, while prices of consumer 
goods and services rose 37 times. 
<H5>  Situation in Some Economic Sectors </H5>
  Industrial production continues to decline. In 
January-November, the volume of goods production fell 8 percent 
compared to the same period of last year. More than half of all 
enterprises saw their output contract. The output of 128 out 148 
types of very important products shrank. 
  In the first 11 months, enterprises of the fuel and 
energy sector produced 106.4 tons of coal, which is 13.1 
percent less than during the same period last year; 3.9 million 
tons of oil and liquefied gas, or 5.2 percent less; and 17.6 
billion cubic meters of natural gas, or 8.1 percent less. 
  Coal industry enterprises reached only 77 percent 
of the coal production target for November, and 85 percent of 
the target for coke production. Since the start of the year, 
these targets were fulfilled by only 86 percent and 88 percent, 
respectively. 
  The situation in the petroleum processing industry 
remains difficult. Output in basic oil refining continues to 
decline. Since the start of the year, 22 million tons has been 
refined, 38.6 percent below last year's levels. As a result, the 
production of gasoline fell 34.3 percent, of diesel 23.8 percent 
and of heavy fuel 39.5 percent. 
  Electric energy production also continues to 
shrink. During January-November, 207 billion kilowatt hours was 
produced, 8.2 percent less than last year; of these, combustion 
plants produced 128 billion kilowatt hours, or 16.1 percent 
less. The fall in output at combustion plants was in part made 
up by the rise in output at nuclear and hydroelectric plants, by 
4.2 percent and 45.9 percent, respectively, compared to last 
year. 
  The situation with supplying fuel to combustion plants is 
extremely difficult. Gas deliveries during November were nearly 
halved from last year, falling short of target by 456 million 
cubic meters; only 24,000 tons of heavy fuel was provided, 
amounting to just 24 percent of the target. 
  Severe shortages of fuel, energy and raw materials, as well 
as price increases on them, have created a critical situation in 
the metal industry. Some enterprises have been 
working below capacity or have halted production altogether. Due 
to the fall of natural gas deliveries, 15 blast furnaces, 20 
open-hearth furnaces and several rolling mills had to be halted. 
The output of main types of products fell by between 18 percent 
and 37 percent in the first 11 months of the year, compared to 
the same period of 1992. The output of pig iron fell 7.4 million 
tons (23 percent), of steel 8.1 million tons (21 percent), of 
rolled products 4.8 million tons (18 percent) and of steel pipe 
1.7 million tons (37 percent). 
  In November, enterprises of the coal industry in Ukraine 
fell 
short by some 200,000 tons in their deliveries of coke to 
metal-processing enterprises, whereas supplies of coke from 
Russia and Kazakhstan were 20 percent below contracted levels in 
the first 11 months, as a result of payment delays. 
  The situation remains difficult also in 
agriculture. The output and state purchases of main 
types of meat and poultry industry products fell due to the 
decline in numbers and yields of cattle and poultry. 
  In January-November, the output of meat fell by 736,300 tons 
slaughterhouse weight, 24 percent less than the same period last 
year, of milk by 10.05 million tons (9 percent) and eggs by 
4.704 billion (16 percent). 
  State purchasing contracts for meat and poultry were only 78 
percent filled, for milk 95 percent and for eggs 81 percent. 
  The government continues to purchase farm products. It 
purchased 14.2 million tons of grain (97 percent of target), 
which is 3.2 million tons more than in 1992. It purchased 
716,100 tons of potatoes (21 percent below last year's levels), 
1.5 million tons of vegetables (5 percent below) and 448,700 
tons of fruit (3 percent above). 
  Due to the decline of total output, lack of fuel and higher 
prices for energy, the volume freight transportation 
continues to decline. In the first 11 months, motor transport 
hauled 418 tons of freight, which is 37 percent below levels of 
the same period last year; rail transport 496 million tons, or 
28 percent below; and water transport 27 million tons, or 22 
percent below. 
  Steady price increases in travel caused further 
reductions in its volume. Airline travel fell 72 percent and 
motor travel 22 percent. 
  At 1 November, 2,167 joint ventures existed in 
Ukraine, producing K887.4 billion worth of goods or services. At 
the domestic market, they sold output worth R1.1856 trillion and 
$131.3 million. Exports by joint ventures totaled $201.4 million 
and imports $262.8 million. 
  Foreign trade with countries of far abroad totaled 
in January-October $3.5785 billion, of which exports accounted 
for $2.1618 billion and imports for $1.4167 billion. 
  Foreign trade by Ukraine enterprises was conducted with 99 
countries. The highest volumes of exports went to Austria, 
Bulgaria, India, Italy, China, the Netherlands and Germany. Most 
imports came from Austria, Brazil, Germany, the US, Hungary and 
France. 
  The volume of foreign trade between Ukraine and 
countries of the former USSR totaled K34.3 trillion, of which 
exports were K11.2 trillion and imports K23.1 trillion; this 
created a deficit of K11.9 trillion (due to the purchases of 
natural gas, oil and oil products, polyethelene, wood pulp, 
cotton and synthetic rubber). Deficit was registered with Russia 
(K9.7 trillion) and Turkmenistan (K2.1 trillion), as well as 
with Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania and Estonia. 
<H5>  Consumer goods and services </H5>
  The output of consumer goods fell by K8.7 
trillion, or 15 percent, in January-November, and totaled K50.3 
trillion in retail prices. 
  The output of food products fell 11 percent, 
including that of sausage 33 percent, of margarine 32 percent, 
of whole milk 31 percent, of meat 27 percent, of vegetable oil 
13 percent and of cheeses 11 percent. 
  Food industry enterprises suffer from persisting financial 
problems, especially the disarray in inter-enterprise payments. 
Because they are owed money by retail trade organizations for 
sold output, and experience a liquidity shortage, food industry 
enterprises have been unable to pay in full for the deliveries 
of agricultural products. They can get no loans for these 
purposes. 
  The output of non-food products fell 23 percent 
during January-November, and totaled K16 trillion. 
  The output of cultural-recreational and household good fell 
considerably. For instance, the output of tape recorders 
declined 27.3 percent, of television sets 25.4 percent, of 
electric irons 16.4 percent, of automatic laundry machines 13.2 
percent, of radio sets 11.8 percent and of refrigerators by 7.8 
percent. 
  One cause of this is the shortage of rubles to pay Russian 
enterprises for raw materials and components, as well as delays 
with payment processing in the banking system. 
  The energy crisis in the country also impacts negatively on 
output. 
  The main cause of the existing situation is the lack of 
foreign currency, including rubles, which is needed to buy up to 
70 percent of required raw materials outside Ukraine, as well as 
shortages of domestic currency. 
  The volume of retail trade fell by 28.2 percent in 
constant prices in the first 11 months of the year compared to 
the same period of last year, and totaled K28.1 trillion. 
  Due to constant price increases on practically all consumer 
products, the situation in the consumer market worsened further 
during January-November. Consumers are trying to get rid of 
their money as soon as possible, since it is rapidly losing 
value, while the available goods are clearly insufficient to 
meet demand. As a result, retail trade inventories are 
declining. At 1 December, stocks covered 41 days of sales, 6 
days less than a year ago. 
  In January-October, the sale of meat through state and 
cooperative retail trade fell 19.4 percent, of butter 10.4 
percent, of vegetable oil 17.7 percent, of cheese 36.4 percent 
and of eggs 25.5 percent. 
  Average monthly wages for employees in the state 
sector rose 15.8 times since the start of the year, amounting to 
K240,200 in October. They are lowest in the catering industry, 
culture and the arts, social work, agriculture, retail trade, 
housing, education and health care, ranging from K149,000 to 
K197,000. 
  This information is prepared based on data from the Economic 
Ministry, the Ministry of Finance, the Statistics Ministry and 
the National Bank of Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Article by Karmo Kaas: "Warehousing Services Attract </F>
Foreign Capital to Estonia"] 
  [Text] 
  At its yesterday's session the government approved, in 
principle, the formation of AS Keemia Vahendus, a joint stock 
company with foreign capital participation for handling 
chemicals, which will be dealing with the warehousing and 
reloading of chemical products being shipped between Russia and 
the Western states. 
  The mission of AS Keemia Vahendus would be to warehouse 
chemical products coming from Russia and other CIS states, 
utilizing the facilities of the centrally located and currently 
unused Maardu warehouse base, and forwarding them to different 
states of Western Europe, United States or Canada. The company 
also offers reloading services for goods bound for Russia and 
other CIS states, along with the option of transfer into 
different containers. 
<H5>  Joint Stock Company Has Five Part-Owners </H5>
  The owners of the joint stock company being formed are RAS 
[State Joint Stock Company] Kommer and AS [Joint Stock Company] 
DAK from Estonia, RAS Gammahim from Russia, production concern 
Orgsintes from Tatarstan, and the Swiss firm of Sober Handels 
AV. RAS Kommmer participates with a 884 square meter storage 
facility, and shares are distributed evenly between all 
participating owners. RAS Gammahim and production concern 
Orgsintes have complete control over the export of their 
country's chemical production, and the Swiss participant has 
been a cooperation partner with Russia for some time. 
  Azril Bernovski, executive director of RAS Kommer, told in 
his interview to aRIUUDISED yesterday that the 
geographical 
positioning of Tallinn's commercial ports is optimal for 
implementing the above-mentioned business plan, and that the 
warehousing and reloading services offered are backed by a 
sufficient demand from Russia as well as the Western states. 
<H5>  Estonia Will Profit From the Venture </H5>
  The state of Estonia should, according to calculations, 
profit from this venture by having the use of Keemia Vahendus 
services at preferential rates. The company will enable RAS 
Kommer to make full use of its now only partially used storage 
capacity, and also increase the utilization of Estonia's 
railroads, Tallinn port facilities and other facilities not 
being used to their full potential. By doing this, Keemia 
Vahendus is hoping to help reduce unemployment. Formation of the 
company will be creating 55 jobs directly. 
<H5>  The Venture To Pay Off in a Year </H5>
  The UN industrial development organization has confirmed the 
profitability of the venture. According to their estimates, the 
venture should pay off in one year, and have an annual 
profitability rating of 72 to 93 percent. 
  The government did not pass a final resolution on the 
formation of AS Keemia Vahendus at its yesterday's session, 
because some details dealing with the formation of the company 
are yet to be worked out.

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Horbulin, general director, Ukrainian </F>
National Space Agency, and Oleksandr Zhyvkov, division chief, 
NKAU: "Satellite Communications Links in Ukraine"] 
  [Text] It is a matter of common knowledge that the 
state-of-the art development of industry, transportation, the 
banking and finance system, as well as the mass media, require 
reliable, multi-channel, and frequently mobile communications 
links. 
  To a considerable extent, these needs can be met and 
provided 
for by means of creating and developing satellite-link systems. 
The practical experience gained by other states in this sector 
attests to the fact that what works in creating national 
satellite-link systems is either based on the share-type 
participation of state and commercial structures, or leasing 
satellite-link channels from other countries. There are 
sufficient grounds for considering that Ukraine's scientific, 
technical, and industrial potential--as well as its geopolitical 
position--will enable us to solve this problem in a 
comprehensive manner. 
  In accordance with the directive issued by the president of 
Ukraine, dated 3 October 1992 and entitled "On a National System 
of Communications Links," as well as Decree No. 92 issued by the 
Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, dated 4 February 1993 and 
entitled "On Measures Regarding the Creation of a Unified, 
National System of Communications Links," the Ukrainian National 
Space Agency (NKAU) has developed a Program for Creating a 
Ukrainian Satellite-Link System. 
  Primary attention in this program was accorded to the 
following four services, which we will briefly discuss below in 
order to inform the readers of URYADOVYY KURYER. 
<H6>  A satellite-link system for general use </H6>
  This has the task of providing and ensuring an international 
liknk, as well as additional (reserve) communications channels 
within our country at times of overloading and accidents on the 
radio-relay lines and cable links. At present international 
telephone links have been provided to the United States, Canada, 
and Southeast Asia by the satellite-link station in the city of 
Zolochev (there are approximately 500 telephone cables here); 
this is done via satellites of the international consortium 
known as Eutelsat. To Western Europe communications links have 
been provided via Eutelsat's European satellite by a station set 
up at the Kiev International Telephone Exchange (120 channels). 
Further development of this service will be carried out by way 
of modernizing the Zolochev Station (its potential throughput 
capacity is close to 1000 telephone channels), and the station 
at the KMTS [Kiev International Telephone Exchange] (with close 
to 500 channels). Provisions have also been made to build 
satellite stations in oblast centers. 
<H6>  2. A system of satellite television viewing </H6>
  As of today, the territory of Ukraine has no broadcasting 
stations within a network for distributing TV programs via 
satellite, although individual consumers or users can receive 
more than 20 TV channels from foreign satellites. Our program 
provides for expanding two or three channels to Ukraine and to 
Europe, as well as for broadcasting TV items to the United 
States, Siberia, and the Far East. For this purpose we will be 
able to utilize the resources of the station at Zolochev, as 
well as the teleport whose construction is planned to begin 
quite close to Kiev. This teleport has been designed in such a 
way that--after the Lybid spacecraft has been put into 
operation--most TV will be relayed to the teleport from leased 
foreign satellites. 
<H6>  A system of satellite links with mobile objects </H6>
  With the aid of this system it is planned to organize 
dispatcher-type links for guiding or direct technological 
processes for transport. At the present time links with mobile 
objects (and in Ukraine these are still only ships) are carried 
out via spacecraft of Intelsat and Gorizont, as well as the 
central station (TsMSZ-1) located in the city of Odessa. Our 
program provides for expanding the technical capabilities of 
TsMSZ-1 in order to offer the new types of services which are 
now being introduced all over the world. 
  Beginning in 1995, we will be launching the Arkos and Mayak 
satellites in order to replace Russia's Gorizont satellites. The 
NKAU has been conducting negotiations with the Informkosmos 
Joint-Stock Company--the developer of the Marafon mobile 
satellite link. The purpose of Ukraine's participation in this 
project was conditioned by several factors. These include 
advantageous rates for us for the link services and the 
participation in this project by Ukraine's leading enterprises, 
in particular, by the Muson Concern, located in the city of 
Sevastopol. It is the only plant on the territory of the former 
Soviet Union which has produced mobile satellite-link stations 
for civilian uses. 
  We must also take into account the fact that satellite links 
constitute one of the most profitable types of business, and 
hence Ukraine's participation in these promising international 
projects is desirable, all the more so in that investments can 
be made in the form of products of our own enterprises, rather 
than by hard currency. 
<H6>  4. A system of satellite links for news, information, and 
business </H6>
  This service will consist of individual networks of links 
which will provide exchanges of information in the interests of 
the president, organs of state administration, banking 
structures, various departments, etc. 
  Certain networks of the business and information links are 
being created within the framework of the program for converting 
defense-type enterprises. Thus, for example, the Kiev Radio 
Plant is producing small-scale stations for the Sokil satellite 
link (the dimenions of the antenna are 46 X 46 cm), on the basis 
of which the communications network of the Ukrinterzv'yazok Firm 
are being organized. The large-scale network of a banking 
communications link for Ukraine's Prominvestbank is being 
created by the Geosat firm, based on the SSZ [satellite-link 
station] which is being turned out in Izhevsk. 
  Negotiations are being carried out with Western partners 
concerning joint production of SZ stations for individual use at 
Ukrainian enterprises. These stations can operate within the 
international networks of the satellite links on spacecraft of 
Intelsat and Eutelsat. 
  The developers of the program which we are discussing here 
envision two stages for implementing it. The first stage is 
offering the services on the basis of leasing already-existing 
satellite links, developing a ground-level infrastructure in all 
four of the above-mentioned services, as well as the 
development, manufacture, and launch of our own satellite links, 
along with participation in the international project for the 
Marafon mobile link system. 
  The second stage is as follows: After the launch of the 
Lybid 
spacecraft, most of the traffic will be transferred to it. 
Leasing channels on foreign satellites is to be maintained--for 
the most part--by means of links with America and the 
Asian-Pacific region. What is envisioned is the possibility and 
the capacity of leasing to other states and to foreign 
organizations a portion of the resources of this spacecraft, 
offering to make available the services of this satellite link 
to adjacent regions, carrying out launches with the aid of Zenit 
rocket-carriers, and selling systems as a whole, including those 
of rocket-carriers and spacecraft. 
  Developing the Ukrainian satellite-link system in the first 
stage--prior to 1997--in the event that all the services 
envisioned by our program are adopted--would require 300 billion 
krb. [karbovantsy] (at the prices prevailing in July 1993) and 
100 million dollars. Most of the hard-currency outlays (97 
million dollars) would be earmarked for leasing channels on 
foreign spacecraft. 
  From the time when the Lybid spacecraft is put into 
operation 
these outlays--while retaining and even increasing the volume of 
services rendered by the satellite links--would be reduced by 
approximately two-thirds and would amount to about 5 or 6 
million dollars per annum. The expenditures in the national 
currency for maintaining the Lybid satellite-link system would 
not increase because the basic funds for creating it would have 
been spent during the first stage. 
  And so (not even taking profits into account) the creation 
of 
a satellite-link system using our own spacecraft would enable us 
to save some 10-12 million dollars a year and to offer users in 
Ukraine all the necessary services of a satellite link. 
  If we were to abandon the creation of our own spacecraft and 
hire foreigners on a contract basis to produce it and launch it 
into orbit, then the outlays for creating the satellite segment 
alone--one which would be analogous to Lybid--would amount to 
approximately 160-200 million dollars, instead of 30-50 billion 
krb. Such a great difference is to be explained--in addition to 
everything else--by the high degree of readiness of the Zenit 
rocket-carrier and by the capability for manufacturing our own 
platforms for satellite links. In other words, Ukraine already 
has an abundant supply of those very systems components which 
are so expensive on the world market. 
  The difference in the value of a satellite link "made on 
contract" and one of our own systems amounts to a factor of 
8-10. And this also provides us with an opportunity to acquire 
big profits both from selling the services of our links and from 
selling the satellite links themselves--as well as their 
launches--on the world market. 
  We are still at the beginning of the road to creating a 
satellite-link system in Ukraine. But this road must be traveled 
so that Ukraine may become a truly independent state.

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Havrylovych Batyuk, ambassador </F>
extraordinary and plenipotentiary of Ukraine to the United 
Nations, by Lidiya Korsun, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA special 
correspondent in the United States, under the rubric "National 
Treasures," at the Ukrainian UN mission, date not given: "Not 
Only the Gold Itself May Be the Gold of the State...."] 
  [Excerpts] Who is he, the permanent representative of 
Ukraine at the United Nations? Why was this responsible mission 
at the premiere international commonwealth in the world 
entrusted precisely to him and a small group of coworkers? 
  So, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Viktor 
Batyuk is an interlocutor of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA. 
  First, a short file. Viktor Batyuk is 54. He graduated 
from the Institute of International Relations in Moscow. He held 
diplomatic positions in the organization of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of Ukraine: at the Permanent Mission of Ukraine 
at the United Nations (New York, 1968-1973), as an aide to the 
minister, the general secretary of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (1974-1977), the permanent representative of Ukraine at 
the offices of the United Nations and other international 
organizations in Geneva (1978-1984), and as the chief of the 
department of international organizations and member of the 
collegium of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine 
(1985-1991). 
  On 4 March 1992 he was appointed a permanent 
representative of Ukraine at the UN. 
  Within Ukrainian delegations, he has taken part in many 
international meetings, as well as 20 sessions of the UN General 
Assembly. 
  Also, he is a member of the Union of Writers of 
Ukraine, a translator of the works of Indian and American 
writers. 
  He is married with three children. 
  The diplomatic corps of the Ukrainian UN mission 
consists of: 
  Volodymyr Khandohiy--deputy permanent representative; 
  Oleksandr Motsyk and Oleksandr Horyn--first secretaries; 
  Viktor Andriyaka, Ihor Humennyy, and Valeriy 
Kyrychenko--second secretaries; 
  Vitaliy Malashchenko--an attache. 
  All have special higher education. Their average age is 
37. 
  With one exception, all are married. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Korsun] Viktor, let us discuss the issues of our mission. 
  [Batyuk] At present, Ukraine has its diplomatic missions in 
a 
few dozen countries. As has already been mentioned, 184 states 
belong to the United Nations. Consequently, contacts are 
maintained through us with countries in which our embassies do 
not operate (we bring to their attention the positions of our 
government, political statements, and so on). This is an 
intensive and great effort. For us, vacations once every two 
years have been established. 
  [Korsun] What is the difference between the functions of the 
Ukrainian representative at the UN in the environment of the 
former Union and at present, when we have an independent state? 
  [Batyuk] The difference is striking. Previously, it was like 
this: The landlord and a live-in son-in-law sat on a block. The 
latter merely listened, and had no right to put in a word of his 
own. At one time, ours was a decorative, pro forma mission, 
despite the fact that the flag of Ukraine flew over the common 
building. We now say our word outloud, pursue the policy of an 
independent Ukraine, and work out our course independently and 
follow it independently. 
  [Korsun] How do our neighbors, the Russian mission, respond 
to this? Does their leading, supreme role manifest itself (say, 
through information)? 
  [Batyuk] We feel supremacy. To be sure, there are no 
complaints concerning purely human relations between colleagues. 
However, the congenital "great-power attitude" is frequently all 
too obvious. Besides, we room with in-laws. For example, a 
"directive" comes: Effective 1 February of this year, payments 
for the use of such and such services will be increased by this 
amount. There are no explanations as to why. Visitors come to us 
here, to this reception room. Some ask before the conversation, 
pointing at the adjacent wall: "Will Mr. Vorontsov 
(representative of Russia at the UN--note by UKRAYINSKA HAZETA) 
hear our conversation?" I happen to answer "Yes" because 
important texts sent by fax to the UKRINFORM for some reason 
suddenly end up in the adjacent mission. Or else this "thing" 
which was recently installed by the neighbors. (He pointed at 
the ceiling.) They said that this was additional fire protection 
equipment. It is strange because issues of reliable fire 
prevention were resolved here a long time ago. Once again, they 
did not consult us even 'for the sake of appearances' about the 
'fire alarm' system." 
  [Korsun] Can we say this in the newspaper? Is this not a 
diplomatic secret? 
  [Batyuk] No, this is not a secret. This is our predicament. 
This is why the issue of moving our mission to separate premises 
remains pressing. A search for ways to resolve this problem is 
underway. First of all, it is necessary for Russia to return the 
share due us in a 13-floor building which was legally acquired 
in 1964 by three states--the USSR, Ukraine, and Belarus. Russia 
is in no hurry to relinquish its control over diplomatic 
property. I think that our ministry should raise this property 
problem before the Government of Ukraine in an acute and 
resolute manner for the latter, in its turn, to press Moscow: 
"Return to us what is ours." Otherwise, only Russia will present 
bills for "our debts." At present, it is difficult, almost 
impossible, for Ukraine to equip embassies in other countries 
"from square one." For example, our diplomatic mission in Turkey 
is crowded into a few hotel rooms. At the same time, it is felt 
that the significance of our UN mission is somewhat 
underestimated. To my mind, we should buy something even below 
38th Street where establishments of this rank are not located. 
However, housing costs two times less there. At the beginning, 
let it be the way it is. Let our poverty shine through. However, 
as Oles Honchar said, on the other hand, we have freedom and 
independence. Enough of this living and feeling as if we are in 
a single kolkhoz called the USSR. 
  [Korsun] I know that the Ukrainian community in the United 
States, which has already established the Fund of Aid to 
Ukrainian Diplomatic Missions, sympathizes with you. 
  [Batyuk] Yes. I am immensely grateful for this. The building 
of our embassy in Washington is being outfitted with the monies 
collected by the fund; the building of the consulate in New 
York, the official opening of which is planned for this year, is 
being repaired. The consulate in Chicago has been in operation 
for a year now. Here, the fund has also joined us in order to 
purchase some equipment. In particular, we received a copier and 
installed a trident at the entrance to our floor; on request, 
they provide consumer services to the members of Ukrainian 
delegations, and so on. Thus, our countrymen help us here with 
more than just words and applause.... 
  [Korsun] A mountain of debts to the UN is dragging Ukraine 
down.... 
  [Batyuk] A contribution amounting to 1.87 percent of the UN 
budget has been established for our state. This proportion is 
obviously overstated. It was calculated on the basis of the 
Union total when the ratio of the karbovanets to the dollar was 
likewise overstated. There are also a number of other reasons. 
Everybody understands them, but for now nothing can be done, 
although we continuously strive to establish the truth. As of 
today, our debt to the UN comes to $95 million. If we do not pay 
$19 million before the end of this year, we will lose the right 
to vote in the General Assembly. This has already happened to 
some small countries. We would prefer not to end up on this 
list. Unfortunately, only $1.5 million has been paid so far out 
of the $19 million. 
  [Korsun] It would be interesting to know what the overall 
budget for maintenance of the UN comes to. 
  [Batyuk] At present, $1 billion is the annual budget for 
general expenditures and tentatively $3 billion for peacekeeping 
and security measures. The latter number changes depending on 
the situation and the existence of hot spots in the world. In 
recent years this item of expenditure has increased severalfold. 
  [Korsun] You mentioned the 13-floor building which you 
"inhabit" together with Russia. How many floors does your team 
have? 
  [Batyuk] Russia has allocated one floor to us. Certainly, 
this is not enough. Missions of independent states of the former 
USSR--Belarus, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, 
and Kyrgyzstan--also have some space. Both we and they have 
cramped working conditions. Our team includes 13 employees, of 
whom eight are diplomats and five are support personnel (a 
secretary, an accountant, a driver, a typist, and a janitor). 
  [Korsun] In one of the interviews, you complained about a 
lack of qualified cadres in conjunction with an extensive entry 
by Ukraine into the worldwide diplomatic space. Are you happy 
with your assistants? 
  [Batyuk] It is possible to do business with those I now work 
with. Our shortcomings are common and concern almost all 
diplomats. We grew up in the environment of Russification and a 
lack of ethnic identity. Many lack the experience of working in 
an independent state. Professional qualities are desirable for 
each one of us first of all. 
  [Korsun] What are the arrangements for your coworkers as far 
as the way of life, schooling for their children, etc., are 
concerned? 
  [Batyuk] Three families--mine, the secretary's, and the 
driver's--live in this building where our permanent working 
offices are located. The rest of the families live in the 
so-called "white house" (it is just that its color is white). 
This is a residential building for families from the missions of 
the former Union. It has about 200 apartments now. 
  The children of our employees go either to American schools 
(if they began to study in younger grades here) or to a Russian 
school (if they were older when they came here). All children 
also attend the Ukrainian "Native School" on Saturday. For 
example, my grandson Ivan, who is seven and a half, went to an 
English school. Certainly, one day of instruction in the 
Ukrainian school per week is clearly not enough. The example of 
the former GDR would be desirable. As is known, Germans are a 
nation with a markedly manifested national sentiment. 
Previously, if there were as few as two school-age children in a 
German diplomatic mission, a permanent teacher was assigned to 
them for daily instruction. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Tsepkalo, political scientist: "Creators </F>
of the New Sensation, or About the Myths of the Foreign Policy 
of Belarus"] 
  [Text] "The world revolves not around the creators of 
new sensations but around the creators of new values..." F. 
Nietzsche: "Thus Spoke Zarathustra." 
  The problems of Belarus today have been mixed in to the 
domestic political sphere. The republic's population is 
suffering from higher prices, impoverishment and unemployment, a 
sharp rise in crime, and a loss of future prospects. Because of 
the difficulties of daily life, public opinion remains actually 
indifferent to questions of foreign policy. Yet we cannot allow 
ourselves to be indifferent to international activity. The 
taxpayer has the right to know about the effectiveness of the 
utilization of funds spent for conducting the state's foreign 
political activity. 
<H5>  How It All Began </H5>
  Foreign policy, like policy in general, in civilized 
countries is formed by a fairly narrow group of people. They 
include political figures of a certain level and the so-called 
analyst-experts who develop various political concepts. 
  In Belarus, which is just starting out on the bumpy path of 
development of civilization, the situation with the development 
of a political course is much simpler and hence also sadder. A 
lack of professionalism does not play last fiddle in the 
political orchestra of the Republic of Belarus. This disease has 
affected many power structures of our country as well as, 
unfortunately, one of the key organs of state 
administration--the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  Many critical shots have been taken at this department 
recently. And Petr Kravchanka, chief of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, has ended up at the center of the target. And in 
general this is understandable. It is the leader of the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs who is largely responsible for both foreign 
policy and the republic's image in the international arena. 
Therefore when analyzing the foreign policy of independent 
Belarus, the author of these lines automatically has to look at 
the image of the minister of foreign affairs. 
  To be fair, it should be noted that Kravchanka's first steps 
in the post of leader of the foreign political department 
deserved all possible praise: It was necessary to begin under 
the conditions of the existence of the USSR when the Belarusian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs was nothing more than a branch of 
the Union one. In these circumstances, which were so unfavorable 
for the establishment of national independence, the only correct 
line of foreign political behavior was 
selected--cultural-national. 
  "Native Tongue," the propaganda of Belarusian culture, the 
development of ties with the Belarusian diaspora--all this could 
not fail to evoke the sympathies of the republic's 
intelligentsia. For a certain amount of time Petr Kravchanka was 
able to charm even the leaders of the Belarusian People's Front 
who, in general, cannot be suspected of having great love for 
the so-called party nomenklatura. I would also like to point out 
another of the minister's positive characteristics--his 
consistent behavior. Certain of his opponents understand this 
quality as an adherence to methods and forms of party 
leadership. But the author sees it as "devotion to ideals," in 
the long list of which one can note ideals of a culturalogical 
direction. 
  Veteran Belarusian diplomats and the intelligentsia will 
understand well how three years ago the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs was turned into something like a private investigation 
bureau, all of whose workers day and night, with or without 
technical means, looked all over the world for the notorious 
"cross of Yefrasinya of Polotsk." These searches continue to 
this day, although with less enthusiasm. 
  While giving the great Belarusian sacred object and the need 
to return it to the homeland their due, it still should be noted 
that searches for national treasures that have disappeared 
abroad should be handled, apparently, by the Ministry of Culture 
and the corresponding authorized organs. And the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs may exert a certain diplomatic influence but 
certainly not usurp the entire process. 
  But we will not get into an analysis of the causes of the 
"cultural fever" that gripped the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
abroad for two epochs. A sufficient number of interesting 
articles have been devoted to this topic. Let us turn to the 
less-studied aspects of our state's foreign political activity. 
<H5>  Forgotten Initiative </H5>
  One of the methods of fighting for peace is to fight for the 
creation of a zone free of nuclear weapons. A couple of years 
ago Minister P. Kravchanka put forth an initiative to create a 
nuclear-free zone from the Baltic to the Black Sea. But no 
further steps were taken to add details and real content to this 
initiative. The problem of a "Ukrainian Chernobyl" remains. 
Moreover, it recently acquired a new quality--our southern 
neighbors decided to continue to operate their nuclear reactor. 
And what can be said about the condition in which nuclear 
weapons are kept in Ukraine today! This is how our initiative, 
long forgotten by everyone, has been realized. 
  While the citizens were thinking about the problem of doing 
without nuclear weapons, they were told that Belarus had 
submitted a proposal for mediation in the Nagorno-Karabakh 
conflict. 
  A moment later we are already becoming the initiators of 
regulation of the conflict in the Dniester region. The latter, 
naturally, was resolved without even our minimal participation. 
As for Nagorno-Karabakh, here at the diplomatic level our side 
has done nothing and is doing nothing. The minister has not 
taken a single trip to either Armenia or Azerbaijan. They have 
all been longer--to Western Europe and America. Apparently 
Belarus needed the intermediary mission more than the 
Transcaucasus did. 
  The only result of our activity for regulating conflicts has 
been that the government has allotted money for the 
reconstruction of a number of facilities in the former building 
of the CPSU Gorkom [city committee] (now, Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs) for an international group of observers. But the 
intermediary group moved to Rome without even registering in our 
country. 
<H5>  Memorial Markers Are All Right, But... </H5>
  The activity of Belarus in the United Nations is evoking a 
multitude of complaints. Naturally, one is reminded of the 
related work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the past 
three years in this area--A. [as published] Kravchanka's 
appearance in the United Nations in an ethnic shirt. This 
surrealistic episode, incidentally, can be included among the 
minister's cultural predilections. 
  The next session of the UN General Assembly (the minister of 
foreign affairs headed this delegation as well) was marked by 
the fact that the contribution of Belarus to the United Nations 
was increased by $2 million. We will now pay three times more 
than Hungary, twice as much as Greece, and 1.5 times more than 
the 800 million put up by India. 
  Without analyzing the reasons for adopting this decision, 
one 
can say merely that it will lead to a 1.5-fold increase in the 
republic's contributions to other international organizations, 
which are based on the existing scale of contributions to the 
UN: the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), UNIDO (United 
Nations Industrial Development Organization), UNCTAD (United 
Nations Conference on Trade and Development), the International 
Labor Organization, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, 
Scientific, and Cultural Organization), and dozens of other 
international organizations and hundreds of various conventions 
and joint expert and consultative groups. 
  The leader of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs prefers to 
remain silent about these facts. Therefore we will most likely 
not learn the truth about the contribution of the long-suffering 
Belarus to the budget of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe either. All we know is that it exceeded 
the contribution of Portugal and Ireland, whose economic 
potential is not likely to be very far below that of our 
country. And if perhaps these figures still do not strike terror 
in us, as more institutions of European cooperation appear, 
Belarus' contribution will strike a painful blow to our 
pocketbooks, which are practically empty to begin with. 
  Belarus' sharp increase in expenditures on multilateral 
diplomacy is occurring under conditions of a terrible economic 
crisis, which has struck literally all branches of the republic 
national economy. 
  A curious comparison can be made with the People's Republic 
of China. A country with more than a billion population and the 
most rapid rates of economic growth in the world (about 12 
percent annually), each year it contrives to reduce its 
contribution to the budget of the United Nations. After the 
increase of the contribution of Belarus and the regular 
reduction of China's contribution, we have almost caught up with 
this superpower in terms of the volume of hard currency payments 
for maintaining international bureaucrats. 
  Is there really no logic in diplomacy? There is logic. It 
lies in the varying degree of effectiveness of diplomatic 
efforts of various countries. 
  At the last session of the UN General Assembly Belarus 
submitted its candidacy for the Security Council. It lost to the 
Czech Republic. Now we will not appear on the lists of 
candidates for this position before the next millennium. 
Although if we had been able to really evaluate our capabilities 
and gain the support of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, at the 
next elections in two years our chances of obtaining a position 
on the Security Council would have looked much better. 
  Another fact related to the selection procedure is 
confusing. 
After the first round of votes it was clear that the Czech 
Republic would make it onto the Security Council. In this case 
the states that garnered the fewest votes in the first round, as 
a rule, remove their candidacies for the next vote, as if making 
a gentlemanly gesture. Belarus did not do this. We know how it 
ended--the Czech Republic was selected. 
  But let us be tolerant. Today's diplomacy is mainly 
multilateral diplomacy. In the international arena questions are 
decided to an ever increasing degree in informal discussions 
with the participation of several diplomats at the same time. 
Having only one foreign language, Russian, the minister of 
foreign affairs apparently sometimes experiences certain 
difficulties in communicating with representatives of other 
countries. Therefore some of the aforementioned blunders are 
partially the result of objective difficulties related to the 
problem of understanding. 
  But there are also blunders that have nothing to do with 
understanding.... 
  Strange as it may be, the Czechs did not put up their 
memorial plaques to Karel Capek and Jaroslav Gasek throughout 
all of Europe, but they were still selected for the Security 
Council. But, putting up signs all over the world and calling 
this foreign policy, we speak with the Italians about Frantsisk 
Skorina and his plaque in Padua, we engage in conversation with 
the Poles about Manyushko, and with the Japanese--about the need 
to immortalize the memory of Gashkevich. It is finally time to 
stop asking the entire world the eternal question: "Do you 
respect me?" 
<H5>  A Time To Gather Up Stones </H5>
  For the foreign affairs ministers of the United States, 
Germany, France, Japan, and also the Czech Republic the 
imperative of foreign policy has been problems of the economy 
and particularly questions of international trade. The author of 
these lines is not surprised by the fact that the first question 
raised in the international arena by leading politicians of the 
West and East is the defense of their interests in negotiations 
within the framework of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade). 
  It seems that the main foreign political task for Belarus is 
to provide favorable external conditions for carrying out 
economic modernization. But, observing the activity of the 
leader of the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, one could 
get the impression that all of our problems related to this were 
solved long ago and we can allow ourselves to work 
on....questions of culture. 
  The situation is quite the opposite. Antidumping legislation 
is continuing to work against us in the European Community. That 
is, we are considered to be a country with subsidized production 
(like the former USSR and now Russia). In other words, we 
continue to be seen as a state that receives oil, gas, and metal 
raw material at discounted prices. And therefore, unlike the 
Baltic states, we are taxed to such an extent that it actually 
blocks off our access to the European market. 
  In both domestic and foreign policy there is a certain 
tactic 
of behavior to which certain figures in the highest echelons of 
power resort from time to time. This tactic is as old as the 
hills, but even today it continues to produce certain political 
points. The main thing is to come up with a slogan or introduce 
an initiative and then, without following up on what has been 
said, immediately switch to other initiatives or historic 
programs. 
  Realizing the idea is much more complicated than merely 
discussing it. But it is the realization of what has been 
earmarked that increases the state's prestige in the 
international arena. Anything else merely undermines faith in 
the country's foreign political commitments. 
  There was a time when we threw stones. But sooner or later 
the time will come when we have to gather them--take 
responsibility for the promises we have made. 
  From the editorial staff. The facts contained in the 
published article show that Petr Kravchanka and the ministry he 
heads sometimes work on problems outside their purview. 
Moreover, instead of the expected aid, the republic itself is 
making considerable unjustified expenditures. Therefore it is 
impossible to understand why the activity of the Belarusian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet attracted the fixed 
attention of the Council of Ministers and the Supreme Council. 
At the present time SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA intends to publish a 
series of articles devoted to an analysis of the foreign policy 
of the Republic of Belarus in the most important regions of the 
world.

<F P=106> [Interview with A. Taranu, ambassador extraordinary and </F>
plenipotentiary of the Republic of Moldova in the Russian 
Federation, by V. Perushkin; place and date not given: "`We 
Insist on the Withdrawal of the 14th Army'"] 
  [Text] Of all the wars that erupted on the territory 
of the former Union, the war in Moldova was the shortest. 
Military operations in this region were suppressed with the 
participation of the Russian 14th Army. There is at the present 
time a fragile armistice on both banks of the Dniester. Our 
correspondent V. Perushkin asked A. Taranu, ambassador 
extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the Republic of Moldova in 
the Russian Federation, how political events would develop in 
Moldova in the immediate future. 
  [Perushkin] Anatol Mihailovic, do you not have the 
impression 
that all conflicts on the territory of the former Union have 
occurred and continue to occur not spontaneously but are a great 
bloody game being played according to a single script, the 
purpose of which is to unite everyone once again in a single 
union? 
  [Taranu] The point is that the status of diplomat requires 
that I be guided exclusively by the facts. I do not, however, 
have facts confirming your conjectures. But I agree that many of 
the events that are occurring could speculatively be viewed this 
way. And I would like to mention here that if Russia is to build 
its relations with its immediate neighbors on the basis of 
commonly accepted, civilized standards, this presupposes respect 
for the sovereignty and independence of the states that have 
appeared since the disintegration of the Union. In this case, 
despite the long transformation process, the result will be the 
most desirable for all without exception. 
  If, on the other hand, Russia attempts to spread its 
influence to its immediate neighbors by methods that were 
officially approved in Abkhazia or Moldova, the anti-Russian 
mood in the republics will intensify. 
  [Perushkin] What effect, in your opinion, will the results 
of 
the elections in Russia have on the political situation in 
Moldova? 
  [Taranu] Of course, both the October events and the results 
of the elections in Russia will, of course, be reflected in the 
political situation in the countries of the CIS, Moldova 
included. 
  The surprising success of political forces which, generally, 
no one had taken seriously before could signify the 
consolidation of all conservative blocs in our republic also. 
Considering that parliamentary elections on a multiparty basis 
are to be held in Moldova on 27 February 1994, I would like to 
hope that our democrats would draw the correct conclusions and 
not repeat the mistakes made by Russia's democratic forces. In 
addition, the election struggle with us is being exacerbated by 
the intensifying economic crisis. And the unresolved Dniester 
and Gagauz issues are complicating the situation as well. 
  [Perushkin] Certain Western newspapers are starting to say 
that economic assistance should not be channeled only to Russia. 
How, in your opinion, will Moldova attract the West's attention? 
  [Taranu] The extent of the aid to be received by Moldova was 
specified prior to the elections in Russia. And even after the 
results have been tallied, no abrupt leap forward on this matter 
on the part of the West has been observed. We have obtained 
credit, which is more or less enabling us to support the 
introduction of a national currency. The Moldovan national 
currency as of the present is one of the most stable currencies 
of the "near abroad" in relation to the dollar. A decline in the 
dollar's rate against the lei has been recorded even. 
  It seems to me that the West would be making a big political 
mistake were it not to render Russia the necessary support at 
this time in order to strengthen the democratic transformations 
there. There should be such assistance, but not at the expense 
of other republics, just as, equally, the latter should not 
obtain greater assistance at the expense of Russia either. 
Russia is today the main economic partner of the former Union 
republics. And the fullness and efficiency of economic relations 
with other regions will depend on how matters stand as regards 
the economic reform here. All of the former, us included, are 
interested in Russia standing on its own two feet economically 
as quickly as possible. 
  [Perushkin] The introduction of a national currency has in 
many republics been more of a political than an economic step. 
Will Moldova not suffer the same fate as Ukraine? 
  [Taranu] From Russia's viewpoint such a step could be 
considered political. From the standpoints of the other 
republics, however, it was a forced measure. And it was attended 
by the defense of the republics' economic interests. In 
introducing at home banknotes of the 1993 sample, Russia in 
practice kicked the rest out of the ruble zone. In Moldova the 
decision to introduce a national currency had been adopted back 
in 1991, but only now could it be implemented, in extremely 
inauspicious conditions, what is more. Any currency can function 
normally only under conditions of growing production. It is 
essential that in 1994 we halt the decline in production and 
then organize its gradual upturn. Otherwise couponization or 
karbovanization, which are one and the same thing, for that 
matter, await us. 
  [Perushkin] Is there today a problem of the Russian-speaking 
population in the republic? 
  [Taranu] Undoubtedly. But it is considerably less in terms 
of 
scale than in other republics. Instances of everyday nationalism 
are observed in Moldova, but even this is not that widespread. 
Our citizenship and language laws have undergone the 
corresponding inspection in international institutions and have 
been deemed to be perfectly acceptable. An attempt to play on 
the anti-Russian mood in Moldova is manifestly doomed to fail, 
therefore. 
  [Perushkin] How, in your opinion, is the presence of the 
14th 
Army in the Dniester region influencing the situation in the 
region? 
  [Taranu] Our position here is quite categorical. We insist 
on 
its withdrawal from the republic before 1 July 1994. Many people 
are saying that were it not for the 14th Army, the war between 
Moldova and the Dniester region would still be going on. Maybe 
so. But the situation is aggravated by the fact that the 14th 
Army did not strictly maintain its neutrality throughout the 
conflict. Materially, politically, and militarily it supported 
the policy of the Dniester leaders. 
  [Perushkin] A compromise between Moldova and the Dniester 
region has not, by all accounts, been found. Might not the war 
begin once again as soon as the 14th Army withdraws? 
  [Taranu] I believe not, although the possibility of the 
resumption of the military conflict cannot be ruled out in 
principle. The events of the first half of 1992 were a stunning 
lesson for Chisinau politicians. Even the most unbridled among 
them realized that the problem of the Dniester region cannot be 
resolved with an assault rifle. 
  [Perushkin] But what, then, will happen? Moldova's 
politicians have recognized that this matter cannot be resolved 
militarily, but the leaders of the Dniester region will not 
negotiate until the Dniester region acquires republic status. 
  [Taranu] Compromise is needed. But solving these questions 
with the present leaders of the Dniester region is quite 
difficult. There has to be a change of policy signboards there. 
Whereas this has already happened in Chisinau, everything on the 
left bank remains at the 1991 level. We are prepared to solve 
the question with the corresponding status of the Dniester 
region within the framework of Moldova. This status would afford 
an opportunity to remedy the postwar syndrome, and people could 
in time recognize that they are all citizens of Moldova. But 
today's leaders of the Dniester region will never agree to this. 
And one of the main reasons is the fear of losing the benefits 
and power that they have today. 
  [Perushkin] You maintain that there is in the Dniester 
region 
today a strict totalitarian regime not allowing of different 
viewpoints. Where are the guarantees that Moldova's policy will 
be different? 
  [Taranu] You read our newspapers, what they write about 
President Snegur. The level of freedom of the press is very 
high. Even too high, what is more, I would prefer our 
journalists and politicians to express their views in more 
civilized fashion. Their opportunity to express their viewpoint 
is indisputable. There is none of this in the Dniester region. 
The only person who can permit himself to speak is General 
Lebed. But it is hard to argue with him: He is backed by tanks.

<F P=106> [Article by the political department under the rubric "Press </F>
Digest. Elections-94": "Right, Left--Which Side?"] 
  [Text] The weekly TSARA published in its 23 November 
issue a report from the press bureau of the Khynshet division of 
the KhDNF [Christian Democratic People's Front]. It says: 
  "On 17 November the chairman of the Khynshet ispolkom 
[executive committee], Ion Donica, called together a limited 
number of individuals with leadership (and influential) 
functions in the rayon and also leaders of a number of villages 
and called for them to do everything within their power along 
with their relatives, loved ones, friends, and subordinates to 
block the Alliance of the KhDNF in this campaign. 
  Following the example of the rayon "head," the village mayor 
Mindzhir, a lawyer by profession, in violation of Article 14 of 
the Law on Elections to Parliament, arbitrarily, without 
convening a village council for this purpose, formed local 
electoral commissions which included a good part of the brigade 
leaders of the farms--the most conservative elements, including 
the last secretary of the local party organization. On 18 
November early in the morning, at a meeting of workers of the 
Mindzhir agricultural firm, he made public a list of members of 
precinct electoral commissions. When the violation of the Law on 
Elections to Parliament was pointed out to him, the mayor 
responded that the workers of the agricultural firm had been 
informed of them by way of a discussion. 
  Violations of this kind were committed by the mayor of the 
village of Serata Galbene as well. 
  The same newspaper printed an article by the candidate from 
the Alliance KhDNF electoral block, Eugeniu Garla. The author 
presents the main aspects of Moldovan-Romanian integration: The 
strategic basis of economic integration of the Republic of 
Moldova and Romania is the existence of a common economic space, 
which will provide for: free movement of the work force, 
capital, goods, and services; functioning of the 
financial-currency complex because of the unification of 
financial-currency, tax, banking, pricing, and rate system; and 
simultaneous implementation of economic reforms and joint 
implementation of the economic and social policy. 
  The achievement of this goal will create the conditions for 
stable development of the economies of the two Romanian states 
based on market relations. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  The chairman of the Democratic Labor Party, Aleksandr 
Arseni, 
also thinks that "relations with Romania must be strengthened 
and deepened." This is how he responded to a question from a 
DELOVAYA GAZETA correspondent: 
  "We do not think that the Sangheli cabinet has done anything 
to introduce our country into the world community. Moreover, the 
leaders of Moldova have an especially kindly attitude toward the 
CIS. This is the only place where they can see the republic's 
salvation. They frequently cry on our shoulder and ask for 
things. But our party thinks that too much significance is being 
attached to the role of the CIS in the life of Moldova. With a 
different policy we could quite easily change our economic 
orientation and achieve success in economic management. 
  "Unfortunately, the present prime minister of Moldova is not 
distinguished by his new thinking and is not prepared for this 
kind of dialogue with the world community. We are looking 
exclusively to the East. Yet there are people in the republic 
who have assimilated this thinking. Including in our party. The 
future is with them!" 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  A well-known deputy, a member of the ADPN [Agrarian 
Democratic Party of Moldova], Nicolae Andronic, granted an 
interview to the weekly ZEMLYA I LYUDI. Here is how he views the 
situation that has developed in the republic: 
  "Of course, I attribute all problems--economic, political, 
and others--to the fact that we do not now have unity of all 
political forces regarding the question of statehood. When all 
political forces are sincerely striving to create and strengthen 
the independence of one republic or another, when there is 
understanding of the fact that it is possible to maneuver, it is 
possible to join one bloc or another and then leave, but the 
main goal is to preserve independence. Take, for example, the 
Baltics. Regardless of their leanings--slants--all political 
parties of the Baltic region have the same center. And this 
center is independence. It is from here that the spiral 
develops. But what do we have here? Some see a panacea in one 
thing, some in another, and still others in something else. The 
political forces of the republic are fragmented and dispersed. 
Some are afraid of strong influence from the East, others--of 
strong influence from Romania. And all this is solely because of 
political skirmishes, for the republic's independence is seen by 
various people and various political parties from various 
angles." 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  A preelection address was delivered by the Socialist Party 
and the Unity Movement for Equal Rights, who are forming an 
electoral bloc: 
  "PRESERVE AND DEVELOP the historically formed COMMON VALUES 
of our society--interethnic peace and harmony, territorial 
integrity, fraternal cooperation among people of various 
nationalities, national public ownership of the land, natural 
resources, large basic branches of industrial and agricultural 
production, efficient centralized administration of the national 
economic complex, mutually advantageous cooperation with all 
fraternal republics of the former USSR. 
  "Our most important COMMON VALUE is the MOLDOVAN LANGUAGE 
and 
we must do everything possible to make sure that it is 
voluntarily mastered by all citizens of Moldova. A no less 
important COMMON VALUE is the bilingualism that has developed, 
especially in the cities, and extensive use of the RUSSIAN 
LANGUAGE, which almost all people living in Moldova have 
mastered. 
  "Still an indisputable COMMON VALUE is the worker, the 
person 
employed in socially useful labor in the spheres of material and 
nonmaterial production and the sphere of labor itself. 
Thoughtless, hasty reform in this sphere on the basis of 
neocapitalistic ideas is a crime. 
  "An enduring COMMON VALUE has been and will be the history 
of 
Moldova, including its Soviet period, which is characterized by 
rapid, historically unprecedented rates of socioeconomic 
development, the creation of the industrial and agrarian 
complexes, and the establishment of its science and systems of 
education, public health, and culture. 
  "To RESTORE and DEVELOP these unjustifiably lost COMMON 
VALUES, and above all those such as full, universal employment 
without degrading the human dignity of unemployment, which 
entire generations of workers have not known, a guarantee of job 
placement for all graduates of schools, vocational and technical 
schools, and secondary and higher educational institutions, 
unconditional and effective social protection of pensioners, 
children, and youth, large families and disabled persons, free 
education and medical service, legal protection, a state program 
for housing construction and provision of housing, 
representation of all social groups in legislative organs at all 
levels, public monitoring of the activity of the executive 
power, and elections of judges and people's assessors."

<F P=106> [Interview with Georghe Armasu, director of the State </F>
Service for Cult Affairs, by Anatol Limanskiy; place and date 
not given: "Georghe Armasu: 'The Church Is Separate from the 
State'"] 
  [Text] President Snegur recently signed an edict on 
the establishment of the State Service for Cult Affairs. Today 
we present its director, Georghe Armasu. 
  [Armasu] I was born into an ordinary peasant family in the 
village of Tsareuk in Rezinskiy Rayon... I am Moldavian. I have 
a higher education. I left home at 14 and enrolled in the 
agricultural technical school. After that, three years in the 
army. I went through all the stages of the administrative 
structure from team leader, deputy chairman of a kolkhoz, 
secretary of the rayon party committee, to the Central Committee 
of the Communist Party of Moldova. Starting in 1984 I worked as 
the deputy to the commissioner of the Council for Religious 
Affairs of the Council of Ministers of the Union for the 
Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. After the elimination of 
this apparatus--in the secretariat of the parliament of 
Moldova... 
  [Limanskiy] For what purpose did the president establish the 
new government service? 
  [Armasu] In order not to permit unjustified interference of 
the state organs in the activity of legally recognized religious 
organizations. To strengthen control over adherence to 
legislation on cults. The new state service is a consultative 
information and expert examination organ... 
  [Limanskiy] Until recently all these questions were handled 
by a department under the Ministry of Culture. Should it have 
been eliminated? 
  [Armasu] I would put the question in a different way. Was it 
necessary to unite culture and cults? Well, since you asked--I 
will answer... 
  After all, just what is a ministry? It is a state organ that 
manages and directs institutions and industrial organizations. 
In our case, the Ministry of Culture and Cults manages not only 
institutions but the church as well. This is a violation not 
only of the Constitution of the republic, in which it is written 
that in Moldova the church is separated from the state and 
school from the church (Section 50). It is a violation of 
international acts on human rights and freedoms. The church is 
supposed to be managed by religious centers that function on the 
basis of their own regulations and statutes. 
  The question on the unification of culture and cults arose 
for the first time in May 1990 at a session of the Moldovan 
parliament. The staff of the commissioner of the Council on 
Religious Affairs tried to prevent this. Here is a quote from 
one of the documents that we sent to the leadership of the 
republic. 
  "If the state, i.e., the Ministry of Culture and Cults, 
manages religions in the SSR [Soviet Socialist Republic] of 
Moldavia... this, it seems, will be a step backward with respect 
to the times when the administrative-command system was in 
operation, or even worse--when religion in the country 
(moreover, one--Orthodoxy) was declared a state institution. In 
the final analysis, this will inevitably lead to a dispute 
between denominations, between organs of authority and religious 
organizations, and to a complication of the whole sociopolitical 
situation in the Moldavian SSR." 
  Which is what we have today. One of our main tasks is to 
correct this state of affairs. 
  [Limanskiy] Judging by everything, do you think that the 
department for cults was not entirely engaged in what was 
necessary? 
  [Armasu] I am not one of those people who claims to have the 
final word. Let the church and the public first express 
themselves in this regard. I was not acquainted with Mr. 
Kubryak, the head of the department, before he was confirmed for 
the new post. But I know that he is one of the initiators of the 
revival of the activity of the Metropolitan See of Bessarabia. 
He directed this process at the state level, openly meddled in 
the affairs of the Orthodox Church, and undermined its trust in 
the state. 
  A trust that our state service should once again win... 
  [Limanskiy] Relations between the two Orthodox communities, 
I 
will say frankly, are strained. What is the reason for the 
conflict? 
  [Armasu] There was no conflict and there is none. 
  [Limanskiy] But what is there? 
  [Armasu] At the beginning of last year a group of clergymen, 
headed by His Grace Bishop Peter of Beltsy, decided to revive 
the activity of the Bessarabian Autonomous Metropolitan See 
after a 52-year break. On 18 December 1992, together with 
deputies in parliament and representatives of the Ministry of 
Culture and Cults, they took par in a meeting of the Holy Synod 
of the Romanian Patriarchate. The synod approved a so-called 
resolution of the "eparchial meeting of 14 September 1992 on 
reviving the activity of the Bessarabian Metropolitan See under 
the jurisdiction of the Romanian Patriarchate. Bishop Peter 
became the deputy of this metropolitan see and a member of the 
Holy Romanian Synod. Such a resolution seems to me to be rather 
arguable, inasmuch as back on 5 October 1992 Peter was suspended 
in service... According to canons, another church cannot restore 
him. 
  The metropolitan see ceased its activity in 1940, and since 
that time a lot has changed. There is no Romanian kingdom, no 
Moldavian SSR, and no Chisinau eparchy, but there is the 
Moldovan Metropolitan See, whose charter was officially 
registered by the government on 3 November 1993. 
  Although our service was established recently, we have 
already started talks on the peaceful settlement of problems. We 
are now studying archival documents concerning the organization 
and activity of the Bessarabian Metropolitan See, and we are 
proposing to examine them: There is now a critical question 
concerning property, inasmuch as the churches of Bessarabia were 
at different times under the jurisdiction of three 
churches--Ecumenical, Romanian, and Russian... 
  Only it is not necessary to rush, and it is not necessary to 
urge us on. The situation has to be studied well in the 
localities, and the leadership of the republic must be kept 
reliably informed. 
  [Limanskiy] In your opinion, will the religious communities 
have any kind of influence on the course of the coming 
parliamentary elections? 
  [Armasu] The communities are already quite politicized. And 
this is what they have come to. The church is a holy place, 
where people find peace, offer prayers to God, and enrich 
themselves spiritually. The priests hear the confessions of the 
people and forgive them their sins--and everyone needs this--the 
supporters of the people's front, and the socialists, and the 
communists. 
  [Limanskiy] Well, very soon new deputies will come to power, 
really the people's representatives. Does the Law on Cults 
require any kinds of changes? 
  [Armasu] Undoubtedly. The first article requires 
considerable 
revision--it denies the right to choose and to switch to another 
faith (proselytism). Articles 14 and 15 state that for 
recognition, cults "are required to submit their charter to the 
government." Some of the provisions of the law do not comply 
with international human rights and principles. 
  I think that we will prepare additions and changes to the 
Law 
on Cults in the very near future... 
  Availing myself of this opportunity, I want through your 
newspaper to call on all believers and leaders of religious 
organizations in these difficult times to maintain tranquility, 
not engage in disputes, and resolve all questions peacefully.

<F P=106> [Interview with V. Gorincioi, minister of agriculture and </F>
food of the Republic of Moldova, by Yu. Khudoley; place and date 
not given; published under the rubric "Interview at the End of 
the Year": "The Market Breaks Down Stereotypes"] 
  [Text] 
  [Khudoley] If you do not object, Vitalie Vasilyevich, let us 
begin our discussion with the results of the agricultural year. 
After all, no matter what happens, the food complex is the 
sphere of material production in whose situation everyone 
without exception is interested. The more so during our 
difficult and complicated times, and on the threshold of winter 
at that. 
  True, reports and comments about this appear in the mass 
media from time to time. But these have all been fragmentary, 
scattered information, although even from this it is clear that 
the preliminary prognosis was not fully justified. Is this true? 
Our readers would like to know about this, as it were, first 
hand.... 
  [Gorincioi] Indeed, there were quite a few optimistic 
predictions during the spring and summer. But most frequently 
they did not come from agrarians and certainly not from our 
ministry. Both traditional peasant customs and the 
unpredictability of production out under the open sky make it 
impossible for a serious agrarian to give out easy promises. So 
there is no need to ascribe others' sins to us, we have enough 
of our own. 
  If there is something for which many of us can be 
reproached, 
it is the habit of looking for reasons why the results promised 
by the politicians were not achieved. Most often we blame the 
unkindness of nature. In this case that would not be altogether 
true. Of course, in the spring there are always strong rains 
that wash away part of the planted areas, and during the 
summer--hail in the first half and drought in the second. But on 
the whole the year was not that bad. Especially for the good 
farms. 
  The problems were on a different plane. Above all there was 
the poor supply of fuel, mineral fertilizers, means of plant 
protection, and containers. 
  But, I repeat, looking at the larger picture, the year was 
favorable. And the results were generally not bad. Take just the 
indicators of the first grain harvesting. More than 42 quintals 
of high-quality wheat grain per hectare--Moldova has never had 
such a yield before. And it was on a larger area than usual. 
  According to preliminary calculations, the gross grain yield 
from all categories of farms, that is, including private, will 
be about 3 million tonnes. 
  Will this be sufficient or not? Of course, having learned 
from last year's bitter experience when because of the drought 
the livestock experienced a critical shortage of manufactured 
feed concentrates during wintering, many owners have been 
storing up grain. Nonetheless, more than 400,000 tonnes have 
been sold to the state. State procurements would probably have 
been greater if the banks had been able to allot sufficient 
credit resources. 
  But the main thing is that the population has bread to eat. 
Thus the kolkhoz and sovkhoz workers alone have been issued 
about a million tonnes of grain in the form of in-kind payments 
and preferential sales. In many villages, particularly in 
Drokiyevskiy Rayon, agricultural enterprises have extended this 
benefit to pensioners, teachers, and medical workers as well. 
  But although grain may be on everybody's mind, man needs 
many 
other things as well. For instance, the peasants have tried to 
give the food industry all the raw material it needed. In spite 
of the fact that, as I have already said, the rains eroded a 
considerable area planted in sugar beets, the productivity of 
this crop is fairly high. The quantity of sugar beets processed 
this season will be 1.8 million tonnes. This means that the 
output of sugar will reach 210,000-215,000 tonnes. Half of this 
what they call strategic product will be taken into state 
resources. It is intended for sale to the population at fixed 
prices and also for hospitals and other closed institutions. 
  As for other agricultural crops, the results have varied 
here 
too. For sunflower seeds, say, the indicator is mediocre. In any 
case the yield was lower than was expected in the spring and the 
beginning of the summer. Nonetheless we managed to grow them and 
harvest 185,000 tonnes of this oil-bearing raw material. 
  True, the agricultural enterprises have had to keep most of 
these agricultural products, since the processors do not have 
the credit resources to buy them. 
  Incidentally, it is only in our country that until recently 
the state has tried to buy up all the agricultural products from 
the farmers all at once and at any price. And procurement prices 
for them have been established at the very beginning of the 
harvest. Experts from the International Monetary Fund and other 
European organizations do not conceal their surprise at this. 
  Incidentally, at first glance such a procurement system 
seems 
advantageous to the agricultural enterprises since they can 
immediately obtain large sums of money. But in reality, under 
conditions of inflation and late settlements, the agricultural 
enterprises only stand to lose. There is no doubt that today it 
is more expedient to have stage-by-stage sale of products in 
batches with the corresponding price regulation. For instance, 
for sunflower seeds the sizes of the procured batches are 
determined by the monthly productivity of the processing 
enterprises. 
  With such a system of credit resources in the first stage it 
was necessary to purchase only 35,000 tonnes of raw material, 
and the rest of the batches of it were acquired with earnings 
from the sale of the oil. 
  This summer the farmers' concern about difficulties with the 
harvest and the sale of the fruit and vegetable crops has 
frequently shown through in the newspapers. True, the gross 
yield of these products is not a record, but there have indeed 
been additional problems with them. 
  It would seem that the demand for fresh fruits should 
increase. Because perhaps for the first time Moldovan orchard 
growers have managed to obtain an intensive type of almost 
ecologically pure fruits in their planted areas. 
  Nonetheless, there were frequent cases where our traditional 
customers refused our fruit last year. Incidentally, more and 
more frequently the suppliers themselves have been forced to 
reject partnership with nearby foreign countries. The main 
reason is the excessively high rates for rail transportation: It 
costs one-half to one-third as much to buy a kilogram of apples 
as it does to ship them to the Urals. And so it has turned out 
that of the 750,000 tonnes of fruit that were harvested, less 
than one-third was delivered fresh, and the rest of it was 
processed at our own enterprises. 
  Of course, this is not the best solution, but there simply 
was no other. True, the demand for dried fruits was good, but 
they are an even more energy-intensive product than the 
preserves and compotes. Since the beginning of the year canners 
have produced more than 1 billion conventional containers of 
products, and by the end of December the output will exceed 
20-25 percent of the level of any past year. 
  And this is under conditions with an extremely critical 
shortage of energy and material resources. After all, not all 
the banks followed precisely the parliament's decree on granting 
credit to agricultural enterprises for acquiring containers, and 
the canning plants--for buying glass jars, lids, and so forth. 
  Grape and tobacco growers were counting on hefty incomes 
this 
year. But industry was able to accept from grape growers only 
half a million tonnes of their products. The rest--about 200,000 
tonnes--was sold to the population or turned over for processing 
to be returned to the suppliers later, thus partially 
eliminating the immense interest on credit. Incidentally, grape 
growers cannot count on anything even for the raw material that 
has been shipped: So far the agricultural enterprises have been 
paid only 15 million lei. They are promising to repay their debt 
of 45 million as they receive their earnings from the wine that 
is sold. 
  The shortage of credit resources drove the tobacco growers 
into a corner as well. Agricultural enterprises grew about 
50,000 tonnes of dried leaves and are gradually selling them, 
but the specialized association is first paying for 15,000 
tonnes for the tobacco combine and then 10,000 tonnes to be 
exchanged for grades that are in short supply for cigarette 
production. The rest of the raw material is being processed, and 
as customers are found, the money is returned to the farms. 
  [Khudoley] So even in the autumn the agricultural 
enterprises, leaseholders, and farmers did not get especially 
rich. 
  [Gorincioi] If you keep in mind that under current 
conditions 
settlements for raw material are made not in advance but as the 
final products are sold, of course, immense one-time receipts of 
money into the accounts of the farms are not to be anticipated. 
But still the deficit of credit resources has ultimately worked 
to their advantage. If the old practice continues, neither the 
agro-industrial complex nor, above all, the processing branch 
will ever be able to get out of debt to the banks, with their 
enormous interest rates on credit which erode incomes and make 
products more costly. It is important to get away from 
intermediate credit at any price. With the creation on the basis 
of the processing enterprises of joint-stock companies involving 
the participation of agricultural enterprises, one must assume 
that this need will fall away. But the situation requires that 
we reduce the use of bank credit to a minimum even today. 
  Understandably, it is difficult to break old traditions, 
including the procurement mechanism that has been established, 
but there is no other way. What kind of effectiveness can there 
be if, for example, the agricultural enterprises ship grain to 
the elevators during July-August and are not paid for it until 
the beginning of November! 
  And such delays have become a part of the system. So it is 
better to switch to stage-by-stage procurements with revised 
prices for raw material. 
  To a certain extent the mechanism for procuring animal 
husbandry products is like this, and the ministry is making sure 
that it is strictly observed. In a number of cases it has even 
been necessary to resort to such a measure as suspending the 
issuance of wages to those processing enterprises that do not 
pay for their raw material for a long time. 
  It seems that in time the contractual-financial discipline 
of 
the partners will straighten out. But the situation is indeed 
critical within the animal husbandry branch itself. It has set 
the goal of producing 800,000 tonnes of milk per year, but from 
all appearances it will produce no more than half a million. The 
public sector of agriculture will produce 120,000-130,000 tonnes 
of meat instead of the earmarked 200,000. True, taking private 
farms into account, there will be more of these products. After 
all, the overall number of head of livestock in the republic has 
not decreased. 
  The reasons for the decline are known. Above all, last 
year's 
drought took its toll, leaving many farms on a starvation 
ration. And large complexes were left to the will of fate by 
farm-shareholders after the administrative-command system, which 
sustained them during difficult periods, collapsed. 
  One must assume that these complexes could have adapted to 
market conditions as well were it not for all kinds of 
restrictions. In particular, holding down the prices of animal 
husbandry products did not work to the advantage either of the 
branch or of the consumers. Regardless of how high they may have 
been against the background of the low buying power of the 
majority of the population, expenditures of agricultural 
enterprises are still not being covered, and there is nothing 
with which to compensate for the state overexpenditure. 
  And yet one must keep in mind that the agro-industrial 
complex, above all animal husbandry, is not working solely for 
the domestic market. Meat, powdered milk, butter, and so forth 
are practically the most marketable goods for which we can 
obtain the energy resources we need so much. For this reason 
alone we must produce them even at a loss to ourselves. 
  [Khudoley] Judging from the reports from agricultural 
enterprises, perhaps this is the first time so many of them have 
kept up with the fall complex of field work.... 
  [Gorincioi] It would be more correct to say this: We are 
speaking for the first time about the adversities suffered by 
the peasants. We said nothing when the sugar beets were 
delivered to the plants several months after they had shut down, 
when the corn was processed in the fields, when thousands of 
hectares of vineyards with unharvested grapes were covered with 
snow, or when areas planted in tomatoes and table beets were 
left to freeze. 
  Unfortunately, we have not managed to avoid losses now 
either. About 1,400 hectares of sugar beets and almost 3,000 
hectares of corn suffered from severe frosts. But if there is 
hope of saving these products (in particular, the harvesting of 
corn has not ceased for a single hour), it is impossible to save 
frozen fruits. The only thing they might be used for is jam. 
  But the most alarming thing is that 200,000 hectares of land 
on agricultural enterprises and about 80,000 hectares turned 
over to private possession of the peasants under Article 82 of 
the Land Code went unplowed. There are also farmstead plots that 
need to be plowed. 
  This happened because initially there was no fuel or 
lubricants, and then severe frosts struck unexpectedly at the 
beginning of November. 
  Now the fuel necessary to complete the plowing has been 
shipped in. There is also technical equipment. If there are 
"windows of time in winter" (and they are not a rarity in our 
region), we will be able to finish this work in 10-15 days. In 
any case, that is what the machine operators think. For, be that 
as it may, land plowed poorly in the fall is better than land 
plowed well in the spring. 
  It is especially important to do this work more quickly in 
the southern zone, where there are frequent dry winds in the 
spring and the only way of counteracting them is to plant in 
such a way that the plants have already developed roots and 
become strong by this time. 
  [Khudoley] Is it not too early for the state to abandon its 
concern about resource support for the farms? Does the ministry 
have an effective alternative that would make it possible to 
ensure their normal functioning? Or does everyone have to fend 
for himself? 
  [Gorincioi] Indeed, when encountering the shortages and the 
high cost of fuel on the market, many agrarians more and more 
frequently ask the question: What next? If the fuel problem is 
exacerbated so much, will there be a need for technical 
equipment, which becomes more difficult to restore each season? 
Is there any point in expending so much money and food in order 
to start running hundreds of thousands of motors in the fields, 
farms, and orchards? 
  If anyone is interested in my opinion, it is simple. If a 
person assumes that today it is possible to work the land 
without machine technology, he is deeply deluded. That would 
mean failure. Of course, it is useful to keep horses and oxen. 
But you will not plow very quickly or very well with this kind 
of power, and in general you will not receive a good harvest. 
  Therefore it is necessary to look in a different direction 
for a way out of the crisis--namely in modern technologies and 
the latest achievements of scientific and technical progress. On 
each agricultural enterprise and in the republic as a whole we 
must decide right now what we will do next year. Which structure 
of the planted areas will be most expedient? What should we grow 
in order both to satisfy the domestic market and to earn good 
money by selling products abroad? Even today we must know 
precisely what to sell and where and how to sell it. 
  Incidentally, we must spend intelligently as well. As for 
the 
major expenditure item, it is energy sources, as usual. They 
cost Moldova almost $600 million, and the agro-industrial 
complex can and does provide the lion's share of these funds. 
  But still, it is time to utilize these resources efficiently 
and move from slogans about economizing to practice. I have in 
mind not only guarantees against all kinds of losses but also a 
combination, especially on small farms, of modern machines and 
mini-equipment and horses. In many operations it is impossible 
to do without manual labor. But on most of the areas we must 
continue to rely on mechanization, chemization, and land 
reclamation. 
  [Khudoley] What is your assessment of the agrarian reform in 
Moldova? How accurate are the suggestions from experts of the 
European Community regarding the mechanism for economic reforms 
in your branch? 
  [Gorincioi] Reforms in agroeconomics are not simply 
mechanical redistribution of the land. Their meaning lies in 
completely different relations between the sphere of production 
of raw material and the sphere of its processing, between the 
producer and the state. Completely different relations are 
required today within the former kolkhozes and sovkhozes as well. 
  In a word, the purpose of the reforms is by no means to 
divide up collective or state wealth and drag it off into our 
own little corn bins and then rejoice in such "innovation." We 
need a reform that will provide for increased production and 
high labor compensation. And it is possible to interest the 
peasant in efficient management only if he feels that he is 
working for himself. 
  That is, as it were, the internal side of the reforms that 
are taking place. But today it is apparently not without reason 
that we are asked this question: "What are you doing in order to 
enter a qualitatively different orbit of relations with the 
West?" For now we must admit that only the first steps are being 
taken on this plane. They come to us from there with one goal in 
mind--to earn more. And they will really cooperate with us when 
they see us as equal partners with good intentions and good 
potential. 
  But there has been a breakthrough in the creation of joint 
ventures. In particular, in the sphere of meat production and 
processing, where there will be an entire group of these 
productions with the participation of American capital. One of 
them is already being formed in Oknitskiy Rayon. A protocol of 
intentions has been signed. In grape growing and wine making, 
common interests with Dutch, British, German, and other firms 
have been discovered. There are proposals for joint production 
and processing of tobacco from an Australian firm, but its 
conditions (it demands 51 percent of the authorized capital for 
itself) do not suit us. We are working on the question of 
building a glass bottle plant which will be financed both by 
enterprises of the republic and foreign banks. This plant is 
extremely necessary. But when accepting assistance we must 
remember that it will be necessary to pay for it.... 
  Incidentally, the special demand of producers of energy 
sources for animal husbandry products forces agricultural 
enterprises and organs of local self-government to revise their 
attitude toward complexes. 
  People can say to me that this initiative must come from the 
ministry or even from the government. But most frequently that 
is what happens; we are convinced of this by the special-purpose 
allotment of preferential credit and taxation, the writing off 
of debts on credit, subsidies, etc. It is another matter, 
apparently, that we should not disperse this assistance but 
concentrate it in the leading areas and positions. If only to 
provide goods for the domestic food market. 
  And in general the initially forced reduction of subsidies 
and compensations for agriculture brought about by the state 
budget deficit is also exerting a positive influence. People are 
gradually breaking the habit of placing their hopes in the state 
and learning to manage efficiently themselves, taking their 
capabilities and reserves into account. In a word--doing what a 
market economy requires. All the plans for technical assistance 
developed by experts from the European Community are aimed at 
reforms that provide for a transition to the market. They have 
now begun to be implemented and this is sensitively reflected in 
the standard of living of the underprivileged. 
  In order to weaken the negative consequences, the government 
is trying to take advantage of every opportunity to strengthen 
the social protection of the underprivileged segments of the 
population. Precisely because the reforms affect these 
categories of citizens first of all, the government is forced to 
be extremely cautious in implementing them. 
  Throughout this winter (during the summer and autumn the 
peasants were not up to reorganizing) we suggest taking the 
fundamental measures of agrarian reform. We have already begun 
to transform the kolkhozes and sovkhozes that wish to create 
independent peasant farms. We are also prepared to integrate the 
production of raw material with processing in joint-stock 
companies. 
  Under modern conditions the ministry's role has also changed 
from what it was when it mainly distributed funds. We see our 
task in implementing the corresponding section of the government 
program for bringing the economy out of its crisis.

<F P=106> [Article by Kaarel Kilvits, Economic Institute of the </F>
Academy of Sciences: "Structural Crisis In Estonia's Industry"] 
  [Text] 
  The structure of the industry that had (been) developed 
by the year of 1989 did not correspond to the needs of Estonia 
after it had regained its independence. The central authority of 
the Soviet Union had, in all possible ways, reduced the 
importance of the union republic as a whole. Through trade 
ministry control, specialization to the point of absurdity, 
extending contacts for cooperation, location of production, 
acquisition of raw materials, and other such measures, all were 
made dependent on everyone else. 
  This meant dismantling most of the previously existing 
structures, and interrupting the natural self-regulation of the 
economy. In essence, Estonian industry was nothing more than a 
collection of enterprises located within its territory. 
  Thanks to the very large market of the Soviet Union, as a 
relatively closed system, its enormous natural resources, and 
its deficit economy, the industry did not have to contend with 
world competition. And thanks to a price structure that was 
absurd, artificial, and radically different from the rest of the 
world (unjustifiably low prices of energy carriers, raw 
materials, etc.), a predominantly resource- energy- and 
transport-intensive industry was created, that produced 
primarily low-quality goods. 
  As a prerequisite for reaching a realistic level of 
political 
and economic independence, Estonia saw the need for considerably 
reducing its economic dependence on Russia, and for reorienting 
itself to the Western market. Actually, these steps were as 
inevitable as they were necessary. There was no choice in the 
matter. The Eastern market had, by that time, become less 
important and less secure. 
  Industrial enterprises that had previously produced goods 
for 
the Eastern market, according to plans approved in Moscow, were 
now caught up in entirely new circumstances. When previously, 
industrial management teams only had production, technical and 
supply problems to cope with, then now the basic question was: 
What should be produced and for what market? 
  Many clear thinking economists and industrial leaders 
realized that--as sad as it may be--there is no way of reforming 
the industry smoothly and painlessly. Instead, they conceded, 
the existing industry may collapse, and a new one emerge in its 
place. 
  And that is what happened. Back in 1990 and 1991, production 
volumes dropped considerably, and in 1992, the real structural 
crisis started. I want to emphasize, once again, that this was a 
completely logical development. All the post-socialist countries 
have experienced a decline in production, none of them have been 
able to avoid it.

<H5>  All Governments Have Been Getting Involved </H5>
  Perceiving and understanding the underlying laws of economic 
and social development, does not necessarily mean that the 
government, industrial leaders and economists rely on 
self-regulation, follow the development of the industry 
passively, and let things take their course. 
  Quite to the contrary. All governments have been rather 
active in getting involved in the industry of the transition 
period. Maybe even too active, for the taste of some political 
forces and economists. 
  The structural crisis of the industry is continuing during 
1993. The production volume for the first nine months of the 
year (at comparable prices) was down by 32.4 percent, compared 
to the same period last year. September's volume of industrial 
production (at comparable prices) was down 19.2 percent, 
compared to September of last year. 
  The decline of industry has been enormous, of course. The 
output of many of the products has been reduced several times, 
while production of some goods has stopped entirely. The 
problems are many, of course, but there is no need to 
over-dramatize the situation. Starting with March of 1992, one 
can see that the industry is beginning to stabilize. 
Stabilization, in this case, does not mean restoring the 
previous production levels aimed at the Eastern market, but 
stopping the decline in production and finding (or formulating) 
an industrial structure appropriate for Estonia. 
<H5>  Industrial Production Growing </H5>
  Since March of this year (except for the massive vacation 
months of July and August), industrial production at comparable 
prices has been growing. During the first eight months, proceeds 
from corporate income tax amounted to 93.2 percent of the 
budgeted total for 1993. This not only points to increased 
economic activity, but also to the fact that the economy is 
picking up faster than was expected at the time the budget was 
approved. 
  Estonia's economy has been able to reorient itself to the 
Western market. When, in 1989, close to 97 percent of the trade 
was done with the Soviet republics then, by the middle of 1993, 
the share of CIS republics, in both imports and exports, had 
dwindled to 27 percent. In August of 1993, the CIS share of the 
total foreign trade volume (exports and imports combined) was 
23.9 percent. From that we can conclude that Estonia's 
dependence on the Eastern market has dropped below the level 
maintained by Finland during its record years (26 percent). 
  Thanks to the monetary reform, balanced budget, and 
following 
the recommendations of IMF, Estonia has, within a short period 
of time, become a country worthy of investments, and has indeed 
attracted considerable amounts of foreign capital. 
<H5>  Bankruptcies Are Inevitable </H5>
  There are many small businesses developing fast. As of 
October 15, 1993, a total of 7,434 companies were registered 
under Estonia's processing industry. Out of that number, roughly 
4,000 are actually operating, half of them with 20 or more 
employees. Even that is not a small number, compared to earlier 
counts. 
  One fifth out of roughly 300 big enterprises have also 
managed to find their place under new economic and political 
circumstances. They have not reduced their production, compared 
to last year's. It is hoped that most of the companies still 
struggling with hardship will soon find their place in the new 
economic system--many of them after privatization. Some 
industrial enterprises, however, will inevitably go bankrupt. 
They will be either liquidated, refinanced, or reorganized. It 
would be impossible to save all of the production facilities 
that were put up at one time to encourage migration, supply the 
Eastern market, or simply to the greater glory of the system, 
even with the best of intentions and the most ingenious of 
industrial policies. 
  Comparing Estonia's 'economic miracle' to that of other 
post-socialist countries, one can say that Estonia's industry 
came through this confusing time and situation with sustainable 
losses. The IMF, the World Bank, EBRD, government leaders of 
other states, and known economists speak of the success of our 
current reforms, setting them up as models for the other states. 
Western diplomats and journalists have been using the term 
'Estonia's economic miracle' with increasing frequency. It is 
most rewarding to hear all that. At the same time we know that 
there are still many problems yet to be solved, and in many of 
the sectors production is declining to this day. Of particular 
concern is the politically over-heated Northeast Estonia, that 
is of no interest to foreign investors, and where it is hard to 
develop private enterprise. Development, here, is hampered by 
lack of capital and by incomplete legislation. 
<H5>  Ownership Issue Is Key Problem </H5>
  If we had not made so many mistakes, hesitated, dawdled, and 
lost time, we would have been further along by now. But the 
breakthrough has already taken place. Development has become 
irreversible. The structure of the industry has already changed 
to some extent, and conditions have been created for further 
development. As things stand now, not only are the old jobs 
disappearing, but new ones are sprouting up in their place. 
  Estonia's strategic goal can only be the creation of a 
industry capable of export, and joining the European Community 
(the first stage obviously being a free trade agreement). State 
allocations for structural policies to implement these goals are 
very limited. This is why it was decided to privatize most of 
the work. Everything that can be done using private capital, 
should be done using private capital. 
  A sensible and, if possible, rapid solution of ownership 
issues is at the heart of industrial development. Once this 
problem is solved successfully, conditions will be created for 
solving all other problems and also for a general economic 
upturn.

<F P=106> [Article by Lembit Annus, correspondent: "It's Advantageous </F>
To Trade With Russia: Estonian Ministry of Economics Makes a 
Discovery"] 
  [Text] Economics Minister Toomas Sildmae has given a 
flattering assessment of this past year's results. He 
particularly emphasized the fact that "just during the last few 
months of last year the indicator of the Gross Domestic Product 
rose for the first time in a long time. And its growth has now 
become quite marked. The authoritative prestige of the Estonian 
economy has become stronger, and--in comparison with our Eastern 
neighbor--it is now in a more advantageous, winning position. 
The volume of services within the GDP [Gross Dometic Product] 
has just about reached 50 percent of the total, and--according 
to this indicator--our republic will soon reach that level (55 
percent), which is present in the developed countries." 
  The minister noted the "increased role played by the 
ministry 
in formulating the Estonian state's economic policy." By way of 
affirming this, Sildmae cited the one statistic which--in the 
opinion of that great wheeler-dealer, Ostap Bender--means 
everything. "Today our ministry has jurisdiction over more than 
two-thirds of the state enterprises which--just during the first 
nine months of this past year--produced more than 5 billion 
Estonia kroon (one kroon now equals 91.63 Russian rubles). These 
enterprises acquired profits of 100 million kroon." 
  Of course, not everything is so cloudless under the Estonian 
sun. Just as before, the situation in the Russian-speaking 
northeastern part of the country is still causing headaches. In 
Narva, for example, one out of every five city-dwellers is 
entering upon the new year as an unemployed person. It was here 
that the Estonian government just barely managed to avert a mass 
street demonstration on New Year's by allocating to the 
employees of the Baltiyets Plant 2 million kroon as partial 
payment of the wages which they have not been receiving since 
autumn. But this is merely a drop in the bucket if we take into 
account the fact that this plant owes its own collective some 
8.5 million kroon. Moreover, some of the workers here have 
already been unemployed for a long time, whereas no end to 
privatization is in sight. Therefore, we cannot agree with the 
minister's conclusion to the effect that the "situation in the 
northeastern portion of this republic remains complicated." It 
is not only complicated, but also totally explosive. 
  "As of now, our ministry's relationship to this region is 
that of a fire brigade, whereas the enterprises have turned out 
to be helpless in handling their own affairs. But we can help 
only those who want to help themselves." Such was the 
philosophical conclusion in the reply to my question directed at 
the Estonian economics minister. 
  It is indisputable that Mr. Minister is correct in his 
opinions. But I am still disturbed by the thought that in Narva 
work even at the once leading Krengolmska Manufacturing Combine 
has now--as the saying goes--dwindled down to a trickle. Here 
one cutback has followed another in an unending stream. And even 
those persons still working here are doing so only half-time. 
Could it be that the reason for this lies in the dismissal of 
the director, Gennadiy Klushin? 
  The ministry views the principal tasks of 1994 as continuing 
the economic policy of open doors, as well as solving the 
problems of the agrarian sector. Also included among the 
top-priority tasks are continuing talks with Russia and the 
European Community, increasing export potentials, and solving 
the problem of property ownership. In this connect, we cannot 
fail to note the fact that trade with Russia has been given one 
of the top priorities for the new year. But that means that 
political policy and economic policy have each been assigned 
their own separate places. And it turns out that it is not only 
inevitable to trade with Russia, but even advantageous to do so. 
The only regret is that this truth is only beginning to be 
realized now--at a time when many economic ties with Russia have 
already been irreversibly disrupted.

"Ashgabat's Special Position"] 
  [Text] A meeting of the CIS state leaders was scheduled for 
23-24 December in Ashgabat. 
  Your VEK correspondent, who had been in Turkmenistan for 
several days prior to the Ashgabat Meeting, had a conversation 
with Turkmenistan's minister of foreign affairs, Khalykberdi 
Atayev. 
  "Our republic does indeed take a special position among the 
CIS countries," the minister said. "We regard the Commonwealth 
as a consultative instrument, lacking in any rigid 
administrative organs. We consider that the CIS should 
facilitate the development of bilateral relations between the 
members of this organization. During the initial period many 
people did not understand us, seeing in our position a desire to 
isolate ourselves, to depart from the principles of uniting the 
states involved. However, Turkmenistan's president, Saparmurad 
Niyazov, maintains a different opinion. He advocates the uniting 
of states on the basis of full sovereignty and the development 
of bilateral relations. Therefore, our state did not sign the 
CIS Charter in Minsk, nor did it join the economic union. We 
assume that Turkmenistan will be able to join this organization 
in the capacity of an associate member." 
  "Practical experience has shown that decisions adopted at 
the 
CIS level are not carried out in the necessary manner. Moreover, 
these decisions do not facilitate businesslike cooperation among 
the states involved. But bilateral decisions--in 
contrast--clearly presuppose mutual obligations which must be 
carried out. Such a position taken by Turkmenistan has found 
understanding and support from a number of CIS states." 
  Khalykberdi Atayev went on to explain his state's position 
with regard to the conflict in Tajikistan: 
  "When the matter arose of the need to create a joint troop 
force in order to safeguard the Tajik border and to maintain 
order in Tajikistan itself, Kazakhstan and Russia appealed to us 
on this matter. Our president declared that he would not send a 
single Turkmen soldier into Tajikistan and would not intervene 
in this conflict. He posed the question as follows: Who would 
the Turkmen soldiers fight against in Tajikistan? The Tajik 
oppositionists had possibly crossed the border from Afghanistan 
and were receiving support from certain Afghan groups. However, 
the Kabul government immediately declared that it had nothing at 
all to do with this. But within Tajikistan itself complications 
and confrontations have taken place resulting from clashes 
between various factions struggling for power. In such a 
situation--just whom would the Turkmen troops be fighting 
against? We have stated that Tajikistan must solve its own 
internal problems by itself by means of talks among the 
conflicting parties and by means of strengthening the power 
structures within that country. Our participation in this matter 
could consist of providing humanitarian assistance to the 
suffering population." 
  Turning to economic problems, the foreign minister noted 
that 
at the present time some 11 billion cubic meters of gas annually 
pass through Russian territory on their way to the West. 
However, by way of seeking its own, independent egress to 
foreign markets, Turkmenistan is actively carrying on 
preliminary talks with regard to constructing a gas pipeline 
through the northern part of Iran and Turkey--to Europe. As the 
minister noted, his country could export 10-15 billion cubic 
meters of gas to Turkey, whereas it it could send 30 billion to 
Europe. The explored gas reserves in Turkmenistan amount to 13 
trillion cubic meters. Proposals are now under study for laying 
gas pipelines to China's eastern shore and to Pakistan. Other 
large-scale projects are also being studied, in particular, in 
the field of international railroad transportation.

<F P=106> [Article by Karmo Kaas: "Estonian Entrepreneurs Like </F>
Trading"] 
  [Text] 
  At the moment, trading is indisputably the most popular 
field of activity. Three quarters of the companies entered in 
the business registry show wholesale and retail sales as their 
principal activity. At the same time, state- and 
municipally-owned commercial enterprises account for only 14 
percent of the total business volume. 
  Leev Kuum, leading scientist at the Estonian Institute of 
Economic Forecasting said that, in the retail sector, the sales 
volume has been increasing significantly since March of this 
year, and that in August, the retail volume was up 33 percent, 
compared to January. Preliminary statistical data of the Bureau 
of Statistics shows that the volume of commerce for the first 
nine months of this year amounted to 4.89 billion kroons. Kuum 
attributed the increase in the retail volume to a 70 to 80 
percent increase in the purchasing power of consumers. 
  He added that despite the increase in the number of stores, 
resulting in increased competition, most of the commercial 
enterprises consider the market outlook to be satisfactory. Also 
increasing, for the second quarter now, is the number of stores 
planning to improve their finances, as sales gain momentum. This 
also indicates that the ability of the merchants to trade has 
been increasing right along with the growth of commerce. 
  Kuum said that the organizational development of Estonia's 
retail trade is still in its initial stages. By now, one is 
beginning to see the first signs of store mergers to form chains 
or consolidate ownership. Most mergers of stores into chains 
will probably be based on a common source of supply. 
<H5>  Wholesalers Offer a Limited Selection </H5>
  Raivo Kutt, commercial director of the Central 
Alliance 
of Estonian Consumer Unions (ETK), estimates that most of the 
wholesalers are dealing with food items, as food items also make 
up 90 percent of the retail market. 
  Data on the volume of retail sales within the ETK system 
shows, however, that the share of manufactured goods is 
increasing within that volume. Kutt said that, in January, 
manufactured goods made up 23 percent of the total volume, by 
now this share is up to 30 percent. In the future, the share of 
manufactured goods should remain below 35 percent of the total 
trade volume for Estonia as a whole. 
  Leev Kuum maintained that the share of manufactured goods in 
the total sales volume is increasing, especially in the case of 
garments. This is caused by the higher income level of residents 
enabling them to spend some of it on updating their wardrobes, 
something that was not happening immediately after the monetary 
reform. 
  Besides, most of the people had not made any wardrobe 
purchases since 1989 or 1990, and these expenditures became 
neccessary to replace the worn-out garments. 
  Referring to subjective reports, Raivo Kutt estimated 
that 80 percent of Estonian wholesalers have a limited selection 
of goods, and the number of articles offered does not exceed 
200. Traditional articles of trade are beverages and 
confectionery items. Besides, there are also a number of 
wholesalers specializing in alcohol. 
  Another observation made by Kutt was that many of the 
wholesalers deal in imported goods only, ignoring the fact that 
local products, because of their lower price, are very much in 
demand. 
  Leev Kuum added that in the area of increasing the selection 
of goods, Estonia has a long way to go. Compared to the stores 
in Poland, for example, Estonia's selection of goods is very 
conservative, even though Poland has not reached the level of 
the Western countries yet. Food stores in Estonia carry a 
selection of close to 1,000 articles, whereas 5,000 is 
considered to be the norm in the developed countries. 
  The selection of manufactured goods available in Estonia is 
even more limited than that of food items. Most of the 
manufactured goods are imported, mainly because of the price 
factor, making the purchases more of a chance affair. There are 
still big gaps in price ranges or shades of color for 
manufactured goods, and for different sizes in the case of 
garments. Right now, different items have different combinations 
of specifications that are not available to the consumer. 
  "Estonia has made rapid strides, to be sure, towards 
developing a better selection," Kuum said. "However, there is 
only so much the wholesalers can do with their limited operating 
capital." 
  Raivo Kutt said that many of our trade problems stem 
from 
the small size of our market, making it necessary to use 
middle-men. To deal directly with large producers, we would have 
to be able to buy goods in much larger quantities than our 
wholesalers can sell. 
<H5>  ETK Wholesale Volume Increased Five Times </H5>
  Raivo Kutt said that the monthly wholesale volume of 
ETK 
has gone from 7 million kroons in January of this year to 35 
million kroons today. Other major wholesalers have, in his 
estimation, reached a monthly volume of 10 million kroons. 
  Buying practice is based largely on direct contact with 
producers, with the use of middle-men kept to a minimum. 
Currently, ETK wholesalers are dealing directly with 250 major 
producers and providers in 18 countries. 
  Constant supplies available include 1,500 food items and 
5,000 manufactured articles. 
  Kutt said that ETK's direct involvement is limited to 
wholesale arrangements. The management of retail businesses 
within the ETK system is in the hands of local consumer unions, 
while ETK's role in the development of retail businesses 
consists of cooperation with the local consumer unions. 
  The wholesale portion of ETK consists of four enterprises: 
The ETK Purchasing Center, and the Tallinn, Tartu and Voru 
distribution facilities. During the first half of next year, 
wholesale companies should combine into one organization under 
the tentative name of ETK Hulgi [ETK Wholesale]. The entire 
wholesale business should be set up so that purchasing is based 
on selection, and distribution handled according to the regional 
principle. 
<H5>  Chain of Stores Coming to Estonia </H5>
  Up until now, there have been 27 different kinds of stores 
in 
the ETK system, according to Kutt. As the retail trade is 
reorganizing itself, six kinds of stores should be left, and 
planning calls for combining them into different retail chains. 
  The first to be launched is a chain of stores bearing the 
name of Edu [Success], the first two of which are scheduled to 
open before Christmas. Next year, 50 new stores will be added to 
the chain. 
  The formation of a chain of stores does not involve building 
new stores, but rather consolidating the existing ones. Stores 
belonging to a chain will have the same name, the same layout 
and selection, an integrated cashier's system, etc. 
  Edu stores will be located at parish centers, they will each 
have a 300 square meter sales area, a selection of up to 1,000 
items of food and manufactured goods, to cover the primary 
consumption needs of the people. The monthly sales volume of 
stores in the chain should be roughly half a million kroons. 
  Kutt noted that the stores of the Edu chain will 
remain 
in the possession of local consumer unions, but ETK will enter 
cooperation agreements with them. Supplying this chain of stores 
will be the task of ETK's wholesale division. 
  Currently, there are more than 1,000 retail enterprises 
within the ETK system, and their combined sales volume for this 
year should be 1.3 billion kroons. 
<H5>  Competition Does Not Reduce Markup </H5>
  Leev Kuum said that the commercial markup of stores has gone 
from the state-regulated 8 percent up to 25 percent, 10 percent 
of which is spent on the store's general expenses, and 5 percent 
for salaries, leaving a 10 percent profit for the store. Out of 
the earlier markup, roughly 2 percent went for salaries, leaving 
1 percent of the volume for profit. With the present markup, due 
to higher salaries and higher overall expenses, the stores can 
also offer better service to their clientele. 
  The Institute for Economic Forecasting has not done a 
special 
study on customer satisfaction with the level of service at the 
stores but, based on personal experience, Kuum thought that the 
level of service at the stores has gone up considerably. Legal 
problems relating to consumer protection still need to be 
resolved, but the commitment of the stores to sell and their 
willingness to act on it is becoming visible in our commercial 
enterprises. 
  Stronger competition, Kuum thinks, will not result in 
reduced 
markup or the dropping of price levels in the retail trade. 
Changes, however, will begin to take place in the internal 
structure of markup, with the profit portion going down, and the 
expense portion going up, which impacts directly on improving 
service to customers. In the Western countries, it is quite 
normal for the handling cost of goods to amount to half of their 
production cost. 
  Raivo Kutt added that advertising will be playing an 
increasing role in the development of commerce, which will run 
up the cost accordingly. Besides, the purchasing power of people 
will also be going up, and the merchants will try to take 
advantage of it. 
  Kutt also said that, in the future, markup will 
probably 
become more differentiated, varying for different types of 
merchandise. Perfume sales, for example, are very rare, but a 
large sales volume can be reached by markups up to 80 percent. 
  For the year of 1994, Kuum projects Estonia's trade volume 
in 
kroons to increase by 25 to 30 percent, and be in the range of 9 
to 10 billion kroons. 
  The fastest increase of sales volume will probably be noted 
for garments (30 percent), technical goods (except cars) 25 
percent, and food items 20 percent. 
  Raivo Kutt remarked that in Estonia's retail trade, 
most 
of the merchants will probably be operating on their own for 
some time to come. Establishing retail chains would require 
having one's own wholesale operation and, besides ETK, there are 
only two or three other wholesalers capable of starting their 
own chain. Creating retail chains through mergers of 
independently operating merchants is probably still a long way 
off for Estonia. 
  A few years from now, Kutt said, there will be two or 
three big wholesalers left on the Estonian market. The rest of 
the businesses will either leave the market or become local 
middle-men or importers of some particular item.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuri Lyashov: "Lithuania Extends Benefits to </F>
Foreign Investors"; first paragraph is introductory paragraph] 
  [Text] The Seimas (parliament) and the government of the 
Republic of Lithuania have adopted a package of legislative acts 
regulating the sphere of foreign investments. 
  The attraction of foreign capital has been found to be a 
boon 
in Lithuania, and in the new legislative acts the republican 
authorities envisage a number of benefits for foreign investors. 
Thus, if a joint venture is instituted -- or investments are 
carried out in any other way -- until the end of this year, then 
part of the profit amounting to the share of the foreign 
investor will for five years be levied with a tax decreased by 
70 percent. True, on the condition that it has not been used for 
the payment of wages. On the expiration of five years this tax 
will for another three years be 50 percent less than usual. 
  If a JV is instituted or the investments of foreign capital 
are made in the course of two subsequent years -- i.e., from 
January 1, 1994, to December 31, 1995 -- the share of the 
foreign investor's profit will for a whole six years be levied 
with a tax diminished by 50 percent. 
  The dividends received by foreign investors in Lithuania 
will 
in general be tax free. Not liable to taxation will also be 
their profits repatriated abroad. Moreover, it will be possible 
to do this in the shape of goods and services purchased on the 
domestic market. 
  Under Lithuania's laws, it is not only juridical but also 
persons of other states, as well as persons without a 
citizenship permanently residing abroad, that are recognized as 
foreign investors. The latter category is granted the same 
benefits, which may present an interest to some inhabitants of 
the republics of the former USSR. 
  The decisions on the foreign investments of up to three 
million dollars are taken by Lithuania's Ministry of the 
Economy. For making investments in state enterprises enjoying a 
monopoly position on the Lithuanian market there is already a 
need to obtain a permission from the government. Considered to 
be a monopoly owner is an enterprise manufacturing at least 50 
percent of the products made in the republic, and the government 
has even approved a list of enterprises whose controlling 
interest can be purchased solely with its permission. 
  Enterprises run with the participation of foreign capital 
and 
instituted as joint-stock companies may be registered on the 
list of Lithuania's enterprises solely after the payment by all 
founders of initial fees to the tune of at least a quarter of 
the nominal cost of the shares. The remaining fees must be paid 
not later than in the two years after the registration date. 
  The term of the leasing of land by foreign investors may be 
as long as 99 years with the priority right of its prolongation. 
The size of the rent to be paid for the plot of land is not 
liable to be changed throughout the term when the lease is in 
force unless, of course, it envisages something different. 
  It is noteworthy that Lithuania's legislation envisages 
guarantees for foreign investors. The loses sustained by them as 
a result of actions by the republic's state managerial bodies 
and officials must be fully compensated on the basis of the 
international law norms. And the disputes on foreign investors' 
rights or legitimate interests being violated may be considered 
by the courts not only of the Lithuanian Republic, but also by 
foreign or even international agencies.

  [Text] Denmark's Energy Minister Jann Sjursen expects 
further development of friendly relations with Lithuania. 
According to the minister, Denmark gives priority to relations 
with the Baltic States. 
  "We will continue to support Lithuania politically, morally 
and economically," said the Danish official at a press 
conference in Vilnius on November 25. 
  The Danes have already rendered assistance to the Lithuanian 
economy totalling around 20 million Danish krones. This week 
they brought a package of new projects to Vilnius. Lithuanian 
Energy Minister Algimantas Stasiukynas called the latest program 
a new impulse in Denmark's determination to co-operate with 
Lithuania. 
  The current visit of the Danish Energy Minister is aimed at 
environmental protection, energy saving and efficiency programs. 
Lithuania is interested in studying the Danish experience in 
supplying and saving heating energy. 
  On November 27, Mr. Sjursen visited the Ignalina Nuclear 
Power Plant and the Moletai region, where a boiler-house, using 
local timber waste, is about to be assembled. The modern 
boiler-house was donated by the Danish government.

  [Text] Parliament Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas has advocated 
a national referendum to determine Lithuania's future relations 
with NATO. Neither the president nor the parliament should 
decide whether Lithuania should join NATO. It must be done by 
the nation, he said. 
  According to the chairman, Lithuania would limit its 
sovereignty by joining NATO. Therefore, it should hold a 
referendum like some Western countries did before joining the 
Maastricht Treaty, the parliament chairman noted. 
  In addition, the NATO-option should be co-ordinated with the 
national security plan and discussed in the context of 
Lithuania's entire foreign policy. Mr. Jursenas suggested the 
parliament hold an extraordinary meeting before Christmas or in 
early 1994 to discuss the problems.

<F P=106> [Interview with A.V. Kozyrev, minister of foreign affairs of </F>
the Russian Federation, by ROSSIYA correspondent Andrey Sharyy, 
place and date not given, under the rubric "Throughout the Wide 
World": "The Country Tripped Itself Up: The Minister of Foreign 
Affairs of Russia on Domestic and Foreign Policy"] 
  [Text] The outcome of the elections created an acute 
desire among politicians to speak up. Andrey Kozyrev, who by his 
own admission fully grasped the need for "contacts with the 
public" during the election campaign, did not stay on the 
sidelines either. Toward the end of last week the minister of 
foreign affairs invited to his suite representatives of the few 
Moscow newspapers--as a diplomat described it, "publications of 
a quiet democratic persuasion." Andrey Sharyy represented the 
weekly ROSSIYA at this session of contacts with the public. 
  [Sharyy] Andrey Vladimirovich, will the results of the 
elections influence Russia's foreign policy? 
  [Kozyrev] Russia's foreign policy is determined by the 
president. Fortunately, the president is not being replaced. 
This means that there are no grounds to speak about changes in 
the country's foreign policy course. The source and mandate of 
Russia's foreign policy remain unchanged. We should not forget 
that the adoption of the new Constitution is the main outcome of 
the elections. This document carries the imprint of the national 
leader, just as policy unavoidably bears the imprint of what is 
happening in society. Despite the elections introducing a 
certain element of destabilization into our society, I see 
nothing terrible about their result. 
  Indisputably, foreign policy accents may be changed when the 
new parliament begins to work, when its nature and character are 
determined. We will need to take into account the position of 
the Duma, obviously, heed the criticism in some way, and adjust 
our course. However, few candidates took an interest in foreign 
policy issues during the election campaign, and this is why it 
was difficult to find out who is dissatisfied with what. Perhaps 
only Zhirinovskiy distinguished himself, but his criticism 
amounted to fascist-type demagoguery. It is hard to call what he 
proposed a foreign policy program. Besides, the positions of the 
LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] keep changing. In one 
of his presentations after the election, Zhirinovskiy retracted 
virtually all territorial claims against foreign countries. At 
the same time, note an altogether unprecedented case: The man is 
making territorial claims against his own country by demanding 
that Kaliningrad be converted into a Russian-German condominium. 
This is the extreme limit of irresponsibility, these are crazy 
pronouncements. 
  I believe that we should not panic and exaggerate the danger 
to the process of democratic reforms. Of course, the results of 
the election are not too gratifying; nor can we ignore the 
circumstance that the threat of fascism coming to power has 
arisen in the country. However, I had, after all, been talking 
and warning about it for a long time. We should try to separate 
the buffoonish form of Zhirinovskiy's speeches from this real 
threat. 
  The task of forming a broad antifascist front, including the 
participation of Communists, is becoming obvious. I am trying to 
evoke in the Communists the essence of communism; after all, 
during World War II the communist Soviet Union fought Nazi 
Germany together with the United States, which did not eliminate 
ideological differences. I hope that the Communists will not act 
together with fascists at present, either. 
  Please do not try to find in these words some kind of a 
failure to dovetail with my previous positions. It is just not 
there. I remain anticommunist, and since the elections our 
differences with the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, 
say, on economic issues have not diminished. They say that they 
intend to build communism; let them intend--we do not intend; 
but as far as fascism is concerned.... 
  Previously, we said that our opposition is of the 
"Red-Brownshirt" coloring. The time has come to separate the Red 
from the Brown. By no means should we allow the formation of a 
communist-fascist bloc. An antifascist bloc is needed. 
  [Sharyy] To your mind, to what degree did the democratic 
image of the country at large and your ministry in particular 
become "tarnished" throughout the world after the results of the 
election were known? 
  [Kozyrev] I believe that the initial headline shock of both 
our press and foreign newspapers has already worn off. The 
threat of the peril of democracy is real, but it should not be 
made larger than it actually is. First, for now we cannot say 
that Zhirinovskiy will control the parliament. His influence is 
prominent, but it does not mean a change in the overall course. 
Second, it is not yet known what kind of people these are. I for 
one do not know anyone in the LDPR, except for Zhirinovskiy 
himself. It is quite possible that some of the LDPR faction will 
not march to the drum of its leader. Besides, it is not known 
how Zhirinovskiy himself will behave. 
  Excessive patriotic rhetoric merely hardens the adversaries 
of Russia abroad. We are tripping ourselves up in a way. The old 
Supreme Soviet regularly engaged in this, continuously provoking 
our partners to take a harder line. We should be aware of one 
more circumstance which is manifested in some circles 
speculating with pleasure on the results of the elections, 
beginning with the Ukrainian supporters of nuclear weapons and 
to those in Central Europe who, with maniacal stubbornness, wish 
to join NATO. Questions are already being heard: Are we not 
coming out against the admission of Poland and the Czech 
Republic to NATO because we are beginning to yield to our 
Red-Brownshirts? There are circles in the West, too, which are 
interested in maintaining at least a residual arms race for 
their corporate considerations because they make money from it. 
At present, they are prepared to latch on to any pretext in 
order to say: "You see, you cannot trust the Russians!" 
Meanwhile, our patriots take pleasure in giving them 
ammunition.... 
  [Sharyy] What lessons have you personally learned from the 
outcome of the elections and the outcome of your election 
campaign in Murmansk? 
  [Kozyrev] So far, I am not all that scared. The experience 
of 
my campaign indicates that if you talk normally to the people, 
answer questions, hear them out, and so on, they will vote for 
you and be receptive to your arguments. Moreover, they, these 
people, are very reasonable; on the other hand, I understand 
them. I understand their irritation over these endless 
scholastic TV debates. In essence, the people did not vote for 
Zhirinovskiy; they voted against those whose peacockery 
irritated them, against the complacency of the authorities. They 
were sick of seeing on screen the mugs of my colleagues and 
friends, including obviously my own, who know everything but 
cannot explain it articulately. 
  The nighttime "Welcoming the New Political Year" on TV is 
precisely a case in point. They gathered in order to be seen on 
screen yet another time. I for one did not attend this 
welcoming, although I had been invited persistently. I was so 
tired that, to tell you the truth, I went to bed at 2200 on the 
night of the vote. During the night I was awakened by my wife, 
who was in tears when she saw what was happening there. 
Incidentally, the unprofessionalism of our politicians was a 
factor in the conduct of the election campaign. Where were 
professional politicians to come from? All of these American 
recipes for conducting advertising campaigns do not work out 
here. Against the background of how the people live in Murmansk, 
the dog from the advertising clip of Russia's Choice is 
terrifying. After all, society in the United States has a full 
stomach, whereas a different approach to our people is needed. 
Do you remember the proverb "Some complain of not enough cabbage 
in their soup, while others complain that their pearls are too 
small?" So, for now we have cabbage soup, and this is the reason 
American electoral logic does not apply to Russia. 
  [Sharyy] However, you belonged to the leadership of the 
Russia's Choice bloc and obviously could influence the tactics 
of the election campaign.... 
  [Kozyrev] In the executive committee we entrusted this to 
people who were professionally responsible for this--Bragin and 
Poltoranin. As one of the members of the Russia's Choice 
leadership, I do not disclaim responsibility, although, frankly, 
in the weeks right before the election I was too busy with my 
campaign in Murmansk and international affairs to follow the 
situation in Moscow. I did not even have an opportunity to watch 
TV. However, I was altogether terrified when I returned home. 
  This should provide a great deal of food for a great deal of 
thought, for a major adjustment of policy. What was 
Zhirinovskiy's forte? He went to the elections with lies of 
cosmic proportions, whereas Russia's Choice went to the 
elections with something inarticulate. Zhirinovskiy bought 
several hours of TV time and sort of talked to people in a human 
way. He talked obvious nonsense. However, it turned out that 
this was nonsense, say, for me, but not for many people: They 
are no longer used to things being just explained to them and 
argued in regular spoken language, without showing off, without 
posturing, or to problems of interest to them being discussed 
with them....that they were not shrugged off. Here is the 
result. I did the same in Murmansk, that is, answered questions 
in a popular, human language, and looked at the audience. If I 
saw that my words were not getting through, it meant that I had 
to explain in more detail and argue. I understood that one 
should talk to the people and explain all the nuances to them, 
because hundreds of myths exist which have been quite skillfully 
created by SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA and PRAVDA. So, in addition to 
adjusting the course, we should think about ways to explain our 
policy to people. 
  [Sharyy] What are the differences between parties with a 
democratic orientation on foreign policy issues? 
  [Kozyrev] I do not have an answer to this question at the 
moment. The emergence of differences is not dictated by the 
policy course; the process originates in reverse--personal 
ambitions bring about political polarization. Many of my 
colleagues from the democratic camp were thinking about not only 
the elections to the Federal Assembly but also a presidential 
elections. Each candidate needs his own party for the 
presidential elections. When Russia's Choice was being formed I 
came out in favor of it emerging precisely as a bloc rather than 
a party. At that time, this point of view won out just because 
it was right and not because I advocated it. Having understood 
that no one will give up their ideas about filling the position 
of president--neither Serezha, nor Grigoriy--I proposed to not 
split the parliament and proceed toward the elections with a 
joint platform. Of course, some variants were possible; well, 
women could break off if they wanted to create something on 
their grounds. However, the democratic movement would have 
preserved its unity. However, a reverse process got 
underway--based on ambitions. It turned out that for some 
democratic leaders the main problem was that they did not end up 
as the first ones on the lists. The split for personal reasons 
prompted a search for political substantiation. Since there were 
not enough real differences, artificial ideological spectrums 
emerged: The programs of some parties shifted to the left or to 
the right, perhaps, considerably further than their leaders 
would have liked. They have now grasped for themselves that 
their genuine electorate is elsewhere. 
  [Sharyy] The experience of the coexistence of the Ministry 
of 
Foreign Affairs and the old parliament turned out to be 
unsuccessful. Obviously, problems will arise for you in the 
Federal Assembly, too. Proceeding from your experience in 
interaction with the Supreme Soviet, what are you preparing for 
at present? 
  [Kozyrev] I had a very constructive attitude toward that 
parliament. To my mind, my situation with regard to that 
parliament was quite normal. I must say that at the beginning 
cooperation was not being established all that badly. It is 
another matter that the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 
the condition in which it was a couple of years ago could do 
little. I hope that a constructive relationship will develop 
between the new parliament and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
At any rate, we are doing everything possible and are preparing 
for this as much as possible. 
  What do we need the parliament for? First, to have a 
legislative base. 
  Second, for opposition. Why? Because the parliament should 
express the public sentiment. You might recall that I asked the 
Supreme Soviet time after time to give me an opportunity to 
speak from the rostrum. I continued to invite myself to events 
of this kind even when the Supreme Soviet became altogether 
frantic and they appeared to be unable to stand the sight of me, 
because there is no other way to communicate: Normally, a 
minister reports, and deputies ask questions. It was just 
impossible to work with a majority of the old deputies because 
they altogether failed to get to specific problems. I will tell 
you that a completely monstrous catastrophe will happen if the 
Duma is going to be like the Supreme Soviet.... On one occasion 
we held a quite businesslike closed-door meeting of the Supreme 
Soviet Committee for International Affairs. The newspapers 
wrote: How come--there is a confrontation between the ministry 
and the Supreme Soviet, but the conversation proceeded in a 
friendly tone? So, this was a very instructive meeting: At 
first, all the Isakovs and Baburins flocked there, but they sat 
in the hall only as long as the TV cameras were rolling. A few 
people came who were interested in something, who wanted to 
figure it out, and began to ask questions. Fifteen minutes later 
the entire irreconcilable bunch left. Why would they stay? They 
cannot carry on a conversation at this level. 
  Control is the third point in relations between the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs and the Duma. Regular control of the 
parliament over the ministry is needed, just as there is control 
in any normal country over the operation of any normal 
department. 
  [Sharyy] Apart from the need to explain the outcome of the 
elections to the entire world, what particularly concerns you in 
our foreign policy at present? 
  [Kozyrev] I am concerned about a few substantive issues, for 
example, the issue of expanding NATO membership. We have ensured 
that for now no decision on quantitative expansion will follow. 
Some Central European figures cannot even explain what joining 
NATO would accomplish for their countries, and cannot actually 
imagine how this will end. Expanding NATO will, pardon me, 
amount to a revolution in the entire military organizational 
development and command. And nobody is ready for this at 
present. Some politicians are saying persistently that 
ultimately it is possible to admit new members to NATO. But we 
are saying this, too! However, this is "ultimately," that is, 
following a stage of cooperation! At issue is not the admission 
of some countries to NATO as the beginning of the path but 
rather an opportunity to join as the result of a path which is 
yet to be traveled. Meanwhile, there is a long path to be 
traveled. It is time to proceed from the discourse about who 
should be admitted and when on to more essential issues, and 
this is what gives me a headache. What will be the specific 
content of this stage of cooperation? 
  The situation of the Russian-speaking populace in the nearby 
foreign countries is the second serious problem. This problem 
exists in various countries in different forms. For example, 
there is a tremendous difference between the Baltic states and 
Kazakhstan, but there are problems in both. Some of our foreign 
partners have opted for a clearly speculative approach instead 
of working along democratic lines. I would like to warn that, 
while our strategic foreign policy course remains unchanged, 
very firm things will occur on the part of Russia in this 
instance. Incidentally, we will have to seriously interact with 
the new parliament on these issues. Our relations with nearby 
foreign countries largely depend on how qualified the deputies 
of the Federal Assembly will be. Of course, we will not get 
anywhere if the Duma consists exclusively of people who are only 
capable of stating: "We do not have a policy in the nearby 
foreign countries, and that is that." 
  [Sharyy] You have preferred to discuss domestic rather than 
foreign policy today. Are you preparing for a switch in your 
career? 
  [Kozyrev] No. The whole point is that in our country 
domestic 
policy is too closely tied to foreign policy. This connection 
has become particularly obvious now. 
  The time has come to draw conclusions. We should not yell at 
one another: "Hey, you are to blame for Zhirinovskiy's success!" 
Now is not the time for public acrimony. This severe blow may 
have been necessary for the democrats to come to their senses 
and to get bruised. The main point is not to smash all Russia in 
the process. The only fortunate thing is that the president was 
not up for election this time. We have at least two or three 
years in order to test once again what we are worth.

<F P=106> [Interview with V.L. Sheynis by Tatyana Sukhomlinova; place </F>
and date not given: "`Pygmalion' Is Disappointed With `Galatea.' 
Viktor Sheynis Believes That the Election Statute Has Flaws"] 
  [Text] Despite Viktor Leonidovich Sheynis being a quite 
prominent political figure, here are a few words about our 
interlocutor. 
  Until the late 1980's, the door to politics was closed to a 
person with his political views. Science, which he engaged in 
with great pleasure, became the only area for 
self-accomplishment. Had it not been for "perestroyka," 
everything would have developed as it had.... His first 
experience in entering politics occurred much earlier, when he 
wrote a small work about Soviet intervention in Hungary in 1956. 
This work of the young graduate student was designed for what 
was later named samizdat, but ended up in the KGB first. As a 
result, he was expelled from the graduate school and worked as a 
borer at the Kirov Plant for six years.... 
  As the former chief of the parliamentary working group for 
revising the Election Statute, he perceives the experience of 
the last election campaign in a philosophically calm and 
politically calculated manner. 
  [Sukhomlinova] An ancient story about the relationship 
between the creator Pygmalion and the result of his inspired and 
tormented labors, Galatea, has been implemented anew...in the 
course of the last election campaign. How do you evaluate your 
"Galatea," the Election Statute? 
  [Sheynis] Alas, this lady has turned out to have flaws.... 
The Election Statute has advantages and, unfortunately, obvious 
disadvantages. I consider the introduction of a mixed voting 
system to be the main accomplishment; under the system, half the 
deputies are elected on a proportional basis from the lists of 
electoral associations to which political parties and other 
organizations belong. They objected to me, as a rule in a 
demagogic manner: Why give preference to parties at a time when 
in our country they do not even amount to parties in the greater 
scheme of things. I believe that they will not appear here until 
we have multiparty elections in the country. After all, only the 
"party of a new type" engaged in everything from ideological 
conditioning of the working people to the distribution of all 
kinds of benefits. For their part, parties which exist in the 
environment of a democratic country mainly "work" for elections. 
  [Sukhomlinova] Therefore, we may hope that the process of 
asserting a modern power structure has begun.... However, why 
was precisely this provision, whose potential is obvious, very 
difficult to "push through?" 
  [Sheynis] The reasons are many. I will give one of them. All 
of this is unusual to us, and new things are, as a rule, 
rejected. Opponents suggested that we first conduct an 
experiment and see what happens: to elect 10 percent of the 
deputies the way we proposed, and 90 percent--the old way, in 
single-seat districts. In conjunction with this, I recalled an 
old joke: At one point they became concerned here about the poor 
condition of street traffic. They sent a delegation to England 
to gain advanced experience. Upon its return, they concluded: 
Indeed, street traffic is doing very well over there, probably 
because it moves on the left. Let us try this in our country 
too, and by way of an experiment convert just one motor vehicle 
pool to driving on the left.... We would have had the same 
experiment with these 10 percent.... 
  Still, despite the resistance we managed to ensure that the 
president agreed with us (he was precisely the one to introduce 
the Edict on Elections). We managed to meet with him, explained 
our position, and gave all the arguments "in favor" and 
"against"--and he agreed with us.... I think that our former 
parliament would not have resolved to pass such an election law. 
  [Sukhomlinova] Still, what is its principal flaw? 
  [Sheynis] Our main mistake was that we introduced a system 
of 
one-round voting in single-seat districts. A situation developed 
which was similar to the 1989-1990 elections. Just as at that 
time, a multitude of candidates, frequently without a clear 
association with parties, competed within the same district, and 
this "split" the vote of the electorate. However, those 
elections were held in two rounds, after all. This time there 
were random results in many districts.... 
  I tried to change the situation by setting an example and 
withdrew as a candidate in a single-seat district, suggesting 
that the voters support another candidate from the democratic 
bloc, Pavel Medvedev, who was elected as a result. I counted on 
something greater: on others following my example. Alas.... The 
two-round system would have allowed us to correct the situation 
to a degree and to concentrate the votes of the electorate with 
similar political orientations around the most promising 
candidates. Having perceived the mistake, our working group 
passed on to the president the draft amendments to the Election 
Statute as early as 3 November. At the time amendments were 
still being made. However, either the president turned down our 
proposals or the draft simply did not reach him--it is not easy 
to find a way to the president.... Well, the issue was closed. 
  [Sukhomlinova] However, can we say that this is an issue for 
the future? 
  [Sheynis] Certainly. We will analyze our original draft law 
most thoroughly against the background of the actual electoral 
process and will, of course, try to introduce amendments to the 
law which the parliament has yet to adopt. After all, the 
statute in effect is devised solely for the 1993 elections. It 
has other drawbacks, too. The extremely short period allowed for 
the election campaign is the common source of the drawbacks. 
When preparing the draft law we proceeded from the necessity of 
135 days for the entire campaign. This is not a random number 
but one calculated with the experience of other campaigns and 
the conditions specific to our country taken into account. 
However, the elections were announced, and the real election 
campaign was conducted within a considerably shorter period of 
time, which undoubtedly influenced its results.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Minkin: "President Acts Like a Czar: </F>
Boris Yeltsin Repeats Boris Godunov. With the Same Success"] 
  [Text] It is impossible not to indulge in rereading "A 
Comedy About a True Calamity Upon the Kingdom of Muscovy, Czar 
Boris, and Grishka Otrepyev." 
  BORIS: 
  For me there is no happiness, I thought to calm my 
people With prosperity and glory, To win their love 
with generous gifts. 
  I remember how the price of gasoline was doubled before the 
referendum. People went wild; you could cut the cursing with a 
knife at the gas stations. Suddenly, the price hike was 
repealed. Shumeyko innocently announced that the hike had been a 
political mistake. Everybody immediately understood 
that the hike was not repealed--just postponed. 
  Shortly before the elections, the generosity was far more 
extensive. A week before the fateful date, the minimum wage was 
doubled. (Having doubled, it rose dramatically to one-fifth of 
the poverty level. The only happy people are GAI [state 
motor-vehicle inspection] personnel, who calculate their 
extortion in multiples of the minimum wage). 
  And on the eve of the elections, the favors poured as if 
spilling out of a worn-through sack: 
  Yeltsin signed an edict giving the MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs] the right to set base salaries and the size of 
additional categories of cash allowances. 
  Yeltsin signed an edict raising pensions. 
  Yeltsin signed an edict raising pensions for persons born 
before 31 December 1931. 
  Yeltsin signed an edict on improving the system of state 
allowances and payments to families with children and increasing 
their size. Beginning 1 January, there will be a monthly 
allowance for each child.... 
  Cheap moves. Expensive inflation. 
  Doctors, teachers, and other "budget-financed" folks all got 
handouts. Everybody, absolutely everybody, got some presents. 
And what good did it do? 
  Commission an independent survey. Ask: Has at 
least one person who got a raise changed his mind in favor of 
Russia's Choice (the president's party)? Have they managed to 
buy even one vote? Has not this shower of generosity produced 
the reverse effect: You want to buy me cheap? here, I will show 
you! 
  I opened the granaries for them, I scattered Gold 
in their midst.... But raging, they cursed me! 
  They will say: This was a planned generosity, benefits 
conceived a long time ago. I will not believe it. Why then was 
this bundle of favors was announced so rudely the day before the 
election? 
  Are we not people? Do we not feel humiliated by such sudden 
benevolence? 
  And how can a humiliated person get even with authority? 
  By not showing up at the polling station or by checking 
off--out of spite--a different square on the ballot. 
  A sad paradox. Of the entire of Boris Godunov, we 
best remember "The people are silent"--a phrase Pushkin never 
wrote! We remember what Zhukovskiy added to the play in order to 
fool the censors. 
  Pushkin had a different attitude toward the people. But look 
first how Grishka Otrepyev, an insolent thief, an pretender 
speaking different languages, talks to people: 
  PRETENDER: 
  Everything conspires in my favor: both people and fate 
--Who are you? 
  POLE: 
  Sobanskiy, a free Polish gentleman. 
  PRETENDER: 
  Praise and regard to you, the child of freedom! 
Give him one-third of his allowance in advance. 
--But who are these? 
  KHRUSHCHEV (Russian): 
  We are your Diligent and persecuted serfs; 
Disgraced, we have escaped from Moscow. 
  PRETENDER: 
  Take heart, innocent sufferers, Just let me get 
to Moscow. Czar Boris will pay for all this. Who are 
you? 
  KARELA: 
  A Cossack. I was sent to you from the Don By free 
hosts, by brave atamans, By Cossacks from the upper and 
lower reaches of the Don. 
  PRETENDER: 
  I used to know Don people. I had no doubt That I 
would see in my ranks the Cossack standards. We thank the 
Don host of ours. We know that the Cossacks now Are 
oppressed unjustly and persecuted. But if God helps us to 
ascend To our fathers' throne, we will honor the old 
tradition To favor our loyal free Don. 
  Sounds familiar? Typical Zhirinovskiy intonations. His 
teacher was not stupid when she pounded into their heads: The 
classics always remain contemporary. 
  Half of the voters did not show up at the polls. (Even less 
had been expected. By the edict on elections, one-quarter would 
have been enough). Some did not go out of captious snobbishness: 
This is beneath me, they said. Others out of a certainty that 
everything had been decided in advance anyway: An echo of 
previous decades--whether you show up or not, it is still 99.9 
percent. 
  Brothers and sisters! Our brains--all of us--still operate 
in 
the Soviet mode. The state is an enemy. It rapes us with 
residence permits, sticks us into labor camps, sends us to the 
BAM [Baykal-Amur Mainline], robs us with taxes, strangles us 
with forms to fill out, makes us deal with boorish bureaucrats; 
the militia is an enemy, the judges are enemies; they grab our 
young men and send some of them to the tundra and others to 
Afghanistan; slogans are lies, promises are lies; 
we-will-live-under-communism; mind-honor-and-conscience; 
let-us-respond-with-shock-labor-to; the food program; apartments 
for everyone by the year 2000; everything for the good of the 
individual.... 
  For decades, the state worked hard to make people hate it. 
Hatred toward the government has become a part of our flesh and 
blood. Live by law and die. You want to live--know how to 
circumvent it. For decades (generations!) people lived in a 
country where the rulers, newspapers, radio, and television 
constantly lied, lied, lied. 
  We all grew up and lived in a society where it was 
considered 
valorous to cheat on the state. And stupid to observe the rules. 
  Our national hero is a crook. Ostap Bender. There are as 
many 
films about him as about Lenin. And an honest man is a fool, a 
laughingstock for everyone. 
  An American action movie: The hero is a policeman. Our 
movie: 
The hero is a thief. Govorukhin himself played gangsters, not 
procurators. 
  Hatred toward the authorities. This is how Yeltsin won 
against Gorbachev. The whole world loved Gorby, but the Soviet 
people were for Yeltsin! He took a dip, he looked extremely 
slumberous during his appearances in America; the KGB set traps 
for him every step of the way--and it all worked in his favor. 
Gorbachev had the Army, the KGB, the omnipotent apparatus, but 
the people chose Yeltsin! For his wise program? For his promise 
to get rid of privileges? No. Yeltsin was against our 
dear party-and-government. That was all. And quite enough. 
  Now Zhirinovskiy has played this card and won. Do people 
really believe his babbling about free vodka? Do they thirst for 
Khazanov to be executed by firing squad? Do they want to fight 
on 33 fronts simultaneously? No. But Zhirinovskiy is against the 
authorities. That is all. And quite enough. 
  BASMANOV (commander in chief of the Muscovite Army): 
  We have sufficient forces, thank God! I shall 
inspire them with victory; And you--whom will you send 
against me? Not Karela the Cossack? Or Mniszek? And 
are there many of you? Why, a mere eight thousand. 
  PUSHKIN (an adherent of the Pretender): 
  You are mistaken; you will not find even that number of 
them--I myself say it, our army is rubbish, The 
Cossacks merely plunder villages, The Poles merely boast 
and drink, While the Russians.... there's no denying 
it.... With you I'll not dissemble; But do you know 
what we are strong in, Basmanov? Not in our army, no, not 
in Polish aid, But in opinion--yes! In popular 
opinion. 
  The people are not silent. Do you understand? 
  There is a tremendous difference between Yeltsin and 
Zhirinovskiy. Yeltsin promised reforms, which is very difficult 
to do. It is hard and long, and nobody knows how to do it, and 
there is much theft, and many lies.... 
  Zhirinovskiy promises war. This is very easy. Just give it a 
push! And then it will keep moving on its own. Once you start a 
war--try to stop it. 
  Remember how the Georgians saw the suppression of Abkhazia 
as 
an easy stroll. A day or two; maximum a week. And now 
Shevardnadze crawls on his knees: Take us into the CIS! Give us 
bread! We are dying! War has devoured the well-fed, blessed, 
rich, resort-like Georgia. And it continues to devour, picking 
the bones. 
  One thing is good--Zhirinovskiy's victory woke Yeltsin up. 
He 
finally learned the true worth of his advisers, the cunning 
courtiers. 
  Stankevich, Bragin, and others have been fired. 
  That Bragin was professionally and otherwise unfit to serve 
as the radio and television chief was clear to everyone from the 
very beginning. It was clear BEFORE he was appointed. The flight 
of the best people from Ostankino, the idiotic agitation and 
propaganda--he got away with everything. Finally, on 3 October, 
Bragin, out of cowardice and stupidity, shut down Channel 1, 
plunging the country into a shudder of horror. And 
afterwards--rewards, kisses, medals. God deliver me from fools. 
  What good has the FITs [Federal Information Center] 
accomplished over the time of its existence? What has it 
accomplished at all? A gigantic, very rich agency had been 
bestowed upon a favorite, but other than getting into scandals 
with the procuracy, Poltoranin has not accomplished anything 
whatsoever. Actually, this is not correct. The night after the 
election, he celebrated at the Feast of Democracy, drank 
champagne to the New Political Year, and hugged Zhirinovskiy. 
  Since Poltoranin has not given any reason to suspect him of 
being gay, we have to consider his heavy petting with Zh. [an 
allusion; both the name Zhirinovskiy and the Russian obscene 
word for derriere--"zhopa"--start with the letter Zh.] as having 
a political, rather than sexual, overtone. 
  A farsighted political P. [prostitute]. (This is not me 
about 
Poltoranin--Lenin said this about Trotskiy). 
  What other heroic deeds should the hapless Kozyrev commit to 
be dismissed from his job for innumerable flops in Russian 
foreign policy? Having watched Kozyrev for three years saying 
"Yes, yes, yes" to America and Western Europe, one begins to 
feel nostalgic for Gromyko, with his "No, no, no." 
  And what did we get as a result of endless concessions? What 
kind of presents? Seven pills of aspirin per capita of bad 
population? 
  The weak are disliked; the stupid get no respect; and liars 
are hated. 
  As a result, we have icy relations with the nuclear Ukraine. 
And jubilation in Pentagon: Hurrah! The end of thaw! Kravchuk is 
clinging to his nuclear bombs; the mad hawk Zhirinovskiy has won 
the elections--this is enough for the Pentagon to hammer $20 
million-$30 million out of Congress. Oh, the Cold War--that was 
a golden time! A generals' time! Why did Bragin kiss 
Zhirinovskiy? Why not kiss Grachev? 
  What else does Grachev have to do to get dismissed? The 
Western Group of Troops has rotted on the stalk. Traders-general 
transport booty by military aircraft.... 
  The Army must love and respect its commander. You cannot 
make 
people face death by giving them salaries and apartments. These 
are not very smart hopes. Salaries and apartment exist to keep 
the Army from mutiny, no more than that. They do not instill a 
fighting spirit. Only love, respect, and fear push people into 
battle. Salaries and apartments are a market. A market operates 
on different criteria, different incentives, different values. 
When you are facing a wall of firepower, an apartment is not 
part of your conscious mind. 
  Does the Army love Zhirinovskiy? You bet! He promises it war 
and conquest. Which means medals, fame, and riches. The Army is 
sick and tired of being despised, of riding in tanks across the 
motherland and the capital. 
  Zhirinovskiy, of course, promises money and apartments, but 
he does not have them. Realistically, all he can give is war. 
  Guys! Soldiers and sailors, sergeants and corporals, 
officers, generals, and admirals, do understand: Zhirinovskiy is 
no Napoleon and no Suvorov; it is not the eighteenth century, 
and the time of brave conquests and crusades is over. 
  Friend Saddam did try to stick his hand into Kuwait, 
plundered a bit, did some shooting, but very soon got hit on the 
head, and now sits in his bunker and knows that at any moment.... 
  What the Russian Army needs is not Grachev and not 
Zhirinovskiy. The Russian Army needs Lebed. Very tough (perhaps 
even cruel), but one can see right away: He does not steal, and 
he is not a traitor. 
  The Russian Army should get a person it trusts and who will 
not sell it off. 
  As to Grachev.... He is a minister, of course, except for 
one 
small problem--the Army does not follow him. Give it to Lebed 
before Zhirinovskiy takes it. Whether Lebed will agree to take 
it is another question. 
  And if again--after such lessons!--the apparat games 
continue.... Well, then we will continue rereading Pushkin and 
will keep coming across this terrible remark of the cunning 
courtier: 
  SHUYSKIY: 
  Well then? If Boris does not give up his sly ways 
Let us begin to skillfully incite the people.

ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: "First Swallow"] 
  [Text] ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA is beginning publication of the 
first all-Russian Tatar newspaper. This event--I am not afraid 
of using lofty words--is a signal one. 
  There are a good many ethnic publications in Russia and, 
incidentally, not only on the territories of various national 
formations; for example, Tatar-language newspapers are published 
in Tyumen and other cities. This is the first time that an 
ethnic publication has been accorded the status of a statewide 
newspaper. 
  BERDEMLEK-YEDINSTVO will be distributed in a circulation of 
more than 1 million in all the country's cities and villages. 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA has not only initiated and implemented this 
idea but has provided its broad shoulders to the new paper by 
offering its pages, subscribers, printing facilities and 
distribution network, thereby ensuring YEDINSTVO's success from 
its very first steps among a broad range of readers. The idea 
met with an enthusiastic response from the president of 
Tatarstan. Thanks to the personal involvement of Mintimer 
Sharipovich Shaymiyev, it has been possible to put together the 
newspaper's first issue in a short time. Its founders are 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and the Government of the Republic of 
Tatarstan. 
  It will come out once a week. We have decided to publish it 
in Russian, because the newspaper is aimed at millions of Tatars 
living throughout Russia, many of whom do not know their native 
language. But we will help them learn it: lessons in Tatar will 
be included in every issue. 
  Together with Tatar journalists, we will tell about the 
present day, history, culture, customs and holidays of 
Tatarstan. Our readers of all nationalities will be able to come 
to better know and love this people, which is one of Russia's 
numerically largest peoples. 
  Let us hope that YEDINSTVO will be the first but not the 
only 
ethnic publication to be an all-Russian publication. Our 
newspaper is prepared to collaborate not only with individual 
republics but also with confederations and public centers of 
Ukrainians, Germans, Jews, Koreans and other peoples living in 
Russia but lacking their own national formations on its 
territory. 
  Bon voyage, BERDEMLEK.

<F P=106> [Article by independent analyst Andrey Novikov: "Engineer </F>
Kurginyan's Hyperboloid: This `Thing' Is Somewhat Stronger Than 
Prokhanov's DEN, but Even the Latter Comes a Distant Second to 
the Leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia"] 
  [Text] Rybinsk--Lyudmila Chernaya drew an analogy in 
LITERATURNAYA GAZETA of 17 November between the beer-hall putsch 
in Germany and the events of 3-4 October in Russia. 
  The talk about Russian fascism is undoubtedly topical. But 
it 
should at the same time be grasped that the cancerous tumor of 
fascism can no longer, in my view, be surgically removed. 
  It seems to me that Yeltsin gave the opposition 
carte-blanche 
in that... he smashed it. Everyone understands that there has 
been no real crushing defeat. But the confrontation has turned 
into some new, very dangerous channel. 
  Let us look at the situation from the viewpoint of political 
metaphysics. If something is uttered and put on screen by the 
mass media, it actually exists, consequently. DEN actually 
exists. It expresses some innermost social intention, not yet 
realized but already identified. This is why DEN continues to 
appear under a different name. Combating the red-browns with the 
aid of a curfew is utter nonsense (I'm afraid that the curfew 
itself could become red-brown.) To ideology we need to 
counterpose ideology. An adequate measure of talent. A 
counter-Dugin, counter-Prokhanov, counter-Kurginyan is needed. 
This is very serious--historical victory is measured always not 
by social support but the measure of talent. They have already 
become fashionable. DEN's jokes are already being retold in the 
smoking-rooms. This is what is most frightening, for the main 
function of fashion is reproduction. 
  It is possible, for that matter, that the most odious 
variety 
of fascism, this entire red-brown theater treading mainly the 
Moscow boards, has, truly, ceased to exist. It is possible that 
it can be banned even. But what of this? 
  In 1923 Hitler staged a "beer-hall putsch" and came to power 
10 years later. We must reconsider the highly prevalent view of 
the genesis of fascism, according to which fascism is some 
byproduct of political modernization, a marginal stratum 
inevitable at a time of major historical reforms. In actual 
fact, fascism is the result not of a "transitional period" but 
of national revanche. 
  The most difficult time for Germany were the 1920's--peak 
inflation, peak unemployment. Political marginals in the form of 
the Hitler party and two dozen such organizations emerged. But 
at this time Hitler remained on the fringe of politics. He came 
to power only in 1933, when Germany had entered a period of 
economic upturn and national revanche. Hitler knew how to 
harness the vector of this revanche and conclude an alliance 
with Germany's financial and industrial elite, and only for this 
reason was he successful. 
  Russian fascism may come to power only as Russian 
revanchism, 
that is, as a phenomenon more complex than what we have thus 
far. It is essential to recognize that what happened was not 
simply the defeat of communism but the national defeat of 
Russia, a most powerful geopolitical collapse and a loss of the 
character of political subject bordering on national 
nonexistence. 
  I am a conservative in this respect and think in traditional 
categories, we will never remove the geopolitical component. It 
is necessary, therefore, to prepare for the worst--a Russian 
conservative revolution. A conservative revolution is not in 
itself tantamount to fascism but something similar inevitably 
awaits us. National collapse is the dreadful prologue to a 
Russian Reich. The spring is coiled to the maximum, just a 
little more, and it will begin to unwind with terrifying force, 
sweeping aside all in its path. 
  Russian fascism may come to power only by having imbibed new 
energies: liberal, oligarchic, criminal. It is at the 
intersections between Russian liberalism, Russian 
fundamentalism, and the Russian criminal world that the outline 
of the future Russian Reich will emerge. Of course, this will be 
an entirely different generation of fascists, new leaders and a 
new ideology. It is not Prokhanov, who has condemned himself to 
small-time opposition theatrics, who will be the winner. The 
winner will be Kurginyan. 
  Prokhanov fought modernization to the bitter end and was 
swept aside by it, simply having failed to understand its entire 
historical inevitability. Kurginyan, on the other hand, will 
join the ranks of this modernization, harness it and channel it 
in the right direction. Kurginyan is the man who knows how to 
conclude an alliance with Russia's financial and industrial 
elite, as Hitler did on the eve of his accession to power. 
  Strictly speaking, it is not a question of Hitler at all but 
of Krupp. As long as the red-browns are smashing shop windows, 
they are not dangerous. They will become dangerous when Mr. 
Borovoy or Mr. Khizha concludes a deal with them. You think this 
is not possible? Look at Zhirinovskiy, look at Dmitriy 
Vasilyev--they have already become integrated in Yeltsinism. 
They are being viewed askance as yet, but sooner or later our 
entrepreneurs, our Krupp, will have need of patriotism. The most 
important techniques today are ideological techniques. The 
Kurginyan center is producing just such techniques. 
  It is now important to launch a preventive ideological 
strike 
against the Russian Reich and to create a conceptual SDI around 
it. Otherwise yet another red wheel awaits us....

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Ilya Fonyakov: "Anatoliy Sobchak, </F>
Mayor of St. Petersburg, Declared at the Presentation of His New 
Book: The LDPR Is the Creation of the CPSU and the KGB"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg--"I am in possession of 
reliable facts known at this time only to a small group of 
people on how Zhirinovskiy's party was formed," he said. "This 
happened immediately after the abolition of Article 6 of the 
constitution at that time--the one that affirmed the CPSU's 
monopoly of power." 
  "A multiparty system is coming, and we must anticipate 
events," was what, in effect, M. Gorbachev said at a meeting of 
the Politburo. "We ourselves must create the first alternative 
party, but one that is manageable." The choice of candidates for 
the role of leader was entrusted to the KGB at that time. And 
it, as always, was up to the job--it found within its active 
reserve (there is such a concept!) a person with the rank of 
captain and a name that is now widely known. It was at that time 
that the name of the party was thought up also: Liberal 
Democratic. This appeared to be a real find: After all, the 
world "liberal" had long been compromised with us. Two weeks 
later the new party was officially registered. It was the first 
registered political party in the country--the CPSU, as we all 
know, had never undergone this procedure, and the party of 
Russian Communists was registered much later under a somewhat 
different name.... I shall describe this in my next book, which 
will be called "There Once Was a Communist Party." 
  The book that has just been published, "The Tbilisi 
Fracture, 
or Bloody Sunday 1989," carries numerous photographs and 
documents of those now quite far-off days. Is it not belated? 
After all, so many events have rolled by since then, one after 
the other. Since Tbilisi there have been other "fractures" 
also--the Dniester fracture, for example. And the development of 
the situation in Georgia itself, the calamitous situation into 
which it (and not just it) was plunged with the discovery of 
independence--does not all this influence the evaluation of the 
events of 1989? Questions of roughly this nature were put to the 
author. 
  And the answer was given: It is precisely the fact that much 
is catastrophically being rapidly "forgotten" and that archives 
are disappearing before our eyes (the archives of the Georgian 
KGB disappeared this way under Gamsakhurdia) that compels the 
obligatory recording of what happened. The book's main job is 
not to judge but to bear witness as objectively as possible. The 
well-known General Rodionov, for example, appears in the book as 
a far from unambivalent personality: The author does not forget 
to mention that at the time of the Afghan war he "fell into 
disfavor with his superiors because of his refusal to shoot 
peaceful inhabitants" and that, upon acquaintance, "he makes a 
strong impression with his education, breeding, and intellect." 
And alongside this--"a striking commitment to orthodox communist 
views and an incomprehension and rejection of change".... And is 
there not a most important and most topical historical lesson in 
the fate of Zviad Gamsakhurdia and the very mechanism of the 
conversion of a man of letters, intellectual, and civil rights 
advocate into a dictator and autocrat? Or the fate of his 
antipode, Eduard Shevardnadze, who has heaped on himself at the 
most difficult moment responsibility for the fate of Georgia and 
its people and who has found himself hostage to the current 
situation to a large extent? 
  "My abiding aspiration is to maintain professionalism and 
preserve myself as a scholar," Anatoliy Sobchak said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Arkadiy Volskiy by Vladimir Loktev; place </F>
and date not given: "Arkadiy Volskiy: `You May Shrug Us Off, but 
You Cannot Shrug Off Reality'"] 
  [Text] [Loktev] Arkadiy Ivanovich, the results of the 
elections to the State Duma for the Civic Union, in which you 
are a member of the leadership, have turned out disappointing, 
to put it mildly. It would seem that the people, tired of 
political extremes, should have supported the Civic Union's 
"centrist" position. On top of that, your bloc had the support 
of numerous public organizations, including the Federation of 
Independent Trade Unions of Russia [FITUR]. So what is the 
reason for your poor showing at the elections? 
  [Volskiy] To be honest, we did not entertain any particular 
illusions. And not because we doubted our program. On the 
contrary--we firmly believed in our particular motto: "reforms 
without shock." It has proven its correctness and vitality over 
the past two years. The evidence of that, among other things, is 
that our opponents also borrowed many planks from our program, 
and even some members of the government began to utter such 
words as social protection, state regulation, support for 
different forms of ownership. Many understood that reforms 
cannot be conducted at the expense of the people's material 
well-being, turning them into meek cogs. And, finally, it is 
unreasonable to present the "shock therapy" as the sole possible 
way of transition to a market. 
  It appears, however, that we have not been able to gauge 
precisely the degree of the public's expectations, the depth of 
society's fatigue, and have not been able convincingly to 
present the alternative we offered. 
  I also think that we have not conveyed in a sufficiently 
argumented way and convincingly enough our ideas to those who 
form public opinion: journalists, politicians, and experts. We 
have not exposed the myths about centrism, which sometimes was 
portrayed as a sort of camouflaged anti-reformist stance, or 
almost as a "bureaucratic fifth column." Of course, such 
characterizations--sometimes deliberately dishonest, sometimes 
superficial, sometimes naive or conformist, have not added to 
our popularity among the voters at a time when they were being 
promised that already on 13 December everything would be 
different. By the way, that date is long past. What has changed? 
  [Loktev] With which political parties and coalitions that 
have received the majority of votes will the Civic Union 
deputies form a bloc in the Duma? 
  [Volskiy] Civic Union representatives in the Duma, elected 
in 
single-seat districts, are geared for constructive work. Least 
of all would I want to speak about this work in terms of "bloc" 
positions, struggle and victories, "storm and attack," because 
in the final count among the losers inevitably will be the 
people and their interests. We are willing to support and will 
support any realistic and substantiated draft laws aimed at 
advancement of real reforms beneficial for all Russians who 
produce something, regardless of the form of enterprise's 
ownership. 
  Civic Union deputies will not impose confrontation and 
intolerance. We want to be consistent to the end and not divide 
deputies into "ours" and "not ours," or, God forbid, into 
fascists and anti-fascists. 
  It seems to me that regardless of convictions, the 
prevailing 
qualities in the Duma should be competency, professionalism, a 
high degree of responsibility and understanding of our common 
duty to the people and the country. But, of course, our 
constructive stance is clearly delineated: stability, justice, 
and progress. 
  [Loktev] Do forgive me, but this triad of terms, while 
sounding great, does resemble a populist slogan. What 
specifically do you mean by these high-sounding words? 
  [Volskiy] In our understanding, stability means that the 
reforms are weighted and thought through; that we reject "great 
leaps," violence, and revolutionary expediency. 
  Justice is when a majority of the population can live rather 
than just survive. 
  Progress is when Russia is being reborn, not 
degenerating--whether in the economic sphere, science, culture, 
or education. 
  Within this rather broad framework, we are ready to 
cooperate 
with anyone who is imbued with a desire to act for the good of 
Russia, of the people of our motherland--not striving to invent 
more illusions or loud slogans, or being concerned about their 
own benefit. So that our voters would feel real changes for the 
better instead of being hoodwinked by empty, unrealistic 
promises. 
  [Loktev] Much has already been said about the "Zhirinovskiy 
party's phenomenon," the reasons for LDPR's [Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia] success at the elections. Still, what is your 
opinion on the subject? 
  [Volskiy] I would like you to get me right. I think that the 
LDPR's electoral success is a serious alarm bell, first and 
foremost for the authorities. The authorities in Russia are 
losing authority. Presidential edicts and government decrees are 
being ignored. 
  Banditism has been "ennobled" by calling it "racketeering," 
and these very racketeers in front of everybody, including the 
militia, insolently and with impunity engage in shooting, 
extortion, robbery, and murder. Law enforcement agencies 
passionately register: the chairman of the Rosselkhozbank is 
killed in broad daylight; a joint-stock company director is 
killed; someone else is killed.... If this continues, Russians 
will soon be going from home to work at a run: Attention, this 
side of the street is exposed to fire.... 
  And then comes a man who promises to strangle crime by 
setting up courts-martial and executing gang leaders on the spot 
by firing squad. Well, I guess when the authorities do not sound 
alarms in this respect, some voters begin to think that 
Zhirinovskiy offers at least some hope. 
  Let us look at another part of our problems. Have not some 
"reformers" fanned up the confrontation and intolerance in the 
society, have they not ignored demonstratively a sharp 
intensification of social contracts, have they not disregarded 
the vital social needs of millions of Russian citizens? Have not 
our people been subjected to humiliation? they have been labeled 
derogatorily as sharikovs [rabble], lumpens, sovoks ["new Soviet 
men"]. And the subjects of this derogatory name-calling are 
mostly those who feed the country, nourish it, keep it warm, 
those who heal and educate us.... 
  I am convinced that the election results do not provide a 
sufficient reason to call someone publicly a fascist and 
frighten us with historic parallels. The country has a 
president, a Constitution, an office of the procurator general, 
judges, and laws. 
  Personally, I do not believe in the possibility of the 
country "going fascist;" in my opinion, our people possess 
strong immunity against the brown virus. 
  [Loktev] Enough about politics. Let us move on to a topic 
close to you: industry and production. As is known, Arkadiy 
Ivanovich Volskiy is the president of the Russian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs [RUIE]. This job by itself 
prompts you to "ring all the bells" in connection with the 
extremely difficult situation in the economy, submit to the 
government proposals capable of at least halting somewhat the 
disintegration of key industrial sectors.... 
  [Volskiy] Not a day goes by, probably, without us receiving 
yet another piece of alarming news of partial or complete 
stoppage of enterprises. Tractor production at the Kirov plant 
has been suspended until 1 February; workers have been sent on 
an administrative leave. Several hundred K-700 "Kirovets" 
tractors are standing, ready for shipment, in the plant's yard, 
worth a total of R10 billion. The customers, mostly Russian 
agricultural enterprises, cannot take delivery of the products, 
because they cannot pay. 
  The Altaysk, Volgograd, Vladimir, and Lipetsk tractor plants 
are idle, as well as the Taganrog combine plant. The Krasnoyarsk 
automotive trailer plant, too. Rostselmash is working on an 
irregular schedule. The general decline of production in 
agricultural and tractor machine building already has reached 30 
percent (as compared to last year). 
  The Gorkiy Auto Works alternately comes to a halt and then 
back to life; the assembly line of my home enterprise--the ZIL 
[imeni Lenina Auto Works]--moves only four days a week, and even 
that only for one shift. Work week has been cut at the VAZ 
[Volga Auto Works]. In the middle of December approximately 
12,000 plant workers were sent on the administrative leave. 
  What is lurking behind these separate facts is the specter 
of 
unemployment, which threatens to materialize within the next few 
months into a fully tangible army of the unemployed. Already 
now, if we use the International Labor Organization methodology, 
3.8 million persons in Russia should be counted as unemployed; 
this is 5 percent of the able-bodied population--not 1 percent 
(750,000) as official statistics tell us. If we count 
potentially unemployed--those not fully employed, people on 
administrative leave, and so on--their total number will come to 
7.8 million, or slightly more than 10 percent of able-bodied 
population. 
  The RUIE had warned as early as in the summer that unless 
urgent measures are worked out, unless the circulatory system of 
our industry is revived, in the fall and winter enterprises will 
stop, and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of workers, 
technicians, and engineers will find themselves on the street. 
Our warnings were shrugged off; we were told that inflation was 
going down, production was stabilizing, the reform had passed 
its critical point, and everything would start improving any 
time now. That is, we were sounding all the alarms, but all we 
heard in response was that the RUIE was attempting to turn 
things back to the command-administrative system and appease the 
directors corps. You may shrug us off, but you cannot shrug off 
reality. 
  We did not engage in empty criticism. The RUIE submitted a 
score of proposals to both the government and the Supreme 
Soviet. For instance, we proposed immediately to begin 
implementing targeted programs of retraining those who had lost 
their jobs, and start creating additional jobs through the 
development of a public works program. We also proposed--and 
these proposals are still topical--to work in the direction of 
freeing the economy from being overrun by middlemen, especially 
speculators. 
  Speaking of unemployment, we believe that there still is 
time 
to avert the catastrophe by combining the efforts of the 
government, entrepreneurs, and trade unions. In particular, it 
is necessary to codify not only in a law, but also in a sort of 
an agreement among entrepreneurs, a statute that in changing the 
form of ownership, an enterprise's specialization, or even a 
bankruptcy, a one-time cutback in the labor force should not 
exceed 20 percent of the total. 
  We also believe it necessary to establish special funds for 
assisting the unemployed, their retraining, as well as settling 
accounts with those enterprises that owe back wages and pensions. 
  A natural question comes up: Do these proposals indeed 
perhaps lead to a slowdown of reforms or their curtailment? No, 
and once again, emphatically no! 
  You will not find in any RUIE document even a hint at it. 
The 
Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs has always 
supported and will support energetic implementation of economic 
reforms. But we have always said, keep saying, and will do so in 
the future, that the mechanisms of reform implementation 
absolutely have to take into account the specifics of Russia and 
our current reality. Otherwise, we will have a sharp rise in 
social tension in the country; we will see the number of 
opponents of the reforms multiplying, and a threat to the reform 
itself. 
  [Loktev] Right before the new year, A. Chubays, the chairman 
of the Russian Federation Committee for the Administration of 
State Property, said: The Russian program of privatization has 
been fulfilled. And this was not an unsubstantiated 
statement--it was supported by impressive figures. Do you agree 
with such an appraisal of the privatization process? 
  [Volskiy] If you look at the figures, it appears to move on 
at a speedy pace. In my opinion, however, what is happening in 
the sphere of privatization of plants and factories in Russia is 
the restoration of the Yugoslav model of "workers 
self-management," and in an inferior form, at that. 
  I believe that privatization methods must be brought closer 
to a truly market approach; however, it should be done without 
sharp moves, so as not to destroy not only the former socialist 
system, but also the future capitalist one. The substance of 
privatization measures we offer is in tying it in with the 
interests of production, its stabilization and increased 
effectiveness. The system of these measures is very extensive; 
among them are extending the deadline and the range of use of 
the vouchers, making it possible to convert them into 
privatization bank deposits to be subsequently used for buying 
out land, purchasing apartments, construction and repair of 
housing, payment for medical services, and so on; to permit 
reciprocal ownership of shares of industrial and trade 
enterprises; to stimulate the creation of industrial-financial 
groups, including with the participation of supplier enterprises 
from near-abroad. 
  [Loktev] Many specialists in the VPK [military-industrial 
complex] believe that a lot has been done wrong in the defense 
industry conversion, and that had we continued selling arms at 
previous levels, we could have had our own hard currency 
lifeline for the reform. In your opinion, will Russia be able to 
regain the positions it has lost in the world market of 
armaments? 
  [Volskiy] My personal opinion is as follows: Of course, arms 
sales were very lucrative for the former Soviet Union and could 
be for Russia as well; it would allow for the attraction of the 
means we need so much for modernization and structural 
restructuring of the industry. However, as you well understand, 
it is extremely difficult to regain lost positions in world 
trade--the competitors are not sitting and waiting complacently. 
Besides, we should not forget our obligations to the world 
community. I think that Russia should not set its interests 
against those of maintaining world peace. At the same time, our 
diplomacy should urge Russia's partners to adopt the same 
approach and act accordingly. It is also necessary to go ahead 
with the conversion process, but do it sensibly and in a 
thought-through manner. I want to remind you that defense orders 
have drooped off by 67 percent, and our Armed Forces are half 
their former size. In these circumstances, it is important to 
retain the advance positions in science and technology we have 
already achieved, and meet the needs of defense with 
high-quality and, to the extent possible, the best armaments in 
the world. Let us not create another illusion, however, that the 
defense industry allegedly is capable of solving all our 
economic problems. We cannot avoid a large-scale structural 
restructuring and modernization of the entire production base, 
including agriculture. And defense production should take its 
strictly defined place among all others. 
  At the same time, the state must understand that, having 
created a gigantic defense industry, it has certain obligations 
to it and to the people employed there, and has no right to 
abandon them to their own devices under the pretext of 
noninterference in economic matters. Yes, we need to scale down 
defense production, but not destroy the advanced scientific and 
technical base. I personally would like to see Russian 
automobiles, steel, tires, television sets, and other such items 
become as famous in international markets as our tanks, 
submachine guns, anti-aircraft missile systems, multiple missile 
launchers, and fighter aircraft. 
  [Loktev] Arkadiy Ivanovich, a last--and as they say, 
frontal, 
question: If offered, is the RUIE willing to "delegate" its 
representatives into the government? 
  [Volskiy] We are willing to take part in the government, but 
naturally, the government that would share our philosophy of 
reforms without shocks and unnecessary social costs. We are 
ready to undertake most decisive steps and reforms, but on the 
principle "Measure seven times before cutting." 
  I would also like to use this opportunity to wish TRUD 
readers our most sincere good wishes and congratulations for the 
New Year.

<F P=106> [Article by Arkadiy Solovyev, candidate of economic </F>
sciences: "Everything Is Better in Russia as Regards `Human 
Rights,' but There Are More and More Who Are Downtrodden"] 
  [Text] The latest anniversary of the Declaration of 
Human Rights passed almost unnoticed in Russia. By an irony of 
fate it coincided with the apogee of the election campaign. 
Perhaps it was for this reason that it was "noticed" only by a 
small circle of professionals--political scientists, 
sociologists, and employees of specific grassroots and civil 
rights organizations. Yet human rights and liberties are, it 
would seem, that sole purpose and overriding mission for the 
sake of which many of us in April 1985 or in August 1991 and 
subsequently also, perhaps, were prepared to renounce everything 
contained in the notorious period of stagnation. 
  But the "perestroyka era" has ended, smoothly passing into 
the "era of radical reform"--a great recasting of power, 
property, and life's foundations--and the euphoria of the 
triumphs in connection with the emancipation from the seven 
decades of slavery of the national spirit has evaporated like 
smoke, leaving the people in its wake merely the ashes of the 
charred ruins. And all that was in any way valuable, which had 
been accumulated by the generations... has vanished. 
  There has also, somehow imperceptibly, been a division of 
the 
monolith of fellow thinkers of perestroyka, once welded together 
by an inspired idea, into fighters "for the people's interests" 
and the people themselves, into the possessors of rights and the 
bearers of obligations, which have for some reason or other 
become for a large part of the populace even more onerous. And 
this can be traced graphically against the background of the 
struggle for human rights--in the strikes and prestrike actions 
of the workers of many sectors of the economy. Those working in 
health care and education and geology and communications, 
agrarian specialists and mechanical engineers, and coal miners 
have been or are now in this position.... More than you can 
count. 
  There is no doubt that our acquisition of the right to 
express a protest is a good thing. But it would be even better 
did we not have to avail ourselves of it. Particularly so often. 
For it is well known that in the period of the shock reforms 
some sectors have been almost permanently in a strike or 
prestrike condition. This is, I believe, far from the best 
achievement of democracy and not the right of the working people 
for the sake of which it was worth accomplishing perestroyka in 
its various substances. 
  It is time, evidently, to stop searching for the reasons for 
so unequivocal an attitude of the bulk of society toward the 
socioeconomic processes occurring in the country. These reasons 
have long been obvious to all. They are the catastrophic decline 
in the living standard, the menacing growth of unemployment, the 
narrowing of people's access to sociocultural benefits and 
services, the loss of their hard-earned savings, and the 
repulsion of the majority of citizens from privatization. And so 
forth.... How is this actual situation of the working people 
combined with the manifold increase in the number of rights and 
liberties of the citizens recorded in the new constitution? 
  While not a legal expert or political scientist, I venture 
to 
maintain that the rights and the number thereof even (and in 
just a cursory study of the new constitution I "discovered" more 
than three dozen rights and liberties) in themselves do nothing 
for a single one of the possessors of these rights if they are 
totally unsupported, guaranteed by no one, and subject to no 
precise control. 
  In other words, it is not the rights themselves but the 
guarantees of rights that are needed. And everyone should know 
who the exponent of the specific guarantees is. After all, what 
is the value of the right to housing (I would recall that in the 
constitution that previously was in effect the state guaranteed 
all citizens a roof over their heads) with the appalling 
shortage of housing and the uncontrolled formation of the 
housing market? What use is the right to education with the 
beggarly grant of the students, which is only enough for one 
meal a week? And of what sort of rights to recreation and health 
can we speak when the cost of a pass to a sanatorium is 10-15 
times the average monthly wage in the national economy?! 
  But, in addition, of what sort of freedom of movement can we 
speak if the cost of one's journey to a suburban "dacha" damages 
the family budget as much as a trip to the Riga shore once did? 
Of what sort of right to social security can we speak when the 
average pension is one-third below the physiological subsistence 
minimum, and the majority of retirees may with their pension buy 
only a loaf of bread and a liter of milk a day? And this is not 
counting the charges for housing, for other elementary services, 
for the use of mass transit. 
  I would question also freedom of thought and creativity 
since 
visiting an art gallery or museum, going to the movies or the 
theater, and buying books are now affordable only to the spoiled 
children of the liberalized economy. 
  I am afraid even to mention the right to property and 
inheritance. Inasmuch as there immediately arise here questions 
concerning the R70 trillion (in current computations) of 
hard-earned savings confiscated by the "reformers," the 
manifestly formal participation of the people in 
privatization.... 
  You could not count all the rights not backed by the 
corresponding guarantees. But I would like to recall one further 
right of ours--to dignity. Truly, it is this which both Soviet 
and, even more, Russian man have always lacked. But with what 
does our new statehood back this right now? With the fact that 
the holders of hard-earned Russian rubles, the quantity of which 
for the "workhorses" is strictly determined by a single wage 
rate-qualifications guide, feel themselves to be at every step 
in their own country "third-class" citizens? With the fact that 
millions of once perfectly respectable people on the books of 
enterprises now paralyzed by the monetarist idea, having taken 
in just a couple of pennies, have been forced to run to the 
street market to sell and exchange whatever comes to hand? 
  I am afraid that real backing for all the above-mentioned 
and 
a dozen unmentioned rights and liberties will require (and very 
soon) of the state the most specific and precise actions. The 
time of abstract deliberations by legal scholars, party chiefs, 
and supernumerary prattlers has passed. All the mechanisms of 
economic reform and social reform, which is manifestly in need 
of reform, should be geared to the realization of the rights and 
liberties of the citizens. And as long as the economic and 
social "ingredients" of the reform contradict the truths 
inscribed in international and our constitutional tablets, all 
the innumerable rights and liberties of Russians will be paper 
rights only. 
  All the more will the special "freedom department"--the 
Human 
Rights Committee formed in the Office of the President of the 
Russian Federation--fail to cope with these tasks. Granted all 
my respect for the personal composition of the said committee, I 
confess that I very much doubt whether it will be able to 
establish a balance between the quantity of rights and liberties 
and the real assurance of a normal life for the citizens of 
Russia. There remains hope of the Federal Assembly? But it has 
barely been elected, has not yet even been convened, and 
struggle has already begun. Not for our, the electorate's 
rights, unfortunately.

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Vasilenko: "What Distinguishes the </F>
Speaker From `Snickers': The Federal Assembly of the Russian 
Federation Opens Today. What Will It Be Like? And What Should We 
Expect From It?"] 
  [Text] Some oracles were foretelling the speedy demise of 
the new parliament even before its birth. The logic of their 
arguments was as follows. 
  Parliament will pursue its own line and display 
recalcitrance. This will not be to the liking of the president's 
circle, which will decide the fate of the Federal Assembly. 
  No, the body of the people's elect does not afford grounds 
for expectations that it will agree to play the part of 
legislative decorator of the designs of the executive. 
Therefore, there are perfectly realistic grounds for the 
pessimistic forecasts concerning the breakup of parliament. 
  Nonetheless, a new "action" against the new parliament, 
elected in accordance with rules laid down by the executive 
itself, could prove to be almost suicidal for the latter. An 
authority entangled in endless improvisations would become 
helpless and unproductive and, consequently, totally unneeded, 
except by the persons crowded on Olympus and around it. 
  A new political situation has arisen. For the president, who 
came to power on a wave of almost nationwide support and who has 
managed largely to lose it, the time has come to reflect in 
earnest on how he will be remembered historically: a servant of 
the people, to fidelity to whom he took the oath, or a 
submissive servant of his immediate entourage. So from the 
viewpoint of his historical reputation the first president of 
Russia should abandon any thought of the breakup of the newly 
elected parliament, even if the latter displays an independence 
that does not suit the president. 
  The new parliament could perform an innovative role. It has 
for the first time been formed on a multiparty basis. The 
organization of its work on the principles of the interaction of 
clearly structured party factions is a new aspect, which will 
make it possible to represent more precisely the interests of 
various groups of society and to take this more fully into 
account in lawmaking. 
  It is important, however, that this objective possibility 
not 
be blocked once again by endless speechifying, wrangling, and 
scuffling at the microphones. Much here will depend on who is 
endowed with the right to turn the microphones on and off and 
keep an eye on strict observance of the standing orders and 
parliamentary procedures. Such a person is called different 
things in different countries. In Germany he is the president of 
parliament, in Anglophone countries, the speaker. Not to be 
confused with Snickers, which, as the advertisement claims, 
everyone enjoys. 
  For the success of the work of the Federal Assembly and, 
possibly, for the fate of the fledgling Russian 
parliamentarianism, in general even, it is important that the 
speakers of both houses not resume the failed experiment of 
making the speaker some double of the head of state. Otherwise 
the country's political life would once again be reduced to a 
playing of the already dog-eared "whose side are you on" card. 
The danger of this primitive relapse has not been eradicated 
completely. The personality of the politician who occupies this 
seat is so important, therefore. 
  There is no doubt that the figures of speakers are 
determined 
on the basis of a "balance of interests." In the State Duma, on 
a balance of interests of the party factions. In the Federation 
Council the interests of the regions will, most likely, clash 
with the position of the center, that is, the president. The 
result is not obvious. There is no doubt that the members of the 
Federation Council, the vast majority of whom being pragmatic 
people, will treat the president's nominee for speaker with 
respect. But that same pragmatism will determine the limits of 
the concessions also. Would the regional leaders have sufficient 
respect for Yeltsin to agree to a "Shumeyko," for example? And, 
on the other hand, would the president have the patience to 
"accept" a candidate of the regions who is inconvenient, 
perhaps, like E. Rossel, say? 
  It would seem that any conflict with the upper house of 
parliament would further complicate the position of the 
president, who, according to the Constitution, does not have the 
right to dissolve the Federation Council, incidentally. In any 
event, the spread in terms of options of the relations of the 
president and the regions and, accordingly, in terms of the 
candidates for speaker of the Federation Council is great: from 
"compromise" (Gonchar?) to radical (Tuleyev?). Any serious 
complication with the Federation Council could show the 
president that it is no longer 1991. The president understands 
this, evidently. Do his associates understand it? 
<H5>  Time of the Wreckers Is Coming to an End </H5>
<H6>  Appeal of the International Democratic Reform Movement to 
Members of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation </H6>
  The International Democratic Reform Movement Executive 
Committee welcomes the start of business of the State Duma and 
the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of Russia and 
wishes that it may be fruitful and constructive. We call on the 
political blocs and parties and each deputy to display 
state-minded wisdom, cast aside personal ambition, and 
concentrate joint efforts on the revival of the fatherland. The 
time of the Herostratuses and the wreckers is coming to an end, 
and the time of the creators is coming, and creation in 
isolation is impossible. 
  We express the hope that the fruitful work of the 
Russian parliament will lend new impetus to the activity of the 
CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, which, following the October 
events, has virtually ceased. We are sure that without the 
reconstitution of the common fabric of the Eurasian space no 
state of the former Union can develop normally. 
  Our movement declares its readiness for constructive 
cooperation with the new Russian parliament in any form 
acceptable for this.

<F P=106> [Interview with Oleg Poptsov, chairman of the VGTRK </F>
[All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company] 
  [Text] [Moroz] Oleg Maksimovich, the first question--from 
the sphere of history: How did you manage to slip away from 
Khasbulatov--not to allow him to bend Russian Television to his 
will, which he wanted to do so passionately? 
  [Poptsov] In principle, the Supreme Soviet, in a purely 
legislative sense, did not have any kind of rights to the 
Russian Television and Radio company. The fact is that no one 
founded it--it was organized by a decision of the presidium of 
the Supreme Soviet. But this is not the same thing. 
Nevertheless, we began to sense deputy pressure as early as the 
Second Congress, just as it went on the air. A desire emerged 
among the deputies to be present on the air, then it grew into a 
desire to prevail on it, and in the end, into a desire to own 
it. The situation began to heat up. Here, of course, it was 
necessary to display a certain diplomatic ability, and at times 
elementary cunning. On the one hand, to offer parliament an 
opportunity to be present on the air in one way or another 
(pluralism for us is natural), and on the other hand--to remain 
true to the principle of protection of reform. We developed a 
certain formula of political behavior: We are supporters of the 
president, but we are opposed to his mistakes; we are supporters 
of the progressive forces in parliament, but opposed to the 
reactionary, conservative forces in it. When the situation got 
completely hot, we had recourse to the protection of the law. By 
taking advantage of precisely the fact that our company was not 
founded, we held a conference of the labor collective and 
elections of the leadership. What happened further is known. The 
appearance of the "Parliamentary Hour" already signified the 
stage of hand-to-hand fighting. I was absolutely convinced that 
this "hour" would bring only harm. Khasbulatov spoke more than 
once about this. Parliament was transformed into a kind of 
theater, and it lived according to the laws of the theater. But 
inasmuch as the actors were not professionals, the performance 
only repelled the viewer. I would not want our present 
government to make a similar mistake by trying to create its own 
television studio. Journalistic professionalism should not be 
confused with administrative professionalism. 
  When a head-on attack was started on the part of parliament, 
I was faced with the task as the manager of the television and 
radio company to involve the president in the resolution of this 
problem. The president understood that the fate of reform and 
his own political fate, curiously enough, was in the hands of 
the mass media. Yeltsin reacted to the emerging situation 
instantly, and he issued several documents concerning the 
company. They were rescinded and suspended by parliament.... 
Then these absurd changes appeared in the Law on the Mass 
Media--concerning the oversight councils.... 
  [Moroz] Was strong pressure exerted on you personally? 
  [Poptsov] Of course. At that congress where the question 
concerning oversight councils was discussed, there was also an 
item on the agenda about my dismissal from the position I held. 
It is hardly likely that I would have been dismissed at the 
congress, but this was a strong move on the part of the deputies 
and initiators of that inconceivable decree of the congress on 
the mass media. I was practically the only one who could 
professionally and conclusively oppose them. They sensed this 
and took me out of the game. No matter what I said against the 
amendments to the law, this could be easily represented as my 
self-defense. It must be said that it was a brilliant move. 
  Afterwards, a skirmish started with the faction "Smena--New 
Policy," Astafyev's group.... But when, at the very end of its 
existence, the Supreme Soviet sent a commission to the company, 
well, here, as the saying goes, the wounded were carried 
directly from the battlefield.... 
  [Moroz] Do you expect the same kinds of encroachments on RTV 
[Russian TV] on the part of the newly elected Federal Assembly? 
How do you expect to build relations with it? The experience of 
the struggle with the Supreme Soviet will probably prove to be 
apropos? 
  [Poptsov] The Federal Assembly is a legislative authority of 
a transition period. Part of the conclusions, attitudes, and 
world outlook in it will be from the past, and part--from the 
future. The Duma faces a very complex test: Behind it is the 
image of the past Supreme Soviet. If suddenly the relay of its 
meetings is repeated and the television viewer sees not only 
familiar faces, but also hears familiar speeches, when the 
deputies vie in insulting the president, the viewer inevitably 
will utter in response the fateful "Enough!" This will be the 
beginning of the end of the Duma. Therefore, I think that 
principles have to be developed that rule out a repetition of 
that past unreasonableness. 
  There must be an edict, a strict rule, that would define the 
practice of elucidating the activities of the president, the 
government, and the Federal Assembly. This elucidation must go 
into the general information stream. Television, radio, and 
newspapers should have an opportunity, based on their 
professional understanding, to be at meetings of the government, 
the state, and so on, and throw light on these meetings in those 
instances when the journalists deem it necessary. 
  [Moroz] A big "backlash" is taking place on television today 
in connection with the phantasmagoric results of the elections. 
Do you feel responsible for these results? 
  [Poptsov] Both yes, and no. More--no. Because this is 
ridiculous--to blame everything on television. TV, radio, and 
the newspapers simply reflect events. This is first. And, 
second, we must subordinate ourselves to normative acts that 
regulate an election campaign. 
  We were supporters of equal air time that was being offered 
to the candidates. But the electoral commission took the Western 
principle as a basis. We, after all, cannot live without 
imitation, forgetting that, in contrast to "them," our democracy 
is in its first stages. Blocs not only monopolized the 
airwaves--they also monopolized the form of exposition. They let 
loose a torrent of words onto the heads of the television 
viewers, over and above discussions, and over and above debates, 
and without any kind of critical commentaries. But now we are 
looking for culprits.... First of all, the former candidates 
themselves and their helpers should say to themselves: "We do 
not know how to do that which is called an election campaign. We 
do not know how to participate in the development of appropriate 
normative documents. We missed that moment when the president 
was preparing these edicts. We missed it! Everybody wanted to 
make himself secure! So that it would be convenient and cozy for 
himself. At the same time, it was forgotten that an idea does 
not develop in a comfortable situation, but in an uncomfortable 
one. It is necessary to have opposition for the birth of an 
idea. Of course, there is such a genre as advocacy. But this 
already simply requires oratorical skill. And so it has been 
disclosed: There are no brilliant advocates among the democratic 
figures. But Zhirinovskiy did not burden himself with ideas--and 
he succeeded in oratorical skill. He handles himself well in 
front of a camera. His weakness is when there are no television 
cameras. He is extremely vulnerable here. And more. We became 
more and more convinced: It is impossible to talk with everyone 
simultaneously. Zhirinovskiy appealed to different social groups 
separately. Gaydar is an excellent popularizer. But--among the 
intelligentsia. However, a leader must feel confident with any 
audience. Every leader has his own line, one induces laughter, 
another debate, and the third--concentration, he makes you 
think. Both the language and the style should change depending 
on the situation. 
  [Moroz] Does it not seem to you that you also displayed 
inadequate persistence in order to organize a debate, 
commentaries, and the participation of a critically inclined 
anchorman on Russian Television and Radio? 
  [Poptsov] Persistence is expedient until the adoption of a 
law. But when it is adopted, we are obliged to observe it. 
Everything happened rapidly. The periods allotted for the 
election campaign were limited, and everything created in haste 
suffers from mistakes. The normatives associated with 
information support are the best evidence of this. The law 
served the interests of the party. This was the first multiparty 
election, and a new degree of democratic development, and all 
the rest seemingly became secondary, including the interest of 
the voter as well. Incidentally, Russian radio proved to be more 
varied. Journalists took an active part in the programs--they 
asked sharp questions, although they also did this 
circumspectly, in view of the restrictive law. There were 
excellent debate programs. If we return to television programs, 
we were also preparing here for dispute and debate, and we 
readied the studio in five variants. A television debate 
variant, a press conference variant, and a cross-examination 
dialogue variant, "one on one." But the parties chose the 
monologue and the team self-representation variant. No one 
wanted debates and disputes. 
  [Moroz] Did it not occur to you to show something just 
before 
the elections similar to Zhirinovskiy's film that was shown on 
the Ostankino channel? 
  [Poptsov] We did have such work, but we abandoned it. It is 
impossible to do anything the day before in Russia. The 
unpredictability of the Russian character, among other things, 
is that frequently everything is done "for spite." According to 
sociological estimates, the film added 4 percent of the votes to 
Zhirinovskiy at a minimum. 
  [Moroz] Sociologists say that the rapid increase in 
Zhirinovskiy's support started a week before the elections. This 
seems to indicate unequivocally: Television determined the 
outcome of the voting.... 
  [Poptsov] This is a correct observation. It is precisely at 
that time that a definite drop occurred in the election 
activities of the democrats. It became clear that the government 
would not undergo radical changes. This diminished personal 
interest in the election campaign. You must not weaken in a 
distance race! Zhirinovskiy appeared for the last time on paid 
radio and television air time on 30 November; that is, more than 
10 days before the voting. But for free air time, his party, 
like the others, drew lots. Russia's Choice was abundantly 
represented on our channel, but this did not add votes to it, 
because it conducted its agitation campaign both unskillfully 
and in an untalented way. In addition, it absolutely did not 
welcome criticism of its low-quality programs. Only at the very 
end did it wake up and understand that it was necessary to bring 
good polemicists to the fore. Chubays, of course, is the 
strongest polemicist among them. He is both a polemicist and an 
outstanding public speaker. But an understanding of this came 
too late. And, in addition to everything else, the democrats 
could not agree among themselves not only on the scale of the 
whole democratic movement, they were unable to come to an 
agreement even inside Russia's Choice. I do not know who on the 
Russia's Choice team was answerable for the election image, but 
the fact that there was no stage management there, nor 
psychological training, nor an elementary understanding of who 
your primary opponent is--this is unequivocal. But when the 
candidates of one bloc could not unite in single-seat okrugs, 
which led to defeat, this is already a signal concerning the 
obvious instability of the bloc in the future. They all spied on 
each other--God forbid that your colleague should become more 
popular. Russia's Choice was unable to carry through even a line 
of defense of the Constitution. "It broke down." We also do not 
like everything in it. But when preparations began for the 
referendum, we said on Russian Television: "That is all. The 
time to argue whether the Constitution is good or bad has 
passed. It is necessary now to explain to the people what is 
important in it, and to apply all our energies only to this." 
But the People's Choice candidates were engaged in a competition 
to the finish line, as if secretly, but they are kicking the 
Constitution, nonetheless. 
  [Moroz] In June of 1996, a fascist could become president of 
Russia. This is no longer a fantasy, and it is not the delirium 
of a madman; it is an entirely tangible possibility. What does 
Russian Television plan to do in order to prevent this? 
  [Poptsov] It is necessary to talk about what is happening in 
the country. What reform is giving, and how much it costs. Show 
the emptiness of Zhirinovskiy's promises. Well, he says: "I will 
make the Army strong." No one objects to this in principle, but 
what is behind this specifically? In what way does he propose to 
accomplish this? "I will bring Finland back into the Russian 
structure." But this already means blood. It should be explained 
what such imperial habits lead to.... It is necessary to say it 
this way: To unite with force--means to kill. 
  [Moroz] Do you think that it is necessary to explain to 
television viewers that gibberish is gibberish? To react to each 
idiotic comment with a popular science program? "Children, we 
must not employ an atomic bomb against Japan.... This is not 
good.... This is inhuman...." Does it not seem to you that 
within half a year of such talk that the country will turn into 
a madhouse? 
  [Poptsov] Well, you are presenting this in a rather overdone 
way. But in reality there is a rather serious problem here. 
Question: For whom is the mass media intended? LITERATURNAYA 
GAZETA, it is clear, is intended for the intelligentsia. But, 
after all, now all newspapers of a democratic persuasion have a 
claim on the same audience--the intelligentsia. And all 
television is working on it. The mass media somewhat 
imperceptibly lost the habit of talking in the language of the 
other classes. Therefore, one of the main problems is to find a 
field, but even better, several fields of a language that is 
understandable and accessible.... Not a primitive one, but a 
simple one that would reach people and touch them. Yet this is 
impossible without an understanding of the interests of one or 
another class, or one or another social stratum. 
  [Moroz] Do you intend to put this into practice? 
  [Poptsov] Of course. But here it is necessary to break the 
psychology of those who work in broadcasting. All anchormen now 
select as interlocutors only intelligent people who are 
communicative and educated. And this is understandable, but this 
is not the makeup of the whole society. A person should see 
himself on the screen. He is just like me, and his worries are 
just like mine. I believe him. 
  [Moroz] What can you say with respect to the removal of 
Bragin from the post of chairman of the Ostankino television and 
radio company? I understand that it is not very comfortable for 
you to speak, but, still.... Does it not seem to you that he was 
made a scapegoat in connection with the failure of the elections? 
  [Poptsov] I do not think that the elections played the main 
role here. 
  [Moroz] After all, there were reasons to remove him earlier. 
But it was timed specifically with the elections and to that 
idiotic nighttime get-together in the Kremlin.... 
  [Poptsov] It is both difficult for me to talk about this and 
it is easy. For the reason that I was against that kind of 
variant of a concluding night. I was an opponent of the film 
about Zhirinovskiy that was shown on the 11th. I do not want to 
say that I was consulted.... It is something else. In our 
country, unprofessionalism is not considered a defect. Democrats 
of the first wave fully copied and continue to copy the habits 
of past authorities. The main thing is "friend or foe," but 
professionalism is not even in third place, but in fifth place. 
As for what happened, Vyacheslav Ivanovich is partly to blame 
himself: Being a product of the rayon committee school, he 
apparently became accustomed to being guided by the principle 
"It is necessary!" He is appointed, then it is necessary. This 
is first. Second: He was appointed, as you will recall, under 
conditions of persecution on the part of Khasbulatov, and this 
formed in Bragin the impression that he was a fighter for 
democratic ideas and that therefore he was important. He 
identified his polemical fervor with the professional skill of a 
journalist. There was an interesting incident in my practical 
work. Somehow I was called up by Tyazhelnikov, at that time the 
first secretary of the TsK VLKSM [Central Committee of the 
All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League], and was asked what 
the pay was for the work of journalists who work on the journal. 
I said: 250-300 rubles [R] per printer's sheet. Tyazhelnikov 
became indignant and noted that central committee workers write 
50 pages of information and do this free of charge. Just about 
everybody was managing the journalists. 
  In general, the fact that the decision on the appointment of 
Bragin was made under extreme conditions proved to be 
determinative. This is always a risky matter. 
  This is the tragedy of democracy--a shortage of leaders, and 
a terrible hunger for them. I have in mind not only political 
leaders, but also professional leaders in various spheres. 
Democracy is doomed if it does not have a powerful professional 
layer in various spheres. 
  [Moroz] You came to television from our environment--from 
the 
environment of writing journalists. Moreover, you are a writer 
and were for a long time the editor of a journal. What features 
in the general atmosphere of television and the psychology of 
the people grabbed your attention? I am personally struck by a 
kind of heightened complexity of many television studio 
employees. How can this be explained? 
  [Poptsov] A person who has been on the air if only five 
minutes becomes half actor. And he already lives according to 
the laws of the theater. He requires praise and applause. And he 
gets very upset if there is none. It is like opium. A special 
kind of arrogance emerges: They know me, they will recognize me. 
But "recognize" still does not mean that they want to see you 
and hear you. It is on television as nowhere else that arrogance 
replaces knowledge and enlightenment. Further, television 
demands colossal expenditures of nervous energy, incommensurable 
with expenditures of energy on a newspaper or a journal. You 
perform twofold work on television: First, you prepare the 
program, and then you present it on the air. Therefore, nervous 
breakdowns here are much more frequent and apparent. And, 
finally, one more thing--television is cliquish. It does not 
accept people from the outside. This does not exist, for 
example, in the theater. A theater that does not replenish 
itself with new people is doomed. But if you take 
television--not only Russian Television--practically not one new 
name has appeared here in the last five years. Perhaps Leonid 
Yakubovich, the anchorman for "Fields of Miracles." A unique 
kind of television pomposity exists. Its most widespread 
manifestation: He does not understand anything about television. 
Although it is clear that television lives according to the very 
same laws as do the periodical press and theater, and that they 
are not partitioned off by a Chinese wall. But here, there is an 
effort to cut oneself off. Including from criticism.... 
Incidentally, television critics also do not make me happy. A 
haughty opinion--this is on the one hand, and on the other 
hand--slyness: How could they allow such an election campaign? 
Although they know very well that it was impossible not to allow 
it. However strange it may be, many critics are short on 
spectator attributes. 
  Never rush to say that you saw more than the rest, do not 
rush with your conclusions to assert your dislike for the author 
of one or another program. There are a lot of personal scores in 
articles of this kind of reporting, revenge for past slights, 
which there probably were. 
  ....All of this makes work in television very difficult. But 
the main difficulty is the lack of brilliantly talented people. 
Although there are not enough of them anywhere. 
  [Moroz] What are you most dissatisfied with on Russian 
Television? 
  [Poptsov] I am dissatisfied with the channel's slipshod 
work. 
I am dissatisfied with the fact that an enormous number of ideas 
die without ever being realized. An intensely negative attitude 
toward an idea exists if it was not you who expressed it. In 
such a case, all efforts are expended not on realizing it, but 
in a fight against it. No less dangerous is the untalented 
implementation of an idea that simply ruins it. There are a lot 
of excellent professionals here, obsessed people, but those 
tendencies that have appeared on television in recent years are 
too dangerous. I am disturbed, for example, by the neglect of 
such a concept as the profession of producer, and as the role of 
the artist. In its time, going live on the air caused a 
revolution in television; it disrupted the usual, it disrupted 
the exclusiveness, and the special theatricality. But we could 
not stop in time. Live broadcasting went on the attack and began 
to destroy television as an art. A whole category of television 
studio employees began to appear who think: "I am on the 
screen--and this is sufficient." The syndrome of "talking heads" 
appeared, from which everyone is going mad. Talk alone is not 
enough for television. It is also absolutely necessary to have a 
play factor, and there must be inventiveness and staging. I 
dream about a theater of social and political journalism, a 
story theater, a fable theater.... If you wish, a theater of 
economics. This is the only way to infect and capture the 
viewer. Other television thinking has to be developed. 
  [Moroz] What can you say regarding the scandal surrounding 
Channel 4 and the prospects for closing our "Russian University 
Days?" 
  [Poptsov] This simply cannot be, because it can never be. I 
have in mind the closing of "University Days." That is all we 
need! We will raise the whole country, if there will be need of 
this. As it is, reform has already crushed science, and it has 
crushed enlightenment, education, culture.... I have talked 
about this a thousand times. I spoke to everyone about this. To 
the president, to the prime minister, and to the deputies. I 
would put the question to the local powers that be in this way: 
"Yes, today we cannot provide you with resources. It is 
difficult. But we are giving you this channel. This is your 
channel, scientists. This is your channel, teachers. This is 
your channel, young people--an enlightenment and education 
channel." Even if it kills us, we will defend this channel. We 
defended it. We will not give up an inch. Any self-respecting 
state should have such a channel. This is a channel which, 
speaking in the fashionable idiom, should become the presentment 
of the Russian intellect. It is necessary to bring the channel 
up to snuff, to the necessary mark. We have already invested 
enough energy in it. As everywhere, money and time are needed. 
As for the remaining part of Channel 4, there, perhaps, there 
you can do what you want. Two concepts have collided here: Our 
"Russian University Days", or still another little Ostankino? It 
is all the same, but in its own small variant. A little less 
polished, a little more nonchalant, but, still, the 
same--politics, music, theater.... I see no need to repeat one 
and the same thing in 20 variants. Now, according to the edict 
of the president, NTV [Independent Television) will work 
together with us. They promise to amaze the world. We wish them 
success. And we will wait. 
  [Moroz] At one time, you tried to arrange regular interviews 
with the president and his periodical speeches on television. 
Where did this idea get sunk--in Yeltsin's circle, or did he 
bury it himself? 
  [Poptsov] It was possible to implement one-third of this 
idea 
in principle, but there is great resistance on the part of the 
president's circle. Indeed, Boris Nikolayevich himself is a very 
specific person. He himself is a reserved person by nature. 
Difficult to get used to. With a confused idea about his own 
positive and negative qualities. Someone suggested to him that 
he loses in extemporaneous talks. In reality, improvisation is 
his strongest side. Because he is a man of the people. He feels 
good and at ease in a crowd. In a free dialogue, he proves 
himself to be interesting, very original, and an interlocutor 
who is not devoid of craftiness and cunning. He is quick to 
react, and he has a good memory. In all of our practical work in 
television interviews with him, Yeltsin did not once ask me 
questions beforehand. We were simply able to come to an 
arrangement while walking: We will talk about such-and-such a 
subject. 
  The president has a normal human reaction. He gets offended 
like a normal person. You can hear from him: I promised myself 
to hold a grudge against you for two weeks, but it is already a 
month today, and it is past the time, let us talk...." 
  [Moroz] Do you associate with him frequently? 
  [Poptsov] I try not to abuse this, but when it is necessary 
for me to discuss some questions, and if the president is not 
bearing a grudge against me, he is always ready to be contacted, 
and the conversation, as a rule, turns out to be very open and 
interesting. I do not recall that the president has refused to 
meet. 
  [Moroz] Well, then, will there still be regular monthly 
speeches of the president on Russian Television? 
  [Poptsov] I am confident there will be. And the last time we 
came to an agreement, and we scheduled a program. But then some 
kinds of events occurred.... Poptsov appeared somewhere in 
Skokov's company--the circle immediately began to say: "There, 
you see! Something is not right here...." The president is a 
human being. He is also vulnerable, like all people. He has been 
betrayed more than once. Before our eyes he was betrayed three 
times in a major way. Under such circumstances each of us should 
be more cautious in relations with other people, even more 
suspicious. I understand him well. There is one more 
obstacle--jealousy on the part of the Ostankino company. They 
are beginning to calculate on which channel the president speaks 
most often. These calculations absolutely do not interest me. I 
am also not interested in the fact of who in a shot is next to 
the president. All of this is details; the main thing is that 
there should be a continuous, open dialogue with the president 
on Russian Television. And there will be.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Stepashin, first deputy director of </F>
the Federal Counterintelligence Service, by TRUD special 
correspondents Vitaliy Golovachev and Yuriy Dmitriyev; place and 
date not given: "Counterintelligence: A Look From the 
Inside--Sergey Stepashin, first deputy director of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, Talks About the New Russian Secret 
Service"] 
  [Text] For many decades the state security organs 
were the most powerful and mysterious organization in the former 
USSR. The tumultuous events of the past few years could not 
bypass them. The Main Protection Directorate, the Federal 
Government Communications and Information Agency, and foreign 
intelligence became independent agencies... In December of last 
year an edict of the president of Russia disbanded the Ministry 
of Security and announced the creation of a new Federal 
Counterintelligence Service (FCS). What do all these changes 
mean for the country? What will the new secret service be like? 
In what way will it be different from the old one? We posed all 
these questions to Sergey Stepashin, first deputy director of 
the Federal Counterintelligence Service. 
  "In many respects this organization will be different from 
the old Ministry of Security," said Sergey Vadimovich. "Here are 
our six main tasks. 
  "First. Exposure, prevention, and suppression of 
intelligence and sabotage activities of foreign special services 
and organizations against Russia. 
  "Second. Obtaining intelligence information on 
threats to the national security. 
  "Third. Providing information to the president of 
the Russian Federation on threats to national security. 
  "Fourth. Combating terrorism and illegal 
circulation of arms and drugs. This also includes uncovering and 
neutralizing illegal armed formations, as well as uncovering 
illegally created or banned public associations that encroach on 
the constitutional system of Russia. 
  "Fifth. Ensuring within our jurisdiction the 
protection of state secrets. 
  "Sixth. Counterintelligence support for 
operational protection of state borders. 
  "As you can see, the FCS will not have many of the old 
functions. For instance, we will no longer be involved in 
investigations (and therefore the investigative department is 
being transferred to the Office of the Procurator General). 
Neither will we have the investigative detention facility in 
Lefortovo--it is being transferred to the MVD [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs]. The only function we retain is inquiry 
(urgent investigative actions within a short period of time). 
  "Next, drugs inside the country are not our province, 
either. 
The FCS will investigate only those cases where the drug 
business is linked to foreign partners." 
  [TRUD] What about corruption? 
  [Stepashin] Only in the event that it involves the highest 
echelons of power. The rest will be handled by the procuracy and 
the MVD. The same goes for gangsterism and routine criminal 
offenses... 
  Overall, the Federal Counterintelligence Service's staff 
will 
be half as large as that of the former Ministry of Security 
[MB]. The MB had a staff of 138,000; the FCS will have 75,000 
(nationwide). 
  [TRUD] How many people will you have in Moscow? 
  [Stepashin] Approximately 1,500, not counting the 
scientific-research institute, military-medical units, 
maintenance personnel, and protection and maintenance of 
buildings and facilities. 
  [TRUD] Is the structure of the federal service a secret? 
  [Stepashin] What specifically do you want to know? 
  [TRUD] For instance, what departments will the FCS have? 
Will 
there not be, for instance, an entity under a new name similar 
to the notorious former Fifth Main Directorate of the KGB, which 
investigated the differently minded, "dissidents"? 
  [Stepashin] Even the Ministry of Security that was abolished 
in December no longer engaged in political investigations; this 
will be even more true for counterintelligence. The entire FCS 
structure, all its departments, will correspond precisely to the 
tasks defined for our service, which I have already enumerated. 
  If readers are interested, the FCS structure is as follows. 
First, the counterintelligence operations administration. This, 
I think is self-explanatory: Exposing agents of foreign 
services, etc. Next, the counterintelligence support for 
strategic facilities administration. This involves the security 
of nuclear stations and other nuclear facilities, 
transportation, communications, and protection of state secrets. 
  Next, the following administrations: military and economic 
counterintelligence; antiterrorism; information and analysis; 
search operations; and operational-technical measures. Other 
units are in a way auxiliary, providing support for FCS 
operations: contracting and legal; personnel; economic... A 
total of 20 administrations, including medical and the Public 
Relations Center. 
  I repeat: Our main task is counterintelligence; the FCS does 
not have any other tasks. 
  [TRUD] Who is the Federal Counterintelligence Service 
subordinated to? 
  [Stepashin] Directly to the president of the Russian 
Federation. 
  [TRUD] Can local authorities direct the work of FCS' local 
units? 
  [Stepashin] No, they cannot, although, naturally, we will 
work in contact with local authorities. But the specificity of 
the FCS' work is such that all units must be rigidly 
subordinated vertically to the center. 
  [TRUD] Corruption is so pervasive today among Russian 
bureaucrats that this is openly discussed both in our country 
and abroad. Will the FCS have sufficient resources to combat 
very influential corrupt officials in the highest echelons of 
power? 
  [Stepashin] There should be no doubt in this respect. All 
such materials will be handed over to the procuracy and directly 
to the president of the country, who demands an unrelenting 
fight against corruption at any level. No matter what job a 
person holds, he will not escape responsibility if he is caught 
with his hand in a honey pot. It is another matter that the 
materials collected must be totally convincing. It was due to 
insufficient evidence that in the recent past officials who used 
their position for personal enrichment were able to escape 
punishment. We have learned from this experience. 
  Simultaneously, we need to strengthen the legislative base, 
to make it absolutely clear what an official cannot do (for 
instance, be a part of commercial structures, including 
foreign), and what does not constitute a violation of law; what 
is the mechanism of penalty for violations; and so on. An edict 
on civil service is an important step in this direction. Other 
legal acts are in the works. 
  [TRUD] Are there currently any specific cases "in the 
development stage" involving corruption in the highest echelons 
of power? 
  [Stepashin] Yes. You realize I cannot yet mention any 
details, but these are very serious cases; our specialists are 
following a hot trail and are checking carefully and 
scrupulously. 
  [TRUD] Lately the press has frequently published reports of 
serious violations of the law by MVD personnel. In the past such 
facts were investigated by organs of state security. Now that 
the MB has been abolished, does it mean that the MVD, customs, 
and tax services will be completely unsupervised? 
  [Stepashin] Why unsupervised? First, there is the procuracy, 
whose task is to monitor observance of the law. Second, we are 
not going to stand on the sidelines either--the MVD, the 
customs, and the tax police will not be left "unsupervised." 
Honest people have nothing to fear. Those, however, who violate 
the law must bear responsibility in accordance with the law. 
  [TRUD] How do top officials in the government feel about the 
activities of security services? 
  [Stepashin] We encounter great understanding. Recently, for 
instance, we discussed with First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor 
Gaydar issues related to the country's economic security. He was 
particularly interested in matters related to product exports 
(the potential for abuse, illegal deals, etc.). Another example: 
Anatoliy Chubays asked us not to recall our service's 
specialists who are on assignment at the Russian Federation 
Committee for the Administration of State Property and to assist 
in averting machinations in the course of privatization of state 
enterprises. 
  [TRUD] A report was made public recently that many 
commercial 
banks are under tremendous pressure from the mafia. Those top 
bank officials who do not agree to cooperate with the mafia are 
simply being liquidated; evidence of this is the number of 
contract murders last year. It is easy to imagine what will 
happen if the financial system ends up in the hands of corrupt 
structures... 
  [Stepashin] We have an agreement with the Central Bank 
Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko that our services will take the 
national banking system under protection. In addition, banks 
have their own security services. 
  [TRUD] The results of the recent parliamentary elections 
were 
completely unexpected for the powers that be. Does this mean 
that nobody in the country knows what the people's mood is? 
  [Stepashin] Zhirinovskiy's success was not a surprise for 
our 
services. Sociological services use their own methods to study 
public opinion; our services get this kind of information 
through their channels. Even before 12 December the analytical 
department produced this forecast: Zhirinovskiy's party may get 
24 percent of the vote in the elections (as you can see, the 
forecast was very precise). All these materials were sent 
"upstairs" in time... 
  [TRUD] What about you personally: Do you get information 
about the popular mood only from analytical summaries? 
  [Stepashin] First, we do not produce these kind of 
"summaries" on a regular basis. (The forecast of election 
results is not a typical occasion). It is not the FCS' task to 
identify and evaluate popular moods. I think a lot of people 
would be glad to immediately accuse us of reanimating political 
investigations... 
  [TRUD] Why investigations? Is knowing the popular mood an 
investigation? How is it possible to run the country without 
knowing what people are happy or unhappy about? If the FCS is 
tasked with this, however, will you be able to carry it out? 
  [Stepashin] Of course. But until we are charged with such a 
task, we do not do this on a regular basis. As to popular moods, 
they are generally known. There are, of course, those who are 
doing fine, who have adapted to the market environment, but 
there are also many who have found themselves beached. I 
recently visited my relatives in the town of Sobinka in Vladimir 
Oblast. My cousin works at a textile factory, which is now idle. 
He is paid 12,000 rubles a month. He does not have dinner every 
day. And there are others like him. What kind of mood can these 
people be in? I was told a lot of things in Sobinka... 
  [TRUD] The stratification in society is growing; about 40 
million people do not have the income to provide for even a most 
modest sustenance minimum. Some political scientists talk about 
growing social tensions in society, the potential for intense 
social conflicts. Until a way is found to attenuate hardship for 
tens of millions low-income people, the situation may intensify 
to the limit. In your opinion, could conflicts grow into civil 
war? 
  [Stepashin] I do not think so. The government said clearly 
that social orientation of the reforms will be strengthened. And 
if stabilization processes begin at the end of the year; if the 
production decline is halted and structural restructuring in 
industry begins, positive changes will affect the social climate 
as well. 
  [TRUD] It is being said that during the period of 
reorganization of the security services they have ended up being 
sort of paralyzed, incapable of functioning, and the country has 
been left unprotected. Is this true? 
  [Stepashin] Nothing of the kind; the work has never stopped 
and is continuing right now. And it would be impossible to 
suspend it anyway: For one, there is the unceasing stream of 
contraband people try to smuggle out of the country. For 
instance, in Orenburg Oblast it was discovered that 667 kg of 
gold and 21,770 kg of silver had been exported abroad as part of 
black copper alloys from the Mednogorsk integrated copper 
smelter and sulfuric acid plant. Now the joint enterprise will 
reimburse the cost of exported precious metals in hard currency 
(about $10 million). In Pskov Oblast, two railcars (135 tonnes) 
with 8.45-caliber cartridges were intercepted on route to 
Estonia... I could give you numerous examples of this nature. 
  Neither is there any decrease in active intelligence 
activities against Russia, and it is conducted not only by 
special services of "far abroad" countries but also by Baltic 
and CIS countries. Twenty people were arrested in 1993 on 
charges of espionage. Several dozen more cases involving 
espionage are under investigation. 
  [TRUD] There are many rumors regarding the circumstances of 
Barkashov's arrest. How was he actually found? And why was he 
not arrested while he was in the White House? 
  [Stepashin] I know Barkashov by sight, and I saw him on 4 
October on television, when he was being escorted with others 
out of the White House. After that, the militia handled each 
person individually. Why Barkashov was not detained I do not 
know... 
  Later, when the task was set to find him and bring him in 
for 
questioning, our services began the search. We followed his 
trail--we knew he was in Moscow. It was only a matter of time. 
At the end of December our officers found out that he had been 
admitted to hospital. The rest is history. 
  By the way, a while back the Security Service sent the 
procuracy (the procurator general) materials on military 
training and other actions of extremists led by Barkashov. 
Nevertheless, later on the Ministry of Justice... officially 
registered the organization, and it acquired legal status... 
  [TRUD] Last question. Regarding the upcoming visit of the 
U.S. President Clinton to Moscow. How will his security be 
handled? 
  [Stepashin] As usual. The Main Protection Administration and 
our services are doing everything necessary in coordination with 
representatives of the U.S. special services. Several thousand 
operatives will be on duty during the visit. The U.S. 
President's security is completely guaranteed. 
  I would like to say in conclusion that the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service will build its work on the 
principles of legality, respect for human rights and freedoms, 
and humanism. This is the alpha and omega of our entire work.
