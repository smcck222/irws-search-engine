<F P=106> [Interview with Air Force Aviation Chief Col Aleksandr </F>
Abrahamyan by A. Dokholyan: "Flight `In Armenian'"] 
  [Text] The Air Force, one of the most important 
components of modern armed forces, is, for understandable 
reasons, a new thing for us. Up until recently we would look at 
military aircraft appearing in the sky overhead with an interest 
purely for the hardware itself. We now experience a conscious 
awareness that those intrepid souls up there are sons of 
Armenia, our boys. At first our joy was mixed with doubts: would 
Armenia, which lacks vital necessities of life, be able to 
handle such a burden? 
  In spite of all this, however, on 26 July we celebrated 
the first anniversary of our Armed Forces. We are talking with 
Air Force Aviation Chief Col Aleksandr Abrahamyan. 
  [Abrahamyan] In a structural sense we have essentially 
stabilized, and we are presently deploying our subunits. 
Instruction of young pilot personnel has also commenced. 
  [Dokholyan] Military aviation in Armenia is a new 
thing. How have you resolved the problem of specialist 
personnel? 
  [Abrahamyan] The fact is that we have started from scratch. 
Thanks to the efforts of our ministry, however, we received 
first-rate pilots, pilots who in the former Soviet Union had 
completed advanced training school. And we ourselves began 
training pilots locally. Many of these are today flying modern 
aircraft. We are now operating in Arzni, the Republic of Armenia 
Ministry of Defense Aviation Training Center. 
  [Dokkholyan] Aviation, especially military aviation, is 
an expensive pleasure, as they say. And our republic is 
presently experiencing an economic crisis. I would imagine that 
this in all probability has an adverse effect on your work as 
well. 
  [Abrahamyan] Yes, it does. There are many difficulties and 
basic problems. The government and ministry support us, however. 
We are allocated an adequate amount of fuel. Otherwise, we would 
not be able to perform military missions. 
  [Dokholyan] What kind of living conditions do the 
pilots have? 
  [Abrahamyan] The good news is that in our republic, as was 
the case in the former Soviet Union, they understand the 
importance of and give priority to aviation. Only 2 or 3 of our 
pilots have not received individual apartments. First on our 
list of tasks is to provide them with an apartment. 
  [Dokholyan] Do you work in cooperation with CIS states, 
with the Russian Federation? 
  [Abrahamyan] Of course we are working in that direction. 
Everything, however, depends on Armenia's financial solvency. 
  There are also issues pertaining to internal matters: 
violations of military regulations, desertions, etc. We are 
endeavoring to eliminate such things. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  In the course of an informal get-together with 
primary-rank enlisted personnel, the latter indicated that they 
were not so dissatisfied with economic difficulties and 
difficulties with daily life (although pay is extremely low) as 
they were upset by the demeanor of "money-possessing" young men 
(strange as it may seem, even such as these sometimes grace us 
with their service in our army). At times it is difficult even 
for command personnel to "communicate" with them. One of the 
noncommissioned officers came right out and stated: "A person 
with more money than you can shake a stick at comes and stands 
in front of you and tries to dictate special conditions for his 
son." 
  It is a situation with which many of us are quite 
familiar. We encounter such phenomena all the time. The reasons 
for and the roots of this phenomenon are well known. The army is 
not an entity separate from society, and certainly it is 
subjected to the influence of the moral and ethical standards 
which exist in society. However, we should have kept such market 
relations out of the Armenian National Army at any price. 
  In spite of all the problems and setbacks, however, the 
Republic of Armenia Air Force exists today. Col A. Abrahamyan 
replied as follows to the question: "If it became necessary 
today, could they defend our skies?" -- "It is our duty to do 
so." And it is the duty of all of us to strengthen the National 
Army.

<F P=106> [Article by S.V. Aleksashenko, deputy minister of finance of </F>
the Russian Federation: "To Perfect the Process of Drafting 
Territorial Budgets"] 
  [Text] The fall has come--the time to draft budgets. Our 
success in the coming year will largely depend on the results of 
this effort. This is why we should concentrate on the mutual 
relations between budgets and changes in the tax system in the 
coming year without embarking on theoretical discussions about 
how things happen in our country and why, which at present 
claims too much effort and time. 
  First of all, it must be understood that the budget is a 
mechanism that operates continuously, every day. By virtue of a 
number of circumstances of restructuring, radical changes of 
some kind in the budget during the calendar, financial year are 
virtually impossible. We are bound by laws and obligations; 
besides, the economic situation is quite difficult. Under the 
circumstances, it is natural that all our hopes for the better 
may only be attached to 1 January of next year, and new patterns 
of some kind and their implementation may only be planned for 
that period. 
  Perhaps no one sees our budget in its entirety or has an 
idea 
of its status. This is not surprising; after all, the budget is 
supplemented on a daily basis by the decisions of various 
authorities concerning new expenditures and grants of relief. 
Crowds (another word is hard to find) of visitors push decisions 
advantageous to them in the government. The adopted laws force 
the state to spend tremendous funds for programs whose 
effectiveness is dubious. The law on grain, the law on the 
social status of servicemen, and the law on guarantees to 
northerners are the best-known of such laws. These three laws, 
when fully implemented, result in expenditures of approximately 
20 trillion rubles [R]. Of course, servicemen should be 
protected, the northerners should be helped, and our agrarians 
are facing a difficult situation. However, when we are told that 
we should pay world prices for grain to agrarians, plus 
compensate them for one-third of their expenditures, plus offset 
50 percent of the cost of machinery, 40 percent of the cost of 
fertilizer, and 30 percent of the cost of motor fuel and 
lubricants, it will turn out that the grain price for the state 
in our country is greater than in the world, whereas the wages 
of kolkhoz members do not reach even 10 percent of world levels. 
The question is: Where is this money going? We invest tremendous 
funds in agriculture, but the result is zilch. 
  In late July, a representative of the Tula Oblast 
administration, who had "pushed through" a government decree on 
conducting an experiment in the agro-industrial complex, came to 
see me and said: "We need R15 billion in easy credit, in which 
case we will produce additional agricultural output worth R15 
billion." I was somewhat taken aback by these numbers and said: 
"Well, fine--we will give you R15 billion, the interest rate 
being 170 percent annually; this means approximately another 
R23-R24 billion. The total amount of expenditures will come to 
R42 billion, and the increment in output--R15 billion. Are the 
outlays and the returns commensurate?" One would think that 
budget expenditures should be viewed not only from the point of 
view of political lobbying; the time has come to look at whether 
such expenditures are needed from the point of view of the 
result produced. 
  Frankly, the situation that is emerging in the tax sphere 
and 
in the sphere of budgetary federalism, in mutual relations 
between the federation and its components does not satisfy the 
government. We would like to have greater precision and clarity 
in this matter and less room for case-by-case decisions. As far 
as taxes are concerned, the government has a clear-cut position. 
The government evaluates the situation quite soberly and 
believes that it makes absolutely no sense to introduce some new 
taxes, some kind of large, heavy, complex taxes. We will not be 
in a position to collect more than 50 percent of the gross 
domestic product. At the same time, we are not currently in a 
position to reduce the tax burden on the economy. Last year, all 
revenues and receipts that the state collected for the budget 
and all off-budget funds came to approximately 48 percent of the 
gross domestic product. For comparison, this number comes to 40 
percent in the countries of Western Europe, the European 
Community, and to 30 percent of the gross domestic product in 
the United States and Japan. To be sure, there are the examples 
of Denmark and Sweden where, respectively, 54 and 51 percent of 
the gross domestic product is collected. However, in this case, 
too, this is rather an exception from the rule. 
  Therefore, elsewhere they collect less taxes, and we collect 
more. However, in addition to this we should say that the 
deficit of state finance last year came to approximately another 
30 percent of the gross domestic product. That is to say, we 
collect 48 percent, and we print money for another 30 percent. 
The state is facing a unique economic situation whereby it may 
spend not only its revenues (the funds it collects in the form 
of taxes); it may generally meet all of its needs by using the 
printing press--simply printing money. In this case, all 
citizens of the country will pay an inflationary tax: by putting 
new money into circulation, we depreciate each ruble that is in 
circulation. 
  At present, the federal budget receives approximately one 
ruble in three (which it spends on expenditures) out of the 
credit of the Central Bank, i.e., one ruble in each three that 
the budget pays as wages, allowances, retirement benefits, and 
investment is not backed by anything. This is new money that 
depreciates the money already available in the country. Under 
the circumstances, it is impossible to resolutely up and reduce 
the tax load by a factor of two if we still strive to avoid 
hyperinflation. 
  At the same time, there is potential for reducing the tax 
burden. Out of the 48 percent of the gross domestic product that 
we collected in the form of taxes in 1993, 16.5 percent or 
slightly more went to off-budget funds: the Retirement Fund, the 
Social Security Fund, the Employment Fund, and another 
approximately two dozen small funds. As far as off-budget funds 
set up by the government are concerned, a decision in principle 
has already been made to the effect that from 1994 on, all of 
them will be incorporated into the budget, and the government 
will no longer have off-budget funds. There is a problem with 
off-budget funds that were managed and controlled by the Supreme 
Soviet. Out of the monies that the off-budget funds collected 
last year, approximately one-third of the funds remained unused 
(out of the 16.5 percent, which the off-budget funds collected, 
5.5 percent remained in accounts). This says only that 
enterprises pay social insurance withholdings and those to the 
Retirement Fund (to all enterprises, these are just other 
taxes), but these monies are not used in any way. From the point 
of view of the state, they are not productive. Let us say 
frankly that the monies are used there for mercenary purposes: 
They are placed in deposit accounts at a low rate of interest, 
with someone collecting the difference. 
  Under the circumstances, it would be feasible to allocate 
the 
temporarily unobligated monies of the off-budget funds, a 
certain proportion of them (70-80 percent), to the acquisition 
of state securities so that the federal budget would be able to 
borrow money from off-budget funds, pay a certain rate of 
interest to them, and spend it for budget expenditures, thus 
restricting inflationary pressures. 
  In principle, the current tax system (as an aggregate of 
taxes, i.e., the list of 42 taxes) satisfies the government. 
Five or six key taxes generate 95 percent of the budget 
receipts. The rest of the taxes are needed to perform a 
regulatory function and to maintain the revenue base of local 
budgets. 
  While not seeing it fit to change the tax system, the 
government considers it necessary to focus its efforts on 
implementing the principles of the Federation Treaty with regard 
to the budget and tax system. 
  Understandably, the list of local and regional taxes that 
now 
exists is not in a position to meet the financial needs of our 
regions. At present, the situation is such that out of 89 
regions, 41 regions receive from the federal budget 40 percent 
of the funds that this budget spends (this is the total volume 
of grants). Out of these 41 regions, 22 regions receive more 
than 60 percent. In general, there are fewer than 20 regions not 
receiving grants in our country as a whole. This is why it is 
clear that some kind of a substantive approach to the division 
of the collected taxes should be implemented in our country, in 
our federation. The practice of the world indicates that in 
principle there are three approaches to solving this problem. 
  The first approach is to have different taxes. The 
federation 
would introduce its own taxes, components of the 
federation--their own taxes, and the local organs of 
power--their own. The rights and responsibilities of various 
levels of authority in laying taxes should be divided: there 
should be federal taxes, taxes of the components of the 
federation, and local taxes. Correspondingly, each level of 
authority should introduce taxes that are entirely taken in by 
its budget. 
  That is to say, if someone wants to increase his revenues, 
he 
should introduce new taxes, and thus also be held politically 
accountable by his population. "You want to spend money--so tell 
us what are you collecting it for and how"--this principle 
should be the same for all authorities, so that everything will 
be precise and clear, and that no region will visit Moscow and 
bargain for better conditions for themselves than for the 
neighboring regions. Everyone should be responsible for his 
decisions. In conjunction with this, it is necessary to 
authorize the components of the federation and the local organs 
of power to introduce their own taxes, and to establish and 
revise the rates of the taxes that now exist. Are some kind of 
upper-limit restrictions needed in the process or not? The 
Ministry of Finance believes that these restrictions do not 
work; a way will always be found to circumvent them. However, in 
principle, this issue exists. 
  The second approach is for a tax, for example, the profit 
tax, to combine rates: the federal level of power will introduce 
its own rate, the regional level--its own rate, and the local 
level--its own rate. 
  The third approach calls for tax revenue sharing. In our 
country, the value-added tax that is distributed between the 
federation and components of the federation is a vivid example. 
  The practice of what we call developed countries testifies 
to 
the fact that nobody has succeeded in adhering to just one 
principle. No budgetary system is built on a single principle, 
that is, nowhere do just different taxes or the combination of 
rates exist. As a rule, a combination of all three, or in rare 
instances two out of the three aforementioned approaches, is 
used. In view of this, it is not possible by any means to agree 
with the popular proposal to divide taxes: to give the profit 
tax to the regions, and to give the entire value-added tax to 
the federal budget. From a purely financial standpoint, 
approximately equal amounts emerge, that is to say, the federal 
budget will not lose, but the regions will because the 
distribution of the profit tax throughout the territory of the 
country is much more uneven than that of the value-added tax. 
According to estimates by the Ministry of Finance, 17 regions 
stand to win from the introduction of this arrangement, and the 
rest of the regions will lose. This means just one thing--that 
the need of the regions for additional financing will increase. 
  Moreover, the Ministry of Finance believes that neither the 
federal budget nor the budgets of components of the federation 
can be held hostage by a single tax. All kinds of things may 
happen to the profit tax in a region: For example, a large-scale 
conversion program may begin, or else a natural disaster may 
occur there, the entire industrial sector could shut down, and 
there would be no receipts of the profit tax. What then? It will 
always be very difficult for both the federation and components 
of the federation in such emergency situations. 
  This is why in our country, under our conditions, we should 
implement a combination of all three of these methods. In 
particular, the Ministry of Finance proposes to combine rates of 
the profit tax: to make the profit tax both a federal tax and a 
tax of the components of the federation so that the federal 
parliament will introduce its own tax rate, which will apply to 
all enterprises throughout the country, and representative 
organs of power of components of the federation will introduce 
their rates. 
  At the same time, the Ministry of Finance believes that the 
profit tax and the personal income tax should be paid by all 
citizens and all enterprises. These should be federal taxes; at 
the same time, only a particular proportion of them will be 
federal. This is one of the principles that forms the foundation 
of the state. Uniform taxes and uniform currency--this is what 
should unite all of us. Each individual residing in the 
territory of our country or each enterprise operating in the 
territory of our country that generates profits through its 
activities must pay taxes to the federal budget primarily to 
perform common functions that exist in our country. 
  The Ministry of Finance proposes to share and give to the 
regions a proportion of proceeds by virtue of the value-added 
tax. 
  The rate of the value-added tax should be established in its 
entirety by the federal parliament and should be shared on a 
uniform principle between the federal and regional budgets. 
  At present, these allowances are differentiated: between 20 
and 50 percent is taken in by the budgets of the components of 
the federation. Unfortunately, personal preferences play a 
considerable role in whether the number 20, 28, 43, or 50 is 
laid down. 
  The current situation is such that one-half of the regions 
receive substantial grants from the federal budget. Generally 
speaking, it makes no difference whether a region receives 20 or 
50 percent; something will still have to be given to it 
additionally. However, the position of the Ministry of Finance 
is that uniformity in mutual relations should be introduced in a 
radical manner. As we see it, 25 percent of the proceeds by 
virtue of the value-added tax should be given to regions, and 
the uniform norm should apply to all. Everyone should stand on 
an equal footing and be guided by uniform rules. 
  The concept of differentiating the rate of the value-added 
tax cannot be supported by any means. Technically, the 
value-added tax is very complicated. A system for refunding 
monies exists within it; if we introduce various rates in 
different regions of our country, our financial system will go 
crazy: To conduct all such resettlements, we will have to know 
the rates of the value-added tax that exist in each of 89 
components of the federation. 
  A similar experiment has already been conducted in Brazil, 
where each state introduced different rates of the value-added 
tax. However, this was very quickly abandoned because the 
financial system became chaotic. 
  Understandably, disproportions will arise anyway, regardless 
of the manner in which territorial budgets are drawn up. There 
will still be regions (more than one-half) that will need 
financial support even after we make use of all theoretical 
tax-sharing arrangements. This is why it is proposed to 
introduce two types of transfer payments, payments from the 
federal budget to regional budgets. One payment would be given 
as general replenishment for the revenue base in the event that 
the per capita total of federal taxes in a specific region is 
lower than in the country as a whole. A proportion of this could 
be compensated from the federal budget. The second payment (in 
conventional terms--"social") in the event that the total per 
capita social expenditures are substantially lower in a 
particular place than in the economic region on the average. 
Once again, the federal budget may defray a certain proportion 
of these expenditures. 
  According to calculations, the implementation of this 
arrangement on the basis of 1993 statistics results in the 
following: one-third of the regions win, one-third of the 
regions lose, the situation of one-third remains the way it 
exists now. In the process, the issue of regions that lose 
heavily is very complicated. There are regions that will lose up 
to 60-65 percent of their present-day income. Understandably, 
some kind of individual solutions should be sought. 
  At present, there are regions that receive 85-95 percent of 
the funds for their expenditures from the federal budget. 
Understandably, others cannot shoulder the tax burden for them. 
If someone wants to finance large expenditures in his territory, 
let him set his taxes himself, or ask for assistance, subjecting 
his budgets to control by the Ministry of Finance in order to 
make it possible to determine how rationally money is being 
spent. This procedure should possibly have some political 
conditions attached to it, but everyone should know clearly: If 
you want to have assistance beyond certain rules that exist in 
our country be so kind as to do this openly.

<F P=106> [Article by Pavel Felgengauer: "Choosing an Objective </F>
American Style"] 
  [Text] Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin have agreed that the 
strategic nuclear missiles of the United States and Russia will 
now be trained in not on the territory of the "probable enemy," 
but instead--on the empty regions of the world ocean. Now if 
something were to happen, the combined megatonnage of the two 
superpowers would merely slaughter fish and, perhaps, a couple 
of unfortunate fishermen. 
  This, of course, is a large step forward compared to Cold 
War 
times when, at the beginning of the eighties, on both sides of 
the ocean fingers were literally quivering over the launch 
buttons. The re-aiming of the strategic missiles was possibly 
the last in a long list of peaceful initiatives of Gorbachev, 
Reagan, and Bush, which made the beginning of the nineties quite 
different from the beginning of the eighties. 
  In this case, the initiative came from the American 
military. 
The Pentagon was concerned about reductions of staff and combat 
readiness in the Russian Army, about which there were many 
reports last year, and also the general crisis in our country, 
as a result of which, as they think there, there was a greater 
probability of unsanctioned or accidental launching of missiles. 
  The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs was happy to 
support 
the new peace initiative, and the Ministry of Defense and 
General Staff had no objections. The agreement was signed, but 
neither in the United States nor in Russia was there any 
possibility of monitoring compliance. All questions of 
controlling strategic nuclear forces (SYaS) are a carefully kept 
state secret. Nothing is known specifically--all one can do is 
guess. But one can assume with a certain amount of confidence 
that the Russian (Soviet) missiles were not aimed anywhere in 
particular anyway. There are various possible versions of their 
application and, correspondingly, a set of flight assignments. 
The order to launch and, correspondingly, the number of the 
flight assignment come from Moscow at the same time, and the 
team on duty in the underground command point in a standard 
situation does not participate in the launch at all. It merely 
echoes the commands from Moscow in the event of a possible 
failure of the electronic system, but itself can launch nothing 
without an order from Moscow granting permission. 
  When a year and a half ago President Yeltsin spoke about the 
fact that our missiles were not aimed at the cities of England 
and the United States, he undoubtedly spoke the truth, although 
in the West they did not really understand this ("Where are they 
aimed, then?!") Probably for the Americans aiming the 
missiles in a different direction really could serve as an 
additional safeguard against an accidental nuclear war. But 
since the majority of Americans, particularly the 
military--patriots of their homeland--are firmly convinced that 
the American way of solving any problem is the best, they are 
thus convinced that our equal triad of strategic nuclear forces 
is more or less a copy of their triad. Which in reality is far 
from the case. Frequently, fundamentally different technical and 
military-political solutions were used in the Soviet Union. 
  The most reliable thing would probably be for our presidents 
to simply take and exchange nuclear buttons, and thus put an end 
to the threat of nuclear war once and for all. Incidentally, the 
already mentioned differences in the organization of strategic 
nuclear forces could make sure that this exchange would not be 
altogether equivalent, either. It has long been known that what 
is good for the Russian is good for the German (or, say, the 
American).... Or, as Sir Kipling wrote: "East is East and West 
is West, and never the twain shall meet."

<F P=106> [Article by L. Khazan: "The Kuchma-Hrynyov Alliance--Biggest </F>
Surprise of the Season"] 
  [Text] The super-bloc of this election campaign, the union 
of ex-Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma and ex-Deputy Speaker 
Volodymyr Hrynyov, was met with a certain degree of bewilderment 
by the broad segment of quasi-political masses. But despite 
being entirely unexpected, it was still immediately perceived as 
being fairly strong and flexible. The impression remains, 
however, that this compromise union is deficient, due to the 
fact that ex-Deputy Prime Minister Volodymyr Lanovyy is not a 
participant. Prior to this time, Lanovyy's views on methodology 
for the conduct of market transformations coincided with those 
of Volodymyr Hrynyov. Which cannot be said about Leonid Kuchma. 
Nor has this strange factor gone unnoticed by observers and 
delegates to the III Congress of New Ukraine, from which all 
three individuals have sprung. 
  But Leonid Kuchma did not spend a long time in New Ukraine, 
soon making his career as the head of government. While 
Volodymyr Lanovyy left New Ukraine over disagreement with the 
tactics of the antimarket--in Lanovyy's view--policy of Kuchma 
following the II Congress. The New Ukraine leader, Volodymyr 
Hrynyov, has evidently embarked upon a path seeking unifying 
factors with Leonid Kuchma, not disjunctive ones. 
  V. Hrynyov's attempt once again to draw V. Lanovyy into the 
ranks of New Ukraine at the III Congress 18 November were not 
crowned with success. In his presentation to the congress, 
Lanovyy expressed a sharply negative assessment of the 
Kuchma-Hrynyov alliance. Perhaps not the least 
important--although not the most important either--role in the 
difficult relationship between Lanovyy and Kuchma was played by 
the ugly situation that came about in January of this year, when 
the Center for Market Reforms, headed by Lanovyy, presented to 
Prime Minister Kuchma--still new in office at that time, a 
program of market transformations. But Kuchma, enamored with the 
idea of "management of the state sector," failed to attribute to 
the program the significance it deserved. His apparatus (V. 
Pynzenyk's name was also mentioned here) used scissors and glue 
to fashion a motley collection of fragments of diverse--at times 
mutually exclusive--economic programs, including the program of 
the Center for Market Reforms, into which titanic labor had been 
expended, according to Lanovyy. In the final analysis, the 
eclectic nature of the policy of the Kuchma Cabinet (along with 
pressure from the president's clan) led to his resignation. Not 
joining the alliance, Volodymyr Lanovyy is establishing the 
Union of Private Property Owners and Entrepreneurs, whose 
congress will convene 24-25 December. 
  So what is this union of Kuchma and Hrynyov based on? It is 
most likely based on a certain convergence of positions, for 
which Kuchma had to make at least a small shift to the right, 
and Hrynyov--to the left, which fixes the position of the 
alliance on the left flank, but not far from center. From all 
appearances, the prediction of farsighted politicians and 
political experts, including the well-known V. Malinkovich, on 
prospects for a left-centrist bloc is coming to fruition. We 
know that political groups of appropriate orientation formed 
prior to this time are beginning to gravitate towards it. The 
election results will show whether or not it was worth the 
trouble.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dmytro Korchynskyy, deputy commander, UNSO, </F>
by Oleh Yeltsov, journalist: "Dmytro Korchynskyy: `It's No 
Problem for Us To "Put Down" a Certain Number of Persons'"] 
  [Text] At the end of 1993--by a vote of 294 "for" and 
23 "against"--our parliament added three amendments to the 
Criminal Code. These amendments provide for criminal liability 
for mercenary service, participation in armed conflicts on the 
territory of other states, and illegal activity by citizens' 
associations. To be sure, everyone understood that these 
amendments had been prepared--first and foremost--bearing the 
UNSO [Ukrainian People's Self-Defense Forces] in mind. The 
journalist Oleh Yeltsov addressed some questions to Dmytro 
Korchynskyy, deputy commander of UNSO, on this score. Their 
discussion is printed below. 
  [Korchynskyy] The enactment of these amendments can be 
regarded from the following two points of view: political and 
legalistic. 
  In our opinion, from the legalistic point of view, these 
amendments are inconsistent with--or even 
contradict--international norms, the Ukrainian Constitution, 
and...common sense. Thus, the law in question provides criminal 
liability for participation in international armed conflicts 
without the objective of receiving remuneration. Moreover, such 
persons are really not mercenaries, but rather so-called 
combatants; and they are protected by various international 
conventions. Byron, Hemingway, and Che Guevara were combatants. 
If they were living in Ukraine right now, they would be put 
behind bars for five years. And, in fact, Hemingway would be 
sentenced to 12 years because he received payment for his 
activity. 
  A great deal of interest has also been aroused by the 
definition of a "militarized formation or unit": It is motivated 
by the military principle, which includes authority, 
subordination, and discipline; for how else can a troop 
formation or sports training be conducted? And so now people 
will be condemned for discipline and military training. These 
amendments likewise provide for criminal liability for 
participating in informal associations. Not even the Bolsheviks 
attempted to do this when they were in power. From now on, the 
amateur members of a choral group will be taking a chance if 
they have failed to register themselves. But it is understood, 
of course, that the singers will go on singing, while this law 
will be applied to us--the foes of the present regime. 
  [Yeltsov] Nevertheless, no matter what kind of a thing his 
new law may be, it has been put into effect. What moves do you 
intend to make in order to cope with it? 
  [Korchynskyy] I'd like to ask you the following questions: 
Who will be the judges? In accordance with what kind of legality 
will they proceed when the state itself is utterly criminal in 
nature? 
  [Yeltsov] Critical observations and remarks have been 
directed at the UNA [Ukrainian National Assembly]-UNSO for quite 
some time now. How do you explain the fact that these "criminal" 
amendments were enacted precisely at this time? 
  [Korchynskyy] Everything that is occurring in the state now 
must be perceived within the following overall context: 
ruination of the credit, financing, and banking system, the 
actions of the government directed at incapacitating any kind of 
economic life at all.... That is to say, those very same persons 
who are attacking the foundations of economic life are also 
attacking us. And they certainly do sense the threat--or at 
least the genuine inconvenience--which is personified by our 
organization. They are moved by a trend to step up the 
persecutions of our self-defense forces and the UNA structures 
with strikes and free trade unions. The regime has begun to be 
agitated by the fact that the working people's actions are 
assuming more organized features. An increasingly greater number 
of workers are coming to the conclusion that the path of strikes 
and trade-union methods alone will not correct the situation. 
And--here and there in the localities--a genuine threat is 
already being posed to this government. 
  [Yeltsov] In such cases, what will be your specific actions 
in the situation which has evolved? 
  [Korchynskyy] We are being provoked to take revenge. And, 
indeed, it's no problem for us to beat up this or that 
bureaucrat, or to "put down" a certain number of persons. 
Believe me, we have gained enough combat experience for this 
purpose at various points of military confrontation. However, it 
is not revenge that we need, but rather victory. We will not 
fall into the trap of yielding to such a provocation. If we were 
to set for ourselves the mission of overthrowing and ruining 
this state, then it would not be hard to accomplish that. We 
have experience in acting under the conditions of destruction. 
  [Yeltsov] Then what is it that you are striving for? 
  [Korchynskyy] We are for order and a strong state. 
  [Yeltsov] What kind of a path do you see in order to attain 
such goals? 
  [Korchynskyy] Cooperation and consolidation among the UNSO, 
the political power of the UNA, the officer corps, the national 
capital, and the independent unions. If such a constructive 
force were to be finally and definitively formed, the 
present-day regime would be toppled without any bloodshed and 
with the maximum legitimacy. 
  [Yeltsov] But let's turn from the political program to your 
orientation with regard to today's legislative space. As of now, 
UNSO activity has already been designated or categorized as 
illegal. Will your actions be aimed at going underground or at 
endeavoring to become legalized? 
  [Korchynskyy] First of all, we will be utilizing the 
possibilities of legal activity. We will try to register our 
units in the localities. 
  [Yeltsov] But if your attempts to become included within the 
power structure prove vain and useless, what kinds of actions 
will you take then? 
  [Korchynskyy] It is undoubtedly the case that the potentials 
of the MVS [expansion not given] are incomparably greater than 
those of the UNSO. I have only a few thousand comrades-in-arms. 
But all of them have been tried and tested in combat actions; 
they have gathered together and are bonded by their own blood. 
In our organization we do not betray each other. That is to say, 
we jusge a person by his healthy, human instincts. 
  But a situation could evolve whereby our organization 
couldbe 
deprived of its leadership--a leadership which has made no 
effort to hide itself from the present-day authorities. And then 
uncontrolled actions by our fellows could not be ruled out. 
  [Yeltsov] But against whom would they take action: against 
the government, the parliament...? 
  [Korchynskyy] On that score I'm sure that it would be an 
unmotivated kind of terror. And history has emphasized that 
unmotivated terror is the most effective. 
  [Yeltsov] A great many rumors continue to abound concerning 
the existence of reserve supplies of firearms in the possession 
of the UNSO. 
  [Korchynskyy] It would be simply senseless for us to 
stockpile such weapons. Practical experience in military 
conflicts on the territory of the CIS has attested that arms 
should not be gathered in such stockpiles. They will appear as 
soon as the need for them arises. We do not need to seek out 
weapons--they are all around us. 
  [Yeltsov] Rumors are also spreading about the existence of a 
ruthlessly severe security service in your organization... 
  [Korchynskyy] The best security system is a sure system of 
relations in the midst of the organization itself. And in 
connection with underground activity, centralization is even 
detrimental.

POST-POSTUP: "Three Trampolines, One Hole: Tactics of Political 
Forces in Preelection Leaping"] 
  [Text] With 90 days remaining before the elections, 
nobody any longer doubts that potential people's deputies of the 
1994 vintage will mostly leap into the Supreme Council from 
trampolines of three designs. Although the names of those who 
wish to try it on two or three trampolines at the same time are 
known, an overwhelming majority of candidates have already 
chosen a design to their liking and in line with their 
potential, and are now enthusiastically demonstrating trial 
leaps to their colleagues in electoral blocs in order to capture 
the top positions on the qualifying list. 
  As far as the designs are concerned, they are perfect. 
That is to say, each trampoline has been tailored to the needs 
of the designer himself. The trampoline of the nomenklatura, 
tall and made for the shortest leap without any particular 
swinging, was introduced especially for individuals with heavy 
behinds benumbed from sitting, to whom hopping into the chamber 
of the Supreme Council is like walking from their office to the 
room next door. Only in Galicia will there be trouble with this 
design: Because of a lack of materials, the trampoline was built 
on rotten supports, and the deputy careers of the few courageous 
members of the nomenklatura may come to an end under its rubble. 
  The trampoline of the entrepreneurs is as simple as our 
economy. One of its ends is held by the sinews of labor 
collectives and the other by those of independent trade union 
organizations. Each candidate will choose the end to his taste. 
Before leaping, the catapulting mechanism should be well oiled. 
A group of disconcerted private owners and businessmen has 
nested somewhere in between the favorites of the labor 
collectives and the pets of the trade unions. The push in this 
place on the trampoline is going to be minimal whichever end is 
pulled--those who have trained may fly far enough.... 
  The trampoline of the political parties is somewhat 
like its creators. It has three starting pads--left, center, and 
right. Some mechanisms of the trampoline remain a mystery to the 
designers themselves. The function of most parts changes daily. 
Since the parts are worn out due to the frequent change of aim, 
they have to be tied together by ropes or nailed down. Nobody 
can say with certainty which mechanisms hamper the leap and 
which give it an impetus. Perhaps all the mechanisms will be 
turned off at the same time for the elections, provided, of 
course, that the trampoline does not fall apart before then. 
  Given the differences in leaping techniques and 
competitive tactics, each group of the candidates is training 
separately. POST-POSTUP intends to familiarize its readers with 
the peculiarities of this process. 
<H5>  Entrepreneurs </H5>
  Three all-Ukrainian associations of entrepreneurs are 
getting 
ready to run. The USPP [Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs] team appears the strongest among them. After 
Leonid Kuchma and Volodymyr Hrynyov got together, the USPP has 
succeeded in bringing in some private businessmen, which will 
undoubtedly create for it a favorable reformist image and fill 
the coffers of the union with capital from businessmen. The 
clear-cut pro-Russian orientation of Leonid Kuchma, the new 
president of the USPP, makes the bloc reliable on the 
preelection menu of the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine. 
The chances of candidates from the USPP bloc are estimated to be 
better than of those who went to other associations of 
entrepreneurs--the All-Ukrainian Association of Entrepreneurs of 
Serhiy Babych and the Union of Private Owners and Entrepreneurs 
established with the participation of Volodymyr Lanovyy, the 
former deputy prime minister with the still untarnished 
reformist image. 
  In combination, the Lanovyy and Babych blocs will offset the 
obvious superiority of the USPP somewhat. The disproportion 
would have been catastrophic had Lanovyy not secured support 
from the Oleksandr Mril free trade unions. This combination 
guarantees him fans during the duel with Kuchma: Both blocks are 
betting on the "labor collectives." The power over labor 
collectives which state directors from the USPP are easily 
retaining both through the "aktiv" of enterprises and thanks to 
resort vouchers, hospitals, and waiting lists for housing is 
counterbalanced by the independent trade unions from Lanovyy's 
bloc, which have painlessly reorganized their primary chapters 
into labor collectives. A "labor collective" cuts both ways. It 
is an ideal trampoline for the "director's man," where 
democratic trade unions do not exist. However, the labor 
collective is a director's headache in districts in which the 
free trade unions have grown in strength. Nonetheless, it is 
expected that Lanovyy's people will be successful in just 12 
electoral districts populated mostly by miners, taking the 
deputy seats from the USPP. 
  At least two intense clashes between USPP directors and 
trade 
union organizations are known--in Krivoy Rog and Pervomaysk, 
where Vasyl Yevtukhov, current deputy prime minister, and Mykola 
Surhay, current head of the State Committee for the Coal 
Industry, grasped with surprise that they will have a problem 
getting nominated by the labor collectives of miners, although 
they were not able to link this phenomenon, an unpleasant one 
for them, with their behavior during the miners' strikes. The 
main battles between the free trade unions and the director's 
tank are expected to break out in the Donbass, where Markulov's 
Liberals and the Labor Party will interfere with dividing up the 
election pie. 
  It is hard to imagine a more fortuitous tactical combination 
than the alliance of the free trade unions and bankers from 
Praveks and Inko which has been devised by Lanovyy. Having 
grasped the futility of efforts to stand against the USPP alone, 
Lanovyy opted for the only possible line of behavior whose 
chances to be effective will improve by reason of a strike 
scheduled by the trade unions for 18 January. It is precisely 18 
January that may advance Lanovyy to the center stage of 
Ukrainian politics. 
<H5>  Parties </H5>
  The party life of the democrats is full of contradictions. 
Each one of them demonstrates devotion to the idea of a single 
bloc, while stressing at the same time that such a bloc is 
hardly possible. Some, dispensing with preelection agreements, 
have gone to look for greener pastures in districts prepared 
beforehand, maneuvering between the need to demonstrate 
adherence to the ideas of private enterprise and the temptation 
to scold the entrepreneurs before the voters, most of whom view 
businessmen as "thieves" and "speculators." It appears that 
participants in the center-right Council of Democratic Parties 
and Organizations of Ukraine, the creation of which was 
memorable at the last Rukh congress, are now more concerned 
about the division of funds from the diaspora; failure to 
apportion them is preventing the ultimate breakup of the council. 
  Les Tanyuk said: "Many problems of the association are 
related to the KNDS [Congress of National-Democratic Forces]--an 
organization created to break up Rukh. The so-called 
All-People's Rukh of Larysa Skoryk, which is a direct 
alternative to People's Rukh, also emerged from the recesses of 
that organization. Many KNDS leaders believe that the democrats 
have reared a Mazepa out of Kravchuk. If people from the URP 
[Ukrainian Republican Party] understand that they have been 
fooled, the array of national-democratic forces will possibly be 
broadened. Everything depends on the degree to which these 
forces distance themselves from the president. Painful 
disappointment awaits them otherwise." Of course, it is hard for 
Tanyuk to forget that some people from circles close to the KNDS 
were privy to his persecution as a "KGB agent," and also that 
the leader of the Republicans attacked Vyacheslav Chornovil on 
television right before the 1991 presidential elections. 
  Larysa Skoryk, chairman of All-People's Rukh, does not 
believe in consolidation of the democrats for the elections. She 
calls the democrats' promises not to fight one another in 
electoral districts "declarations backed up nothing." Mrs. 
Skoryk asserts emotionally: "I am telling you that this will not 
happen. There will definitely be several candidates from various 
democratic groups per district, especially in Galicia." In view 
of the fact that the KNDS is used to paying attention to the 
reflections of Larysa Pavlivna, the paralysis of the council may 
be explained from this point of view, if no other. 
  To skirt the "points of conflagration" in the council and 
free itself from the trouble of settling adversarial situations 
in the electoral districts, the leaders of Rukh appear to have 
found a quite mild outcome which, it appears, Oleksandr Kibza, 
an adviser of the department of political analysis of the 
organization, has been charged with releasing. He said: "We are 
planning to give regional organizations an opportunity to 
themselves decide which candidates to nominate and support." 
  Old conflicts and misunderstandings are superimposed over 
the 
severe realities of the present day: It is hard for the 
center-rightists to come to a compromise in dividing up their 
traditional electorate in the western region (Galicia) and Kiev. 
Some observers believe that approximately seven candidates from 
the democrats will contend in the rural areas of Galicia for one 
mandate, and 15 candidates in the cities. In Kiev, out of 2,500 
contenders for candidates which are expected to be registered by 
the electoral commissions of the capital city until 27 January, 
the center-right will "field" only 100. It is quite possible 
that some leaders of the center-right, having returned from a 
futile tour of Galicia, will compete among themselves in Kiev. 
Only Oles Shevchenko, who will run in Tarashcha, in the vicinity 
of Kiev, and Dmytro Pavlychko, who considers the area of Kanev 
to be the best jumping-off point, have given up the capital. 
  Kiev has prepared a few more presents for the voters, which 
could also have been expected. Semen Yufa, chairman of the 
Merkuriy company, which is widely known in the capital city, 
will most likely be a candidate in Chervonoarmiyskyy Electoral 
District, in which Yuriy Kostenko won the previous election. So 
far, people willing to compete with him are not in evidence, 
just as there are none who want to try their luck in a game 
against Ivan Saliy. The "Podol wolf," who has organized his own 
Choice, not only draws on the favorable position of KIYEVSKIYE 
VEDOMOSTI but also impresses competitors with the directness of 
his drive for power, a directness which, in combination with the 
methods for persuading competitors, will be sufficient for Saliy 
to win with no opposition. 
  The flight of the left wing of Ukrainian parties is not 
endangered by surprises. Although Yevhen Marmazov, deputy 
chairman of the Communist Party of Ukraine, says that "the 
Communists will not form a bloc with anyone, but all of us--the 
Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Peasant 
Party--will help one another," his "other party comrades" 
consider the issue of creating a left bloc already resolved. 
People's Deputy Valentyn Trizna projects: "The time for the left 
bloc to gain power has now come. I think that it will win the 
elections." The possible "drain" of votes of the electorate by 
the Hrynyov-Kuchma bloc causes a certain alarm among the "left." 
Nevertheless, the "left" do not avoid discussions with this 
bloc. A certain outline of anti-Kuchma theses in the electoral 
program of the Socialists may be found in the words of Oleksandr 
Moroz: "The panacea for all misfortunes--privatization--which 
was advocated by both the Fokin government and in particular the 
Kuchma cabinet, has fully discredited itself. They brought our 
society to the brink of catastrophe." 
  However, such theses of the left are not the foundation of 
their electoral platform. Their leaders engage in anti-Rukh 
propaganda with energy worthy of a better cause. Yevhen Marmazov 
said: "The blockade of the Communist and Socialist Parties, of 
those who do not subscribe to the positions of Rukh, is real." 
  Anticommunism remains the core of Rukh's propaganda. 
Chairman 
of People's Council Ivan Zayets said: "People are already 
beginning to understand that the system of power which is 
embodied and implemented by the procommunist forces is to blame 
for all these troubles." Both party leaders are much more 
reluctant to acknowledge a paradoxical situation whereby the 
nomenklatura succeeds in "swinging the pendulum" from the 
Communists to the Rukh people and the other way around while 
remaining in the shadows in the process. Marmazov said: "Perhaps 
Kravchuk is indeed trying to put the Communists and the 
Socialists at odds with the nationalists. However, I consider it 
more probable that they are not trying to put us at odds, they 
are simply isolating us." Ivan Zayets: "Indeed, the arrows which 
the democrats now shoot at the party of power ricochet in the 
direction of the Socialists and the Communists." However, the 
two antagonists recognize that the method of "swinging the 
pendulum" is a quite effective nomenklatura technique to ensure 
its victory in the elections. 
<H5>  The Nomenklatura </H5>
  Changes in the structure of the nomenklatura indicate that 
Kravchuk's group has suffered a defeat at almost all its 
positions. This is significant for Ukraine not only because it 
is certainly the only country in the world in which elections of 
the executive authority are carried out by the executive 
authority itself, with the latter calling elections and forming 
electoral commissions, but mainly because the Electoral Law 
approved suits only the apparatchiks of the local 
councils--Plyushch's nomenklatura. This conclusion has become 
obvious following the adoption of the Electoral Law whose draft 
called for 50 percent of the members of the TsVk [Central 
Electoral Commission] and OVK [district electoral commissions] 
to be appointed at the hand of the president, whereas in the 
law, the appointment of TsVK and OVK members became the 
prerogative of the Supreme Council and local councils, that is, 
the "party" of the speaker. It was ultimately determined "who is 
who" after Ivan Plyushch stated at an all-Ukrainian meeting of 
representatives of the president that "the institution of local 
representatives of the president is ineffective." 
  The intermediate results of the confrontation between the 
nomenklaturas of Plyushch and Kravchuk, the difference in whose 
territorial and clan backgrounds has been clear for a long time 
now, the imbalance which has developed in relations between 
them, as well as Kravchuk's open attempt to draw on the USPP and 
the unheard-of fiasco of his calculations indicate that his 
"party" has no chance of winning the elections. With the 
exception of the official FPU [Federation of Trade Unions of 
Ukraine] and several groups in the KNDS and the VsRU 
[All-People's Rukh of Ukraine], virtually nobody supports the 
president's nomenklatura. And even this support appears 
ephemeral. The FPU, which is headed by Oleksandr Stoyan, a 
former adviser to the president, is being torn apart by internal 
contradictions; for different reasons, the Association of Trade 
Unions of the Lvov Area (headed by Rukh member Yaroslav 
Kendzyor) and the Association of Trade Unions of the Kharkov 
Area (led by the Socialist Viktor Chub) have expressed their 
disagreement with decisions of the council of the federation. If 
the FPU had a major influence on 20 million of its members, any 
opportunity for other political forces would be altogether out 
of the question. The activity of small propresidential political 
groups is generally restricted to the vigor of Larysa Pavlivna. 
  Plyushch's nomenklatura has better insurance against a 
defeat 
in the elections than any other political force. Each point in 
the Electoral Law is a step toward the Supreme Council. The 
already mentioned infamous "labor collective" is the "horse" 
which is supposed to carry the nomenklatura people between the 
rock and the hard place--the desire to obtain loans and 
opposition to market-oriented transformations. The Electoral Law 
does not define the labor collective at all. Two other laws, the 
Constitution and the Code of Labor Law, provide either the 
ideological or the production-oriented definitions of the labor 
collective, and neither codifies the political role of the labor 
collective. Sick days, waiting lists for housing, allocation of 
mineral fertilizer, and the plowing of auxiliary plots are the 
best starting conditions for the "party of the nomenklatura." 
  Even if a director, kolkhoz chairman, or commander of a 
military unit wishes to become a deputy before retirement, the 
law also envisions a soft "way out." Unlike the draft law, which 
envisioned that public servants may run "if they resign from 
their post no later than four months before the day the 
elections are held," in the law (Article 2, Point 5) this 
provision has magically changed--public servants "may be 
registered as contenders for candidacy if at the time of 
registration they submit to the district electoral commission a 
statement of consent to their dismissal from the position in the 
event of being elected people's deputies of Ukraine and a 
statement on the temporary suspension of official powers for the 
duration of the election campaign." Therefore, the law does not 
mention the resignation of a deputy before the beginning of the 
election campaign. 
  If we disregard the touching desire of the current community 
of people's deputies to protect their director colleagues 
against the loss of their positions in the event of losing the 
election, the goal of this "innovation" in the law becomes more 
transparent: It is hard to imagine that any "young worker" will 
have the slightest desire to come out against the director at a 
conference of the labor collective. The director may return 
after failing at the elections. 
  However, the resourcefulness of the nomenklatura is not 
limited solely to the nomination of candidates by labor 
collectives. Article 11 of the law regulates the boundaries of 
electoral districts. In keeping with the decree of the Central 
Electoral Commission, the average number of voters in a district 
should amount to 86,600. In keeping with the same law, 
deviations in the number of voters may not exceed 12 percent. 
However, if we analyze the Decree of the Central Electoral 
Commission, dated 17 December 1993, On Electoral Districts for 
the Election of People's Deputies of Ukraine, well over a 
hundred violations of the law may be found there. For example, 
Pivdennyy Electoral District in Kiev has 66,200 voters, 
Troyeshchinskiy District--108,600. In Sumy Oblast, Zaliznychnyy 
District has 112,400 voters, Trostyanetsky District--61,400; in 
Lugansk Oblast, Lisichanskiy District has 110,100 voters, 
Lutuginskiy District--62,300. Certainly, the gentlemen from the 
Central Electoral Commission do not know how to calculate 12 
percent. 
  Readers not privy to the secret are surprised: "What 
difference does it make?" However, try solving a riddle: Where 
in Kiev Oblast will Ivan Plyushch run--Belaya Tserkov, which has 
99,400 voters, or Baryshevets, which has only 64,400 voters? You 
guessed it. On the other hand, in Galicia, where the 
nomenklatura has almost no chance of winning the elections, 
deviations in the number of voters do not exceed those specified 
in the law. 
  "Trifles" such as "officials [word illegible] on consent to 
being relieved from positions in local self-government shall 
have no right to come out in support of a particular candidate, 
party, or electoral bloc" (Article 36 of the draft) have 
disappeared from the draft law. A very important section on 
financing the election campaign is also gone; its draft included 
many norms which did not allow abuse of the election campaign, 
in particular, the amount of 500 times the minimum wage as the 
personal electoral fund of a candidate for deputy, the procedure 
for remitting funds, and the refusal of candidates for deputy to 
accept "gifts." Out of a total of 15 points, only eight remain 
in Article 36; this is an excellent opportunity to compromise a 
person or, quite the opposite, make him a deputy. It was 
announced on an oblast TV program that a company, the dubious 
nature of whose capital is common knowledge in the region, had 
resolved to give one of the current progressive deputies of 
parliament a few tonnes of paper as a "gift." They said that the 
deputy lost his mind before he managed to announce his rejection 
of the "gift" on that same television; the people had the 
pleasure of listening to it between 2400 and 0100.... 
  However, unrestricted financing for runoff elections, which 
promise to become the main point of the elections in view of the 
number of those eager to a get a taste of the deputy's life, 
became a particularly strong move on the part of the 
nomenklatura. Funding for the second round of elections is not 
regulated in any way. This gives those who have money a splendid 
opportunity to manipulate the elections, and the "party of 
power" has an opportunity to frustrate the runoff elections if 
democratic candidates get through to the second round. It would 
suffice to mount an "explanatory effort" among the masses, and 
elections will not be held. 
  Finally, under the circumstances it is surprising that this 
parliament will operate on a professional basis. Nothing stood 
in the way of the nomenklatura using the need for an 
"inseparable bond with the masses" as an argument in favor of 
the right of a people's deputy to work in production. However, 
rumors about the number of supporters of combining the art of 
kitchen maid (on the principal job) with that of parliament 
member (during time off from the principal job) increasing 
catastrophically in the Supreme Council may yet come true in 
some masterpieces from the electoral kitchen.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mustafa Dzhemilev, chairman of the Mejlis of </F>
the Crimean Tatar people, by Olga Pronina; place and date not 
given: "`I Told Kravchuk That I Know What Democracy Is. I Served 
15 Years For It'"] 
  [Text] We met with Mustafa Dzhemilev, chairman of the 
Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people, immediately following a 
session of the Presidium. The third in the past week, and not, 
by all accounts, the last, since the question of the Crimean 
Tatars' participation in the presidential elections has yet to 
be decided. The appeal to the people to boycott these elections 
has been suspended, meanwhile. 
  [Pronina] Mustafa-aga, on New Year's Eve you met with Leonid 
Kravchuk, president of Ukraine, and on 2 January the Mejlis 
announced a boycott of the elections for president of Crimea, 
although the Congress of the Crimean Tatar People had adopted a 
directly opposite decision. Is there some connection here? 
  [Dzhemilev] You do not have it quite right. The question of 
elections to the Supreme Soviet, where we are allocated a 
particular quota, for which I voted myself and called on others 
to do likewise, was considered separately at the assembly at 
that time. As were, separately, the presidential elections. As 
far as the latter are concerned, I have been opposed from the 
very outset since I am convinced that neither the Crimean Tatars 
nor people of other nationalities are, if it is viewed 
realistically, interested in the institution of a presidency in 
Crimea. 
  The presidency is only for a particular group of people, 
which aspire to the creation of a strong power for the solution 
primarily of their own problems. I pointed out in my report at 
the assembly that the Presidential Election Act was adopted by 
the Supreme Soviet of Crimea, which we did not elect, and on the 
basis of a constitution which we consider unacceptable for 
ourselves and which entirely ignores our legitimate sovereign 
rights. But at the same time, considering the alignment of 
political forces that is shaping up (there is a great evil and a 
somewhat lesser evil, which is mirrored in the fact that people 
wholly of the Zhirinovskiy level are straining after power on 
the peninsula), we are allowing of the possibility of use of the 
votes of Crimean Tatars in the election of the least of all the 
evils. The assembly's decision was, therefore, a compromise. 
  Although there was mention of the unacceptability of the 
institution of a presidency in principle, the final decision on 
participation in the elections was at the same time left to the 
Mejlis. We are prepared to support the candidate who 
honestly declares the indivisibility of the evolved borders, 
that is, allows no mention even of a reconsideration of the 
question of the current territories of Ukraine and Russia and 
the affiliation of Crimea, inasmuch as our people see their 
self-determination in a national-territorial autonomy within the 
framework of Ukraine. He must be a candidate who will at 
least state that he sees the strengthening and restoration of 
Crimea's statehood on the basis of respect for the Crimean Tatar 
people's right to self-determination on their territory. 
  [Pronina] Judging by the decision of the Mejlis, none of the 
present presidential candidates as yet meets these requirements? 
  [Dzhemilev] We have had discussions with many politicians, 
with candidates for the office of president included. I should 
say, incidentally, that as of late everyone has greatly loved 
the Crimean Tatars, and even Leonid Grach, the candidate of the 
Communist Party, sent his people to us, via whom he promised the 
positions of deputies in all the rayon soviet executive 
committees if the Crimean Tatars vote for him. So it was that, 
having analyzed all the election programs and having assured 
itself that not one of our conditions is observed in them, the 
decision not to take part in the elections was made after stormy 
debate at the Mejlis Presidium session on 2 January. 
  But I had a meeting, which took place after the decision of 
the Mejlis, with Nikolay Bagrov, and some of our comrades 
believe that we should take part in the elections for all that. 
Because there is a real danger that instead of Nikolay Bagrov, 
whom they consider the lesser evil, real extremists could come 
to power. It is these members of the Mejlis who are insisting 
that the decision be reconsidered. After two days of stormy 
debate, a decision to boycott the elections was adopted all the 
same. But on 5 January 12 members of the Mejlis submitted to me, 
in accordance with the standing orders, a petition requesting 
the convening of a new session and a conclusive decision on the 
matter on 8 January and for the appeal to the people to be 
suspended meanwhile. 
  [Pronina] So Nikolay Bagrov's candidacy was, for all that, 
preferable to the others? 
  [Dzhemilev] Yes. All the other candidates, including, 
unfortunately, Ivan Yermakov, who declares that he would lift 
the moratorium on a referendum on Crimea's independence, could 
by their actions create an explosive situation on the peninsula 
before which the Dniester region and Karabakh could seem like 
just a game. And when barricades have to be built, a solution of 
the problems of the Crimean Tatars would go by the board. 
  [Pronina] Mustafa-aga, I would like to return to the start 
of 
our conversation--your meeting with L. Kravchuk. 
  [Dzhemilev] I was forced to tell him that I know what 
democracy is. I served 15 years for it, but a democracy where 
presidential candidates raise the question of a change in the 
current borders and a violation of the country's constitution I 
do not understand and do not accept. A self-respecting state 
should not be treating this with such nonchalance. 
  I spoke in great detail about the most difficult situation 
in 
which our people have found themselves and about the fact that 
the assistance which Ukraine allocates from its sparse budget 
should be more specific. All the monies that have been allocated 
us thus far have ended up with the Administration of Crimea. 
They have been used to create a parasitic managerial machinery. 
We have dozens of examples of this money being stolen and used 
for purposes having nothing in common with the return of the 
Crimean Tatars. 
  Ukraine has allocated us 240 billion karbovantsy for capital 
construction in 1994. I asked L. Kravchuk to ensure that this 
money be channeled directly into the national bank which we have 
organized in order that we might purchase building materials 
with it and distribute them to people. A commission with the 
participation of representatives of the Administration of Crimea 
and the Mejlis, which would monitor its expenditure, should be 
created. Some 300-400 homes could, via trusts, be built with the 
amount allocated, and if the funds are distributed directly to 
the individual builders, we could resolve the housing problem 
for 30,000 families. Leonid Makarovich agreed with this and 
promised to render us every assistance here. 
  The president and I also discussed the enlistment of the 
help 
of other countries. Primarily Turkey, whose government is not 
indifferent to the lives of a kindred people. Prior to my 
meeting with Kravchuk I had an interview with the Turkish 
ambassador. He said that the matter could be resolved only with 
the participation of an official delegation of Ukraine, in which 
there should necessarily be representatives of the Mejlis. He 
promised to draw up a program indicating whom we should meet and 
how the questions of assistance should be decided, but on one 
condition--that the resources allocated go directly to the 
Mejlis, not the Administration of Crimea. L. Kravchuk agreed 
with this also, and such a visit will soon take place, I believe.

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Stefanets, Chernovtsy: "Attempt To </F>
Cross-Breed a Few Rukh People With the Party of Power Ended 
Successfully in the State Nature Preserves of Bukovyna"] 
  [Text] Chernovtsy--Despite the territorial affiliation with 
Western Ukraine and the image of a nationally aware region, 
Bukovyna is in many respects a model of the situation in the 
entire state. The oblast has actively progressive western rayons 
and passively conservative eastern rayons. These specifics 
rooted in the historical divisions of the region between various 
empires only reinforce the negative trend toward an increase in 
the weight of regional candidates which is caused by the 
majority electoral system. Consequently in Bukovyna the most 
formidable basis might exist for the prediction that candidates 
will give in to the temptation of populist promises colored in 
keeping with the trends. In addition, it is recalled that during 
the previous elections the obkom [oblast committee] nomenklatura 
had no trouble in eastern rayons, where kolkhoz chairmen and 
Communist Party secretaries "made it" without a hitch, and 
committed all its propaganda efforts to the west, to 
Kitsmanskiy, Vizhnitskiy, and Zastavnevskiy Rayons. Little has 
changed since, except perhaps the fact that the democratic 
publications of the region call the eastern Khotinskiy, 
Kelmenetskiy, and Sokiryanskiy Rayons only the preserves, and no 
longer the strongholds, of communism. 
  In turn, Chernovtsy enjoys the reputation of a politically 
involved city, and even now many observers believe that the most 
severe struggle among contenders will break out precisely in the 
oblast city. Against this background, rayons in which Moldovans 
and Romanians (20 percent of the population of the oblast) are 
clustered, especially the recently created Gertsayevskiy Rayon, 
stand apart. Politicians are uncertain about the tastes of their 
residents. Some recall the December 1991 referendum in which an 
overwhelming majority of residents in these rayons voted in 
favor of Ukrainian independence. Others are concerned about the 
likelihood of the obstruction of elections by these territories, 
in which the chauvinistically disposed Eminescu Society 
subscribing to the position that "Northern Bukovyna has been 
Romanian land since time immemorial" enjoys a certain influence. 
  Religious factors may also influence the course of the 
election race and its result. Bukovyna is an area with 
traditionally strong Christian roots. Periodic flareups of the 
flame of confrontation between the Kiev and Moscow Patriarchates 
of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church may force members of the clergy 
to seek support from political entities and, accordingly, give 
them concealed support. Out of the three main denominations (the 
Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow and Kiev Patriarchates 
and the Greek Catholics), the lion's share of parishes (over 
300) remain with the first church, with the attendant 
consequences. Although the 50 parishes of the Ukrainian Orthodox 
Church of the Kiev Patriarchate are a quantitatively small 
force, one would think it to be sufficient to undermine the 
image of any contender. 
  Contenders themselves in Bukovyna, where almost 20 political 
parties, public organizations, and ethnic cultural associations 
operate, will represent considerably fewer political centers: 
the party of power, the NRU-KUN [People's Rukh of 
Ukraine-Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists], the DemPU-URP 
[Democratic Party of Ukraine-Ukrainian Republican Party], the 
SPU-KPU [Socialist Party of Ukraine-Communist Party of Ukraine], 
and the DSU [State Independence of Ukraine]. 
  In the oblast, which is considered both agrarian and 
industrial, the party of power is realistically capable of 
controlling the votes of the electorate, particularly in rural 
areas. The nomenklatura proposes candidates from the power 
structure of the oblast--popular people who at one time were 
delegated there by the democrats. After all, it is known that 
elections establish their own rules of the game. Consequently, 
not wishing to become members of any party, these politicians 
may, in order not to lose support, face the option of running as 
independent candidates but with the blessing of the head of the 
local state administration. 
  In general, the situation on the eve of the election to the 
power structures is one of the most piquant in the community of 
Bukovyna's democrats--if for no other reason than the top 
leaders of regional Rukh, headed by its chairman Hryhoriy 
Manchulenko, hold positions in the oblast state administration. 
This may be the reason NRU spokesmen have so far been keeping 
the assessment of the activities of the local authorities 
balanced, thus incurring condemnation by the other wing of the 
democrats--the Congress of National-Democratic Forces. There is 
even the suspicion that the NRU has entered into an unadvertised 
alliance with the party of power. 
  Meanwhile, through almost all of November the NRU and the 
URP-DemPU called on one another to unite for the sake of 
opposing the neocommunists in the elections. This resulted in 
the establishment of the Zlahoda Committee of Democratic Forces. 
However, before it managed to get on its feet, DemPU leader 
Taras Kiyak announced, at its oblast conference, the creation of 
the Poryadok electoral bloc within Zlahoda. In addition to the 
DemPU, the URP, the "greens," the Prosvita Union of Officers, 
and farmers who have asked for associate membership in the DemPU 
agreed to join Poryadok. Having thus distanced itself from Rukh, 
DemPU merely gave the local mass media the occasion to ponder 
whether there would be less Zlahoda [accord] with such a 
Poryadok [order]. However, it appears that everything blew over; 
at any rate, from the outside it appears that Zlahoda has come 
to an agreement concerning election strategy and tactics. 
  Meanwhile, the DSU association and the Communists vigorously 
"reached out to the people." In the political array of Bukovyna, 
the DSU clearly sympathizes with the URP. Strict discipline and 
clear-cut slogans of the DSU, which are attractive to voters, 
fit in harmoniously with the objectives of the already mentioned 
bloc with the equally expressive name Poryadok. However, DSU 
leaders offer assurances that they have no intention at all of 
forming a bloc with anyone. 
  The recently held organizational meeting of the Chernovtsy 
city committee of the Communists testifies to their 
organizational activities. The "Reds" are clearly in a hurry to 
create structures before the election. They are being helped in 
this by the publication OBYEKTIVNAYA GAZETA, which is known for 
its criminal disrespect for Ukrainian independence and whose 
sources of financing are not known. The GAZETA is published and 
edited by Volodymyr Dovheshko, who is also the first secretary 
of the KPU oblast committee. Unlike the democrats, the comrade 
secretary long ago released lists, which his name heads, of 
candidates for deputies from the KPU. The KPU does not get along 
well with the local Socialists, who are hardly different from 
the Communists. That same Dovheshko just recently came from the 
ranks of the SPU. However, by all signs mutual relations far 
removed from "comradely" have developed between the two 
secretaries of the oblast committees of the KPU and SPU 
(Kostyantin Kovelchuk is the leader of the Socialists in 
Bukovyna). The KPU is openly accusing the SPU of being soft on 
all "Bandera's followers." However, it is quite probable that 
this is merely a tactical device through which the KPU and the 
SPU want to gain a maximum of the votes of the electorate. 
  In the second 10-day period of December, a "roundtable" 
panel 
on "The Crisis in Ukraine and Ways To Overcome It" organized by 
the New Ukraine association met in Chernovtsy. New Ukrainians 
who created a center in local areas the year before last and who 
until recently did not make their presence known in any way 
suddenly became active. Doctor of Economic Sciences Ihor Shkola, 
professor of the University of Chernovtsy and cochairman of the 
local center of New Ukraine, said that he had agreed to the 
"roundtable" panel on the condition that specific measures for 
stabilization in the country will be worked out by it. The New 
Ukrainians of Bukovyna have made decentralization of the economy 
and the endowment of administrative territories with more 
extensive rights the cornerstone of their strategy. Here is why. 
In Bukovyna, New Ukraine is actively supported by the directors 
of local state enterprises, as well as leading personalities 
from the oblast state administration. For his part, Professor 
Shkola is one of the active supporters of a free economic zone 
whose concept has gone astray in the offices of Kiev but is 
quite popular in Bukovyna. Perhaps this idea may only be spoiled 
by "Trojan horses"--candidates for deputies from the outside, 
mainly from the capital city. According to some reports, the 
functionary of the Cabinet of Ministers Buzduhan may become one 
of these candidates. 
  As far as the political associations of entrepreneurs are 
concerned, no information is available about them. However, 
almost all observers agree that the local business community 
will sooner or later articulate its program because even now it 
has several brilliant personalities in its ranks. Some of the 
entrepreneurs have probably already placed their bets on the 
candidates of national-democratic forces. There are reports 
about businessmen sounding out the positions of probable 
candidates from the party of power. 
  As far as predictions are concerned, candidates who are 
supported by strong, organized groups that have actually been 
created already although not proclaimed will win. On the other 
hand, candidates enjoying the patronage of the power structure 
will have a chance in rural rayons. After that, the democratic 
nominees will stand a real chance in Chernovtsy and one or two 
rayons of the oblast, whereas in other rayons, candidates of the 
party of power or those supported by it will win. However it 
will be possible to consider even this outcome of elections 
favorable, if it materializes, because the current deputies of 
the Supreme Council from Bukovyna which have been dispatched 
there by the late CPSU have for a long time now represented 
nobody aside from themselves. The move by which the KPU and the 
SPU want to get [published item ends in mid-sentence]

<F P=106> [Interview with Mykhaylo Horyn, Ukraine's Republican Party </F>
leader, by Ihor Pasichnyy; place and date not given: "Our State 
Must Become a Therapist of Imperial Moods"] 
  [Text] 
  [Pasichnyy] Mr. Mykhaylo, today's visit by U.S. President 
Bill Clinton to Kiev, the $12 billion promised by him for 
assistance to Ukraine.... Does this indicate a change in the 
attitude toward our state on the part of the world's "mighty"? 
  [Horyn] It must be admitted that quite a number of Ukrainian 
politicians have been counting upon comprehensive support for 
Ukraine on the part of Western democratic states that will be 
happy to help us. We needed time for our society to become 
convinced that a Ukrainian state, about which dozens of 
generations dreamed and for which millions of patriots died, can 
only be built by our own efforts. It is only possible to create 
a favorable political climate in Ukraine when it stands on its 
own two feet concerning the economy and defense, and when it 
manages to convince its neighbors and the entire democratic 
world that it will ensure stability inside the state and will 
thereby promote stability in the region and in the world. In 
that case, it would be political short-sighted to ignore us and 
not to establish mutually advantageous relations with us. 
  As regards the policy of the United States and some European 
states, it has undergone a certain evolution in a direction 
favorable for us. Earlier, there were calls for us to return to 
the "bosom" of the empire, and the new leader Bill Clinton tried 
to talk to us through ultimata. Their policy with regard to the 
states of the former USSR, with the exception of the Baltic 
countries, was pro-Russian. This, in turn, stimulated leading 
Russian state figures to pursue a tough policy with regard to 
Ukraine. There even were territorial claims. It must be 
pointed out that this was always encouraged by the unprincipled 
policy pursued by our government and president. 
  [Pasichnyy] After all, we remember quite well George Bush's 
visit and his speech at the Ukrainian Parliament in which he 
openly called upon us to return to the empire. Or the present 
position of President Clinton, a position that is openly 
coercive.... 
  [Horyn] They expected that the young state would yield to 
such powerful pressure.... However, our parliament had enough 
common sense to state: We will not fully disarm ourselves, 
because we do not possess guarantees for Ukraine's security as 
an independent state in what concerns its borders and 
territorial integrity. 
  The refusal immediately to give up nuclear weapons was an 
extremely clever step on the part of the Ukrainian external 
policy, as it drew the attention of the entire civilized world 
to Ukraine. The world started thinking: What sort of state is 
Ukraine, why does it refuse to give up its nuclear weapons, how 
does it motivate its position, and to what logic do its 
politicians adhere. There arose a problem of imperial threat on 
the part of Russia, and our northeastern neighbor acquired the 
image of an aggressor. The Western mass media steadily spread 
this idea and, as a result, in recent months, there appeared a 
change for the better in the attitude toward Ukraine. We became 
an object of a thoughtful U.S. policy, and, finally, Washington 
realized that the giant state in the center of Europe required a 
proper attitude toward itself. This does not mean that today's 
U.S. policy has become pro-Ukrainian. However, we have not freed 
ourselves from pressure on the part of the United States. 
Clinton's planned trip to Moscow is quite telling. However, 
now Clinton demands that we dismantle our nuclear weapons in 
exchange for compensation. It will depend upon our president 
whether he will manage to convince Clinton that the best 
security guarantee for Ukraine would be to retain those 46 
strategic missiles until all nuclear states disarm. However, it 
must be admitted that we are no longer being totally ignored. 
  [Pasichnyy] I agree with you, but I want to remark that 
Clinton arrived in Kiev in order to offer us assistance in 
dollars. However, he does not want to guarantee our security. 
We cannot count upon assistance from the United States or NATO 
in the case of Russian encroachments.... 
  [Horyn] Recently, I had a conversation with a German deputy 
defense minister, who stated that they are not interested in the 
existence of a strong Ukraine. Such frankness was nothing new 
for me. Back in Soviet [prison] camps, Levko Lukyanenko 
[Ukraine's Republican Party leader] and I foresaw such a turn of 
events. 
  Well, this high-ranking German official explained his idea 
in 
approximately this way. Ukraine is presently in a state of 
crisis. We do not have enough food. However, some 10 years will 
pass, and our state will finally be standing on its own two 
feet. It will be a competitor on European agricultural markets. 
At the same time, traditional exporters, such as Germany and 
France, will find themselves in a difficult situation.... 
  I replied to those arguments by saying that had Ukraine 
remained within the empire, the entire Europe would have been 
compelled to spend huge amounts of money on armaments in order 
to insure themselves against the imperial threat. Europe would 
have trembled before the Moscow empire as it did after World War 
II. 
  Ukraine is not only a dream of the people and the form of 
their survival. Ukraine is a factor of stability, peace, and 
de- imperialization in Europe. Ukraine must become a therapist 
of the imperial moods that prevail among the Russian people. 
The recent elections in Russia are disturbing. 
  [Pasichnyy] After all, the consequences of the recent 
elections in Russia have again placed before the world a threat 
of direct invasion from Moscow. Chauvinism is still alive, and 
it has now acquired features of communo-fascism.... 
  [Horyn] Yes, they showed that it is not only the ruling 
circles in the Kremlin that are infected with the virus of 
imperialism. Many Russians display deep nostalgia for the 
empire, because its very existence raised our neighbors in their 
own eyes. 
  The results of the elections in Russia have also contributed 
to a change in orientations in the West's attitude toward 
Ukraine. Instead of diktat, we see a striving for a dialogue. 
  [Pasichnyy] Pan Mykhaylo, you, as chairman of Ukraine's 
Republican Party, are a candidate for deputy of the Supreme 
Council at the coming elections. What is the attitude of the 
Republicans toward Ukraine's nuclear status? 
  [Horyn] We believe that the very fact of nuclear missiles in 
Ukraine is a guarantee for us and a warning for all of our 
neighbors that they should refrain from playing with fire. We 
are not opponents of disarmament and we are not against 
dismantling those missiles whose service life has expired. 
However, in our opinion, 46 missiles must be left and 
dismantled only after all nuclear powers make identical steps. 
  One more thing. Russia, after it received from us a large 
number of medium-range missiles, has not to this day paid us for 
the nuclear fuel -- this sum constitutes several billions of 
U.S. dollars. 
  I, for example, do not agree that, while dismantling the 
nuclear warheads, we should also be compelled to dismantle the 
missiles themselves. They are our separate property -- they 
were built at our factories. We will be able to use them to 
protect ourselves from territorial encroachments by aggressors. 
  I hope that the president will not hasten to sign the 
necessary documents that would fully disarm Ukraine. It would 
be an irreparable blunder.

<F P=106> [Interview with Candidate of Legal Sciences A. Buteyko by an </F>
unidentified URYADOVYY KURYER correspondent; place and date not 
given: "Ukraine's Nuclear Ambitions. Do They Really Exist?"] 
  [Text] 
  [Correspondent] The world is widely commenting on the 
well-known decision of the Ukrainian parliament concerning the 
ratification of START I. Unfortunately, there also are 
assertions that Ukraine, allegedly, has ended up in 
international isolation and put itself in opposition to other 
countries that follow the path of nuclear disarmament. What is 
the situation as you see it? 
  [Buteyko] Yes, indeed, there are ill-wishers in various 
countries, in particular in our neighbor to the northeast. 
Actually, everything is by far not as unambiguous as some people 
would like. At a meeting of the CSCE ministers of foreign 
affairs Russia attempted to have a decision adopted that could 
have indeed isolated Ukraine. However, they did not succeed at 
doing that. Another attempt was made in Brussels, at a meeting 
of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, with the same result. 
This is why at present some Russian politicians, possibly being 
guided by election-time motives, make statements leveling 
accusations at Ukraine and point toward the international 
community that supposedly also condemns the decision of our 
parliament. However, there is, of course, no documentary proof 
of such condemnation. On the contrary, the facts testify that, 
although some states experience absolutely understandable 
uneasiness, others view our position with understanding. The 
world waited for a first step toward a genuine nuclear 
disarmament, toward a genuine liberation of humanity from the 
nuclear monster. Everyone wanted this to happen as soon as 
possible, as the saying goes, the day before yesterday. 
  One does not have to be a prominent professional to 
understand that disarmament is no simple matter. It necessitates 
considerable expenditures, additional material resources, 
technologies, and production capacity, i.e. precisely the 
factors that are in very short supply in Ukraine to begin with. 
This is why the decision of the parliament was justified 
although, as far as I am concerned, somewhat different, more 
acceptable wordings could have been found. However, the key 
provisions of the decree of the Supreme Council are fully in the 
national interest of Ukraine. 
  I will note that the nature and content of this particular 
decision were also predetermined by the position of some 
countries of the world. What do I mean? The issues of 
guaranteeing our security, the issues of providing technical 
assistance, of compensation for nuclear material placed in the 
warheads have been repeatedly raised by Ukraine before the 
states of the world. Of course, had we been accommodated, 
executive power and the president himself would have had more 
arguments in order for the members of the parliament to accept 
different wordings. 
  [Correspondent] We would like to specify what the main 
content of the accusations that some are now leveling against 
Ukraine is. 
  [Buteyko] One of the main accusations is that we supposedly 
violated obligations to destroy nuclear weapons before certain 
deadlines in keeping with START I that we have assumed under 
international law. However, in this instance our ill-wishers 
count on people who are simply not knowledgeable about the area 
of international law. Certain principles have long emerged in 
relations between states according to which, as a rule, 
obligations and rights are linked. If a state assumes certain 
obligations to other parties, at the same time it also acquires 
rights that safeguard its interests. The nature of the 
obligations and the procedure for assuming them are regulated by 
the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of International Treaties. 
It clearly states that a state may assume obligations by way of 
concluding agreements that take effect and, accordingly, become 
legally binding documents after they are signed. However, an 
agreement may envision another track--ratification, i.e. an act 
of parliament. If we look at START I and the Lisbon Protocol, to 
which our opponents refer, these documents provided specifically 
for ratification. Therefore, obligations for Ukraine arise only 
after the Supreme Council votes in favor of them and the 
treaties take effect. For now, we may state that they have not 
taken effect and Ukraine does not have--I will stress this--any 
obligations under international law in this area. 
  [Correspondent] They refer to the well-known declaration of 
the Supreme Council about Ukraine intending to acquire 
nonnuclear status in the future and the Declaration on State 
Sovereignty.... 
  [Buteyko] Yes, it is so, but the documents mentioned were 
unilateral acts of the state, and they may be classified as 
those merely proclaiming the objective; by no means can they be 
viewed as obligations of Ukraine under international law. 
Besides, they contain no mention of definite deadlines, or 
anything else. 
  [Correspondent] As is known, at a certain point, or more 
precisely on 7 May 1991, Ukrainian President L. Kravchuk sent a 
letter to U.S. President Bush in which he expressed the idea 
about the obligation of Ukraine to destroy strategic offensive 
nuclear weapons within seven years. 
  [Buteyko] Indeed, there was such a letter. However, I would 
like to stress once again that this was a unilateral political 
act on the part of Ukraine. Obligations of a political rather 
than legal nature are at issue. For some reason, those who quote 
this letter turn only to its first part, forgetting that it also 
has a continuation. Specifically, the letter clearly says that 
upon the ratification of START I Ukraine will honor its 
obligation to destroy strategic nuclear weapons before the 
deadlines envisioned by the treaty and, I stress, within the 
context of the Declaration on the Nonnuclear Status of Ukraine. 
In particular, the treaty envisions that it will have effect for 
approximately one-third of the entire nuclear arsenal of the 
former Soviet Union. Therefore, the Lisbon Protocol provides 
that the four nuclear states--Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, and 
Belarus--should conclude an agreement among themselves under 
which they will divide this number of nuclear delivery vehicles 
and warheads that are subject to destruction. However, Russia 
has refused to do this, refused to even proceed to negotiate 
this. 
  Supplements to the letter concerning the destruction of 
nuclear weapons within the context of the Declaration on the 
Nonnuclear Status of Ukraine should be interpreted under 
international law in keeping with the norms that exist in the 
already mentioned Vienna Convention. This means that we should 
look at what even the political obligation assumed by the 
president of Ukraine is about. The sense of it is that nuclear 
weapons are located on the territory of Ukraine that were not 
manufactured by us but were inherited by Ukraine. Ukraine will 
destroy them by way of participating in START I whereas the 
remainder of the nuclear weapons that are not covered by the 
treaty will become the subject of negotiations with other 
interested states. In addition, we should note that the 
Declaration on the Nonnuclear Status of Ukraine envisions that 
we will destroy these nuclear weapons in line with our 
financial, technical, organizational, and legal potential, as 
well as proceeding from the need to ensure ecological security. 
The problem should be viewed in this very context: Are we 
capable of destroying all nuclear weapons in two, three, or 
seven years in our specific situation? 
  Therefore until START I takes effect, Ukraine has no 
obligations under international law. All accusations, including 
those found in the declaration of the Russian Government, are 
completely groundless. 
  [Correspondent] There is a lot of talk about whether Ukraine 
owns nuclear weapons. However, they reproach us, as does Russian 
Minister of Foreign Affairs A. Kozyrev, for Ukraine suddenly 
wanting to become the owner of nuclear weapons. 
  [Buteyko] Empires have fallen apart many times in the 
history 
of civilization. Humanity has developed norms that regulate 
issues associated with the emergence of new states on the rubble 
of empires. This is what it is about. Two Vienna conventions 
exist concerning the legal succession of states with regard to 
treaties, and legal succession with regard to state property, 
state debts, and archives. Specifically, they provide that in 
the event of the emergence of a new state (or several states) 
everything located in their territories becomes the property of 
the new state or states. In keeping with these international 
norms, the Ukrainian Supreme Council passed the well-known 
decree as early as 12 September 1991 in which it was laid down 
that all assets, including financial resources, of all 
enterprises, offices, and organizations reporting to the Union 
became the property of Ukraine. The same applies to strategic 
nuclear weapons. 
  At the time, nobody objected to this. Over time, the thesis 
about Ukraine as the owner of nuclear weapons was also confirmed 
in other agreements signed and concluded within the framework of 
the CIS. Even the agreement on creating the CIS said the states 
will exercise joint control. Subsequently, an agreement between 
Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine, dated 21 December 
1991, also said that the states assume such and such obligations 
with regard to nuclear weapons. 
  How could Ukraine have assumed obligations with regard to an 
object that was not its property? It is nonsensical. Therefore, 
even then it was recognized that Ukraine is the owner of these 
weapons. 
  Besides, there was another string of agreements, in 
particular, two about the status of strategic offensive forces 
within the framework of the CIS in which Ukraine also acts as 
the owner of the components of nuclear weapons deployed in its 
territory. 
  [Correspondent] Does it follow from this that Ukraine is a 
nuclear state, or not? 
  [Buteyko] This is a quite complicated question. Usually, 
they 
talk about nuclear or nonnuclear states, that is, as if there 
were no third. However, it is paradoxical that in the case of 
Ukraine this dilemma does not exhaust the entirety of factors. 
In the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty itself, there is an 
indirect definition of a nuclear state and a state that does not 
posses nuclear weapons. Nobody envisioned in this treaty that 
states might appear which would inherit nuclear weapons, as 
happened in our case. Ukraine has not produced or tested a 
nuclear device, it has no technology for producing nuclear 
weapons, it does not even control the weapons because the 
nuclear button is located in Moscow. Therefore, it so happens 
that Ukraine is an owner of nuclear weapons but is not a nuclear 
state in the full sense of this term. This is a unique situation 
that is not envisioned by existing international agreements. 
  In view of this, Ukraine should manage the weapons as 
material valuables. We are accused because of the Supreme 
Council failing to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
However, if this were to happen now, in this situation, when 
Russia did not go for an agreement on compensation for tactical 
nuclear weapons that had been removed previously, it would turn 
out that Ukraine is forsaking its right to compensation for 
fissionable materials that are placed in the warheads. It would 
have to give the weapons to Russia unconditionally. Can we 
really agree to this? We have already had the case of tactical 
nuclear weapons; we have already had an agreement on the 
division of the property of the former Union abroad. We got 
zilch by virtue of that. However, the goal of achieving the 
nonnuclear status of Ukraine exists, nobody has canceled it; I 
am convinced that a relevant decision of the Supreme Council 
will be approved. 
  [Correspondent] The idea is widespread that nuclear weapons 
in Ukraine threaten us with a new Chernobyl, and that we are not 
capable of ensuring proper oversight of nuclear warheads. 
Therefore, the sooner we give them to Russia the better it is 
for us. 
  [Buteyko] The safety of nuclear charges should be ensured by 
the producer--Russia. We had an agreement on warranty inspection 
and servicing of nuclear missile complexes by the manufacturer 
last year, which was also confirmed during negotiations between 
the presidents of Ukraine and Russia. These agreements should be 
complied with. I am convinced that both parties will be wise 
enough to honor their obligations. If this were suddenly not to 
happen, we should know that danger would loom not just for 
Ukraine. In this case, such a situation could be the subject of 
consideration by the UN Security Council. Negotiations are now 
underway both with the United States and Russia concerning 
security guarantees, financial and technical assistance, and 
compensation. I believe that we will manage to come to 
agreements that will be acceptable to Ukraine and other states. 
  Ukraine is a peace-loving state; it does not threaten 
anybody, and this is understood in the world. In particular, our 
neighbors the Poles stated during a meeting of the Consultative 
Committee of the Presidents of Ukraine and Poland that they 
perceive with understanding the position of Ukraine and the 
decision of the parliament as the first step along the path 
toward achieving the nonnuclear status. 
  In turn, we understand the uneasiness of some states because 
of this problem. A recent conversation between L. Kravchuk and 
U.S. President Clinton touched on exactly the readiness to find 
mutually acceptable solutions. 
  I think that the development of events will follow this very 
path.

  [Text] The Ukrainian flag seemed to have become hopelessly 
entangled in the flagpole line. Someone of the journalists 
waiting on the air field for the plane carrying the U.S. 
President pointed this out to a guard--let your bosses know. The 
guard replied irritably: There is a special person responsible 
for the flag. And, lo and behold--the man "in charge" soon 
appeared, and the flag was fixed. All of this reminded me very 
much the situation of our state, which has become "entangled" in 
a multitude of economic, political, and other problems. Except 
that we are still waiting for the man "in charge" to fix the 
situation. 
  It does appear, however, that an attempt was made that 
evening in Borispol to deal with one of the most burning issues 
of modern times--nuclear disarmament. President Clinton, for 
instance, quite justifiably lists it among the problems that 
came into existence because of the end of the cold war. This 
knot has been tightened even more lately. 
  In your opinion, what is the image of the Ukrainian people 
in 
the eyes of the ordinary man in the West? Undoubtedly they are 
seen as aggressive, trouble-making, and with double standards. 
This is not surprising. Over the past few years people in the 
West have heard about Ukraine almost exclusively in connection 
with two conflict situations: nuclear weapons and the Black Sea 
Fleet. 
  The West does have reason to be jittery. After all, Ukraine 
has in its possession no less than the third mightiest nuclear 
arsenal in the world. It is obvious why the American President's 
statement that those 176 missiles and about 1,500 warheads will 
be eliminated on our soil became a sensation: These missiles 
were not aimed at nothing--they were aimed at the United States. 
Russia conducted its propaganda quite successfully by playing up 
this factor. 
  Still, the greatest contribution to creating this negative 
image of Ukrainians in the world was... our own doing. A 
Ministry of Defense officer of my acquaintance, who is closely 
involved in nuclear armaments issues, once remarked bitterly: 
"These days every politico wants to play the nuclear card." This 
was quite noticeable when our independent state was making its 
first steps. At that time, unfortunately, Ukraine's foreign 
policy was being generated not by MFA ((Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs] professionals but by parliament members not versed at 
all in serious policy matters, let alone military ones. Having 
crowed to the entire world that Ukraine would not join any bloc 
and would maintain nonnuclear status, they counted on 
"compensations, subsidies, and investment" flowing to us in a 
steady stream. This did not happen, though. And then our state 
machinery began to hurriedly put itself into reverse. 
  The "doves" in the Supreme Council simply could not 
comprehend that Ukraine's nuclear complex could not be severed 
from the rest of it (within the borders of the former USSR) 
overnight. This extremely complex organism could be restructured 
only gradually, and even then only on the condition of goodwill 
on the part of Russia. We all remember well that everything was 
developing in exactly the opposite way. As for us, we simply did 
not have our own foreign policy--it was all essentially a 
"response" to Russia's actions. And the United States, too, took 
a very uncompromising position. Initially it offered a laughable 
amount in compensation--$127,000, and proposed as a compromise 
solution to temporarily store missiles on the territory of 
Ukraine under international supervision (very attractive at 
first glance, except that it is well known that where 
international supervision begins, the real rights of a 
"supervised" state end). 
  The terms Clinton is proposing now look quite different. For 
the first time the United States has shown a serious interest in 
Ukraine. This is especially underlined by Clinton's visit to 
Kiev, which is absolutely meaningless from the business point of 
view--what can be possibly discussed in two hours? Eduard 
Lisitsin, a researcher with the Institute of World Economics and 
International Relations [IMEMO] of the Ukrainian Academy of 
Sciences, described the positive points of potential trilateral 
agreements: 
  --Russia finally agreed to compensate Ukraine for the losses 
incurred by having its tactical nuclear missiles taken out. We 
will be given substantial economic aid. We were promised 
guarantees of security. There is hope that the world will 
finally understand Ukraine and its problems. The situation in 
the economy and the military-industrial complex will relax; 
military reform will begin. 
  ...Let us stop and think, however: Do our people really 
crave 
to get rid of nuclear weapons? Obviously not. On the other hand, 
public opinion may change--depending on the results of 
agreements. Besides, if there are no results, the world 
community will simply come to the conclusion that the strong 
United States simply "overpowered" Ukraine (were L. Kravchuk's 
rather unusual and somewhat confused behavior at the press 
conference, his pale face and forced smile not signs of 
precisely such pressure?) 
  In Lisitsin's opinion, by emphasizing the special role of 
the 
Ukrainian president, Clinton unwittingly drove a wedge between 
Kravchuk and the Supreme Council. The decisions that may be 
adopted at the meeting in Moscow are capable of aggravating the 
situation and leading to a crisis of presidential power or, vice 
versa, to hard pressure on the parliament. Neither is needed 
now. Joint efforts of both branches of power are needed (if this 
is at all possible) to restore the economy destroyed by 
incompetent bureaucrats and shamelessly pilfered by embezzlers. 
I think it is appropriate to recall here the thesis of the 
American President, who especially emphasized that in the 21st 
century the best guarantee of a state's security will be its 
economic might. 
  Let me also quote L. Kravchuk, who once uttered a sacred 
truth: "A state may maintain only the kind of an army, the kind 
of armed forces, that its economy permits." This probably also 
is a strong argument for nuclear disarmament. Having to choose 
one of the two--guns or butter--we should probably choose the 
latter. 
  Although perhaps everything would be different had Ukraine 
been capable of formulating and skillfully implementing a 
farsighted foreign policy. This was not to be, however. Sergey 
Vlasov, chief of the Europe department at the Ukrainian IMEMO, 
believes: "Stronger states, such as the United States and 
Russia, have formulated this policy for us. To make us accept it 
they used a carrot-and-stick policy, where Russian played the 
stick and the United States the carrot." Does this mean that 
these countries are indeed those "in charge of the flag," who 
are taking our state ship out of the political dead end? 
  And something else. Having declared our own independence a 
bargaining item (and there is no other way to describe the 
situation of backtracking from a pacifist course to flexing 
nuclear muscles), we ourselves showed to the world how much we 
"value" this independence. I think that in the near future the 
real meaning of the notion "Ukrainian independence" will shrink 
like shagreen leather. We will find ourselves tightly tied to 
one of the poles of the United States--Russia axis. Most likely 
the latter. But this is a subject for separate contemplation.

<F P=106> [Article by Olena Lisnycha: "From a Central Committee </F>
Secretary to the Press Secretary of the White House: Bill 
Clinton Somewhat Unexpectedly Flew Into Kiev for Two Hours. He 
Saw Kravchuk. He Won"] 
  [Text] On Wednesday night, young followers of Michurin from 
Rukh and the USS [Ukrainian Student Union] met a high-ranking 
visitor at the Borispol airport, where several flights, 
including one to France, were delayed in honor of Bill Clinton's 
visit. The imagination of Michurin's followers cross-bred a 
bizarre hybrid on their signs--"Clinton + Kravchuk = 
Zhirinovskiy." However, the presidents did not know this, 
because the picketers who, according to them, had gotten the 
blessing for this action from Vyacheslav Chornovil, together 
with their modest militia escort, remained at the opposite 
entrance to the airport. At precisely the time when they were 
tirelessly chanting "Kravchuk, retire," Clinton was joking that, 
if Kravchuk did not hold his high position, he would offer him 
the job of the press secretary of the White House. 
  Today, on Friday, the presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and the 
United States are supposed to sign a trilateral agreement 
according to which Ukraine will give up all of its strategic 
nuclear weapons, receiving in exchange nuclear fuel for nuclear 
power stations (for the highly enriched uranium that is placed 
in nuclear weapons) and monetary compensation, the amount of 
which has not been ultimately determined but, according to 
preliminary projections, will not exceed $1.5 billion. The U.S. 
President promised that Ukraine will receive some compensation 
for tactical nuclear weapons removed by Russia--actually from 
the United States, greater financial support than in 1993 ($155 
million) and lobbying on behalf of Ukraine in the IMF and the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The U.S. 
President announced the establishment of the Enterprise Fund, 
the monies of which will be addressed to Ukraine, Belarus, and 
Moldova in order to assist small enterprises and privatization. 
This is precisely how, very cheaply, Ukraine was persuaded to 
surrender virtually all nuclear arsenals which until recently 
were the main "emergency store" of Ukraine, saved for the 
rainiest day of the national economy. 
  Most likely, today Leonid Kravchuk will affix his signature 
to a trilateral compact. However, no matter what form it assumes 
(an agreement, a treaty that the parliament must mandatorily 
ratify, or a communique, a statement that becomes legally valid 
after being signed by the head of state), an overwhelming 
majority of the Supreme Council will not approve the 
presidential decision. It could be assumed that, having exceeded 
his authority, Kravchuk is ignoring the parliament and heading 
for authoritarian power, if it were not for the land under the 
president's chair shaking in an increasingly perceptible 
earthquake of a lack of confidence on the part of both the lower 
strata and the supreme echelons of power. Leonid Kravchuk has 
always left one move to retreat. It appears that lately he has 
been playing without writing down his moves, and his intuition 
has failed him. As he expressed his expectation that the Supreme 
Council would support his decision because "the parliament grows 
wiser together with life," Leonid Makarovych may have already 
imagined the forthcoming battle in the parliament. After all, as 
they are struggling for seats in the post-March parliament, the 
people's deputies will arm themselves with the thesis about the 
betrayal of the national interests of Ukraine by the president. 
The chances of Ivan Plyushch to secure the presidency are 
growing automatically (of course, if Kravchuk keeps his word and 
does not freeze the date of the presidential election). 
  Did it make sense to surrender the missiles with lightning 
speed, at ridiculous prices, when our eastern neighbor, with its 
very unpredictable future and in the accent of Zhirinovskiy, is 
putting pressure on all sensitive points of Ukraine ever more 
perceptibly?! Did it make sense to bid farewell to the weapons 
without having obtained full-fledged security guarantees? After 
all, the American initiative Partnership for Peace which was 
approved by NATO and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty--the 
ones that Clinton guaranteed in Kiev--do not provide 
full-fledged guarantees. 
  As the U.S President assured us, we will receive a 
"considerable amount of funds" in keeping with the Nunn-Lugar 
law (a program for assistance to Ukraine by the United States); 
these funds may be used, in particular, for defense and 
conversion. This may be the most dramatic aspect at 
present--given a lack of large-scale, specific reform programs, 
there are reasons to doubt that American aid will not be 
dispersed in economic chaos.

<H5>  Results </H5>
  It is customary to look back on the path traveled and sum up 
what has been done on the eve of the New Year. The results of 
the two years following the gaining of independence by Ukraine 
and the election of Leonid Kravchuk to the presidency are 
joyless, sad, and in many ways tragic. The country that set out 
on an "unrestricted cruise" with dignity and integrity is now 
increasingly reminiscent of a wagon rolling downhill whose 
wheels and shocks are breaking off and speeding every which way 
as it rolls. It appears that we will no longer be able to stop 
and that the wagon, and all of us with it, will end up in an 
abyss. 
  This is what Ukraine has today: a paralyzed economy and 
financial system, a most profound crisis in all spheres of life; 
inflationary processes have already turned into 
superhyperinflationary processes (on this score we are next only 
to Serbia where, unfortunately, a war is on). The pace of 
destruction is far greater than that of our creative activities, 
which makes it possible to refer not only to Ukraine turning 
into a Latin American banana appendage, but also to conclude 
that the threat of the nation dying off is very real. 
  How could this happen? Who is to blame? First of all, the 
state authorities, which have taken care to preserve the old 
system of the nomenklatura-Soviet-communist monopoly behind the 
new attributes. Monopoly has become a reliable barrier in the 
path of all reforms. Thus, Ukraine was perhaps the only European 
country to successfully maintain the old system "safely and 
entirely," and to neutralize political forces of a democratic 
persuasion by way of their splintering and elementary graft, 
which has made it possible for the turncoat party nomenklatura 
to not just hold onto its complete power but to also to 
reinforce it. 
  In this instance, the role of the parliament is instructive. 
For the first time, democratic forces have appeared within it; 
they accounted for one-third of deputies, which sufficed to 
assert differences of political opinion and create a 
constructive opposition to the Communist Party bosses, kolkhoz 
and sovkhoz estate owners, the "Red directors," and other 
representatives of the "aggressively obedient" majority. 
However, L. Kravchuk, I. Plyushch, and V. Durdynets, who cut 
their teeth on nomenklatura intrigues and honed their skills for 
many years in the "golden cage" on Ordzhonikidze Street, 
together with the died-in-the wool fraternity of oblast 
committee secretaries, did everything to block the operation of 
the parliament. This was executed masterfully. Pitting the Reds, 
the yellow-and-blues, the rosy, and the just plain sickly 
people's deputies against one another, the ruling nomenklatura 
undertook to sell out Ukraine and its wealth against the 
background of a political struggle. The deputies and the people 
were fooled in a classical manner--governments and programs for 
overcoming the crisis changed; "tame" political parties were 
created; the president proclaimed himself the guarantor of 
Ukrainian independence; from time to time the attention of the 
public was diverted toward "white brothers and sisters" or the 
Russian threat. At the same time, everything possible was 
exported from Ukraine, plundered, and "grab-it-ized." The mafia, 
corruption, and oligarchy, or in simpler terms, the fusion of 
the criminal underworld with the powers that be, permeated the 
entire societal pyramid, beginning with its very apex and on 
down to the least of the officials issuing export licenses. 
Graft and bribery are reaching a zenith--bribes are given and 
taken not only in "green envelopes" but in entire files and 
attache cases stuffed with dollars. The expression "bribe 
suitcases" has taken root in the vernacular. 
  A colleague told me on one occasion: I was flying in from 
Asia; there are no direct flights; you have to change planes in 
Zurich. I took a look: Everyone on the plane was ours: some 
ministers, bankers, prominent merchants--a well-known company. I 
asked a friend: "What are you returning from--some kind of 
symposium?" "No, everyone was there on business. I for one flew 
to visit a bank and checked on my accounts." Not having a 
personal foreign exchange account abroad is now considered bad 
form in the milieu of those who govern us. 
<H5>  Prospects </H5>
  Having successfully "done in" a referendum on confidence in 
the president and the Supreme Council, L. Kravchuk and I. 
Plyushch began to seriously prepare for new elections. As a 
result of very refined, jesuitically sophisticated, and crafty 
efforts the Law on Elections appeared, which caused the whole 
civilized world to laugh. First of all, it is majority-based, 
i.e. the kind we got used to during the years of Soviet power. 
Second, candidates for deputies will be nominated by labor 
collectives, while political parties will be virtually unable to 
influence the course of elections and the qualitative 
composition of deputies. Third, the practice of electing 
deputies who are not responsible for their actions to anybody or 
anything, except the "mythical" voters, will continue. All of 
this means the collapse of illusions concerning the formation of 
a professional, reformist parliament. That is to say, the 
political and economic situation which has emerged in the 
country will be preserved for a few years to come, which, of 
course, is advantageous for the forces that hold power at 
present. As before, they count on "making it" as deputies in 
remote rural districts, exploiting the oppressed and confused 
condition of the people. 
  The composition of the Central Electoral Commission, which 
consists mainly of people loyal to the president and the 
speaker, headed by Chairman of the Central Electoral Commission 
I. Yemets, who worked on the president's staff, testifies to how 
seriously and actively the party of power of L. Kravchuk and I. 
Plyushch is preparing for the elections. Methodological 
recommendations have been distributed to the localities and 
regions through the channels of both the soviets and 
presidential structures, which contain an analysis of the array 
of forces, recommendations on how to act in particular cases, 
who to nominate, who to block, and precisely how to do it. One 
such study which originated in the recesses of the 
administration of the president was printed in NEZAVISIMOST 
toward the end of last year with a view to familiarizing the 
voters with methods used by the representatives of the party of 
power. 
  The special services have also been drawn into the effort. 
They have been charged with monitoring, through all operational 
and informant techniques, the receipt of assistance from abroad 
by democratic candidates. Finally, the special services will 
embark on carrying out their principal mission: looking for 
spies. 
  The editorial office has learned of the establishment of a 
special, independent division for discrediting future 
"particularly dangerous" candidates for deputies and 
presidential candidates, which does not depend on either the 
Security Service of Ukraine or the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
Techniques of political investigation, surveillance, and a 
thorough study of the "subject" will be used to this end. When 
compiling a character profile, one should answer these 
questions: Does the contender have a family? Where does his wife 
work? Does he have an official or personal car (the make is 
indicated)? What is his standing in the office? Does he 
celebrate holidays together with fellow workers? What does he 
drink--prestigious drinks, or does it make no difference to him? 
What are his hobbies? Does he have a mistress? What does he do 
in the evening? And so on, and so forth. There are grounds to 
believe that all this information will be used against 
democratic candidates by way of producing special leaflets which 
will be dropped in every mailbox, as is now the case with some 
newspapers. 
  Incidentally, about the newspapers. As the election draws 
closer they are thinking about newspapers more often than usual. 
According to available information, appropriate work has already 
been done with a number of publications; they have been geared 
toward candidates who are "ours"; they have received 
instructions and motives to use in refusing to publish democrats 
or let them speak. This was stated recently by V. Pavlyuk, 
editor in chief of the disgraced Hart Studio. Here is an 
altogether amusing piece of information. S. Kichigin, the former 
president of the Dovira company and the former president of the 
newspaper (?) KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI, became the editor in chief 
of this publication, having single-handedly fired from the job 
the well-known journalist A. Shvets. Understandably, this could 
happen only in a highly independent and democratic newspaper. 
However, something else is of the essence. As it became known, 
the dismissal of A. Shvets was the second condition which 
representatives of the administration of the president set for 
S. Kichigin. The first and key condition was to change the 
political line of the newspaper and unconditionally support all 
candidates of the party of power during the elections. In 
return, S. Kichigin was granted an "indulgence" in the form of a 
prolongation of credit and debt (totalling over 10 billion 
karbovantsy) until the end of March of this year, that is, until 
the elections. Subsequently, it will be possible to forgive the 
debt altogether if the newspaper fulfills its obligations and 
everything ends well for the current inhabitants of the "golden 
cage." 
  This is how the party of power operates. What about the 
opposition, the national-democratic forces, organizations of 
state and market orientation? Alas, they are splintered and 
disjointed due to their own ambitions, intrigues, offenses, 
pride, and their own delusions of grandeur. It appears that they 
will still be unsuccessful in creating or contrasting anything 
of value. Besides, in the eyes of the people they are quite 
compromised, due to the care that was taken by yesterday's 
Communists. It is not surprising that in independent 
sociological surveys they hold between 5 and 8 percent of the 
vote. The Communists lead in these projections, who, in tandem 
with the Socialists, are capable of getting up to 55 percent in 
the new parliament. It is noteworthy that up to 23 percent of 
the vote goes to so-called "pure" and "independent" candidates 
whose names are known to few. However, having "made it" to the 
parliament, they will turn out to be closely tied to mafia 
structures, as well as to banking and entrepreneurial 
structures. However, the scenarios whereby homegrown 
communist-fascists come to power or still the same Communist 
Party nomenklatura survives are not ruled out. 
  I do not doubt that many familiar individuals from the 
current parliament will be among the contenders. Many of them 
have come to like the comfortably sated existence built on using 
the erstwhile privileges of the Central Committee of the 
Communist Party of Ukraine and meeting the mercenary interests 
of the present-day commercial structures, and they are not 
averse to extending it. I have repeatedly heard cynical 
narratives of people's deputies who have already "staked out" 
their districts. Using money wheedled out in advance for future 
services (for example, familiarization with the drafts of new 
laws), the deputies "bend over" for the voters every which way 
they can--they hand out sops to families with many children, lay 
the foundations of kindergartens and hospitals, open free 
cafeterias, and so on, and so forth. I for one have no 
particular doubt that they will be reelected. 
  Alas, we have to talk about the imperfection and even 
fallaciousness of the very procedure of elections under the 
current economic conditions, whereby people reduced to the 
extreme stages of poverty and hunger are prepared to give 
everything away for crumbs from their master's table; they are 
prepared to give not only their votes but the shirts off their 
backs so that their children will not end up without clothes and 
barefoot in the snow on the street. Besides, the results of the 
elections in Russia confirm it: Zhirinovskiy's fascists and 
Zyuganov's Communists are in power. I will venture to predict 
their close rapprochement in the parliament; after all, the 
objectives of both are the same--totalitarianism, dictatorship, 
monopoly on power. 
  The election struggle is going to be cruel. The political 
melee will shatter a great many careers and lives. The striving 
of genuine intellectuals, of people with integrity and honesty 
to not get involved in the dirty free-for-all, to keep their 
souls pure, and to distance themselves from lies and 
provocations is natural. This is why I for one have difficulty 
imagining that the new deputies coming to power will be better 
than the current owners of credentials. That is to say, the 
elections will hardly be able to change the situation radically. 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  The results are joyless, the prospects are hazy, and the 
conclusions are sad. As of now there is no force in Ukraine that 
is capable of winning the elections, forming the government, and 
averting a catastrophe. There is chaos in the economy; in 
politics, the party of power holds sway, and people are 
demoralized. This is why, to my mind, the coming elections 
cannot do anything good for the democratic forces; their outcome 
has been predetermined in favor of the nomenklatura. The threat 
of resuscitation of the Communist regime or the establishment of 
an authoritarian dictatorship is real. The situation is being 
complicated by the syndrome of the regions "pulling apart," the 
symptoms of which--attempts to withhold payment of taxes, 
creation of free economic zones, presidential elections in the 
Crimea, fuelling of tension in the Donbass, etc.--are apparent. 
  In a situation in which all power belongs to the president 
(although he and his clique are trying to shift onto others 
responsibility for the current condition of Ukraine on various 
pretexts), his proposal to adopt a law on power acquires a 
menacingly ominous coloring. In the future, we will remain 
hostages to L. Kravchuk's ambitions; after all, if such a law is 
passed, he will still decide the fate of Ukraine 
single-handedly. In turn, if the new parliament adopts a new 
Constitution, the separation of powers will be codified in it. 
This is why it appears that at present elections to the Supreme 
Council are not the priority task. The elections will resolve 
nothing. Only an early election of the president of Ukraine and 
the formation of a reformist government from among 
professionals, proponents of the market economy such as V. 
Lanovyy, A. Savchenko, and V. Chernyak, can change the situation 
and influence it fundamentally. As I see it, there is just no 
other way out for Ukraine at present. The only issue is just how 
blind the current parliament is in failing to see that which 
lies on the surface.

<F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Karpenko, editor in chief of VECHIRNIY </F>
KYYIV, under the "The Editor in Chief's Column" rubric: "The 
Press: Today and Tomorrow"] 
  [Text] Preliminary results of a subscription campaign have 
now been summed up; the campaign has proceeded with difficulty 
and slowly, through severe clashes between editorial offices and 
the monopolistic postal department, against an overall 
background of the continuing pronounced impoverishment of the 
population. The monopoly won out in this instance, too: The 
price of subscription and delivery of the press exceeds all 
outlays on publishing it--the cost of newsprint (at present, one 
tonne already costs as much as 15 million karbovantsy), 
printing, wages, internal outlays of editorial offices, and so 
on. This is happening while the quality of postal services is 
deteriorating markedly: More and more complaints are being heard 
about a failure to deliver periodicals on time. 
  The only comforting point is that, apparently, the first 
blow 
has been dealt to the monopoly of the postal department, 
certainly not a lethal blow but a perceptible one: Alternative 
structures have come along that undertook to take subscriptions. 
These are the newsstands of the former Soyuzdruk [Main 
Administration for the Distribution of the Press of the USSR 
Ministry of Communications], which have broken away into the 
freedom of leasing from the powerful clutches of the Central 
Postal Office of Kiev, various small enterprises, and the 
editorial offices themselves. Difficult trials still lie ahead 
for them; it is not easy to stand against a monopoly. However, 
already the first holes are in the once unsinkable vessel of the 
Ministry of Communications. 
  What did the results of the subscription campaign indicate? 
  First, they testify to the fact that the impoverished 
population, stripped by our dear government, is no longer able 
to afford the spiritual nourishment--periodicals. As recently as 
a few years ago, the average resident of Kiev subscribed to 
three or four publications; last year, many people switched to 
one, whereas in the current year, even one newspaper has become 
unaffordable to many. 
  Second, this subscription campaign indicated that 
everything in the domain of the press is upside down. 
Previously, the struggle for a large circulation was considered 
a matter of prestige in our country; it still is abroad. During 
the last subscription campaign, many editorial offices abandoned 
the chase after circulation: After all, the greater the 
circulation of a newspaper, the more difficult the life of the 
editorial office is and the greater the losses that await it in 
the near future. At present, there are virtually no profitable 
newspapers. I see nothing strange about the circulation of 
newspapers dropping yet again. Even the state press, which 
exists mainly thanks to the state budget, cannot withstand the 
current price gouging. Newspapers of the type of FINANSOVYY 
KIYEV and RYNOCHNAYA PLOSHCHAD, which at one time lured citizens 
by supposedly being free, have announced subscriptions and put 
themselves on the same footing as others. 
  Third, despite the high prices for periodicals and 
everything else, the impoverishment of the people, and 
competition from free television and radio, citizens of Ukraine 
have displayed their high intellectual standards, considerable 
spiritual needs, and, in addition, their civic awareness: The 
results of the subscription campaign were more favorable then 
could be expected. SILSKI VISTI has secured a large circulation 
by the standards of this time, 312,000 copies, thus 
demonstrating yet again the stability of the only nationwide 
newspaper for rural areas. HOLOS UKRAYINY got 205,000 copies, 
URYADOVYY KURYER--182,000 copies, MOLOD UKRAYINY--70,000 copies, 
NEZAVISIMOST--55,000 copies, UKRAYINA MOLODA--81,000 copies, 
PRAVDA UKRAYINY--79,000 copies, and LITERATURNA UKRAYINA--27,000 
copies. An insanely impudent and expensive advertising campaign 
notwithstanding, KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI failed to retain its 
circulation generated by scandal features, but nonetheless got 
subscriptions for 150,000 copies, which proves yet again that 
there is a social need for such a newspaper, too. 
  Just as the editorial office had planned, VECHIRNIY KYYIV 
reached the intended circulation, between 40,000 and 45,000 
copies, together with some retail sales. We are not able to 
"hack" a greater circulation in the environment of an economic 
crisis. For this reason, we were forced to give up the 
Russian-language edition; we are grateful that the majority of 
readers perceive this step with understanding. However, our 
subscribers had an opportunity to ascertain one thing: The 
editorial office has done everything possible to meet its 
obligations to the readers. As had been promised, we did not 
charge additional subscription fees in the middle of the year 
and did not reduce the size or frequency of publication of the 
newspaper. We published five times per week at a time when some 
five-day newspapers became weeklies. Our readers are receiving 
all the 250 issues of VECHIRNIY KYYIV due to them annually. We 
are also planning to publish the newspaper five times a week in 
the coming year. We have helped our low-income subscribers as 
best we could by establishing a charitable foundation and 
helping them to obtain subscriptions for the next year. 
  What does the next year, the Year of the Dog, hold in store 
for the press? Figuratively, ours will be the life of dogs. The 
state publishing house--for the nth time!--has increased prices 
for printing services, and the Central Post Office of Kiev is 
counting on tripling (!?) the fees for delivering the press in 
the second quarter. Prices for newsprint (which is delivered 
exclusively from Russia) will hardly stabilize; even now, these 
prices reach world levels. 
  How will the press survive under such conditions? The state 
press will be sustained from the state budget, that is, at our 
expense, regardless of whether we want this or not. The press of 
commercial structures will depend on how thick the wallets of 
their masters are: There is nothing to be done--such is the law 
of the market. The independent press, i.e., such that does not 
serve the power structure, does not have owners and does not 
want to have them, and that in which labor or journalist 
collectives act as founders--such a press has nobody to attach 
its hopes to, except the likewise impoverished readers. The 
authorities will hardly help this press, because it sticks in 
its craw. However, one thing is clear: The day on which the last 
independent newspaper goes down in Ukraine will be the beginning 
of the end for democracy. Actually, the offensive of the current 
power structure against openness and democracy and their 
embodiment, the mass media, has already begun. Live broadcasting 
of the meetings of the Supreme Council sessions has been 
suspended on the ridiculous pretext of ensuring an equal footing 
for candidates for deputy; TV commentators now assure us through 
the lips of their masters that the session is proceeding in a 
clear-cut and fine manner. The minister of the Armed Forces of 
Ukraine has forbidden officers to write in the civilian press if 
the topics of these presentations transcend the confines of the 
military statute. Strange things are happening at our 
degenerating television: Reassignments in the top leadership 
echelon are not aimed at a fundamental improvement in 
programming, but rather at the reliability of the censorship 
screen--God forbid that some unsanctioned thought should get 
through. So a television person is assigned to manage radio 
broadcasting, and a radio person is transplanted to television; 
neither one knows the new business perfectly. Ideas are hatched 
instead about suspending the relay of radio broadcasts to the 
Kiev area on the city network, thus driving a wedge into the 
relationship between urban and rural, areas which is not ideal 
to begin with. The youth studio Hart is instead being hampered, 
and episodes that criticize the policy of the current 
authorities are not being allowed on the air. A familiar 
situation, is it not? 
  Add to this the fact that, contrary to the law that bans the 
censorship of the mass media, structures of the former 
censorship department that was invented by the Communist Party 
in its time still survive in our country; of course, they are 
being sustained from the budget. Who needs this? Does someone 
believe that a time will come when this organ for smothering 
free thought will be needed? This is a purely rhetorical 
question. 
  Nonetheless, let us be optimistic. Our society has already 
matured to such a stage as to not allow the winding-down of 
democracy. We have entered the wide world, and there no longer 
is at present--nor, one hopes, will there ever be--an iron 
curtain separating us from the world and the world from us. Let 
us in unison oppose the offensive against glasnost in every way 
we can. We will not let them tighten the noose around the neck 
of the independent press. Support the press morally, 
organizationally, and, those of you who can do it, also 
financially, and the press will become a mighty weapon of the 
society in the struggle for the assertion of democracy.

the performance of state service (Article 23 of this Law); 
  4) the resignation of state employees who hold positions in 
categories one or two (Article 31 of this Law); 
  5) the ascertainment or appearance of circumstances that 
keep 
a state employee from being in state service (Article 12 of this 
Law); 
  6) the refusal of a state employee to take the Oath or a 
violation of it, as envisaged by Article 17 of this Law; 
  7) the failure to submit, or the submission of incorrect, 
information by a state employee pertaining to his income, as 
envisaged in Article 13 of this Law. 
  A change in the heads or composition of state bodies cannot 
be grounds for the curtailment of state service by a state 
employee in his post at the initiative of newly designated 
heads, aside from state employees in patronage service. 
  State employees who have occupied a category one position 
for 
no less than three years and have been dismissed in connection 
with a change in the composition of the body where they were 
working, or the end of the term of authority of that body, 
retain their average monthly pay for the period of job search, 
but not for more than one year. 
  Article 31. Resignation of a state employee 
  Resignation is the curtailment of state service by an 
employee who holds a position in categories one or two, by his 
written request. 
  Grounds for resignation are: 
  --a fundamental disagreement with the decision of a state 
body or official, as well as ethical impediments to being in 
state service; 
  --the forcing of a state employee to fulfill the decision of 
a state body or official that contradicts prevailing 
legislation, which could cause significant material or moral 
harm to the state, enterprises, institutions, organizations or 
associations of citizens or a citizen; 
  --a state of health that impedes the exercise of official 
authority (with the presence of medical findings). 
  A resignation is accepted, or a well-founded refusal is 
given, by the state body or official that named the state 
employee to that position. The decision to accept a resignation 
or refusal of it is made within a month's time. A state employee 
shall continue to fulfill his official duties in the case of a 
refusal of his resignation, and has the right to discharge under 
the procedure stipulated by the Code of Labor Laws of Ukraine. 
  In a case of the resignation of a state employee who has not 
reached pension age, but has sufficient time of service for the 
granting of a pension (25 years for men and 20 for women) and 
has worked in category one or two positions for no less than 
five years, he is paid 85 percent of his official salary monthly 
with allowance for additional payments for grade and for time 
served until he reaches pension age. 
  A state employee who is retired, upon attaining pension age, 
is granted a pension as a state employee. 
  In the case of the granting of an age-based pension, the 
finding of a job or conviction for committing a crime, the 
payments stipulated in Part Four of this Article are curtailed. 
  Article 32. Appeal of a decision to curtail state 
service 
  A decision to curtail state service may be appealed by a 
state employee directly in the courts.

<H6>  Material and Social Support for State Employees </H6>
  Article 33. Pay 
  The pay of state employees shall provide for sufficient 
material conditions for the independent performance of official 
duties, facilitate the staffing of the apparatus of state bodies 
with competent and experienced personnel, and provide incentives 
for their conscientious work with initiative. 
  The pay of state employees comprises salaries, bonuses, 
additional payments for grade, supplements for time in state 
service and other supplements. 
  The salaries of state employees are established depending on 
the difficulty and level of responsibility of the official 
duties they perform. 
  Additional payments for grade are made according to the

than 3 years--10 percent, more than 5 years--15 percent, more 
than 10 years--20 percent, more than 15 years--25 percent, more 
than 20 years--30 percent, and more than 25 years--40 percent.

results in their work and the performance of especially 
important work, additional payments for the performance of 
duties of temporarily absent employees and other supplements and 
additional payments, as well as the granting of material 
assistance to resolve social and domestic issues. 
  The terms for the pay of state employees, the amounts of 
their salaries, supplements, additional payments and material 
assistance are stipulated by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. 
  The source for the formation of the pay allocation for state 
employees is the State Budget of Ukraine. 
  A cutback in state appropriations cannot be grounds for a 
reduction in salaries, supplements to them or the financing of 
other guarantees, benefits and compensations as envisaged by 
this Law. 
  Article 34. Incentives for conscientious work 
  State employees are given monetary remuneration in an 
amount, 
and under the procedure, established by the Cabinet of Ministers 
of Ukraine for conscientious, uninterrupted work at state bodies 
and the exemplary performance of their labor duties.

conferring of honorary titles for special labor merit. 
  Article 35. Annual and additional vacations of 
state employees 
  State employees are granted an annual vacation of 30 
calendar 
days, if a longer vacation is not stipulated by legislation, 
with the payment of health assistance in the amount of their 
salary.

legislation, for individual and cooperative housing construction 
or for the acquisition of apartments or individual residential 
housing. The terms for the granting of credit are established by 
the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. 
  State employees and the members of their families who are 
living with them enjoy free medical care at state health-care 
institutions under established procedure. They are supported by 
the same institutions after retirement.

the 
legislation of Ukraine, with overall labor service of no less 
than 25 years for men and 20 years for women, including state

pensions for state employees. These individuals are granted 
pensions in the amount of 80 percent of their (official) salary, 
with allowance for the supplements envisaged by this Law and 
without restriction on the maximum size of the pension. 
  The pension is paid to the state employee in the full 
amount, 
regardless of his earnings (or profits) received after

<F P=106> [Text of speech delivered by President Leonid Kravchuk of </F>
Ukraine at the second session of the Parliamentary Assembly of 
Member States of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization 
held in Kiev; date not given] 
  [Text] Esteemed ladies and gentlemen! 
  I sincerely welcome you to ancient Kiev in the hospitable 
land of Ukraine. I am confident that today's meeting will play 
an important role in strengthening relations and promoting 
greater understanding understanding among the countries of the 
Black Sea region. 
  I am especially pleased that Ukraine was chosen as the site 
of the second session of the Parliamentary Assembly of Member 
States of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization. This 
event is of truly symbolic significance to our country, because 
tomorrow marks the second anniversary of the day when the Act of 
Proclamation of the Independence of Ukraine was ratified by a 
national referendum. Despite the shortness of the period during 
which we have been building our statehood and setting our own 
foreign policy course, the process by which Ukraine has gained 
international recognition as an independent state and joined the 
world community of nations as an equal is now virtually complete. 
  In July of this year, the Ukrainian Parliament approved the 
"Principal Directions of Ukraine's Foreign Policy"--a document 
that sets forth the fundamental national interests of our 
country, the goals of our foreign policy, and the principles 
underlying this policy. These principles are based on the 
universally recognized norms and principles of international 
law, the UN Charter, the Helsinki Final Act, and the Paris 
Charter for the new Europe. 
  Our foreign policy is based on pursuing an open foreign 
policy and a desire to cooperate with all interested states. We 
are building our bilateral and multilateral relations with other 
countries and international organizations on the principles of 
voluntarism, mutual understanding, equality, mutual respect, and 
noninterference in domestic affairs. Ukraine also adheres to the 
principle of the indivisibility of international peace and 
international security and believes that a threat to the 
security of any one state carries with it a threat to 
international security as a whole. Our country's approach in 
foreign policy is "security for Ukraine through security for 
all." 
  One of the key principles of Ukraine's foreign policy is our 
desire to attain nonnuclear status in the future. Recently the 
Supreme Council took a step forward in this direction, although 
I am convinced that this was only the first step and that we 
must return to this issue. 
  Our policy must be consistent and predictable. To make this 
possible, apart from all else, we need the support of the 
world's countries, understanding of our difficult situation, and 
assistance in "clearing away the impediments" that were created 
when the USSR collapsed, including those involving nuclear arms. 
  We emphasize: in following the path of nuclear disarmament, 
Ukraine expects to receive national security guarantees from the 
U.S., Russia, and other nuclear states, as well as the financial 
and other assistance that we need to destroy our nuclear 
weapons. These are not conditions, as some would like to portray 
them, but a foundation without which the actual process of 
destroying nuclear weapons may become complicated. We simply do 
not have the money for this. Our economic situation is 
difficult. We look upon our nuclear arms not as weapons but as 
material assets and ask for compensation. I consider this to be 
a normal demand. 
  The decision of the Supreme Council confirms that Ukraine's 
policy to attain nonnuclear status remains unchanged, and all 
the Supreme Council's earlier decisions on this issue remain in 
force. 
  This is the most important thing. We have to move forward, 
based on today's circumstances, focusing our attention not only 
on criticism of the Supreme Council's decision, but also on 
constructive actions. 
  This will produce profitable results and open up the way to 
new steps in nuclear disarmament. I believe that this unchanging 
position will enable us to find a solution that will serve the 
interests of the Ukrainian people, those of the world community, 
and the goal of the total elimination of nuclear weapons in the 
world. 
  Esteemed guests and participants in the session! 
  Ukraine is interested in developing mutually advantageous 
bilateral relations with other countries and in expanding her 
role in regional cooperation and in the work of the United 
Nations and of other international organizations of a universal 
nature. 
  In our opinion, Ukraine's geopolitical location, the long 
history and cultural traditions of her people, her rich natural 
resources, and her large economic, scientific-technical, and 
intellectual potential not only allow Ukraine to view a European 
orientation as paramount in her foreign policy, but also to play 
an important role in safeguarding Europe's political and 
economic stability. 
  Having a deep-seated sense of herself as a European state, 
Ukraine wants to move as fast as possible "to build strong 
bridges" of cooperation with the countries along the entire 
perimeter of her borders. 
  It is a universally recognized truth that the international 
position of any state is judged primarily by the relations that 
it enjoys with its neighbors. That is why we have taken an 
unequivocal stand on this matter: we regard all of Ukraine's 
neighbors as priority partners. 
  An important component of this approach is regional and 
subregional cooperation. It is quite natural and essential in 
international relations to look for points of convergence and 
common interests with close neighbors, in particular with the 
kind of neighbors that the countries of the Black Sea region 
are. The notion of an opening to the sea as a country's "window" 
in one direction or another has now become commonplace. For 
Ukraine, the Black Sea serves as such an opening to the 
Mediterranean region, the Near East, and North Africa, not to 
mention the states of the Black Sea region. 
  Ukraine--and it gives me great pleasure to underscore 
this--was one of the initiators of the creation of the Black Sea 
Economic Cooperation Organization. The history of relations 
between countries in this region is measured not in years but in 
centuries. Since the earliest history of the Pontus Euxinus, or 
the "Hospitable Sea" as our ancestors called the Black Sea, 
there have been close and vigorous trade links and friendly 
relations among the peoples living along its coasts. Of course, 
there have also been difficult periods, but the wars and 
conflicts always passed and were followed by periods of peaceful 
cooperation. 
  Today, as never before, there exist exceptionally favorable 
conditions for the countries of this region to develop mutually 
advantageous cooperation in all spheres of interstate relations. 
By coordinating our efforts towards this end, we can transform 
the Black Sea region into an important area of cooperation in 
the new Europe. 
  In today's difficult times, when crisis phenomena in the 
economies of many countries are being exacerbated by domestic 
political conflicts or even armed hostilities, coordinated 
actions, support, and mutual assistance are especially 
important. We need to keep strengthening the ties that evolved 
over the centuries in the Black Sea region and developing them 
on a new basis that takes into account the new historical 
realities. 
  We are very interested in developing friendly relations and 
close cooperation with the countries of the Black Sea region. It 
is Ukraine's position that the realization of the plan to 
transform the Black Sea into a zone of peace and multilateral 
economic cooperation will in a short time create conditions 
conducive to expanding mutually advantageous relations in such 
areas as sea transport, the development of the fuel and energy 
and the agroindustrial complexes, health care, and the 
pharmaceuticals, food, and processing industries. 
  In our view, the progressive growth of multilateral economic 
cooperation in the Black Sea region will create the most 
favorable conditions for establishing a Black Sea foreign trade 
and investment bank. We should make an immediate start at 
further institutionalizing this cooperation, establishing 
permanent commissions and working groups to resolve various 
important issues. 
  To promote the expansion of political and economic relations 
within the framework of the Istambul Declaration we need to work 
out an additional contractual and legal basis for multilateral 
economic cooperation aimed at fostering broad trade and economic 
links, the growth of entrepreneurship and business ties at the 
state level by making possible the free movement of goods and 
services. The Black Sea is already a zone that is free of 
nuclear weapons. The reduction of military activity by the 
countries of this region could be the next positive step towards 
creating a zone of peace, stability, and prosperity along the 
Black Sea coast. Unfortunately, today the waves of the Black Sea 
also carry human blood that is being shed along its shores. 
  The wider the horizons of cooperation within the framework 
of 
the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization become--in terms 
of economic relations, parliamentary contacts, cooperation in 
the sphere of culture--the less tolerance there will be for the 
existence of "hot spots" in this region. Our common and 
paramount goal is to put an end to the terrible advance of war. 
  Expanding economic cooperation in the Black Sea zone is the 
most effective means of strengthening trust among the countries 
of the Black Sea basin. The development of commercial and 
economic ties, increasing investments in the economies of 
neighboring countries, establishing the most favorable possible 
regimes for trade, and participating in joint economic projects 
will promote increased economic interdependence among states, 
thereby objectively reducing the threat of potentially new 
conflicts among them involving the use of military force. 
  At the same time, the expansion of mutually advantageous 
bilateral and multilateral economic relations is being hampered 
by the fact that the Black Sea zone of economic cooperation is 
still a zone of military conflicts. In those places where blood 
is being shed, other, so far unresolved, problems in the 
bilateral relations of a number of countries, including the 
inviolability of borders, pose a potential threat to peace and 
stability in the region. 
  Given the military hostilities that are continuing inside 
some countries or between countries, as well as the tension that 
remains in the relations between some neighboring states, the 
growth of military activity in the Black Sea and its coastal 
regions is cause for grave concern. Recognizing that economic 
cooperation is not possible unless a climate of trust is 
established among the member states of the Black Sea Economic 
Cooperation zone and stability and security in the region are 
assured, Ukraine proposes implementing the following measures to 
build trust in the military and political spheres: 
  If this formula is accepted, the necessary details can be 
worked out: 
  1. That provisions for holding naval exercises be worked out 
with a view to reducing them, as well as reducing the number of 
military vessels in peacetime, thereby helping to reduce 
hostilities. 
  2. That a declaration on the sanctity and inviolability of 
the sea borders of the countries in this basin be adopted. 
  3. That the countries of the Black Sea region sign a 
memorandum renouncing the use of naval forces, either directly 
or in other ways, against one another. 
  4. That the countries of the Black Sea basin adopt a 
declaration committing them to refuse the use of their territory 
for acts of aggression or subversion against other Black Sea 
states. 
  The above is only an outline of our initiative. We are 
prepared to join in working out the details of this proposal, 
taking into account the interests of all interested states. What 
is needed is joint action and collective wisdom. 
  [I would also like to deal with] another issue. There is an 
increasingly urgent need, in my view, to concretize an 
environmental policy in Black Sea cooperation. It is 
exceptionally important to work out a convention on protecting 
the Black Sea from pollution. This convention should cover a 
wide range of issues with respect to improving the ecological 
state of the Black Sea and utilizing and developing the 
bioproductive potential of this body of water. 
  For Ukraine, with her first-hand experience of a real 
ecological disaster resulting from the Chernobyl catastrophe, 
the establishment of environmental safety guarantees and the 
implementation of a plan to improve the quality of the 
environment are "vital issues" in the full sense of the term. 
The Mediterranean countries, too, have directed their efforts at 
improving the environment by their recent adoption of a number 
of joint measures designed to accomplish this goal. If we 
consider that the Mediterranean and Black seas comprise a single 
natural organism, the need for ecological cooperation becomes 
obvious. 
  Esteemed participants in the session! 
  I have already stated that the ancient name for the Black 
Sea 
was Pontus Euxinus. But legend has it that it was also known by 
another name, Pontus Axenos, which means the "Inhospitable Sea." 
That was the name given it by those who came to its shores by 
force and with evil intent. 
  I believe that productive cooperation among the peoples of 
the countries of the Black Sea region is the best guarantee of 
this sea always being hospitable to them. 
  Allow me to welcome you once again at the start of this 
forum 
and to wish you success. 
  Thank you for your attention.

<F P=106> [Presentation by Ukrainian President L.M. Kravchuk at the </F>
Center for Cadre Skill Improvement of the Institute of State 
Government and Self-Government of the Cabinet of Ministers of 
Ukraine; no date given: "We Are Working With More Than One Day 
in Mind"] 
  [Text] It is good that we met at this difficult, even 
extremely complicated time for Ukraine in order to ponder 
together problems that need to be solved, noted the president. 
First of all, these are socioeconomic issues and joint actions, 
our position on elections. 
  We predicted that crisis phenomena would occur inevitably if 
there were to be the partition of states and reforms in society. 
However, we did not imagine the entire scope of the crisis. 
  Among the reasons for the current difficult situation, there 
are domestic reasons that include structural changes in 
industry, the establishment of new relations between enterprises 
within Ukraine, and reforms in the financial, banking, and 
credit systems. Of course, we do not have either a precise 
program, or an adequate number of persons capable of effecting 
profound transformations. After all, this is not just about the 
professional qualifications of people but about fundamentally 
new approaches and a new system of actions. This requires time, 
reinterpretation, and retraining. 
  External factors--they frequently say that, supposedly, 
Ukraine is some kind of a recalcitrant fellow who triggered the 
processes of economic breakup. Supposedly, this is one of the 
main reasons why the crisis has become deeper, and so on. I do 
not disclaim my responsibility and that of the government and 
other power structures for not acting precisely and consistently 
at all times. However, it is a mistake to believe that the cause 
of the crisis is solely in severing the relations. This prevents 
people from taking more resolute and persistent steps in order 
to find one solution or another here, in Ukraine, rather than 
sit on the ramparts as Yaroslavna and lament the severance of 
relations. 
  I do not want this to be immediately perceived as 
interference in Russia's domestic processes, but you see that 
plants are being stopped there--tractor and combined harvester 
plants, cotton mills. The question is--are we the reason for 
that? Difficult processes are underway in both Ukraine and 
Russia. 
  There are people who say: Let us quickly get back together, 
and everything will fall into place: Sausage will be cheap, and 
everything will be problem-free. Perhaps those who talk about 
this desire to restore everything the way it was: "centralized," 
"administrative," and "power of the united force," and so on. Is 
this possible? It is impossible. Everybody knows this well, but 
instead of somehow persuading the people to think and act 
realistically, certain leaders and the mass media follow the 
path of least resistance, playing along to the mood of some 
people. 
  However, there also are examples to the contrary. For 
example, the Zaporozhye Motorsich plant established relations 
with Russia--nobody forbade it to them--and is now operating in 
a stable manner. The director of this plant, Bohuslayev, said 
correctly as he reported to the congress of industrialists that 
we should now find direct relations and integrate at the level 
of enterprises and collectives. 
  I see a strange picture. I receive telegrams: Give us money, 
do this, open that. What is this, a civilized state? Is it the 
function of the president to be a patron of all structures with 
regard to material-technical supplies? 
  I would like to agree with you about one issue, without 
analyzing the entire set of problems. How are we to come 
together so as not to divide now into those who are to blame and 
those who are not? 
  I am giving you the numbers. The total amount of 
expenditures 
from the state budget during nine months of this year came to 
almost 15 trillion karbovantsy. This exceeded revenues by more 
than 5 trillion. Meanwhile, 983 billion were approved for the 
year, let us say, 1 trillion. How is it possible to keep 
increasing expenditures without increasing the revenue side of 
the budget? Of course, it is possible if the printing press 
operates and continues to put into circulation money that is not 
backed up with anything. However, in a month to 1.5 months, ruin 
would be inevitable. 
  Ways to replenish the budget should be found promptly; the 
tax service should be resolutely put in order. For this I appeal 
directly to you. The tax service should work together with 
organs that are involved in this and with administrations, and 
mobilize revenues to all levels of the budget on the basis of 
law and order. We will simply not survive otherwise. 
  I will resolutely support you in putting the tax system in 
order, stopping the shipment of goods out of the country, and 
fighting corruption and crime. 
  I would like to once again revisit the question of prices. 
We 
did not have an opportunity to not raise prices, but there 
should be correspondence between them and remuneration for 
labor. However, there is a nuance: If production falls, and 
labor productivity falls, whereas wages increase, this is a 
purely inflationary process. To prevent a slump in production is 
the only possible way to stop the impoverishment of the people 
and improve their welfare. Giving the producer freedom is the 
only way to do this. I have proceeded to grant greater rights to 
regions. This has to do first of all with economic rights and 
freedoms and liberalization of government at the level of 
regions. We will also proceed to give the collectives the right 
to manage the resources that they have and that they are earning. 
  Intimidating the people with a mafia that is grabbing 
everything through privatization amounts to deliberately 
promoting tension in our society in order to stop privatization 
and conversion to joint-stock operations, because a plant that 
is given to its collective through conversion to joint-stock 
format operates to benefit the Ukrainian economy. The task of 
the state is to create external conditions for the development 
of production. Customs duties, taxes, price regulators, and 
wages should be effective. All of this is provided by the state, 
and the rest by the collective. That is, I would like us to 
agree in this critical period in the life of our state that 
Ukraine needs to survive economically. This will give us the 
power to take a step forward. Do we have grounds to say that we 
can survive? Definitely. However, everyone should act with 
initiative to this end. Had kolkhozes and sovkhozes failed to 
find sources of diesel fuel, lubricants, and gasoline on their 
own this year, I think that we would not have brought the crop 
in. Recently, representatives of collective farms have been 
approaching me; managers are asking for permission to sell 
products remaining on the farms and obtain in exchange diesel 
fuel, gasoline, and spare parts for spring work. At present, we 
should act as the situation warrants. If there are products and 
a farm wants to sell them in order to not take from the state 
but rather purchase on its own what it cannot get by without, 
this should be allowed. I am calling upon you to act accordingly 
in your localities. I do not see any other way, and I cannot 
guarantee that the state will collect foreign exchange and will 
be able to buy the necessary resources in a centralized manner 
and give them to agricultural producers. 
  Some people think to this day that there is a strategic 
course that was set forth in 1917, and some deviation from this 
course is now occurring which will end, and everything will 
return to the way it was. What will the final result of such a 
return be? It is blood. It is possible, after all, to analyze 
how the situation is developing and what outcome it may have. 
  In this regard, I would like to remind you of one 
comparison. 
At present, Finland, in which only five percent of the land is 
suitable for agricultural production feeds itself and has an 
opportunity to sell 30 percent of its products beyond the 
borders of the country. It is a civilized modern country with a 
high level of the culture of consumption, democracy, and 
protection of human rights. I will ask this question. Tell me 
please, had Finland remained within the great and omnipotent 
Soviet Union, would it now be what it is? It would be the way we 
now are. This is the first point. The second point: Give me the 
name of a single country of the former socialist system, of the 
former Soviet Union that is now on an equal footing with the 
highly developed countries of the world. 
  Would we now be facing this difficult situation had Ukraine 
been in 1991, when the Soviet Union disintegrated, at the level 
of economic development of, say, Japan or the United States, 
producing high-quality competitive products, and had it not been 
as it is in Ukrainian villages, whereby in Poltava Oblast alone, 
100,000 houses have thatch roofs and 30 percent of the schools 
are suitable for classes? Everything fell apart back then, and 
now old problems have become extremely acute. In this situation, 
accusations are being leveled against independence. You have got 
what you wanted, they say. 
  I do not understand how a statesman can say from the rostrum 
that the state that he represents is not needed and may not 
exist. Meanwhile, this sometimes happens to the sound of 
applause. He lives in this land and does not believe in this 
land, does not believe in the people, and does not want to be 
the owner. 
  Some of those who call themselves democrats have now stooped 
to one of them mounting the rostrum and saying: "Do not give 
them any loans, do not give them credit." Yet another hero came 
up and said: "Do not admit Ukraine to European structures 
because human rights are being violated here." That is to say, 
they spit upon and tear into themselves. They yell--we are for 
Ukraine, we will give the shirt off our backs for it. However, 
pardon the expression, they will keep the pants with a pocket 
for deposit. This is the kind of democrats they are. 
  Yesterday, I met with the parties. What disturbs you, of 
what 
do you accuse the president? The Supreme Council has passed an 
election law. So, proceed toward the election. If the Ukrainian 
people love you so much they will elect you. You will engage in 
politics, and I will be the first one to congratulate you on 
your election. I will never come to the podium, and will not 
lecture you after that, as some gentlemen do now. They sat in a 
chair over there, and worked and failed, and when they moved 
down--they are already in the opposition, they are already 
teaching how to work. I will never allow myself to do this 
because I have honor. This is a serious matter. We are choosing 
the progress of our state. We should unite. 
  I have thus come to the election. My point of view is as 
follows. The law on elections exists. We may criticize it yet 
again, we can see its shortcomings. There are shortcomings, but 
the law has been approved and signed. Elections should be held 
on the basis of this law. We should determine our tasks in 
implementing the law on elections. 
  First, it is monitoring compliance with this law; 
  second, it is ensuring equal rights for all candidates; 
  third, it is preventing the inflow of funds not envisioned 
by 
the law from other structures in order to use them to benefit 
individual persons. 
  Further on, I will ask questions. Can we restrict ourselves 
to just that and not be interested in intelligent, dedicated, 
moderate, honest, and principled people coming to the Supreme 
Council? Can we stand aside? 
  I believe that we cannot. As not only representatives of the 
president, but as citizens of our state, we may, want, and have 
the right to do so that precisely such people come to the 
parliament. At present, I am not segregating them by political 
coloring. We need new statesmen who are capable of ensuring 
economic, political, and diplomatic international authority of 
the state; people who are capable of pursuing a policy 
intelligently and carrying on friendship, cooperation, and 
partnership with our neighbors to both the east and the west: 
Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, 
Germany, and other countries. That is, we should ensure the 
normal life of Ukraine in a worldwide, European process while at 
the same time implementing domestic reforms step by step. 
  Voices are now being heard--what is to be done, say, if we 
do 
not elect a parliament? Some people suggest--let the president 
then take over everything. I would like to state my philosophy 
regarding this question here. Can this not bring about a 
dictatorship? If I apply this to myself, I think that I am no 
dictator. I will not allow this to happen. However, who can 
guarantee that another man will not come after me who will use 
authoritarian tendencies to the hilt? 
  I for one have confidence in B.N. Yeltsin. The Constitution 
that has been adopted in Russia gives extremely great powers to 
the president. I believe that Boris Nikolayevich will use these 
powers in the interest of Russia, Europe, and the world. 
However, can I say that after Yeltsin this Constitution will not 
be used by someone in a different direction? Is there a 
guarantee that it will not? Nobody will give you one. 
  I want to be understood. If we write a Constitution and talk 
about democracy, we should take steps that would safeguard the 
people against the cataclysms in the long run because the nature 
of each person is embodied in the law, and the law should be 
such that nobody could take advantage of it contrary to the 
interests of his own people and the world. 
  This is why I take a very cautious attitude toward such 
questions and such proposals. There should be counterbalances. I 
have had a lot of unpleasantness with the current parliament. I 
have, but I will tell you frankly and openly: The parliament is 
a counterbalance to possible steps that could have brought about 
a different interpretation, a different vision of democracy as 
such. In our evolving democracy, in our evolving state only a 
parliament may be such a counterbalance, along with other 
representative organs. And you are supposed, accordingly, to 
counterbalance them. So, the Constitution and legislation on the 
power structure are still imperfect here. However, this is not 
to say that we should reject the significance of the parliament. 
  Consequently, we have to do everything in order for 
elections 
to be held and for people to come to the parliament who are 
responsible for the state, for Ukraine. This is our main task. 
  Now about your personal participation in the election 
campaign. I will say frankly that anyone can nominate himself as 
a candidate for deputy. However, everyone must weigh what he is 
capable of and who he draws on. There are relevant clauses in 
the law but they do not rule out the opportunity to take part in 
an election campaign. 
  Our initiative should be based on law and the actual 
situation. The time before March is going to be extremely 
difficult. If we overcome inflation--and we should do this--if 
we overcome the drop in production, if we handle all economic 
problems and ensure the holding of elections, and elect a 
professional, responsible, and far-sighted parliament, believe 
me, this will be a very important step toward resolving upcoming 
problems, economic, political, and social alike. 
  What has the government done? It has prepared a 
privatization 
program that has been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. The 
government is now completing the drawing up of the budget and 
the social development plan. We want to give greater powers to 
regions and basic-level cities from the point of view of the 
sources of financing and taking advantage of realistic 
opportunities. A program for anti-inflationary measures has been 
approved. There is a program for the supply of energy resources 
to Ukraine during the winter-and-spring season. Work is now 
underway on arrangements for implementing the plan. 
  The documents that we have adopted are realistic for 
present-day conditions, and everything should be done in order 
for these conditions not to deteriorate. All programs will be 
carried out in this case. The programs in question are 
market-oriented, reformist programs; however, carrying them out 
will depend on us. 
  At this difficult time, I am calling on all of you to 
proceed 
from the fact that Ukraine is a state; it should be preserved. 
We have resources, we have potential; they should be used in the 
best way possible. Certainly, there were and there will be 
conflicts, and we will not get by without them. However, 
conflicts may not, should not bring about confrontation, 
intimidation, menace, strike threats, and so on. 
  I think that if someone goes for a strike and threatens an 
all-Ukrainian strike, it will be the last strike--the last 
organized strike, and after that a perpetual strike will come. 
It will no longer be necessary to organize because it will no 
longer be possible to return to the real concerns. All those who 
threaten a strike so actively should know and understand this. 
  A way out should be sought, especially for low-income 
individuals; persons with many children, the handicapped, 
retirees, those who need our specific assistance should be 
helped in every way at every opportunity. In turn, for those who 
can work, conditions should be created such that they will be 
able to work and have earnings. Believe me, I see no other way.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "From the Editorial </F>
Mailbag": "On the Labor Market. On the Progress of the 
Implementation of the State Program for the Employment of the 
Population in 1993"] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian Ministry of Labor has released 
information on the progress of the implementation of the State 
Program for the Employment of the Population in the nine months 
[as published] of 1993 which has been received from ministries 
and departments, the Council of Ministers of the Republic of 
Crimea, oblast state administrations, and the Kiev and 
Sevastopol city administrations. 
  The employment program envisioned the introduction of 
114,300 
new jobs in the current year. Actually, 70,700 units, or 61.8 
percent, were actually introduced during the nine months of this 
year. The program of job creation at enterprises of the private 
form of ownership was 154.3 percent fulfilled, of the mixed 
ownership form--115.1 percent fulfilled, of collective 
ownership--57.8 percent fulfilled, and of the state form of 
ownership--34.7 percent fulfilled. 
  Some 17,626.7 million karbovantsy has been allocated to 
create additional jobs from the state fund for facilitating the 
employment of the populace, and 53.8 million karbovantsy from 
the State Off-Budget Privatization Fund. The measures taken made 
it possible to place 150,700 people in jobs from among the 
nonemployed population during the reporting period, or 33 
percent, compared to 27.5 percent during the corresponding 
period of last year. 
  Considerable attention was paid to the job placement of 
citizens who are not capable of competing in the labor market on 
an equal footing and for whom 317,100 jobs were reserved this 
year within the 5-percent quota. 
  The sphere of labor use expanded in the reporting period 
owing to the organization of paid public works. Three times as 
many citizens as in the corresponding period of last year 
(11,200) took part in these works. More than 42 percent of the 
citizens who engaged in such works were unemployed. A total of 
306,700 man-days were put in at public works of all types, which 
exceeds this indicator for the period between January and 
September of last year by a factor of 2.4. 
  The invigoration of joint efforts by the Ministry of Labor, 
Ministry of Education, and the State Employment Center and the 
taking of organizational measures by them made it possible to 
increase considerably the volume of vocational training and 
retraining of laid-off employees and the nonemployed population. 
The Employment Service has signed cooperation agreements with 
more than 800 educational establishments. Between January and 
September of this year, 23,300 nonemployed citizens received 
instruction or underwent retraining. 
  Efforts are being made to ensure vocational retraining and 
to 
facilitate the adaptation of women and young people to the 
conditions of the new economic situation. In particular, the 
training of women has been organized at the school of 
entrepreneurs in the sector of small- and medium-size businesses 
at the Cadre Training Administration of the Ministry of Culture 
of Ukraine and the Institute for Skill Improvement of the 
Ministry of the Machine-Building Industry. Seminar training for 
women in fundamentals of business is being offered in Rovno, 
Kherson, Kharkov, and other oblasts. A total of more than 16,100 
women have been referred for vocational instruction since the 
beginning of the year. 
  Certain efforts have been made this year to organize the 
training of servicemen discharged from the military service in 
conjunction with strength or authorized complement reductions 
and not entitled to retirement pay. 
  Some 1,594.6 million karbovantsy has been spent for 
vocational training from the State Fund for Facilitating the 
Employment of the Population, of which 507.2 million karbovantsy 
was for the payment of scholarships. 
  Nonetheless there are still many shortcomings and unresolved 
issues in the area of vocational training and retraining. The 
main directions for further work on carrying out the State 
Program for the Employment of the Populace in this matter were 
set forth at a meeting of the collegium, which was held on 24 
November, of the Ukrainian Ministry of Education with the 
participation of representatives of the State Employment Center. 
In particular, it is envisioned to develop the Concept of 
Vocational Training and Retraining of the Nonemployed Adult 
Population, to establish an interdepartmental commission for the 
issues of vocational training and retraining, and to submit, for 
consideration by the leadership of the Ministry of Education and 
the Ministry of Labor, proposals for the establishment and 
organization of the work of model centers of professional 
training and retraining in the regions. 
  The scope of carrying out program measures over these nine 
months has been in line with the current condition of the labor 
market. 
  In Ukraine as a whole, the unemployment rate comes to 0.28 
percent of the able-bodied population of the working age. As of 
1 October of this year, a total of 78,700 unemployed were 
registered, which is 1.3 times more than on the same date last 
year. More than 75 percent of them are women. 
  The unemployment situation is the most acute in the western 
region of Ukraine, where 50.2 percent of all unemployed are 
concentrated. 
  Hidden unemployment persists on a considerable scale, just 
as 
it did in the first half of this year. In July through September 
of this year, 759,400 people, or 16.8 percent of the average 
number on the payroll, were on unpaid leaves of various duration 
(from two weeks to one month or more) at 5,988 enterprises 
surveyed by the employment service. 
  Reviewing the issue of the progress implementing the State 
Program for the Employment of the Population for 1993 at a 
meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine made it possible 
to bring the development of the material-technical facilities of 
the state employment service to the attention of the state 
administration.

<F P=106> [Interview with People's Deputy Viktor Pynzenyk by Yevheniya </F>
Romaniv, labelled as an exclusive interview under the rubric 
"The Economy"; place and date not given: " `Any Curved Line Is 
Shorter Than the Straight Line Leading Past a Superior' "--first 
paragraph is ZA VILNU UKRAYINU introduction] 
  [Text] Our ill-fated economy has been left in the lurch. 
Our legislators are busy fighting to retain their seats as 
deputies for another term, while our civil servants are taking 
advantage of the absence of controls to do as they please, 
leaving people to wonder whether they are really as incompetent 
with respect to the laws of economics as they appear or 
deliberately bent on utterly destroying the economy. This 
situation in Ukraine was the subject of our discussion with 
People's Deputy Viktor Pynzenyk. 
  [Romaniv] Mr. Pynzenyk, what do you think the government's 
next decision will be? 
  [Pynzenyk] When I was asked this question in Washington, I 
joked that it would be the nationalization of women. The point I 
was trying to make was that the present cabinet's actions are 
absolutely unpredictable. Take, for example, the telegram signed 
by Acting Deputy Prime Minister Yu. Zvyahilskyy and V. 
Yushchenko, the chairman of the board of directors of the 
National Bank of Ukraine, prohibiting banks from issuing 
credits. Imagine for a moment that the banks had actually 
carried out this directive--in reality, they had enough sense 
not to comply. Had they stopped issuing credits for even a week, 
production would have been completely paralyzed owing to a lack 
of working capital and the fact that it would have been 
impossible to obtain accounts receivable financing. Would the 
financial situation have improved as a result? There would have 
been a new jump in prices, an even greater shortage of goods, 
and a larger hole in the budget. This is not only the view from 
Lviv, the view of a professor and theoretician, as I am being 
called. In a recent speech in parliament, Mr. Melnyk, an 
industrialist who is the director of the Novomoskovsk pipe 
plant, described the government's actions as contributing to the 
collapse of the economy. But then every director and every 
worker will tell you the same thing. 
  [Romaniv] Do you intend to return to the government? 
  [Pynzenyk] Only if it works as a team. I have personal 
experience working in an ill-assorted cabinet. I had never 
imagined politics to be such a dirty business. I think that one 
of the government's problems is its poor relations with the 
deputies. Most deputies do not read the drafts of decisions; if 
these acts were explained to the deputies, they could be counted 
on to support them. Many matters in the Supreme Council are 
decided in the smoking room, but one has to be present there. 
Government officials need to come more often to the delegations 
and the parliamentarians to the government officials. 
  Many good decisions were passed while I was a member of the 
Cabinet of Ministers, but we were not able to supplement them 
and put in place the necessary mechanisms. As a result, some 
decrees proved ineffective. 
  [Romaniv] On the other hand, many of the government's other 
actions succeeded in doing their dirty work--they drove 
production into a blind alley. Given the authority, what would 
be the first things you would propose to improve the fundamental 
laws governing the economy? 
  [Pynzenyk] As you can see, the first not to survive the 
torture was the financial system--it virtually died. Reviving 
the state's economic organism requires an infusion of new blood. 
In economic terms, this means money. But the existing credit 
policy is not capable of curing the situation. Here is why: the 
banks offer an interest rate of 300 percent to enterprises and 
individuals on their deposits and extend loans at 600 percent. 
But do not rush to condemn them for setting overly high interest 
rates on credit. To borrow money at this rate, you also have to 
give the bank a good bribe. Let us do some calculating: I 
borrowed one billion karbovantsi and bought goods, the price of 
which increased 65-fold in a year. Thus, without doing anything, 
I have 65 billion karbovantsi. I repay the bank 7 billion 
officially (the one billion I borrowed and six billion in 
interest) and of the remaining profit of 58 billion, I give the 
bank something unofficially, either because we had a gentleman's 
agreement to that effect, or because I understand that business 
has to stay on good terms with such a wealthy outfit. Given this 
situation, why spend money investing in production when one can 
prosper engaging in such middleman operations? 
  Thus, the cheaper the price of credit from the National 
Bank, 
the greater the profits that sit in commercial banks and the 
faster the pace at which the business of speculation grows fat. 
What do we need to do to make such middleman operations less 
profitable? The interest rate on such credit must be the same as 
the rate of inflation. This will make it unprofitable for me to 
hold on to goods, because I will have to give back everything I 
make selling them in interest to the bank. This will also solve 
the financial problem, because funds will be saved and invested 
in the production sector. 
  I would also recommend that credits be issued mainly through 
auctions. And only when secured by property. The flaw in the 
command-sectorial allocation of finances is best described by 
the army expression that any curved line is shorter than the 
straight line leading past a superior. You know, when I was 
demonstratively resigning from the government, one official said 
to me in a conciliatory fashion: "If you want, we'll divide up 
the currency together." That is not what I want. Because 
whenever the dividing up is being done by a civil servant, 
something always sticks to his hands. There is always someone 
who must be accomodated first, always someone who wants much 
more and is prepared to split a portion of what he gets. 
Currency should be divided up by those who can afford to buy it. 
  But the market system of advancing credit will produce no 
results without free prices. There is no need to fear 
liberalizing them when credit flows are restricted. Why are 
people opposed to the liberalization of prices? Because they do 
not understand what this means. The prices of goods are rising 
because the flow of freshly printed money is not restricted in 
any way. Last year, for example, the money supply increased 
severalfold. When the printing of money is restricted, 
expenditures are also placed under control and prices stabilize 
as a result. If prices do not cover costs, bankruptcy ensues. 
This financial insolvency makes it necessary to change owners. 
  This brings us to privatization. This should be started--by 
force, if necessary. But as part of a package involving the 
destatization of the distribution of circulation and trade. This 
is especially important in the current conditions of 
hyperinflation. After all, the revaluations of goods are not 
producing the expected results, because large sums of money are 
moving from state to private pockets. A seller, knowing that the 
price of cigarettes will double tomorrow, will pay for them 
today and sell them tomorrow, pocketing the difference. As long 
as there are two pockets--one belonging to the state and the 
other to private individuals--trade will remain in disarray. 
Such machinations make no sense in a private store. 
  These are the problems on which I would like to work in 
parliament--I plan to run again in the coming election--as well 
as in the government, if it is a reformist and market-oriented 
government.

<F P=106> ["Decree of the Supreme Council of Ukraine: On Measures To </F>
Stabilize the Socioeconomic Situation in Ukraine"] 
  [Text] Having heard and discussed a report by Minister of 
the Economy of Ukraine R.V. Shpek on the implementation of 
proposals by people's deputies of Ukraine concerning additional 
measures to stabilize the socioeconomic situation in Ukraine as 
outlined in the appendix to Decree of the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine dated 17 December 1993 "On the Economic and Social 
Situation in Ukraine," the Supreme Council of Ukraine 
resolves:

  [Text] Nikolayev--Four large refrigerating trawlers will be 
turned over to fishermen of the Far East toward repayment of a 
proportion of the debt of Ukraine for natural gas to the Gazprom 
concern of the Russian Federation. The crews of these vessels 
are scheduled to arrive in Nikolayev shortly. The 
Ukrnefteprodukt association will refund the cost of the vessels 
in karbovantsy to the shipyard. This impressive barter operation 
between the two CIS states became possible as a result of 
negotiations initiated in Moscow and Kiev by specialists from 
the Black Sea Shipbuilding Plant. During the negotiations, 
opportunities for the delivery of a total of 15 trawlers with 
similar arrangements for mutual settlements was discussed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Oleksandr Stoyan, head, Federation of </F>
Ukrainian Trade Unions, by Volodymyr Oliynyk, correspondent: 
"Stoyan Does Not Believe in a Mass Strike, But He Does Believe 
in Cooperation Among All Trade Unions: A Timely Topic!"] 
  [Text] Protest actions by the trade unions comprised 
the subject of the following conversation between our 
correspondent and Oleksandr Stoyan, head of the Federation of 
Ukrainian Trade Unions. 
  [Oliynyk] Mr. Stoyan, could you tell us how the branches of 
government reacted to the recent protest actions by the trade 
unions? 
  [Stoyan] Let me remind you that these protest actions lasted 
for an entire week. They took the form of meetings, picketing 
the state administrative offices of the presidential 
representatives in various localities, and collecting signatures 
in opposition to the government's anti-social policy. At the 
same time, we were endeavoring to find a compromise with the 
government side. And such a meeting did take place. The 
government delegation was headed up by Acting Prime Minister 
Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, while our side was led by members of the 
Federation of Trade Unions Presidium and by leaders of those 
trade-union associations which do not belong to our Federation. 
  We set forth 11 specific demands. After a lengthy and 
difficult discussion during the ensuing week, the Cabinet of 
Ministers issued several responses. One of them proposed that a 
joint investigation be made--together with the trade unions--as 
to who had actually raised the prices. For the state had 
announced a two- or three-fold price hike, whereas, in fact, 
they rose three-, five- and even eight-fold. 
  Working groups were also created. In addition to this, the 
government sent commissions to 10 Ukrainian cities; thanks to 
their work, prices were lowered by 20-25 percent in some 
oblasts. We pushed our demands with regard to stabilizing 
production. One of the demands, which we had not succeeded in 
implementing for an entire year--and which consisted of revoking 
the penalty fines for overdrawing the consumption fund--was 
likewise met. 
  In parallel fashion we worked with deputies of the Supreme 
Council. In the first place, we found a common language with 
them. Whereas measures regarding stabilization of the 
socioeconomic situation in Ukraine were listened to attentively, 
a certain person proposed that this information be taken into 
account and the session continued. 
  However, most of the deputies listened closely to the 
telegram from the FPU [Federation of Ukrainian Trade Unions] 
concerning our decisive actions, along with telegrams from the 
localities which had been sent by the trade-union organizations. 
And under such pressure the Supreme Council set up and approved 
a commission. Because of the week's summaries of this 
commission's work and under pressure from the grass roots, the 
Supreme Council adopted the Decree "On Measures To Stabilize the 
Socioeconomic Situation in Ukraine." 
  [Oliynyk] As far as we know, this December decree by the 
Supreme Council encompassed all the demands made by the FPU. If 
that is so, is this the first serious victory by the FPU or--to 
put it more precisely--for those who are at or below the poverty 
level? 
  [Stoyan] Inasmuch as the Supreme Council's Decree is a law 
for the Cabinet of Ministers, the latter must now carry out its 
obligations in this regard. 
  Among other things, such obligations include the following: 
exempt enterprises and other institutions from the need to pay 
penalty fines for exceeding the consumption fund; revoke the 
telegram sent by the Cabinet of Ministers with regard to 
prohibiting banks from issuing any kinds of credits; work out a 
mechanism for aiding citizens in straitened circumstances. The 
matter of the government--together with the trade unions and the 
state administrations in the localities--introducing normative 
distribution of foodstuffs for the most harshly affected levels 
of the population is being looked into. Therefore, it can be 
said that the protests by the FPU and other trade unions have, 
for the first time, brought about a victory with regard to 
people's social protection. 
  [Oliynyk] Mr. Stoyan, what is your prognosis with regard to 
the strike activities at Ukrainian enterprises? 
  [Stoyan] The FPU is not calling for a strike. We are 
proceeding along a different path, a path of pressure, talks, 
and negotiations--a path of working together with all levels of 
the state power structure. 
  A strike is being called for by the Ukrainian Free Trade 
Unions. But everybody understands that their demands are 
unrealistic. Judge for yourselves: They are demanding wages 
which would raise the standard of living, but they do not want 
to think about where the money is to come from. They are 
threatening to stir up the people to strike on 18 January! 
Moreover, they are making the following political demands: 
resignation of the government, a new prime minister, and even 
resignation of the president. I don't know whether they will be 
able to rouse people by such slogans. People are already fed up 
with politics; what they really want is a real piece of bread. 
  Therefore, I am quite convinced that this is just one more 
bluff on the part of those trade unions which pay no attention 
to reality, but merely call for strikes. 
  [Oliynyk] Let's imagine that this "bluff"--as you call 
it--does indeed take place. Would the percentage of strikers be 
large? 
  [Stoyan] In my opinion, this percentage would be very small. 
Well now, there could be a certain number of miners; there could 
also be some transport workers and airline dispatchers. That is 
to say, such strikers would include those workers who belong to 
the Ukrainian Free Trade Unions. This would be quite a small 
percentage of the total. But I would not want even such a strike 
to take place because it is no longer our goal to tear down the 
state. We would do better to think about cooperating with it. 
  Incidentally, our demands were not for the purpose of 
tearing 
down the state, but instead we were working to improve 
production. Nor were we striving to extract subsidies--of which 
there are no longer any sources in any case. Even if such a 
strike were to take place, it would not have any influence. It 
could be only a political type of strike, a political game on 
the eve of the upcoming elections.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleksandr Pobihay, DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA </F>
special correspondent, under the "Foreign Assignment" rubric: 
"Ukraine-Tunisia: Bridges Spanning Centuries"] 
  [Text] Before my departure to Tunisia, I had the following 
dialogue with my three-year old grandson: 
  "Grandfather, where are you going?" 
  "To Africa." 
  "So will you see Barmaley [a fictional character in 
children's poetry--a savage who lived in Africa]?" 
  I did not venture to dispute this assumption. After all, it 
is known that the standard of awareness is equal to the standard 
of being informed. For my Sashok, Africa, according to Korney 
Chukovskiy, is so far associated with Aybolit and a gang of 
pirates, and for a representative of the older generation--at 
the very most, with the Days of Solidarity with the countries of 
the black continent which until recently were held at the 
highest state level. 
  As is known, it is not easy to debunk established 
stereotypes, even now that the "information boom" has overcome 
us. It has been said: Those who want, hear. Consequently, at the 
very least, a desire is needed. The wish to give the myths their 
due and to evaluate present-day realities does not develop until 
later. 
<H5>  "And the City Was Called Carthage...." </H5>
  For members of the first official delegation of Ukraine, the 
words of Guy de Maupassant--"In Tunisia, you find out for your 
yourself what history is"--materialized by way of unforgettable 
personal impressions, which confirmed the old truth: Seeing is 
believing.... 
  The imperishable linkage of times is traced here through 
ancient monuments and traditions, folk customs and names. The 
palace residence of President of Tunisia Zine El Abidine Ben 
Ali, where he held negotiations with L. Kravchuk, has the 
official name of "Carthage," which is derived from the 
city-state of Carthage founded 3,000 years ago on the North 
African coast of the Mediterranean Sea. This is also the name of 
a hall in the national gallery--the Bardo museum, which stands 
beside the Chamber of Deputies (the Tunisian parliament) and in 
which the most unique and the largest collection of ancient 
mosaics in the world is kept. In particular, its exhibits 
include the only depiction of Virgil, the author of the Aeneid, 
surrounded by mythical goddesses. 
  In that hall, I could not help recalling the lines from the 
Aeneid by I. Kotlyarevskyy, which I remembered from the time 
back in school: 
  "Dido lived in the city,/ and the city was named 
Carthage...." 
  To be sure, it is not known for certain where the 
"Ukrainized" Aeneas made landfall together with his company. 
However, as one of my colleagues joked, it is not ruled out that 
this happened at an old fort in the city of Hamamet, which our 
delegation visited. 
  We did not meet there the modern descendants of the 
"energetic fellow"; however, the hosts in this resort town 
clearly could not complain about a shortage of visitors. 
Everything suggested that the favorable Mediterranean climate 
and the high standard of the local "recreation industry" lure 
there numerous tourists from all continents. As we learned 
later, every year almost 4 million people visit Tunisia, whose 
coastal zone stretches over 1,500 kilometers. They are the ones 
who "contribute" the lion's share of revenues to the state 
treasury. 
<H5>  Thirty-Seven Years and Two Years </H5>
  It is best to learn about a so-far unknown country and its 
people through analogies and contrasts: On this point, they are 
the same as we are, and on that point, we are not similar. First 
of all, Ukraine and Tunisia share a similar historical lot, the 
main landmarks of which lie in the centuries of struggle for 
national liberation and the assertion of their own statehood. 
The Republic of Tunisia was proclaimed independent 37 years ago, 
and Ukraine--two years ago. 
  Just as in our country, the parliament and the president 
will 
be up for election next year. However, the political and 
economic situation in Tunisia gives no grounds for conclusions 
concerning possible radical changes. Existing government 
structures have been fruitfully cooperating with the 
constructive opposition, the emergence of which they themselves 
facilitated with a view to the democratization of society. If 
nothing else, the fact that the ban on the Communist Party, 
which for a long time had been operating illegally, was lifted 
in Tunisia testifies to this. 
  Evident favorable changes also occurred in the economy. 
Thanks to them and a balanced foreign policy, Tunisia is playing 
a leading role in cooperation between the states of northern 
Africa and southern Europe, and is respected in the Arab world 
and among the countries of the Maghreb. The headquarters of the 
Palestinian Liberation Organization is located here. 
  In evaluating the results of his official visit to Tunisia 
at 
a press conference, L. Kravchuk stressed that Ukraine views 
relations with that country as one of the priority directions in 
its African policy. This is facilitated by the proximity of 
Tunisia to our borders, its economic potential, and the place it 
occupies in the Mediterranean region, at a juncture of European, 
African, and Asian routes. 
  As we ascertained during the trip, the establishment of 
strong ties to the Republic of Tunisia has not only geopolitical 
but also promising economic significance for Ukraine. This is 
especially important at present, when our country is looking for 
partners in extensive, long-range cooperation. 
  Experts believe that Ukraine may deliver to Tunisia products 
of the metallurgical industry, machine and instrument building, 
shipbuilding, and farm machinery. We were told that Ukrainian 
specialists in the field of water management construction have 
been working there fruitfully for a long time, and have already 
built many facilities. However, at the same time we also learned 
that for almost 30 years, they have been doing all this work 
within the framework of agreements between the former USSR and 
Tunisia. Therefore, the funds that they have earned so far have 
gone, in particular, to Russia and to maintain its embassy. 
  V. Khorev, chairman of the State Committee of Ukraine for 
Water Management, said: "The situation is now changing 
fundamentally. We have concluded an agreement on cooperation in 
this sector and established a program for joint work until the 
year 2010." 
  Minister of Transportation O. Klympush signed, with his 
Tunisian opposite number, a government-to-government agreement 
on air transportation, which envisions the opening of air 
flights between the capitals of our countries, and also 
specifies flight rights through Tunisia to the countries of 
Africa and South America. 
  The business circles of the two countries also came to an 
understanding, reaching an agreement on cooperation between the 
Union of Entrepreneurs and Merchants of Tunisia and the Chamber 
of Commerce and Industry of Ukraine. Its chairman, O. 
Mykhaylychenko, informed journalists that an exhibition of 
Tunisian goods will be held in Kiev as early as March of next 
year. 
  Minister of Foreign Economic Relations of Ukraine A. 
Slepichev stressed: "Tunisia is one of the few partners of ours 
with which we have a positive balance of trade. Over nine 
months, exports from Ukraine exceeded imports from this country 
by almost $19 million. It is also noteworthy that the commercial 
and economic agreement between our countries envisions 
most-favored-nation treatment in partnership relations and the 
defense of investors of the two parties, and establishes forms 
of settlements both in freely convertible currencies and other 
forms of payment." 
<H5>  The Goal Dictates Deadlines </H5>
  The great scope of industrial and civilian construction is 
one of the characteristic features of Tunisia. For example, a 
new city that is called here a "21st-century city" is being 
built in the vicinity of its capital, at the location of the 
drained lake Buhayrat. Although it does not have all that many 
new buildings, one tends to believe that it will be built on 
time. 
  We also ascertained this during a visit to a new 
pharmaceutical plant in Tunis, which operates and continues to 
develop. The goal--to provide all necessary drugs for the 
country--dictates construction deadlines. 
  There are things for us to learn from the Tunisians. Having 
rid themselves of economic dependence upon other countries, they 
do not sever mutually advantageous relations with them. It is 
precisely on the principle of such mutual interest that a 
textile combine in the city of Sousse operates. State-of-the-art 
equipment for it was delivered from many European countries, and 
cotton is delivered from various regions of Asia and Africa. 
Such examples are many. Therefore, the standard of living of 
Tunisians is much higher than in other African states. On the 
average, the income of each resident of the country comes to 
$1,600 a year. This is not a great deal, but, as the saying 
goes, there are other indicators, too. 
  As they build a new country in Tunisia, Tunisians, by all 
signs, are well aware that they will not do without assistance 
from other states; hence the desire to cooperate with Ukraine. 
For example, at present more than 200 students from Tunisia 
study at our colleges. One of them, Qah La'wi Majid, a graduate 
of the Kiev Institute of Foreign Languages, accompanied us as a 
representative of the Tunisian Information Agency for 
international relations. He returned to the motherland two years 
ago with his wife, our fellow Ukrainian Olena Ustymenko. Their 
lot has been happier than that of the mythical Aeneas and the 
goddess Dido who founded Carthage. On the eve of our departure, 
Majid told us that an addition to his family is expected soon.... 
  Good luck to them, young representatives of the two friendly 
peoples who have embarked on the path of independence and 
cooperation. 
  FROM THE EDITORIAL OFFICE: We take this opportunity to 
express our profound gratitude for the hospitality and 
assistance given to journalists from Ukraine during their travel 
in the country by the staff of the Tunisian Information Agency 
for international relations. We hope that the experience of 
Tunisia, in particular of the Ministry of Information of that 
country in providing state support for the national press, will 
also become a subject of study and be borrowed by Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Report issued by the Economic Department of the Cabinet of </F>
Ministers of Ukraine under the rubric "The Economy": "The 
Economy of Ukraine in January--October 1993"] 
  [Text] The economic situation in Ukraine remains extremely 
critical. Industrial production is continuing to fall, the 
financial state of enterprises and organizations is worsening, 
Ukraine's state budget deficit is growing, and monetary emission 
is sharply rising, further exacerbating the economic crisis in 
the country. 
<H5>  EXECUTION OF THE BUDGET </H5>
  The state budget continues to be heavily burdened by 
inflation, which is causing the deficit to continue climbing 
sharply. This deficit is being financed with credit flows from 
the National Bank. 
  Consolidated budget revenues for 
January--September totalled 16,897 billion karbovantsi. The 
budget was supplemented by an additional 6,065 billion 
karbovantsi in bank credits used to finance the planned deficit 
and a number of other expenditures. Of this sum, 5,603 billion 
karbovantsi were credits issued by the National Bank and 760 
billion karbovantsi were issued by the Prominvestbank of Ukraine. 
  Value-added tax brought in 6,315 billion karbovantsi, 
profits 
tax from enterprises and organizations--4,398 billion, excise 
taxes--773 billion, personal income taxes--746 billion, 
contributions from enterprises and organizations to the Fund for 
Implementing Measures To Liquidate the ffects of the Chernobyl 
Catastrophe and To Provide Social Security for the 
Population--700 billion, and income from external economic 
activity--635 billion karbovantsi. 
  The mobilization of revenues into the budget is proceeding 
with difficulty: a substantial number of enterprises, 
organizations, and institutions, as well as private citizens, 
violate the tax laws, underreport their real income and profits, 
and fail to make payments into the budget in due time. Seventy 
percent of all taxpayers who have been audited were found to 
have violated the tax laws. 
  In January--September, late payments into the budget 
totalled 
1,334 billion karbovantsi. 
  During the nine months in question consolidated budget 
expenditures amounted to 20,544 billion karbovantsi. 
  In the execution of Ukraine's consolidated budget, 
expenditures exceeded revenues by 3,647 billion karbovantsi. 
  The state budget for January--September was 
executed in terms of revenues in the amount of 9,086 billion 
karbovantsi and in terms of expenditures, in the amount of 
13,699 billion karbovantsi. 
  Value-added tax brought in 3,308 billion karbovantsi, 
profits 
tax from enterprises and organizations--1,781 billion 
karbovantsi, and excise taxes--342 billion karbovantsi. 
  Outlays for social security measures totalled 1,239 billion; 
education, culture, health care, physical culture, and 
sports--897 billion; defense--979 billion; science--197 billion; 
and the national economy--3,749 billion karbovantsi. 
  Bank credit resources were used to extend 865 billion 
karbovantsi in loans to the Pension Fund for pension payments, 
270 billion karbovantsi for subsidies to the coal industry, 
2,578 billion for subsidies and price indexation in the 
agroindustrial complex, 750 billion for replacement of material 
reserves, and 1,601 billion karbovantsi for other measures. 
  These loans included, total expenditures in the state budget 
in the nine-month period amounted to 14,378 billion karbovantsi 
and exceeded revenues by 5,281 billion karbovantsi as against 
the approved budget deficitfor the year of 983 
billion karbovantsi. 
<H5>  EXTENSION OF CREDIT TO THE NATIONAL ECONOMY </H5>
  On 1 October, the amount of credit extended by 
Ukraine's banks (financial obligation on loans) totalled 37.9 
trillion karbovantsi, of which 7.5 trillion had been granted by 
the National Bank and 30.4 trillion by commercial banks. 
  Credit extended by branches of foreign commercial banks from 
former oviet states amounted to 73.5 billion karbovantsi. 
  During September, the amount of extended credit increased by 
9.1 trillion karbovantsi (32 percent), of which the amount 
extended by the National Bank grew by 1.5 trillion (25 percent) 
and the amount granted by commercial banks rose by 7.6 trillion 
(33 percent). At the beginning of October, commercial banks 
accounted for 80 percent of all credits as against 79 percent on 
1 September and 56 percent at the start of the year. 
  Increased borrowing from the National Bank was necessitated 
by the growing state budget deficit and the lack of funds in the 
Pension Fund for making pension payments. 
  The unstable economic situation and the high rate of 
inflation are causing a drop in the long-term credit that is 
being invested by commercial banks in economic growth. Compared 
with the beginning of the year, when long-term loans accounted 
for five percent of all loans, their share fell to two percent 
in September. 
  As of 1 October, the amount of credit issued by the National 
Bank for the refinancing of commercial banks was 9.1 
trillion karbovantsi (financial obligation on loans). Most of 
this amount (97 percent) had been granted to the Ukrayina Bank 
to be used in extending credit lines. 
  With the official settlement rate for commercial bank 
refinancing set at 240 percent, the actual interest rate in 
September rose to nearly the set level and amounted to 239.9 
percent as compared with 55 percent in August, chiefly because 
no preferential rates for refinancing commercial banks were 
offered in September. 
  Accordingly, the average interest rate on loans at 
commercial 
banks rose by 19.5 percentage points and amounted to 222.5 
percent as compared with 203 percent in August of this year. The 
maximum interest rate in September was 600 percent (480 percent 
in August), and the minimum rate was 5 percent (1 percent in 
August). 
<H5>  THE FINANCIAL STATE OF ENTERPRISES AND ORGANIZATIONS </H5>
  The total amount of interenterprise debt in the current year 
increased 21.7-fold (in September--93 percent) and on 1 October 
amounted to 48.3 trillion karbovantsi; loan debt increased 
19.7-fold (24.6 percent) and totalled 44.5 trillion karbovantsi. 
  Debts between enterprises and organizations in Ukraine 
and economic entities in countries making up the former 
USSR increased 32 percent in September and amounted to 3.4 
trillion karbovantsi at the beginning of October. During the 
same period, indebtedness to lenders fell 13 percent and 
totalled 7.5 trillion karbovantsi. Since the beginning of the 
year, loan debt has increased 22-fold and interenterprise debt 
eightfold. 
  Interenterprise and loan debt between enterprises and 
organizations inside Ukraine is growing. During 
January--September, interenterprise debt increased 25-fold 
(doubling in September) and at the beginning of October amounted 
to 44.9 trillion karbovantsi, while loan debt increased 19-fold 
(36 percent in September) and amounted to 37 trillion 
karbovantsi. 
  The amount of overdue interenterprise debt on clearing 
transactions and of overdue bank loans increased fourfold 
since the beginning of the year. Just in September, this amount 
rose nearly 33.3 percent and on 1 October totalled 1,761.4 
billion karbovantsi. Of this sum, 1,111.5 billion karbovantsi 
(63 percent) was debt on clearing transactions between 
enterprises and organizations, and 649.8 billion karbovantsi (37 
percent) was the amount in overdue payments on bank loans. 
<H5>  THE CURRENCY MARKET </H5>
  Due to a drop in the amounts of foreign currencies offered 
for sale at the Ukrainian Interbank Currency Exchange, the 
volume of sales of these currencies dropped significantly in 
September and the exchange rates of these currencies against the 
Ukrainian karbovanets rose accordingly. 
  Sales of U.S. dollars fell 22.2 percent compared with August 
and more than twofold compared with July. Sales of German marks 
fell 8-4-fold and 6.5-fold and of Russian rubles 1.9-fold and 
3.4-fold, respectively. 
  In October, the exchange rate of the karbovanets against 
foreign currencies continued to drop and by the end of the month 
amounted to 31,000 karbovantsi to one U.S. dollar (as compared 
with the official rate set by the National Bank of 5,970 
karbovantsi), 19,300 karbovantsi to one German mark (official 
rate--3,720.80 karbovantsi), 25 karbovantsi to one Russian ruble 
(official rate--5.61 karbovantsi), or 5.2-fold, 5.2-fold, and 
4.5-fold below the official rate, respectively. 
  In accordance with the president's edict "On Additional 
Measures To Improve Currency Controls" and as a way of promoting 
the development of the currency market and stabilizing the 
currency exchange rate, a recommendation was made to the 
National Bank to temporarily suspend currency auctions at the 
Ukrainian Interbank Currency Exchange. 
<H5>  PERFOMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL BRANCHES OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY </H5>
  Industrial output is continuing to decline. During 
January--October, the volume of goods produced fell 8.1 percent 
against the corresponding period of last year. Production 
volumes have dropped at more than half of all enterprises. The 
output of 130 of the 146 most essential kinds of industrial 
products has been reduced. 
  The situation in the oil refining industry remains 
critical. The volume of crude oil refined is continually 
decreasing. Since the beginning of the year, 20.3 million metric 
tons of crude oil have been refined, which represents a drop of 
40.9 percent as compared with last year. As a result, the 
production of gasoline fell 35.7 percent, diesel fuel--27.6 
percent, and furnace oil--41.7 percent. 
  Fuel supplies at electric power stations decreased 
significantly in October. Compared with last year, deliveries of 
gas fell to one-half of their previous level, coal deliveries 
dropped 22.5 percent, and only 7 percent of the planned amounts 
of furnace oil were delivered. 
  The financial status of energy enterprises is being further 
exacerbated by the disarray in settling accounts. In October, 
the amount owed by energy consumers grew from 384 billion to 561 
billion karbovantsi, while overdue payments for fuel by energy 
enterprises rose from 345 billion to 670 billion karbovantsi. 
  The harvesting of crops is nearly complete. By 8 
November, Ukraine's farms had threshed more than 41 million 
metric tons of grain (excluding corn), exceeding last year's 
figure by 5 million metric tons, or 14 percent. This increase 
was the result of a higher yield, which amounted to 34.6 
centners as compared with 29.9 centners last year. 
  According to Ministry of Agriculture and Food estimates, the 
gross yield of grain (including corn) is expected to reach 45 
million metric tons (weight after harvesting has been completed). 
  Other crops harvested include 35.2 million metric tons of 
sugar beets (22 percent more than last year), 2.9 million metric 
tons of potatoes (3 percent less than last year), and 2 million 
metric tons each of suflowers and vegetables (the same amounts 
as last year). 
  Still unharvested on 8 November were 6,200 hectares of sugar 
beets, 600 hectares of potatoes, 7,900 hectares of sunflowers, 
13,000 hectares of vegetables, and 159,500 hectares of corn for 
seed. 
  Fourteen million metric tons of grain crops (96 percent of 
the state order) were procured by the state. This 
amount exceeds the 1992 figure by 3.1 million metric tons. Farms 
in 16 oblasts executed the state order. 
  By 18 October, the state had purchased 534,400 metric tons 
of 
potatoes (30 percent less than last year), 1.1 million metric 
tons of vegetables (8 percent less), and 319,700 metric tons of 
fruit (2 percent less). 
  The decline in the output of livestock products is 
continuing. During the last 10 months, farms have produced 
2,180,100 metric tons of meat (live weight), which is 22 percent 
less than last year, 10,250,000 metric tons of milk (11 percent 
less), and 5,225.5 million eggs (18 percent less). 
  The state has procured 2,019,000 metric tons of meat (23 
percent less than for the same period last year), 9,473,000 
metric tons of milk (10 percent less), and 4,356 million eggs 
(15 percent less). 
  The state order for the procurement of cattle and poultry 
has 
been met 71 percent, for milk--89 percent, and for eggs--75 
percent. 
  During January--September of this year, the total volume of 
foreign trade turnover with former Soviet states 
amounted to 26.3 trillion karbovantsi, of which exports 
accounted for 8.5 trillion and imports for 17.8 trillion, 
producing a negative foreign trade balance in the amount of 9.3 
trillion karbovantsi (mainly as a result of the need to import 
natural gas, oil and oil products, polyethylene, lumber, cotton, 
rolled aluminum, and synthetic rubber). A negative trade balance 
exists with Russia (6 trillion karbovantsi), Turkmenistan (1.8 
trillion), Uzbekistan (1.2 trillion), as well as with 
Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Tajikistan, and 
Estonia. 
  In trade with other countries, exports exceeded imports in 
the amount of 4.7 trillion karbovantsi. 
  Since the beginning of the year, the average monthly 
wage of employees in the state sector rose 13-fold and 
amounted to 197,000 karbovantsi in September. Wages are lowest 
for employees in the public catering, culture, art, social 
security, agriculture, trade, housing services, public 
education, and health care sectors, where they range from 
124,000 to 169,000 karbovantsi (Supplement 3). 
  In September, the minimum wage (20,000 karbovantsi) amounted 
to only 10 percent and the minimum pension (40,000 karbovantsi) 
to only 19.9 percent of the cost of the minimum consumption 
budget. In October, after paying rent and public utilities, 
recipients of the minimum pension rate had only enough left to 
buy 250 grams of bread and 13 grams of cooked sausage per day or 
500 grams of bread and half a liter of milk. 
  The worsening economic situation in the country is 
accompanied by the rise of negative demographic 
trends. Compared with the same period last year, during 
January--September the number of births fell by 23,900, or 5.3 
percent; the birth rate per 1,000 dropped 0.6 percent. At the 
same time, the number of deaths rose by 30,200, or 5.8 percent; 
the population's death rate rose 0.7 percent. 
  The natural decrease in population amounted to 120,300 
persons, which represents an increase of 82 percent over the 
corresponding period of last year.

<F P=106> [Report by the Economic Administration of the Ukraine </F>
Cabinet of Ministers: "The Ukrainian Economy in January-November 
1993"] 
  [Text] At the end of the year, the economic situation 
in Ukraine remains extremely difficult. The total level of 
output continues to fall, the government budget deficit 
continues to increase and excessive emission of money goes on, 
leading to further deepening of the economic crisis in the 
country. 
<H5>  Implementation of the Budget </H5>
  Revenues of the consolidated budget for the 
January-October period amounted to K26.065 trillion. In 
addition, to cover the projected budget deficit and other 
budgetary expenditures, K8.465 trillion was borrowed from the 
National Bank of Ukraine. 
  Value-added taxes raised K9.212 trillion, taxes on revenues 
(profits) of enterprises and organizations K7.9 trillion, 
indirect taxes K1.132 trillion, individual income taxes K1.099 
trillion, contributions from enterprises and organizations to 
the Fund for the Implementation of Measures to Overcome the 
Consequences of the Chernobyl Disaster and for Social Security 
K1.087 trillion and revenues from foreign economic activities 
K960 billion. 
  Expenditures of the consolidated budget during 
January-October amounted to K28.947 trillion, of which K3.957 
trillion (or 13.7 percent of the total) was used for social 
security purposes, K6.423 trillion (22.2 percent) for social and 
cultural purposes and K6.317 trillion (21.8 percent) for the 
economy. 
  In the current year, support for enterprises and entities 
experiencing financial difficulties was effected by means of 
soft loans from the budget. During the first 10 months, K6.638 
trillion of such loans has been issued, including K1.065 
trillion to the Pension Fund and K4.978 trillion to the Ministry 
of the Agricultural Industry. 
  Spending on defense totaled K1.224 trillion, and on law 
enforcement K845 billion. The construction of housing for 
servicemen was funded with proceeds from the sale of military 
equipment, amounting to K86 billion. 
  The consolidated budget deficit totaled K2.882 trillion. 
  The government budget in January-October had 
revenues of K13.954 trillion and outlays of K18.817 trillion. 
<H5>  Lending in the Economy </H5>
  Total assets of Ukrainian banks (loans 
outstanding) at 1 November amounted to K44.8 trillion, including 
K9.9 trillion at the National Bank and K34.9 trillion at 
commercial banks. 
  Assets of affiliates of commercial banks from countries of 
the former USSR totaled K93.9 trillion. 
  In October, loans increased by K6.9 trillion, or 18 percent 
(compared to a K9.1 trillion, or 32 percent, rise in September); 
of these, National Bank loans rose by K2.4 trillion, or 32 
percent (compared to 25 percent in September), and commercial 
bank loans by K4.5 trillion, or 15 percent (33 percent in 
September). The share of commercial bank loans at the start of 
November was 78 percent, vs. 80 percent at 1 October and 56 
percent at the start of the year. 
  Of the total amount of loans at the National Bank, K9.5 
trillion, or 96 percent, were credits provided to Ukrainian 
government to cover its budget deficit and domestic government 
debt. 
  To finance commercial banks, the National Bank 
issued loans totaling K10 trillion since the start of the year, 
97 percent of which went to Ukrayna Bank to cover credit lines. 
During October, the volume of bank financing increased by 10 
percent. 
  Given that interest rates on commercial bank financing were 
240 percent, average interest rates during October were 94 
percent, due to soft credits provided mainly to Ukrayna Bank to 
cover loans to purchasing organizations and enterprises involved 
in processing agricultural products. 
  The average interest rate charged on commercial bank loans 
rose by 13.8 percentage points during October, to 246.3 percent, 
compared to 222.5 percent in September. The highest rate charged 
in October was 770 percent (480 percent in August and 600 
percent in September), while the lowest 2 percent (1 percent and 
5 percent, respectively, in August and September). 
<H5>  Inflationary Processes </H5>
  In the 12 months to November wholesale prices on 
industrial output rose 74 times, including on electric energy 
100 times, on construction materials 92 times, on machinery 79 
times, on petroleum products 73 times, on meat products 66 times 
and on dairy products 63 times. 
  In November, wholesale prices charged by industrial 
enterprises rose 1.3 times compared to the previous month, 
including on electric energy 2.4 times, on building materials 
1.5 times, on light industry products 1.6 times, on wood and 
paper products 1.8 times, on oil and chemical industry products 
1.7 times, on machinery 1.4 times and on food and dairy products 
1.2 times. 
  Agricultural prices rose 40 times in the past 12 
months, including on grain and oilseeds 77 times, on sugar beets 
42 times, on cattle and poultry 38 times, on milk and dairy 
products 39 times and on eggs 63 times. 
  Prices for construction and installation work rose 
in the 12 months to September 26 times, and 16 times from the 
end of last year. 
  It should be noted that the growth of wholesale prices 
charged by industrial enterprises considerably outpaces the 
growth of retail prices. 
  In the first 10 months (December 1992 to October 1993), 
wholesale prices increased 45 times, while prices of consumer 
goods and services rose 37 times. 
<H5>  Situation in Some Economic Sectors </H5>
  Industrial production continues to decline. In 
January-November, the volume of goods production fell 8 percent 
compared to the same period of last year. More than half of all 
enterprises saw their output contract. The output of 128 out of 
146 types of very important products shrank. 
  In the first 11 months, enterprises of the fuel and 
energy sector produced 106.4 million tons of coal, which is 
13.1 percent less than during the same period last year; 3.9 
million tons of oil and liquefied gas, or 5.2 percent less; and 
17.6 billion cubic meters of natural gas, or 8.1 percent less. 
  Coal industry enterprises reached only 77 percent 
of the coal production target for November, and 85 percent of 
the target for coke production. Since the start of the year, 
these targets were fulfilled by only 86 percent and 88 percent, 
respectively. 
  The situation in the petroleum processing industry 
remains difficult. Output in basic oil refining continues to 
decline. Since the start of the year, 22 million tons has been 
refined, 38.6 percent below last year's levels. As a result, the 
production of gasoline fell 34.3 percent, of diesel 23.8 percent 
and of heavy fuel 39.5 percent. 
  Electric energy production also continues to 
shrink. During January-November, 207 billion kilowatt hours was 
produced, 8.2 percent less than last year; of these, combustion 
plants produced 128 billion kilowatt hours, or 16.1 percent 
less. The fall in output at combustion plants was in part made 
up by the rise in output at nuclear and hydroelectric plants, by 
4.2 percent and 45.9 percent, respectively, compared to last 
year. 
  The situation with supplying fuel to combustion plants is 
extremely difficult. Gas deliveries during November were nearly 
halved from last year, falling short of target by 456 million 
cubic meters; only 24,000 tons of heavy fuel was provided, 
amounting to just 24 percent of the target. 
  Severe shortages of fuel, energy and raw materials, as well 
as price increases on them, have created a critical situation in 
the metal industry. Some enterprises have been 
working below capacity or have halted production altogether. Due 
to the fall of natural gas deliveries, 15 blast furnaces, 20 
open-hearth furnaces and several rolling mills had to be halted. 
The output of main types of products fell by between 18 percent 
and 37 percent in the first 11 months of the year, compared to 
the same period of 1992. The output of pig iron fell 7.4 million 
tons (23 percent), of steel 8.1 million tons (21 percent), of 
rolled products 4.8 million tons (18 percent) and of steel pipe 
1.7 million tons (37 percent). 
  In November, enterprises of the coal industry in Ukraine 
fell 
short by some 200,000 tons in their deliveries of coke to 
metal-processing enterprises, whereas supplies of coke from 
Russia and Kazakhstan were 20 percent below contracted levels in 
the first 11 months, as a result of payment delays. 
  The situation remains difficult also in 
agriculture. The output and state purchases of main 
types of meat and poultry industry products fell due to the 
decline in numbers and yields of cattle and poultry. 
  In January-November, the output of meat fell by 736,300 tons 
slaughterhouse weight, 24 percent less than the same period last 
year, of milk by 1.269 million tons, or 10 percent less, and 
eggs by 1.254 billion, or 18 percent less. 
  State purchases amounted to 2.216 million tons of meat, or 
24 
percent less than last year, 10.05 million tons of milk (9 
percent less) and 4.704 billion eggs (16 percent less). 
  State purchasing contracts for meat and poultry were only 78 
percent filled, for milk 95 percent and for eggs 81 percent. 
  The government continues to purchase farm products. It 
purchased 14.2 million tons of grain (97 percent of target), 
which is 3.2 million tons more than in 1992. It purchased 
716,100 tons of potatoes (21 percent below last year's levels), 
1.5 million tons of vegetables (5 percent below) and 448,700 
tons of fruit (3 percent above). 
  Due to the decline of total output, lack of fuel and higher 
prices for energy, the volume freight transportation 
continues to decline. In the first 11 months, motor transport 
hauled 418 million tons of freight, which is 37 percent below 
levels of the same period last year; rail transport 496 million 
tons, or 28 percent below; and water transport 27 million tons, 
or 22 percent below. 
  Steady price increases in travel caused further 
reductions in its volume. Airline travel fell 72 percent and 
motor travel 22 percent. 
  At 1 November, 2,167 joint ventures existed in 
Ukraine, producing K887.4 billion worth of goods or services in 
the first nine months of the year. At the domestic market, they 
sold output worth R1.1856 trillion and $131.3 million. Exports 
by joint ventures totaled $201.4 million and imports $262.8 
million. 
  Foreign trade with countries of far abroad totaled 
in January-October $3.5785 billion, of which exports accounted 
for $2.1618 billion and imports for $1.4167 billion. 
  Foreign trade by Ukraine enterprises was conducted with 99 
countries. The highest volumes of exports went to Austria, 
Bulgaria, India, Italy, China, the Netherlands and Germany. Most 
imports came from Austria, Brazil, Germany, the US, Hungary and 
France. 
  The volume of foreign trade between Ukraine and 
countries of the former USSR totaled K34.3 trillion, of which 
exports were K11.2 trillion and imports K23.1 trillion; this 
created a deficit of K11.9 trillion (due to the purchases of 
natural gas, oil and oil products, polyethelene, wood pulp, 
cotton and synthetic rubber). Deficit was registered with Russia 
(K9.7 trillion) and Turkmenistan (K2.1 trillion), as well as 
with Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania and Estonia. 
<H5>  Consumer goods and services </H5>
  The output of consumer goods fell by K8.7 
trillion, or 15 percent, in January-November, and totaled K50.3 
trillion in retail prices. 
  The output of food products fell 11 percent, 
including that of sausage 33 percent, of margarine 32 percent, 
of whole milk 31 percent, of meat 27 percent, of vegetable oil 
13 percent and of cheeses 11 percent. 
  Food industry enterprises suffer from persisting financial 
problems, especially the disarray in inter-enterprise payments. 
Because they are owed money by retail trade organizations for 
sold output, and experience a liquidity shortage, food industry 
enterprises have been unable to pay in full for the deliveries 
of agricultural products. They can get no loans for these 
purposes. 
  The output of non-food products fell 23 percent 
during January-November, and totaled K16 trillion. 
  The output of cultural-recreational and household good fell 
considerably. For instance, the output of tape recorders 
declined 27.3 percent, of television sets 25.4 percent, of 
electric irons 16.4 percent, of automatic laundry machines 13.2 
percent, of radio sets 11.8 percent and of refrigerators by 7.8 
percent. 
  One cause of this is the shortage of rubles to pay Russian 
enterprises for raw materials and components, as well as delays 
with payment processing in the banking system. 
  The energy crisis in the country also impacts negatively on 
output. 
  The main cause of the existing situation is the lack of 
foreign currency, including rubles, which is needed to buy up to 
70 percent of required raw materials outside Ukraine, as well as 
shortages of domestic currency. 
  The volume of retail trade fell by 28.2 percent in 
constant prices in the first 11 months of the year compared to 
the same period of last year, and totaled K28.1 trillion. 
  Due to constant price increases on practically all consumer 
products, the situation in the consumer market worsened further 
during January-November. Consumers are trying to get rid of 
their money as soon as possible, since it is rapidly losing 
value, while the available goods are clearly insufficient to 
meet demand. As a result, retail trade inventories are 
declining. At 1 December, stocks covered 41 days of sales, 6 
days less than a year ago. 
  In January-October, the sale of meat through state and 
cooperative retail trade fell 19.4 percent, of butter 10.4 
percent, of vegetable oil 17.7 percent, of cheese 36.4 percent 
and of eggs 25.5 percent. 
  Average monthly wages for employees in the state 
sector rose 15.8 times since the start of the year, amounting to 
K240,200 in October. They are lowest in the catering industry, 
culture and the arts, social work, agriculture, retail trade, 
housing, education and health care, ranging from K149,000 to 
K197,000.

Ministry, the Ministry of Finance, the Statistics Ministry and

<F P=106> [Interview with Oleksandr Yehorov, deputy head of the </F>
Employment and Job Market Administration, by Volodymyr Oliynyk, 
under the rubric "How To Be Bankrupt"; place and date not given: 
"The Labor Ministry's Move Against Unemployment"--first 
paragraph is MOLOD UKRAYINY introduction] 
  [Text] As we know, in anticipation of the structural 
reorganization of the economy this year, Ukraine's Ministry of 
Labor drafted a National Public Works Program. In connection 
with this measure, our correspondent met with Oleksandr Yehorov, 
deputy head of the Employment and Job Market Administration. 
  [Oliynyk] Mr. Yehorov, what is the goal of the National 
Public Works Program? 
  [Yehorov] First, this program was drawn up as part of the 
effort to implement one of the points of the government's action 
plan for 1994. Second, this is the first time that such a 
program has been drafted as a separate document. Third, the 
program is designed to provide work for those left without jobs 
as a result of the structural reorganization of the economy and 
to avert landslide unemployment due to mass layoffs. 
  [Oliynyk] Can we regard the National Public Works Program as 
a panacea in the struggle against unemployment? 
  [Yehorov] I would not put it that way. This program should 
we 
viewed as part of a complex of measures aimed at overcoming the 
negative phenomena of mass unemployment. Its implementation is 
closely linked with the implementation of the state and 
territorial employment programs for 1994 and subsequent years. 
Actually, what this means is carrying out measures within the 
framework of the principal document--the National Employment 
Program. 
  [Oliynyk] What kind of public works does the program 
foresee? 
  [Yehorov] We concluded that the labor force made available 
by 
layoffs should be employed primarily on priority 
undertakings--i.e., projects and facilities that serve the vital 
needs of the people and improve the social infrastructure. First 
and foremost, this applies to such important economic complexes 
as the agrarian, transportation, and housing and public 
utilities sectors. For example, such large projects as the 
construction and reconstruction of the trans-European highway 
including the creation of a complete transportation 
infrastructure: Germany--Poland--Ukraine--Russia and Central 
Europe--central Ukraine--the Near East; the construction of 
plants to manufacture building materials. Incidentally, all 
these projects are long-term and not limited to 1994 and 1995. 
  [Oliynyk] This is a very large task, and one need not be a 
specialist to understand that this requires a very large number 
of people and a very large amount of money? [punctuation as 
published] 
  [Yehorov] Your observation is very true, and I will respond 
to it. In light of the variable nature of the situation in the 
job market and given the crisis conditions that mark the 
development of this situation, scientific estimates indicate 
that in 1994 there will be 2.4 million people without work, of 
whom 1.5 million will have unemployed status. Let me remind you 
that in 1993, there were only 275,000 people who were not 
working and only 78,000 with unemployed status. As to funds, 
estimates show that we will need at least 52.6 billion 
karbovantsi (in July 1993 prices) for regional projects alone. 
The total cost of implementing the measures provided for in the 
program will amount to nearly a billion karbovantsi in 1994. 
  [Oliynyk] Would it not be better to use this money to 
support 
unprofitable enterprises or simply for paying out unemployment 
benefits? 
  [Yehorov] Of course not. Structural reorganization is a 
painful operation, but once it is over, we will have a sound 
economy. As far as the cost of organizing and implementing the 
National Public Works Program is concerned, despite the fact 
that it is obviously a loss-making proposition, it will 
ultimately relieve social tensions--to begin with, because 
people will have work, and secondly--and this is very 
important--the state will get the main highways it so badly 
needs and the housing and public utilities infrastructure will 
be improved, inasmuch as the state has never had enough 
resources to get around to the construction and ordering of the 
latter.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Vladimir Tokarevskiy, doctor of </F>
physico-mathematical sciences and general director of the 
"Cover" interbranch scientific-technical center of the Academy 
of Sciences of Ukraine, by PRAVDA UKRAINY correspondent Dmitriy 
Kiyanskiy; place and date not given: "Echo of Chernobyl": "How 
Long Will the 'Sarcophagus' Last? The International Competition 
for Changing the 'Cover' Installation Is Over. But What Is 
Next?"] 
  [Text] Just as the nuclear electric power station on 
the banks of the Pripyat River is firmly associated in our 
country with danger, misfortune, and grief, the word "Chernobyl" 
itself brings to mind the fourth unit of the AES [nuclear 
electric power station] that was demolished by a terrible 
explosion and the sarcophagus that was erected on its ruins, 
under whose arches there is now a simply fantastic amount of 
radioactive material--20 million curies. 
  Many think that the "Cover" installation is airtight. 
Unfortunately, this is not so. During its construction, due to 
high radiation it was necessary to use remote methods, as a 
result of which the overall area of cracks in the sarcophagus 
totals about 1,000 square meters. Naturally, radioactive dust 
can easily penetrate through these to the outside. Given a 
failure in the internal structures, there is a serious danger 
for people working in the industrial area of the AES. 
  Prominent specialists from many countries of the world 
who took part in the international competition, whose results 
were summarized in Kiev almost a half year ago, attempted to 
answer the question: "What should the new 'Cover' be like?" They 
had to take the most diverse circumstances into account. For 
example, to ensure against natural and other calamities, the new 
"Cover" should be calculated for an earthquake magnitude of 
seven (one higher than probable) and for a powerful hurricane, 
and even for the fact that an aircraft could fall on it. It is 
not without reason that it is said that the rarest event that 
occurs once in a thousand years could also occur tomorrow. 
  It is written in the conditions of the competition that 
a contract is signed with its winner (or winners) for the 
implementation of their ideas. But nothing is being heard about 
the start of design work, not to speak of construction work. HAS 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION TURNED INTO A KIND OF POLITICAL 
GAME ORGANIZED AROUND CHERNOBYL? A PRAVDA UKRAINY correspondent 
put this question to Professor Vladimir Tokarevskiy, doctor of 
physico-mathematical sciences and general director of the 
"Cover" interbranch scientific-technical center of the Academy 
of Sciences of Ukraine. 
  [Tokarevskiy] Such a point really was stated in the 
conditions, but it was changed in March of this year: The winner 
received an opportunity to reach the final stage of the 
so-called tender--the competition for the right to acquire a 
contract. In this case, this was the conduct of a feasibility 
study for the design work. In essence, this decision of the 
organizational committee was like extending the competition for 
an unlimited period. 
  [Kiyanskiy] What, for example, would soccer fans say if the 
rules of the game were changed in the course of a match?! In my 
opinion, behavior like this is not permitted in civilized 
countries... 
  [Tokarevskiy] An exceptional circumstance compelled us to do 
this. It remained absolutely unclear as to who would pay for the 
TEO [feasibility study] and the design work, and what is most 
important, who would be able to finance the construction. If the 
conditions remained as before, the Ukrainian Government would 
simply prove to be unable to fulfill them and to sign a contract 
with the winner. And this, you will agree, is far worse than 
making corrections. 
  [Kiyanskiy] Perhaps it is appropriate here to mention an old 
anecdote from the "vintage" series. At the beginning of the 
1930's, Rothschild was approached by representatives of the 
Soviet Ministry of Finance with a request to borrow a very large 
sum. Why do you need so much money? asked the famous banker. 
They explained to him politely: for the construction of 
socialism. "In my opinion, when there is no money, it is not 
necessary to build," Rothschild replied. 
  [Tokarevskiy] The story is amusing, but I do not see the 
analogy here. The sarcophagus cannot wait. Every lost month is 
fraught with problems. 
  [Kiyanskiy] As I understand it, the French offered the 
means... 
  [Tokarevskiy] Only for the feasibility study and (to a 
lesser 
degree) for the project. If we had agreed to their conditions, 
we would have impeccably formulated documents, beautifully 
executed sketches, and they possibly would even be able to lay 
down a certain "zero" cycle. And they would have received the 
usual long-range construction project, for there was no money 
for the completion of construction. To finance all the work the 
Ukrainian Government would need, according to various estimates, 
from $500 million to $2.5 billion, and the French were giving 
$10-15 million. As you see, the sums are not compatible... 
  Before starting any kind of a job, it should be known 
exactly 
how to complete it. The World Bank or the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development are able to guaranteeing real 
financing for the grandiose project. It would be possible to 
resolve the problem successfully if we were actively assisted by 
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the 
Commission of the European Community, and an international fund 
established specially to finance the Chernobyl project, say, at 
the request of the presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus. 
The sum of $500 million is really not such a large amount for 
the entire world community. 
  [Kiyanskiy] The authors of one of the drafts that was 
submitted for the competition proposed pouring concrete into the 
destroyed unit and transforming it into a monolith. Why was 
their idea rejected; after all, the resources needed for its 
implementation would be much less than other projects? 
  [Tokarevskiy] By transforming the unit into a monolith we 
would increase the volume of radioactive waste, and would 
thereby be behaving like the poor housekeeper who scoops all the 
rubbish into one corner in the hope that someone will take it 
away later. As the result of such an operation, instead of 
hundreds of cubic meters of radioactive waste, we would get 
millions of cubes of "contamination." But this, you will agree, 
is unethical with respect to our progeny, on whose shoulders we 
would place such a heavy burden. 
  If a catastrophe that is unprecedented in human history 
occurred because of our tragic mistakes, then the efforts that 
are applied to the elimination of its consequences must be just 
as great. The present generation is obliged to cope with the 
accident of the century. 
  Unfortunately the international competition jury, about 
which 
we have already spoken with you, was compelled to state that not 
one of the submitted works makes it possible to resolve the 
problem comprehensively: It is impossible, for example, to take 
the French draft, considered to be the best, and start 
construction on its basis. The jury decided not to award the 
first prize. It thereby declared to the whole world that, 
unfortunately, a ready solution does not exist today. The 
problem proved to be far more complicated than we thought just 
several years ago. 
  [Kiyanskiy] But sooner or later the construction will 
nonetheless begin. Hundreds of trucks will begin to move up to 
the unit, and various mechanisms will start to work in the 
industrial area. Many will speak up about the danger that dust 
will be raised, and that the wind will carry the nuclides to 
nearby villages and cities. Radioactive particles will fall into 
the soil and water... 
  [Tokarevskiy] Well, you know, fear makes mountains out of 
molehills. If such fears are expressed by the broad public, then 
specialists have already thought about this first and foremost. 
We consider dust suppression to be one of the most important 
problems. In the course of a day approximately 22,000 liters of 
air pass through a person's lungs, and you and I consume about 
two kilograms of food on average. This means that incomparably 
more nuclides can get into the human body through breathing than 
through eating. It is for this reason that the requirements for 
clean air are much stricter. 
  Dust suppression systems will begin to function as soon as 
construction work around the sarcophagus is started. The 
contaminated soil of 1986 by the walls of the sarcophagus is now 
at a depth of three to nine meters: It was covered with clean 
earth at one time for the purpose of decontaminating it. But, of 
course, we will have to remove the "cultured layer," which is 
contaminated with radiation. As for removing blockages and 
dismantling damaged structures inside the sarcophagus, this will 
begin to be done only after the erection of the airtight shell 
of "Cover-2." 
  [Kiyanskiy] But after all, nuclides can get into not only 
the 
air and ground, but also into subsoil water... 
  [Tokarevskiy] Indeed, this is one of the most complicated 
and, alas, still unresolved problems today. As recent 
measurements indicate, there has been no record, fortunately, of 
migration through any kind of loose joints or cracks in the 
foundation of the sarcophagus. However, we will not forget about 
the enormous amount of radioactive materials located here. 
  I repeat, there is no migration at this time. But if we 
become convinced that it has appeared, it will obviously not 
become easier for anyone. Therefore, any delays in the 
construction of "Cover-2" are fraught with the most serious 
consequences. We have been allotted only five years for 
everything--and not a month longer.

<F P=106> [Letter to Ukraine's leaders: "Demand of the General </F>
Directors of Coal Associations"] 
  [Text] 
  L.M. Kravchuk, president of Ukraine 
  I.S. Plyushch, chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine 
  Ye.L. Zvyahilskyy, acting prime minister of Ukraine 
  H.S. Surgay, chairman of the State Committee for Coal 
Industry of Ukraine 
  On 28 December 1993 in Lugansk Oblast's city of Antratsit 
the 
general directors of coal production associations of Ukraine 
discussed measures to stabilize work in the sector. Basic 
demands, in respect to which a decision at the state level is 
essential, were adopted for the elimination of the catastrophic 
situation at the coal enterprises. 
  1. The price of coal and coal products established for 
January 1994 must be fixed in dollar equivalent at the exchange 
rate of the dollar as of the end of December 1993 and indexed 
monthly proportionate to the change in the price of the dollar 
in relation to the karbovanets (that is, the price for February 
1994 must be established proportionate to the price of the 
dollar at the end of January and so forth). 
  2. The transfer in the first quarter of 1994 to the books of 
the local authorities of facilities of the social sphere and, 
prior to this transfer, their directed financing from 
centralized sources. 
  3. To liquidate as 1 January 1994 the structure of the 
Uglesbyt [expansion unidentified] of Ukraine and transfer to the 
coal-production associations the right to independently exercise 
the functions of supplies and sale of coal and products of its 
conversion in accordance with direct agreements with consumers 
and government contracts. 
  4. To convert coal at enrichment factories in accordance 
with 
agreements, with the reimbursement of the expenditure on the 
enrichment and the right to sell the end product by its 
producer. At the demand of the coal-production associations to 
transfer the enrichment factories to the associations. 
  5. To extend loans to the coal industry enterprises in 
stable 
fashion against standard stocks of commodity and material values. 
  6. On account of the tardy revision of the price of coal and 
coal products and pricing mistakes on the part of the Government 
of Ukraine, nonrepayable arrears of enterprises of the coal 
sector had formed by the end of 1993. These arrears have 
practically halted the production and financial activity of the 
enterprises. 
  We demand that enterprises of the coal sector be relieved of 
the current debts. 
  7. For the restoration of economic and business relations 
with enterprises of Russia and other neighboring and distant 
states: 
  a) to liberalize customs legislation; 
  b) to introduce identical customs rules with states of the 
"near abroad"; 
  c) to authorize the state-owned enterprises on their 
leaders' 
responsibility to ship and receive products, with customs 
documents being drawn up at the customs house within a month 
from the day of shipment (receipt) of products; 
  d) to exempt imported production engineering equipment and 
materials for the coal enterprises of customs duty and taxes. 
  8. To provide for the allocation of monetary resources from 
centralized sources to pay compensation for length of service to 
all working people of a coal-production association before 10 
January 1994. 
  9. To extend coal-export licenses to the first quarter of 
1994. 
  10. To index the coal enterprises' working capital or 
allocate long-term soft loans for its replenishment. 
  11. To abolish the "government order" concept as lacking a 
legal foundation and to distribute coal resources according to 
direct agreements and government contracts concluded on mutually 
advantageous terms. 
  12. To communicate the response to this demand before 10 
January 1994 in our presence in the city of Kiev. 
  General directors:

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Health Yuriy Spizhenko by </F>
DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA correspondent Valentyna Skoropadska, 
under the rubric "Critical Point"; place and date not given: 
"The Doctor Might Lose His Patients"] 
  [Text] 
  [Skoropadska] Yuriy Prokopovych, at present our society has 
serious complaints about the health care sector because both the 
medical services and the health of the population of Ukraine 
have deteriorated considerably. 
  [Spizhenko] Let us begin with the fact that the health of 
the 
population is determined by a number of factors, the key factors 
being the standard and way of life, the influence of the 
environment on people, their heredity, and only after that the 
standard of medical aid. As you know, at present the ecological, 
social, and economic conditions for living in Ukraine do not 
guarantee its citizens any of those factors that shape the 
health status of the nation. 
  We, physicians are particularly concerned about a 
considerable deterioration in the diet of the people and the 
growing incidence of disease, the overall death rate, to say 
nothing of the pronounced drop in the birth rate associated with 
this--11.4 per 1,000 population in 1992. An extremely 
unfavorable demographic situation has developed. Since 1990 
natural population growth has been negative. Last year almost 
100,000 more people died than were born. 
  The main biological characteristics of a person, the immune 
system, incidence of disease, and life expectancy depend on the 
adequate supply of vital substances to the organism. According 
to data from the Scientific Research Institute of Nutritional 
Hygiene, a person should consume no less than 150 grams of meat, 
700 grams of milk and dairy products, 40 grams of fish, and 
about 300 grams of bread, potatoes, and other vegetables daily. 
However, a considerably greater amount of money than people make 
in many cases would now have to be spent on a monthly basis in 
order to comply with these minimum physiological norms. Given 
that, why would they be healthy? According to data from 
specialists, the daily ration of foodstuffs includes only 30-40 
percent of meat and 30 percent of fish compared to the 
recommended norms. We should also say that diets have 
deteriorated considerably due to reductions in the consumption 
of vegetables and fruit by almost one-half. The carbohydrate 
component and energy content of the diet are ensured virtually 
in their entirety through increasing the consumption of bread 
products, sugar, and other refined carbohydrates. 
  [Skoropadska] Recently the immune systems of many residents 
of Ukraine, even those who were not in Chernobyl, have been 
disrupted. A stable upward trend in cardiovascular and 
gastrointestinal disease, anemias, and gallstone diseases has 
been registered. The number of hypertension sufferers is up 84 
percent, diabetes mellitus patients--up 49 percent, patients 
with ulcer, gastric, and duodenum diseases--up 44 percent. How 
do you explain all of this? 
  [Spizhenko] I have said it before, and will repeat again: A 
considerable reduction in the consumption of animal protein, 
vitamins, and mineral substances brings about the development of 
the diseases in question. 
  We should speak the bitter truth today so that tomorrow it 
will not be too late. Certainly, the considerable increase in 
the number of people who are destitute and the unsatisfactory 
supply of foodstuffs to preschool and youth establishments are 
causing partial undernourishment of children and young people. 
The shortage of protein in the diets of children in organized 
collective settings comes to 36 percent; this includes animal 
protein--50 percent, fats--22 percent, carbohydrates--38 
percent, and micro- and macroelements--about 60 percent. Vitamin 
deficiencies are being registered in almost all children. In 
view of the increase in the cost of meals, only one-third of 
schoolchildren eat at school (in 1990 this was 80 percent). 
  One in three children in Ukraine has exudative-catarrhal 
diathesis and food allergies because of nonrational nutrition. 
Among children who died before the age of four months, 82 
percent received incorrect artificial nutrition. Substitutes for 
breast milk are in an extremely short supply, and the quality of 
those that are produced is very low. We should also mention that 
the operation of infant formula distribution centers has become 
much more difficult. Government assignments to build and equip 
enterprises and shops producing infant formula have not been 
carried out year after year. While two canned dairy product 
combines exist (in Khorol, Poltava Oblast, and Balta, Odessa 
Oblast) which could not only keep Ukrainian children fully fed 
but also manufacture products for sale, the issue of baby food 
has not been resolved because of the unstable situation at these 
enterprises. How is our future nation supposed to be healthy? 
  Unbalanced nutrition, pollution of the natural environment 
with harmful industrial waste, herbicides, and pesticides in 
agriculture result in the organism's reduced resistance to 
disease factors or, as physicians say, immune deficiency. 
Infectious diseases are developing even among children and 
adults who have been inoculated with special serums--diphtheria, 
tuberculosis, which is trending up, and whooping cough--which 
definitely confirms a pronounced immune deficiency. 
  [Skoropadska] Yuriy Prokopovych, a catastrophic situation 
has 
now emerged in Ukraine as far as the incidence of diphtheria is 
concerned. What is the ministry doing at present to snuff out 
this dangerous disease? 
  [Spizhenko] I would like to say that we are doing everything 
to stop this menacing illness. However, we must look the truth 
in the eye. More than 2,000 cases have already been registered, 
415 in children. Some 70 people have died, of them, 22 children. 
Other long-forgotten diseases have also reared their ugly heads. 
The disease control situation involving poliomyelitis has become 
more complex (since 1992, 16 cases have been registered). 
  The Ministry of Health is facing the persistent need to 
sharply reduce the shortage of diphtheria, poliomyelitis, 
measles, and tuberculosis vaccines, and those of other 
infectious diseases, and to improve the quality of those 
vaccines. 
  With a view to reducing the volume of imports of biological 
immunity preparations, the National Program for Immunological 
Prevention among the Population in 1993 through 2000, which has 
been approved by the government, envisions the establishment of 
domestic production of vaccines at the Kharkov, Kiev, and Odessa 
Biological Preparations Enterprises. 
  According to a technical and economic evaluation, 
establishing a new a complete technological cycle of vaccine 
production will require $32.5 million. Some $1.6 million are 
necessary in order to acquire special refrigerated trucks and 
freezing chambers. It is the government's duty to find a way to 
finance these measures even under the current conditions. 
  [Skoropadska] Yuriy Prokopovych, at present all of us are 
feeling the shortage of drugs, including vital, in pharmacies 
and medical facilities. What is being done to improve this 
situation? 
  [Spizhenko] Within the USSR, drugs worth about $800 million 
were allocated to Ukraine, whereas recently about $80 million 
were allocated. This has already affected the health of the 
population perceptibly. As a result of discontinued payments we 
are not able to get raw materials from Russia, Belarus, and so 
on. Even planned surgery, including vital, is frequently not 
performed. Thus at present the need for them is met 30-50 
percent precisely because of the absence of the most necessary 
preparations. Here is an example: With an annual need for kidney 
transplants of 1,500 people, transplants are actually provided 
to 120-150 patients. The extremely limited acquisition of 
preparations preventing rejection is the reason. 
  Between 6,500 and 6,700 operations for heart diseases are 
performed in Ukraine annually, but 36,000 patients need it! The 
reason is the same in this instance. A critical situation has 
emerged in the treatment of endocrine patients, who number over 
1 million. Of these, more than 800,000 have diabetes mellitus. 
Insulin, which is vitally indicated for them, is not produced in 
Ukraine, and foreign exchange funds to organize production 
cannot be found. More examples may be given. The Ministry of 
Health believes that implementation of the Comprehensive Program 
for the Development of the Medical Industry, which was approved 
by the Cabinet of Ministers in October, is one of the main 
directions for overcoming the crisis; this is also associated 
with the allocation of requisite appropriations. 
  The system for supplying medicines to the population is now 
being restructured with the inclusion of foreign investment and 
the funds of enterprises of other, nonstate forms of ownership. 
This makes it possible to increase the acquisition of imported 
drugs which are in very short supply and deliver them to Ukraine. 
  The issue of social protection for the population is being 
resolved by way of state regulation of price-setting for drugs 
and their targeted provision for almost 50 groups of the 
population and categories of diseases. 
  Our ministry has developed a system under which the 
development and production of drugs would take the shortest 
route. Pharmacology and pharmacopoeia committees are already in 
operation in Kiev, Kharkov, Vinnitsa, and other places. 
Industrial production of drugs, reagents, antiseptic compounds, 
and so on has been established. The specially established 
Medical Committee of the Cabinet of Ministers has been brought 
in to solve this problem. 
  However, let us come back to the present: At this stage, 
foreign exchange funds are necessary to purchase annually the 
vital medical preparations worth $800-860 million which are not 
manufactured in Ukraine. I believe that the problem of drug 
supply ranks second to the problem of food supply. Consequently, 
it is necessary to find sources of financing to purchase drugs 
with foreign exchange. This will reduce social tensions 
accordingly in our society. 
  I must mention the beggarly existence of the health care 
sector. The budget for 1993 was approved in the amount of 1,036 
billion karbovantsy, or 60 percent of the need. However, funding 
is provided at the rate of 50-60 percent of the tentatively 
established budget, and is irregular, coming in small amounts 
and with considerable delays. Telegrams are being received from 
health care establishments stating that regular operation is 
impossible, and hospitals are threatening to close because there 
is nothing to either treat or feed the patients with. 
  Indeed, medical personnel must save or help people suffering 
grave diseases. This is our professional responsibility. 
However, the sacred duty of the government is to ensure normal 
funding for the medical sector.

<F P=106> [Interview with Pavel Barbalat, president of the Parliament </F>
of the Republic of Moldova, recorded by Gennadiy Skvirenko; 
place and date not given: "The Third Estate Is Strengthening Its 
Positions"] 
  [Text] Our guest is Pavel Andreyevich Barbalat, 
president of the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova. A lawyer 
with a length of service of almost 40 years. He has risen to his 
present very high position from the lowest rung, having missed 
none. He tells a good joke. He does not respond to criticism in 
the press but does not shun meetings with correspondents. 
  [Skvirenko] Let us begin the discussion with a most general 
question: What impression of the present would you note as being 
characteristic of today's crime situation? 
  [Barbalat] I have tried several contrasting criminal cases 
in 
succession recently. In Yedinets a son killed his father. In 
Stefan Vode a father killed his child. I recently took part in a 
trial in Kahula in which there should have been in the dock 
instead of the young man accused of having killed two persons 
his mother, perhaps.... You know what frightens me? The 
severance of the ties between the generations. The ties that 
hold together the moral health of both the family and society. 
  [Skvirenko] You spent two days in Kahula, I believe? 
  [Barbalat] Four. It was a very serious business. 
  [Skvirenko] Describe it in more detail, if you can. 
  [Barbalat] It is essentially a graphic example of the tragic 
consequences of the disintegration of the family. Husband and 
wife did not get on. The man had been free with his fists, for 
which he had done time, and once at liberty, he left is wife and 
two sons and went away. In her search for consolation the woman 
took to liquor. And she turned her home into a den of iniquity, 
collecting drinking companions aged 17 to 70. 
  [Skvirenko] And what about the sons? 
  [Barbalat] The elder went into the army and is serving as a 
warrant officer. The younger one--he is 31--also earned a 
living. But things were harder for him. He would hear 
continually from people: There's your mother cavorting around 
drunk--come and get her. Or he would be called to come and 
restore order in the house--the drinking companions would be 
letting themselves go once again.... So it was on this occasion 
also. He went to his mother's, there were two others there. One 
was about 60, the other, 40. The 40-year-old, bare to the waist, 
had struggled into his mother's winter coat, with a fur collar. 
The young man suggested that they cut it out, they set about 
him. With language and threats. And he then threw them out onto 
the street and then beat them up such that one died on the spot, 
the other, in hospital. 
  [Skvirenko] A karate expert, perhaps? 
  [Barbalat] Not to look at. He is puny in appearance. Those 
two were far bigger and healthier. But he gave them such a 
thrashing--something fearful. And here he is in the dock. I 
asked the mother: Have you any understanding that it is 
primarily you who are to blame for the fact that those two were 
killed, for the fact that your son is on trial, for what 
threatens him?..." "Yes, I am to blame, please do not pass 
judgment on him...." But a life has already been maimed, and the 
people cannot be brought back. And all because people have lost 
their human qualities. 
  [Skvirenko] There is more freedom, but we are not seeing 
that 
it has been to everyone's benefit. 
  [Barbalat] No, we proclaim freedom of the personality. But 
note: freedom of the personality, not freedom of the animal. The 
personality is a product of culture, it means respect for other 
personalities. Oversimplification is very dangerous here. But 
that which is simpler is very much in vogue with us. People say: 
Let us restore the economy. Once people are living better, they 
will become kinder of their own accord. 
  [Skvirenko] We have already been through this, it would 
seem.... 
  [Barbalat] Or even to boast that adolescents are washing 
cars 
and selling cigarettes--just like in the West, where the 
children of millionaires deliver newspapers. But it is clean 
forgotten here that socioeconomic conditions with us have as yet 
undergone merely superficial changes and that our tenor of life 
is changing as yet merely in the sense that it is being 
destroyed. And destruction is always a very painful process. 
  [Skvirenko] With unclear prospects, what is more. 
  [Barbalat] And the result is that from whatever side the 
problem is viewed, it is a problem of people's relationships. 
How to resolve it? By education? Compulsion? For several years 
our educationists pushed the idea of the establishment of the 
responsibility of the parents for their children's incorrect 
behavior. 
  [Skvirenko] There is something in this, it would seem.... 
  [Barbalat] Exactly as much as there was in another idea, 
when 
in the years of the punitive measures children paid for their 
convicted parents. 
  [Skvirenko] But there was another proposition also: "I am 
responsible for everything!" 
  [Barbalat] A handsome declaration. But it is in fact 
necessary for everyone to be responsible primarily for his 
conduct. Before both his conscience and the law. Only on this 
basis are normal human relationships possible. 
  [Skvirenko] But there should, after all, be some principle 
of 
the creation of this basis? 
  [Barbalat] There is just one principle: People need to be 
made accustomed to order not by talk, not by declarations, but 
by order. By the precision of demands and rules. By the clarity 
of the structures and the logic of their functioning. It is from 
such an approach, incidentally, that the principle of the 
separation of the branches of power ensues. 
  [Skvirenko] I was looking for an opportunity to ask about 
this--about what the feelings of the third, judicial, estate 
are. Journalist colleagues of mine call themselves the fourth 
estate, incidentally, but this sounds nothing more than a joke. 
Is this not the way it is with you? 
  [Barbalat] I would call our situation satisfactory. 
  [Skvirenko] You feel no pressure? 
  [Barbalat] There has been no intrusion upon our competence 
on 
the part of the official legislative and executive authorities. 
But on the part of certain persons, among the deputies 
particularly, there have been such attempts. Futile, of course. 
We have official forms of interaction, after all: an appeal or 
inquiry, in respect to which we examine a fact or problem and 
give the proper answer. 
  [Skvirenko] Quite so. But there is a need for the 
development 
and improvement of the mechanism of the third estate itself. Do 
you sense this need? 
  [Barbalat] I will go further. We have sent parliament, I'm 
afraid to name this figure even, a whole package of bills on 
questions of our activity, on judicial and legal reform. And I 
would like to emphasize the profound meaning of these proposals, 
which is directly connected with the subject of our 
conversation: They are all ultimately dictated by an aspiration 
to the fuller observance of human rights. Let us take, for 
example, the structural question. We still have a two-tier 
judicial system: the people's court and the Supreme Court. And 
that's it. The result is that the Supreme Court is continually 
acting the part of court of original jurisdiction handling the 
more complex cases. Whereas its function is summary, analytical, 
generalizing. But we have no courts of appeal, nor is there a 
Supreme Court itself essentially. It is hard to avoid violations 
of human rights in such a situation. 
  [Skvirenko] And the actuality of the court's independence 
becomes an important facet of this problem.... 
  [Barbalat] Of course. Although in this respect also there is 
a simplistic approach, when the problem of independence is 
reduced merely to the court being subordinate neither to 
parliament nor the government. 
  [Skvirenko] But there was the instance of parliament wanting 
to hear you render account of your work! 
  [Barbalat] Yes, and several parliamentary commissions 
presented such an initiative simultaneously, incidentally. I had 
to respond: If you insist, I will present a report. But I will 
feel ashamed in front of my foreign colleagues. Not for myself 
but for parliament, which has displayed before the world 
community such a lack of respect for the fundamental principle 
of democratic arrangement. In sum, I persuaded them to drop this 
idea. But, I repeat, the problem of the true independence of the 
court is not exhausted by such satirical-article collisions. The 
main questions are rooted within the judicial system itself. For 
example, the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Code of Civil 
Procedure with us record: Directives of the superior authority 
are binding on the lower authority. But where is the 
independence here, pray? At the present time there is none. I do 
not want to say that the current model is necessarily fraught 
with malfeasance. But... there are instances of even the judges 
beginning to strike a balance. He has rendered a judgment, and 
this judgment has been countermanded. Aha, the judge gets the 
point, since the decision to satisfy the suit was countermanded, 
we now need to deny the suit. But the Supreme Court reversed the 
ruling not because the judge was wrong. But because there were 
insufficient grounds for the ruling. But the judge reacts in 
accordance with the rule: Since it came from the superior 
authority, it is, consequently, an order. And this is wrong. 
  [Skvirenko] You speak so self-critically about this. We do 
not hear this that often. 
  [Barbalat] We recently received expert findings from our 
colleague on the U.S. Court of Appeals. He literally tore to 
shreds our celebrated Article 54 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
  [Skvirenko] And what article is this? 
  [Barbalat] It requires the court to assist the plaintiff and 
the defendant in obtaining additional and, from the court's 
viewpoint, necessary evidence. The American writes: What kind of 
court is this if it may, as it chooses, assist one party in 
obtaining additional evidence? There should be one rule in 
court: Whatever a person has brought to court he uses as 
evidence. And nothing doing, as they say, no trial either. 
  [Skvirenko] Strict, but fair. A deforming influence on the 
judicial process is also being exerted, incidentally, by the 
inequality in the position of prosecutor and attorney, which is 
traditional here. 
  [Barbalat] There was a time when the prosecutor, generally, 
exercised supervision of the activity of the court--this is now 
called supervision of the legality of the adopted judicial 
decisions. Such supervision is alien to normal civilized 
countries. If a judicial error has been made, it is rectified 
with the aid of the judicial mechanism. So the nonequivalence of 
the position of prosecutor and attorney is a continuation of 
that same outdated trend. Yes, all participants in the legal 
process should, of course, be placed under equal conditions. 
And, of course, the real independence of the court should be 
assured also--then it could be said that our judiciary was 
reaching the level of the world standard. 
  [Skvirenko] And now the most topical question. What effect 
is 
the election campaign, which is just getting under way, having 
on your activity? 
  [Barbalat] It is known that we have delegated to the Central 
Electoral Commission seven justices, who constitute its legal 
nucleus, as it were. The Election Act made provision for five 
justices, incidentally, but parliament decided to enlarge the 
size of the "brigade of justices." To Lucinschi's question 
concerning our attitude toward this quota, I honestly replied: 
with misgivings. For it seemed to us that an opportunity to 
involve us in some political games would emerge. But since this 
is the decision that has been adopted, we will do everything in 
our power for the strictest compliance with the requirements of 
the law. 
  [Skvirenko] And are your misgivings being justified? 
  [Barbalat] As yet, no. We are not taking part in any 
political or social actions even. We recently had an awkward 
discussion on this subject with a television official--he 
demanded in a tone of voice implying an order almost that our 
representative take part in a session of a roundtable on 
election matters. I categorically prohibited this. But, on the 
other hand, the judges are prepared, in accordance with the law, 
to examine most promptly locally all citizens' complaints on 
questions of this violation or the other in the course of the 
preparation and holding of the elections. And in accordance with 
the law, of course, the Supreme Court has to make a final ruling 
on the legality of the parliamentary elections of 27 February 
1994. Generally, such a ruling should be made by a 
constitutional court, but inasmuch as we do not have such, 
parliament has entrusted this mission to us--in the person of a 
plenum of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Moldova. 
  [Skvirenko] With what would you yourself like to end our 
interview? 
  [Barbalat] I would like to return to the beginning to stress 
that the court is not an organ of struggle against crime, as 
certain journalists and public figures are attempting to 
maintain. The idea of the court is the idea of justice ensuring 
the health of the social and state organism by means of 
unswerving respect for human rights. As far as the fight against 
crime proper is concerned, I remember well, you know, the 
programs that were drawn up in party bodies and oriented us 
toward the phased eradication of crime--in terms of timeframe 
and percentages, by nature and category.... Such programs do not 
work! As long as civilization exists, most likely, it will be 
dealing with this problem. Nonetheless, its scale and 
seriousness will undoubtedly depend on all of us. And will 
result primarily from our attitude toward the problems of the 
youth, adolescents, and children. Let Minister for Youth Affairs 
Sandulachi not be offended with me, but it seems to me that 
these problems have moved somewhere toward the periphery of our 
attention. For instance, adolescents left fully to their own 
devices are busy with self-education in far from the best forms 
and traditions.... And what do the schoolchildren do during 
vacations? The camps and holiday hotels are empty, and even 
passes to children's playgrounds are beyond the reach of the 
majority of parents.... Where are we leading our children, our 
youth? 
  [Skvirenko] Where are we pushing them, it would be more 
correct to say. 
  [Barbalat] The answer to this question, unfortunately, has 
to 
be drawn from judicial practice. And we need, like the air we 
breathe, a different practice--one of normal, valuable, healthy 
relations between people. Without this nothing good with us will 
result. Neither in the economy nor in policy. Neither in the 
family nor in the country. For we will always get what we 
deserve. No less. But no more either.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Pavenskiy, doctor of economics: "Problems </F>
of Moldova's Technological Dependence"] 
  [Text] The specific nature of Moldova's technological 
dependence consists in the fact that all the major enterprises 
of the republic are oriented on the incoming shipment of spare 
parts and components from a raw material base in mainly one 
country--Russia. 
  It would be possible to reduce technological dependence only 
if changes were made to the structure of production, which would 
require time and funds. 
  Faced with the threat of fuel famine, the government has 
begun to involve itself in these matters on an empirical level, 
reacting with great delay to the consequences, but not to the 
reasons behind it. 
  Whereas in Russia and Ukraine the coefficient of dependence 
of end product volume on external relations amounts to 0.31 and 
0.41, respectively, in Moldova this figure is 0.995. That is, 
for Moldova a one-percent fluctuation in external relations 
yields practically the same degree of change in end product 
volume. In other words, Moldova's technological dependence 
amounts to almost 100 percent. 
  Among the republics of the former USSR, Moldova has one of 
the highest shares of interrepublic imports in production (27 
percent) and exports (24.1 percent) in output consumption. The 
index of production share in the heavy industry sectors in 
interrepublic imports in the republic is quite high (72.8 
percent), and in exports it is the lowest (25.5 percent). 
  The indices presented here are averaged. The technological 
dependence of certain plants of Moldova upon republics of the 
former USSR and other countries is greater still. We import all 
television set components from Russia, Belarus, Bulgaria, and 
Romania. Many enterprises, chiefly those that used to be under 
Union jurisdiction, have been obtaining absolutely every single 
component part from other republics. 
  In international practice, the coefficient 0.25 is 
considered 
to be the critical level with respect to technological 
dependence. The following example shows what this means in 
practice. 
  Germany will never permit Russian oil and gas to constitute 
more than 20-22 percent of its trade and energy balance. To make 
up for its energy shortages, it will acquire energy from the 
Near East and Africa, and will do so in such a manner that no 
single country supplies more than 20-22 percent of Germany's 
energy needs. 
  The economy of Moldova today and in the near future will be 
unable to function normally without relations with the republics 
of the former USSR. This is objectively conditioned by Moldova's 
level of specialization and its role in the all-Union division 
of labor that used to exist. About 82 percent of Moldova's 
exports and more than 75 percent of its imports are attributable 
to the CIS countries. 
  For trade turnover with the republics of the former USSR, 
exports and imports for 1992 amounted to: 55.7 percent with 
Russia; 22.1 percent with Ukraine; 10.1 percent with Belarus; 
2.0 percent with Uzbekistan; and 2.8 percent with Turkmenistan. 
  We see approximately the same picture being maintained for 
the first half of 1993. The greatest percentage of materials, 
raw materials, equipment, and other output imported into Moldova 
comes from Russia. Next in line are Ukraine and Belarus. 
  It must be noted that we have already lost a portion of the 
CIS market. This is partly our own fault and partly due to the 
fact that Russia has introduced extremely high excise and other 
taxes on our traditional export products--champagne, wines, and 
cognacs. This has resulted in decreased export volumes of these 
products--by 20, 47, and 64 percent, respectively. 
  The press service of the Ministry of Economics reports that 
over the first nine months of 1993, wine exports from Moldova to 
Russia decreased by 47.1 percent, cognac by 64 percent, and 
champagne by 20 percent. Moldova is losing one of its most 
important sales markets, its place being occupied by Germany, 
Poland, Italy, Finland, and other countries that are shipping 
production output at intentionally understated prices. Moldova 
may find itself squeezed out of this market precisely at a time 
when the Western market is not accessible to it. This has 
already significantly diminished our opportunities to acquire 
the resources and fuel so necessary for the normal functioning 
of the economy. 
  It should also be noted that Russia has in no way always 
observed principles of fairness in its economic relations with 
republics of the former Union. However, neither has Moldova 
always adhered to civilized principles in its relations with 
Russia (we recall the recent incident involving clandestine 
reexport of oil). 
  Therefore, the question of integrating Moldova into CIS 
structures and of utilizing the internal market of the 
Commonwealth acquires not just an economic aspect, but an 
ethical one as well. 
  The technological dependence of Moldova is intensified by 
three circumstances: It is impossible in the present stage to 
resolve the republic's urgent problems without foreign 
assistance, which must amount to about $500 million. 
  In the opinion of specialists, the state debt of Moldova may 
reach a level greater than $300 million by the end of this year. 
And it is felt this assumption is justified, insofar as the 
republic's production structure is reproducing a hard currency 
deficit since noncompetitive output is being produced. This debt 
will constitute a heavy burden on the shoulders of future 
generations. 
  The press service of the Ministry of Economics asserts that 
the total amount of credits, without interest, will not exceed 
$131.3 million, but the balance of assets and liabilities with 
respect to Moldova's foreign debt is tentatively expected to 
amount to $191.3 million by the end of this year. 
  At the same time, the leadership of Moldova's trade unions 
declares that we are already indebted to foreign banks in an 
amount on the order of $450 million. In addition, on the eve of 
the introduction of our national currency we will receive 
rehabilitation credit in the amount of about $300 million to 
provide support for the national currency rate and cover certain 
expenses for the purchase of energy, etc. 
  Still one more aspect capable of intensifying Moldova's 
technological dependence is the incorrect selection of 
priorities. In the process of privatization, rural residents 
obtain advantages: In addition to national-wealth certificates, 
the property and land of kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and sections of 
processing enterprises are transferred to them for their free 
use and possession, as well as preferential-term credits, which 
are not always returned. With such a distortion, Moldova may 
become a purely agrarian country with a backward economy. 
Everyone understands the importance of agriculture and the need 
to provide it assistance. But if we do not become seriously 
involved in research-intensive, resource-economizing, and 
labor-conserving technology, the republic will never raise 
itself to the level of the developed countries. 
  Here it is necessary to accomplish several tasks: First of 
all, determine priorities in the agro-industrial complex itself 
and provide it with state support; second, we must attract 
foreign capital in order to develop agriculture. An example of 
this is the establishment, based on the Orkhey Pig Farm, of a 
joint enterprise with the participation of Italian and American 
livestock output-processing firms. Third, we must effect state 
stimulation of the development of research-intensive production 
output on the islands of scientific and technological progress 
that still remain in Moldova. In the opinion of the trade union 
leadership, prices for sugar, sausage, and other food products 
will be two or three times the level of world prices in the very 
near future due to regular increases in energy costs. This may 
lead to a situation where agriculture finds itself bankrupt and 
Moldova gradually turns into a raw material appendage and a 
supplier of cheap manpower. In other words, we need to resolve a 
twofold problem: the attraction of foreign capital and entry 
into the world market, on the one hand, and the protection of 
our domestic market, on the other. A glut on the market takes 
place not because society does not need the production output in 
question, but because production costs are so high that there is 
no demand for the output. In Moldova, where price increases are 
significantly out pacing wage increases, such a situation is 
turning into the norm. 
  Priority is given to intermediary trade activity when the 
majority of businessmen (about 80 percent) are engaged not in 
production, but in trade. This affects the state sector of the 
economy as well. Thus, of the proceeds from every bottle of 
wine, wine growers get only 7-10 percent, while trade gets 20 
percent. One can borrow accordingly, but the debt has to be 
commensurate with the national income, using hard currency to 
produce competitive output. Simply put, one must not buy fish, 
but rather buy a fishing rod and learn how to catch fish. 
  How can we reduce the technological dependence of Moldova 
and 
bring it in line with the normal, average level (there is no 
such thing as absolute independence from other countries or from 
the world market)? 
  First of all, production relations must be strengthened. The 
most effective way to reduce the technological dependence of the 
republic is to effect integration into the CIS production 
structures through acquisition of a package of shares--of 
Russian oil-production, oil-refining, and other enterprises, let 
us say, which will gradually be transformed into transnational 
corporations. 
  As far as the sale of wine base is concerned, first of all, 
the export of unprocessed product is a sign of backwardness of 
the republic; second, the wine base itself is many times less 
expensive than ready wine; third, in selling base wine to the 
CIS countries we provide work for the citizens of these states, 
while unemployment in our own republic is reaching threatening 
proportions. 
  The penetration of Moldova into Western markets is a matter 
of no small importance. But by virtue of the existing division 
of labor, all positions are filled there. Competitive production 
output is therefore required, which we simply do not have. 
  Thus in order to resolve the problems of technological 
dependence, we must reorient the economy of Moldova not only 
towards the markets of countries of the East, but on those of 
the West as well.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General A. Lebed by A. Platitsyn; </F>
place and date not given: "I Shall Remain the People's Champion"] 
  [Text] Since the newspapers published in the Dniester 
region are not distributed on the Bessarabian territory of the 
republic (especially, naturally, the newspaper of the 14th 
Russian Army SOLDAT OTECHESTVA), it is sometimes necessary to 
print excerpts from certain articles or references to them. 
  In this case the interest in the item is so great 
(after being quoted repeatedly on radio and television) that we 
decided to reprint the article in its entirety in spite of its 
length. The more so since the crucial nature of the information 
and the clarity of presentation are among its undisputed 
merits. 
  [Platitsyn] Alexksandr Ivanovich, it seems that in the 
Dniester region things are proceeding to a point where, as you 
predicted in an interview for KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA in April, the 
people are just about to "reach for their pitchforks." 
Negotiations on a political settlement, in spite of the efforts 
of the mission of the CSCE and the plan it proposed for 
reconciliation of the sides, have come up against insurmountable 
differences. Nobody wants to back down. Having been left the 
only collector of old Soviet money, the republic is rushing 
toward a financial and economic crash. One cannot quite 
understand the attempts on the part of the authorities to 
regulate monetary circulation by political methods. What do you 
have to say about the situation that has developed? 
  [Lebed] Pay attention to the trio in the Dniester delegation 
to the negotiations with Moldova. A. Volkova, V. Yakovlev, and 
T. Zenovich will make every effort to continue these 
negotiations forever and make sure they come to nothing. And 
this in no way serves the interests of the people. Both 
delegations remind one of cats in heat sitting for hours 
opposite one another howling plaintively but always ready to 
pounce on a rival. The conclusion of the CSCE mission is a 
balanced and well-considered document. Not everything in it is 
indisputable. But it is possible to talk. This requires only one 
thing--the existence of political will. And this is lacking and 
none can be seen in the future so far. I do not want to 
second-guess Moldova--they are approaching the subject of the 
negotiations from different positions. 
  As for the Dniester region, the question is extremely clear 
here. From many years of experience we know that authority 
corrupts people so severely that it is necessary to be very 
stalwart and conscientious person in order to have the courage 
to renounce it voluntarily. Under the cover of political 
demagogy and primitive duping of the people, authorities in the 
PMR [Dniester Moldovan Republic] are doing everything they can 
to preserve the gigantic political superstructure that has been 
created recently. This entire theater with the president, the 
commander in chief, the ministers, the generals, and the 
innumerable host of civil servants and assistants constitute an 
unbearable burden on the people's back. In words we all respect 
Lenin for his modesty and his Spartan way of life, but in 
reality practically nobody is willing to give up their 
privileges provided by power. On the contrary, they have 
conveniently placed their wives and children in prestigious 
offices, stuck antennas in luxurious government foreign 
limousines, and darkened the windows in them so that the people 
cannot see their servants, and they ride around Tiraspol 
splashing mud on the bus stops of the people they are supposed 
to be serving day and night. 
  If there is an opportunity they take a free trip to America 
or Austria, and they do not even consider it necessary to inform 
the people of the purposes or results of these trips, or they 
might fly to Sakhalin to hang out for 10 days. Which is not to 
say that any fish will be delivered from there. Understandably, 
a person would have to be a fool to turn down such benefits. Let 
us imagine for a moment that same "colonel" Gratov: 
sober-minded, he rides the bus, he has gone without pay for 
three months. This is not even funny. People like him would lay 
down their life for the republic although, true, they send 
others to defend it. And they themselves will get drunk feeling 
sorry for the deceased. This is why we cannot count on the 
success of the negotiations under these conditions. 
  The people of the republic must beware of something else. 
The 
stubbornness of the Dniester region could end up with 
unfavorable consequences for the republic. Both Russia and the 
CSCE (God help Ukraine to survive by itself) could turn against 
it, and then the evil wish of V. Novodvorskaya, who suggested 
that Romania seize the Dniester "dowry" lock, stock, and barrel, 
might come true. And events might develop. 
  Anna Zakharovna Volkova uttered some remarkable words: 
"Think, people!" I can only add: "Think and act, people! Act 
before they reign you in completely...." 
  [Platitsyn] Might it not turn out that the complete 
paralysis 
of the economy and hyperinflation in the republic will make any 
negotiations in the political area unnecessary? 
  [Lebed] Now about money. Tajikistan, tormented by war and 
interethnic strife, has pawned its mountains and its glaciers in 
exchange for the credit of 120 billion Russian rubles of the 
1993 model in cash. It was granted because the republic did not 
send its mujahidin to protect the White House. There, they 
measure before they cut. 
  Russia has not and will not give anything to the Dniester 
region, and there is no longer anything to pawn here. Everything 
has long since been secretly mortgaged and remortgaged. The 
naive citizens of the republic and the old timers, their heads 
filled with ideological cliches, who raised a fuss during the 
proceedings on the Ilashu case, think that the republic is being 
controlled by the president and the Supreme Soviet. Would that 
it were! The real ruler of this region is the Moscow 
supermillionaire with the nickname of Zika. I know that the 
authorities are now beginning to pretend that this is the first 
time they have heard about this. Zagradskiy will be especially 
adamant. Fortunately, this is well known in the corresponding 
institutions of Russia and Interpol, where the figure of our 
banker stands out in a fairly unattractive light. 
  The rapid collapse of prices has not made itself fully felt 
yet. This avalanche is just beginning to slide. By the new year, 
when the PMR is left in proud solitude with the "Leninists" whom 
nobody needs, everything will inevitably collapse. And no matter 
how the authorities may try by arbitrary decisions to control 
the "Dniester ruble" with the American dollar, they will not 
succeed. There are Napoleons all over the place, although, true, 
it is nice to cure them somewhere else. 
  The miracle will not happen. Merchants will close down and 
seek their fortune in other regions. The markets, which even 
today look like they have been raided by Mamay, will finally 
turn into refuges for the homeless and city dogs and cats, and I 
do not think it is even necessary to remind you of what is going 
on in the stores. It cannot be ruled out that a "nest egg" has 
been stashed for the new year in the warehouses and bases, and 
it will be brought out before the holiday so that those in the 
darkened limousines can see how the people fight over it in the 
waiting lines. 
  And after the new year "we will pour out the water." True, 
the "farm boys" (there is such a category of prisoners) do not 
like to take the "ration," it is considered "too low," and 
therefore there will be bread, milk will be rationed, there will 
be juices, and there will be pickles in jars and nowhere to get 
rid of them. And those who today are beating their chests and 
putting on a show of excessive fastidiousness for the people 
will switch to dollars and Russian rubles. They have them. And 
in sufficient quantities. 
  [Platitsyn] You obviously have in mind the public statement 
by the speaker of the Supreme Soviet when Grigoriy Stepanovich 
who, without justifying the high price he put on moral damage to 
him, began to "count his chickens before they were hatched," 
promising the blind and disabled to more than compensate through 
the court for budget outlays stolen by A. Bolshakov and others. 
  [Lebed] Very nicely put. I read the so-called complaint of 
Grigoriy Stepanovich, which was extremely illiterate from the 
standpoint of the civil code. G. Marakutsa applied to an 
"independent" court as "chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the 
Dniester Moldovan Republic" and not as a citizen. Thus, exerting 
pressure on the court: "You, Semen Afanasyevich, decide who is 
guilty but keep in mind whose side you must defend if you want 
to remain in your post!" Typical "telephone law." 
  I was in Moscow when Grigoriy Stepanovich suddenly started 
counting the unexpected receipts of foreign millions. I saw his 
theatrical demarche on a videotape and I got the impression that 
it was all a cheap trick. 
  What can come of this? The speaker, clearly twisting the 
facts and making unproved accusations, is raising the question 
in a very narrow way. He persistently exclaims: "Prove that it 
was I!" But let us agree that under the wing of an honest leader 
all kinds of crooks and swindlers can operate with impunity. And 
who needs a chief of the legislative power who gives his tacit 
consent to the creation of "miracles?" The plan is simple--to 
divert people's attention. 
  The court completed its "proceedings" on the Bergman-Gratov 
case at the beginning of May, but the court decisions have not 
yet been carried out because for seven months Bergman's case has 
been sitting in the Supreme Court of the PMR. Bergman has been 
stubborn and demands that Shevtsov, Belousov, and others be 
called as witnesses in the Stepygin case. 
  Exactly the same thing will happen with this case. The court 
will begin to dig around in this mud, spread it on other 
individuals, the case will drag out for months if not years, and 
Grigoriy Stepanovich will continue to rule the Supreme Soviet as 
if nothing had happened. 
  And then, frankly, I do not believe him. Grigoriy 
Stepanovich 
has already made many blunders. Once in an interview for the 
newspaper SEGODNYA he named too high a pension for former 
military servicemen so that the pensioners almost had a stroke. 
Then right on the air in front of all the Dniester region he 
nailed V. Gorbov to the cross, informing Dniester region 
residents of the out-and-out lie about the son of a "deserter" 
from the Shevtsov Guard, who was supposed to have been pursuing 
his activities in organs of the Moldovan Ministry of State 
Security in Beltsy. Next on AsKET [expansion not given] came 
Gorbov's only legal wife, who announced with a tremor in her 
voice: "Forgive me, Grigoriy Stepanovich, but I did not give 
birth to any sons. God did not send me any!" Let us ask 
ourselves this question: Is it possible to believe a person when 
it comes to serious matters if he has the habit of lying about 
small things? I do not think so. 
  As for the documents, we shall submit them: We shall mention 
the accounts through which money and licenses with the 
signatures of some very well-known people passed and we shall 
name names. The people say that a friend in need is a friend 
indeed. There is a time for everything. 
  And I will end by reminding the readers of a statement from 
Minister A. Saydakov in court. At that time he was acting in the 
role of voluntary advocate in the case of D. Kondratovich, who 
also wanted to withdraw from AsKET R1.5 million to study the 
problems of the "gays." What did Aleksandr Yefimovich say at 
that time? That soon the courts would be flooded with complaints 
from the powers that be about protection of their "sullied" 
honor. And have many complaints been filed up to this point? Not 
a single one! Draw your own conclusions.... 
  [Platitsyn] Aleksandr Ivanovich, it seems that Anna Volkova 
stated in public that you, having neither documents nor "even 
poor copies," had entered, to put it mildly, on the path of back 
room intrigue and you are persistently trying to discredit the 
authorities in the eyes of the population. Now, judging from 
everything, the time has come for you to begin to "play your 
trumps." Do you have a lot of them in your hand? 
  [Lebed] More than enough. In general I am doing work that is 
alien to me. But it has already turned out that people are 
coming to me and continuously supplementing my collection of 
documents about the life of the "Dniester Court." Since the 
minister of security is not very intelligent, Shevtsov's 
"disinformation" sticks out like a sore thumb and therefore 
these "documents" go immediately into the wastebasket. I have 
specialists capable of distinguishing authentic from counterfeit. 
  But honest people who have access to the real documents, all 
those who suffocate in an atmosphere of falsehood and 
lawlessness, who understand the danger to themselves and those 
around them, are coming to me. I cannot give the names of these 
people because they would be fired immediately. And the most 
obstinate would be "removed from circulation," as Vadim-Vladimir 
Shevtsov-Antyufeyev likes to say. 
  Let us recall that everything that was discussed previously 
has been confirmed. We have asserted so many times that 
Bolshakov junior is a thief and a crook. It turns out that he is 
also scum. We did not want to believe it; on the contrary, the 
authorities allowed him to dance a "hopak" and scoff at the 
patriotic feelings of the Ukrainians. And where is Aleksandr 
Zakharovich now? Why is he not rushing to court to protect his 
"honor?" 
  There are many cases like this. And the longer the 
authorities engage in protection of such people the more 
resolutely I will rip off their masks and the more painful will 
be their fall from the heights of the power Olympus. Theirs and 
that of their protectors. 
  [Platitsyn] Aleksandr Ivanovich, is it true that you just 
like to shake things up, after all you have a wall in front of 
you? Or do you intend to rock the boat to the end? All you would 
have to do would be turn all the cases over to the authorities 
and you could have a good life. 
  [Lebed] "A wall, but a rotten one"--Lenin said. That is the 
first thing. Second, everything you are hinting at has already 
been suggested to me many times. A Volvo, and money, and a bank 
account, and other nice things. In payment for my silence. But I 
could not do that. Because that would be tantamount to 
putting an end to my biography with my own hand. I 
want to continue to stand up for the righteous cause of the 
people. And this does not produce any dividends, but morally you 
feel wonderful. Unlike certain others...I do not want to drown 
my conscience in endless drunkenness. And I still cannot "turn 
over" the cases. Not yet, they would simply burn them and 
pretend to be the "fire hoses." I already have experience.... 
  [Platitsyn] All right, one might say that A. Bolshakov has 
already been crucified. Who is next? 
  [Lebed] Whoever shouts the loudest: "Stop, 
thief!"--and is thrilled by the feeling of having others' 
millions in his pocket. 
  [Platitsyn] Aleksandr Ivanovich, tell me honestly, why did 
you agree this summer to run as a candidate in the pre-elections 
for Parliament? One gets the impression that by this action you 
wanted to test your popularity among the people and be convinced 
that the people believe in you as they did before and will 
render you all kinds of assistance in the event that there are 
radical changes in the republic. And now we have the elections. 
In spite of the fact that Professor Yakovlev grabbed on to your 
"shirttails" and threw himself at your feet to keep you out of 
his private domain, you won a convincing victory. A month later, 
having run through your scenario, you slammed the door and 
resigned as deputy. The voters were in shock, and now the 
Parliament has a hold of "shirttails" and does not want to let 
go. What next? 
  [Lebed] Nothing. The decree on "nonacceptance of Lebed's 
resignation" is a game being played with the public. Many people 
in the Parliament made the sign of the cross and breathed a sigh 
of relief as soon as the door slammed behind me. It was easier 
for them without somebody disturbing their somnolent 
complacency. You can say as much as you want to about the 
subject of "the influence of moonlight on the swinging of a pine 
cone" or make predictions about when the Moldovan lei will go 
bad. And you can do this today when thousands of workers of the 
best enterprise in the city--I have in mind Odema--are going on 
Christmas holidays for a month because of a lack of raw 
material. And the Parliament can find nothing more important to 
do than discuss the concept of the republic's socioeconomic 
development. They promise to prepare such a concept by the end 
of February. And so one wants to shout: Dear friends, and by the 
end of February everybody in this republic will die waiting this 
concept. Let us think and guess what they will feed the people 
tomorrow. And then for now we will somehow scrape by without the 
concept.... 
  The people are your witnesses, I did not participate in the 
election campaign and I did not nominate myself. I did get in 
the way of either A. Safonov or A. Radchenko. True, Mayor 
Radchenko was bursting to ask me "personally" a certain five 
questions, but after he became a monopolist of the "Dnieper 
Mouthpiece" I lost any desire to meet with this person. I could 
ask him only one question, but I am afraid he would not be able 
to answer it. He does not have the intellect. 
  Why did I "slam" the door? I do not want to be a part of 
this 
power, it will inevitably come to an ignominious end. I am a 
patient person and I will wait until all of them, receding, have 
their back to the wall, and in front of them are the facts. Then 
I and others will have an opportunity to admire their kind faces 
with the appearance of a set of pensive dumbbells.... 
  [Platitsyn] One painful question, Aleksandr Ivanovich. It is 
known that in December everyone who has anything to do with the 
Russian army will receive their maintenance pay in new Russian 
rubles. And we are speaking about billions. Will it not turn out 
that against the background of the general poverty your officers 
will get fat and make those around them envious of their 
well-being? 
  [Lebed] I did not create this problem. Immediately after the 
Moscow events, as early as the beginning of October, I suggested 
a way out of the delicate situation in which the Dniester region 
had found itself by the will of "citizens of the world" Shevtsov 
and Matveyev. In an interview in the newspaper IZVESTIYA 
President I. Smirnov, like a drunk rabbit, flaunted it: "We are 
living without Russia, not as well, but we are living...." How 
much worse we are living will be shown in the next few days. 
  In the 14th Army there are many contractors from Russia; 
they 
have come to serve, and for this they receive not "Kerenskiy" 
money but normal money. And recently there has been increased 
dissatisfaction among officers and noncommissioned officers who 
actually receive several times less than their counterparts in 
Russia. What kind of order do you give in such a situation? 
  They can use Russian money in the commissaries and, 
incidentally, at Russian prices. The merchants will probably 
surround the military compounds with commercial stores, healthy 
market competition will appear, some things will find their way 
to the bazaars, and the merchants will have gasoline, cognac, 
and other niceties of life. Many will enter on the path of 
usury, but that is a matter of their conscience. No prohibitions 
will help here. All able-bodied people of Ukraine are living out 
of suitcases today: They take pork fat--to Moscow and the border 
oblasts of Russia, they get rubles--in exchange for coupons, 
more pork fat--more rubles. 
  It makes me bitter to think that many people of the Dniester 
region will suffer in this situation, but I am powerless to help 
everyone. 
  Since 25 July, when Russia exchanged the old rubles, there 
has been plenty of time to think and we should not waste time on 
empty debates about Yakovlev's theories. In my view they should 
have postponed all those festive trips to America and Austria 
and they should have been working on this day and night and not 
on the development of a concept or a text for the hymn of the 
PMR, which by the time it is approved could turn out to be a 
funeral dirge for the republic. 
  [Platitsyn] You speak about an outbreak of usurious 
activity. 
But as far as I know the authorities are prepared to take 
resolute measures against private black marketeers. 
  [Lebed] Who believes that? For years they have been unable 
to 
drive out the gypsies on one small section who established a 
monopoly on trade in alcohol and tobacco in the city. And you 
talk about resolute measures. Maybe Zagryadskiy or someone will 
fight against the black marketeers during times when they are 
sober? This is a kind of snow job without any snow... 
  [Platitsyn] You have gloomy predictions. Will they come 
true? 
  [Lebed] Definitely. Everything in life develops according 
the 
clearcut laws. We all have the same god. He has mercy on the 
intelligent and just, and he punishes fools and sinners. Moldova 
has introduced the leu. For better or worse you can get 30 cents 
for it. People are gloating over this here, they are figuring 
out when the end will come for the lei, and in terms of 
inflation it is compared with its Romanian brother. Behind the 
primitive political shooting matches they completely forget 
about the hundreds of thousands of people who have relatives on 
the Right Bank who go to Kishinev on business, and there are 
plenty of occasions. For now it is not that the people have 
nothing with which to pay a police fine, they do not even have 
anything with which to buy a piece of bread. So a leu that goes 
through a private party and commercial structures without 
Zagryadskiy's knowledge will sooner or later end up in the 
Dniester region and crowd out the "monopoly money." Instead of 
thinking about solving the problem we are allowing Kondratovich 
to arrange public investigations: Which politicians are "fools 
with unwashed necks" and which have clean necks. It is nothing 
but a big mess.... 
  [Platitsyn] But still the authorities could find a way out 
of 
the situation. Not all of the plans are presented for widespread 
discussion by the masses. 
  [Lebed] They will, by firing into the next ambulance or 
microbus filled with workers.... 
  [Platitsyn] Oh, ho, Aleksandr Ivanovich, you are not saying 
that these barbaric attacks are the work of Shevtsov? That these 
were deliberate bloody provocations to stir up hatred for the 
enemy? 
  [Lebed] For now I do not want to say that. I know only that 
on the days when they were carried out soldiers from both sides 
had abandoned their positions and were fraternizing and 
exchanging triple kisses for Easter. And the politicians did not 
like this. It is not important to me which bank the organizers 
of these monstrous crimes were sitting on. Both of them, greedy 
for high power and unable to find other ways of satisfying their 
political ambitions besides rivers of blood of their faithful 
servants, I would tie together with one rope and drop into the 
Dniester. I am sure that not very many flowers would be thrown 
after them.... 
  [Platitsyn] But are you not afraid of evoking the anger of 
G. 
Andreyeva? In June she stated: "Let them make just one move and 
we will again take up our weapons and fight against Lebed." 
  [Lebed] Let us not get sidetracked by the schizophrenic 
outbursts of that woman whom nobody can put in her place. This 
shows once again the face of the power such advisers wield. 
  [Platitsyn] Incidentally, on 27 November, in an article 
entitled "Has No One Been Forgotten?" published in 
DNESTROVOSKAYA PRAVDA, N. Vorobyev, who through his reporting is 
constantly spreading a pathological hatred for you and the 14th 
Army, reported how Lebed's "soldiers" in bulletproof vests 
degraded the dignity of valiant fighters from Kostenko's 
battalion, demanding that they give up one at a time and come 
out of the school without their weapons.... 
  [Lebed] I have already said that it was stupid to sign off 
on 
the measure. In order to dot all the i's, let us return to the 
document. I have before me order No. 53 of 12 July 1992. I quote 
verbatim: "Recently there have been more frequent cases of 
arbitrary abandonment of combat positions (desertion) by 
individual military servicemen and even entire units. Thus on 
the night of 22 June Lieutenant Colonel Kostenko unilaterally 
led his subdivisions away from their positions into the city of 
Bendery and made other units to do the same thing, which was a 
treasonous violation of the order on retaining the units at the 
line they had reached. There had also been similar treasonous 
actions previously. At the present time units of the Second 
Motorized Infantry Battalion RG [expansion not given] under the 
leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Kostenko did not carry out the 
order to liberate the city and are engaged in looting and even 
murdering peaceful residents." With this same order the 
battalion commander replaced Kostenko with Lieutenant Colonel 
A.G. Askerov. Who signed this order? The chief of the 
administration of defense of the PMR and the current inspector 
general of the Dniester troops, General S. Kitsak. The order was 
signed and I was instructed to remove Kostenko. These are the 
kinds of valiant "protectors" whom Madame Vorobyev is now trying 
to make look good. And I could give a couple more examples of 
"valor and heroism" so that people will know how everything 
really was. And where did the dozens missing in action go? Time 
will also provide an answer to this.... 
  [Platitsyn] From my discussion with you I get the impression 
that the PMR today... 
  [Lebed] ...The rule of arbitrariness and lawlessness. I know 
for certain that this republic, created against a background of 
the noble idea of fighting nationalism, has gradually been 
transformed into an instrument for uncontrolled rule of people 
and mockery of moral sense in the name of satisfying the greedy 
whims of a pathetic band. The authorities are answerable to 
absolutely no one in this drive, which is protected by Russian 
peacekeepers on the one side and Ukrainian border guards on the 
other. Alas we have not yet learned to answer to our own 
conscience.... 
  [Platitsyn] Aleksandr Ivanovich, everything is in somber 
tones, there is no light. Where can poor Ivan go? 
  [Lebed] Anna Zakhrovna Volkova has uttered some remarkable 
words: "Think, people!" I can only add: "Think and act, people! 
Act before they have bridled you completely and turned you into 
speechless cattle! Respect your own humanity! Get rid of the 
crooks who are capitalizing like parasites on the results of 
your labor! Act, people! Act before it is too late." 
  And there is no need to suggest how our people should act. 
Our people are not stupid.

<F P=106> [Interview with Konstantin Taushanzhi, head of the Gagauz </F>
People's Party, recorded by P. Lyutyy; place and date not given: 
"By the Thorny Path of Choice"] 
  [Text] The Gagauz People's Party, which is headed by 
Konstantin Taushanzhi, the well-known economist and politician 
and head of a department of Komrat State University, has 
unequivocally advocated elections to the Moldovan Parliament on 
the territory of areas of compact residence of the Gagauz. The 
Gagauz People's Party (GNP) is guided only by parliamentary 
methods, prohibiting confrontation, the use of force, and so 
forth. 
  This is what Konstantin Taushanzhi says on this subject: 
  [Taushanzhi] First, we are convinced that participation in 
the elections expresses the interests of an absolute majority of 
the Gagauz population and that there is no alternative to 
peaceful dialogue and negotiations. The power method, the method 
of confrontation, has not produced and will not produce results. 
We have already experienced this, when armed persons prohibited 
the inhabitants of our districts from taking part in the 
elections for president of the Republic of Moldova. We proceed 
from the fact that participation in the elections is the 
constitutional duty of each citizen, it is his right and 
obligation, if you wish; and if there is even only one single 
person wishing to cast his vote for a future deputy, all the 
conditions for the realization of his right must be created. 
Disregard for this right, pressure, bans, and threats are just 
further disgraceful stunts of the compromised leadership of the 
Gagauz Republic. They are the embodiment of the ignorance of the 
self-proclaimed leaders of Gagauzia, who want to decide for the 
people. 
  [Lyutyy] What is the explanation for the policy of the 
present Komrat leaders? 
  [Taushanzhi] Their fear of the people. After all, their 
behavior, all their actions, their spending, and so forth have 
to be answered for. The people have been waiting for this 
account for three years now. Since 1990, when the workers of the 
villages and towns made their modest contribution (money) to the 
cause of national revival, for the support of the Provisional 
Committee, and then for the opening of the university. We made 
these facts known at that time and thanked via the newspaper all 
those who made these donations. And now what? The group of 
"leaders" has surrounded itself with armed persons and is 
pursuing a policy that is bringing the Gagauz people burdens and 
deprivations. The present leaders are rejecting all projects; no 
proposals for a peaceful settlement of the matter are to their 
liking. I am sure that were they given autonomy, even a republic 
within a confederative Moldova, they would reject this also. 
Because it would, all the same, be necessary to render account 
and be responsible. And they have nothing to tell people; they 
have brought them to poverty by their obduracy and unwillingness 
to conduct a civilized and honest dialogue. 
  [Lyutyy] Konstantin Petrovich, how did the Gagauz Party 
emerge? 
  [Taushanzhi] It was forced into being by the policy of a 
small group of people called leaders who could by turns, without 
shame or conscience, trample on anyone who thinks or, even more, 
acts differently. The party's goals are a peaceful solution of 
the Gagauz issue, the increased social protection of society, 
and the realization of economic reforms, and we are opposed to 
criminal privatization. 
  These are the people's hopes. 
  As far as our opponents are concerned, I would advise them 
to 
pay heed to the people. But they have become confused. They have 
forgotten that the republic should serve the people, not the 
other way about. It would now seem that people have been rounded 
up by force as hostages; and I am overwhelmed by a sense of 
grievance and exasperation that we can find ourselves the 
victims in a political game, which is resumed on each occasion 
by a "third party," attempting to incite disagreements between 
the Gagauz and Moldovans. So I would like to say that the 
slogan: "Nobodies have become everything," is once again 
pertinent today; that a parallel can be drawn with 1946-1949, 
when arrogance and ignorance were dominant and when questions of 
the building of the kolkhozes, dispatch to Siberia, and so forth 
were decided only by weapons. Can it be that 50 years later we 
have taken this same route in Komrat? 
  It is hard to believe, but it is so. "President" Stepan 
Topal 
appeals to the people "to defend Gagauz's gains." What is he 
talking about?! Can it not be seen that the living standard is 
falling and that crime is growing menacingly? The "upper 
stratum" has sunk to an impossible level. What is happening 
currently in Komrat is reminiscent of a sandbox game: We have 
created a republic with the name of "Laughter and Tears," we 
have created a state, seemingly, in which turmoil and 
lawlessness reign (but there is a heap of ministers, on the 
other hand!). For this reason there is no Gagauz Republic either 
de facto or de jure. There is a handful of adventurers, and 
that's that. 
  [Lyutyy] What can you say about the party's immediate plans? 
  [Taushanzhi] Soon we will be choosing the parties to which 
to 
affiliate at the elections. We are oriented as yet toward the 
three parties that support the integrity and independence of 
Moldova, oppose unification with anyone at all, and support the 
Gagauz areas being given special status within the framework of 
international law. We regret that the Parliament of the Republic 
of Moldova has not lowered for us the 4 percent quota at the 
elections. 
  Further, we understand that the leaders from Komrat have a 
desire to preserve the conflict with Chisinau (in order that it 
might always be possible to exacerbate relations as they see 
fit), but the position of certain ministers of the Republic of 
Moldova, who in the guise of compromises are supporting the 
present Komrat leaders in every possible way, is absolutely 
incomprehensible. 
  Time will tell how correct our course proves, but even today 
the number of people supporting and sympathizing with us is 
getting larger and larger. And this implants confidence in the 
choice of a difficult, but correct and honest path for the 
achievement of the hopes and aspirations of the Gagauz people.

<F P=106> [Interview with S. Topal by S. Fedorova; place and date not </F>
given: "The `Gagauz Budget' Could Be Called Regional"] 
  [Text] The election campaign in the republic has 
introduced disagreements to the South, previously united in its 
positions. The decision of the Chadyr-Lungskiy District Soviet 
to participate in the elections for a new Parliament of Moldova 
has evoked an angry response in the administration of the 
region. The local soviets were dissolved in connection with this 
document. The Supreme Soviet of the region, however, whose 
position coincides with the policy of its leadership, has been 
preserved. 
  Nonetheless, there has been movement in the dialogue 
between Komrat and Chisinau. It is the economy that is prompting 
this primarily. The Bujak steppe, whose main income was and 
remains agriculture, under the conditions of isolation has been 
condemned to quite a meager existence. It is the understanding 
of this that is the basis of the decision of the Chadyr-Lungskiy 
deputies. 
  Our interview with Stepan Topal, chief of the 
administration of the region, deals with the new situation in 
the southern districts and the progress of the dialogue with 
Chisinau. 
  [Fedorova] If it is no secret, the essence of your last 
meeting with Moldovan President M. Snegur. On whose initiative 
did it take place, incidentally? 
  [Topal] It dealt with a settlement of relations concerning 
the budget. A year ago we raised the question of the region's 
own budget and payments into the republic coffers. 
Unfortunately, the Ministry of Finance did not settle this 
problem. We then independently voted our own budget in the 
Parliament. Payments to Moldova's coffers have been made 
punctiliously. We understand that payments for health care and 
the defense of the state, since we are a part of it, and so 
forth are necessary. A year has passed, we have come to think 
differently; there has been some change in this respect in 
Chisinau also, and there is hope that we can come to some 
arrangement. This, therefore, was followed by the proposal that 
the two parties sit down and talk out the current problems. The 
response, though, was as follows: Your budget is illegal. But a 
fact is fact, and we have been in existence for three years now. 
If you do not like the wording "Gagauz budget," you can call it 
a regional budget. We want monies for our own needs to stay here 
in the region. 
  [Fedorova] Are you encountering what is being called a 
financial blockade of the southern areas? 
  [Topal] I would speak, rather, about an economic blockade. 
What is meant by this? Agreements between the Government of 
Moldova and our farms on the supply of agricultural products 
(grain, milk, meat, tobacco, sunflower seed, and so forth) were 
signed at the start of the year. In exchange the appropriate 
departments undertook to supply us with energy resources. We are 
fulfilling the government order, but we have received only 50-60 
percent of the promised fuel. As a result 10,000 hectares have 
gone unplowed. 
  [Fedorova] Considering the situation in Chadyr-Lunga, can it 
be said that the opinion of the Gagauz in respect to the 
forthcoming parliamentary elections in Moldova is unequivocal? 
  [Topal] The leadership's decision is unequivocal. There is 
the decision of the Parliament on nonparticipation in the 
elections prior to the Moldovan leadership's settlement of the 
Gagauz issue. We held rallies in the villages of Chadyr-Lungskiy 
District, and they confirmed our decision. 
  [Fedorova] But the district soviet went on record with a 
different decision, nonetheless.... 
  [Topal] Half the deputies of the district soviet are 
Bulgarians. Their position is different from ours. But we 
believe that they are wrong in deciding for the Gagauz in this 
instance. This was the reason for the subsequent edict on the 
dissolution of the local soviets. 
  [Fedorova] In counting on continuing the dialogue with 
Chisinau, what will Komrat defend? Can it agree to a culturally 
autonomous formation and the relative economic independence of 
the region, toward which, generally, current realities are 
pushing it? 
  [Topal] We will talk about a federation for we need some 
political guarantees in the future. Life is no worse for 
European countries formed according to this principle. 
  [Fedorova] Nonetheless, some things are changing. The 
retransfer of the Bujak battalion to the command of the Moldovan 
Ministry of Internal Affairs points to this. Gagauz guardsmen 
will now, as far as we know, be called carabinieri.... 
  [Topal] This decision was connected with the need to somehow 
legitimize the armed formations, and to socially protect the 
officers. The carabinieri will be formed from local inhabitants, 
and the candidates for brigade commander will be recommended by 
us and approved in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Moldova. 
This formation will uphold public order. 
  [Fedorova] Who will finance it? 
  [Topal] The local budget. 
  [Fedorova] The local police operate according to the same 
principle: They are composed mainly of Gagauz, but come under 
the jurisdiction of the district department of the republic's 
Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
  [Topal] Yes, the principle of dual subordination will 
operate. 
  [Fedorova] You recently returned from Turkey, but were, I 
believe, heading for America.... 
  [Topal] The purpose of the trip had, indeed, been the United 
States, to which I had been invited to an assembly of Turkic 
peoples. Chisinau would not draw up a visa for America so I went 
to Istanbul, hoping to get one there. But here I had to change 
my plans since it was explained to me that putting together the 
requisite papers takes quite some time. After several meetings 
with our students in Turkey and members of the Turkish 
Parliament and also with the Red Crescent mission, therefore, I 
came home. 
  [Fedorova] Does the Red Crescent mission mean possible 
humanitarian assistance? 
  [Topal] Yes. We received such in the spring. They promise 
further assistance. 
  [Fedorova] Are there any investments of Turkish 
entrepreneurs 
in the Bujak steppe? We were counting on this here a year ago 
even.... 
  [Topal] Not as yet. Unless we count several private bakeries 
built in Komrat, Chadyr-Lunga, and Vulkaneshty. But there has 
been cultural assistance. Our students are being taught in 
Turkey, and their grants are being paid by the Turkish 
Government. We are being helped with literature and textbooks. 
  [Fedorova] Is this assistance being rendered on the basis of 
the intergovernmental Moldovan-Turkish agreements? 
  [Topal] Yes. 
  [Fedorova] At what level is Komrat in contact with Chisinau? 
  [Topal] Vice Premier Oliynik and the ministers of internal 
affairs and security have been here. Although there are no 
planned negotiations, there have been meetings with the top 
leadership. Very soon there will be a meeting with M. Snegur, I 
believe. We have proposed it.

<F P=106> [Article by Nicolae Chirtoaca, chairman of the Liberal </F>
Convention of Moldova: "OBSERVATORUL Juggles the Facts"] 
  [Text] The protracted current crisis in the country, the 
decline in the population's standard of living, the 
contradictory nature of measures being taken by the executive 
power in the attempts to stabilize the economic situation, the 
sound-bite populism and declarativeness with which our political 
life is replete create the background of human fatigue and 
nostalgic moods against which the elections to the supreme 
legislative organ of the country will take place. 
  Under these conditions, the responsibility of political 
parties and movements of truly democratic, reformist orientation 
is high. By pulling together they can still restore the 
influence and role of common democratic movement, which have 
begun all the transformations that have occurred in the Republic 
of Moldova between 1987 and today, mobilize the creative 
potential of the society, and develop and implement concrete 
effective programs for stabilizing the situation and proceeding 
to a new qualitative level of social and economic development. 
  The complexity of tasks facing the democratic movement in 
the 
country at this important stage demands a constructive approach 
on the part of political parties and public movements united by 
common ideals and goals. For this we need, first and foremost, 
to get rid of narrow group interests, corporate ambitions, and 
the desire to establish oneself at the expense of discrediting 
and diminishing political opponents and the organizations they 
represent. 
  In this context, a graphic example of confrontational style 
in thinking and approach to political reality are some articles 
about the LCM [Liberal Convention of Moldova] that appeared in 
the OBSERVATORUL newspaper. By juggling and distorting the 
facts, the authors of these materials, in particular V. Butnaru, 
try to portray me as a dissident, who has challenged all the 
president's men and jumped into the vortex of political struggle 
with the purpose of exposing and denouncing others. Fortunately, 
I have not had the fortune of earning a general's rank in the 
national army in order to afford myself the luxury of taking the 
stance of an exposer. Moreover, I consider such actions 
destructive and useless unless they are followed by concrete 
proposals on how to improve the situation and concrete efforts 
aimed at overcoming the shortcomings. The main reason for my 
voluntary resignation from the job of state adviser on military 
issues was the realization of the need to consolidate the forces 
of centrist, reformist orientation in Moldova, to unite the 
people who are concerned with the future of the country and see 
the way out of the crisis situation by working out an integrated 
and concrete concept on the basis of values of modern liberalism 
and creative rethinking of the experience of developed 
democratic countries. When others placed their trust in me by 
electing me the chairman of the Liberal Convention of Moldova, I 
made a decision to completely concentrate on political 
activities, seeing it as the most important of all on the 
difficult road to a new democratic state of the society. 
  I believe that the president of Moldova, Mr. Mircea Snegur, 
has taken upon himself the burden of one of the most difficult 
tasks of the transition period--to ensure a gradual reform of 
the economy, democratization of the society, prevention of 
extremes, and resolution of conflict situations from the 
position of common sense and taking into account the current 
realities. Being a guarantor of these transformations, a 
middleman in the competition of new political parties, the 
president of the country frequently becomes a target of 
criticism on the part of radical and extremist forces, of those 
groups that are against territorial integrity and independence 
of Moldova. 
  The Liberal Convention has proclaimed its support for those 
forces that aid in the implementation of real reforms while 
preserving stability in the society. Guided first and foremost 
by its program planks, the LCM will strive to implement concrete 
comprehensive plans developed on the basis of the liberal idea, 
and is ready to constructively cooperate with all political and 
public organizations that share these principles.

Procedures for the Enactment of the Law by Kamenskiy, 
Komratskiy, Grigoriopolskiy, Rybnitskiy, and Sloboziyskiy Rayon 
Executive Committees and the Mayoralties of the Cities of 
Bendery, Dubesar, Rybnitsa, and Tiraspol"] 
  [Text] In keeping with Article 2, Point L of the 
Parliament's decree on the procedures for enacting the Law on 
Elections to Parliament dated 19 November 1993 and the calendar 
of election campaign events approved by the Central Electoral 
Commission on 5 November 1993, rayon executive committees and 
city mayoralties were to submit for approval to the Central 
Electoral Commission the composition of a technical group before 
8 November 1993, and before 10 November 1993, announcements by 
the mayoralties of respective population centers regarding 
electoral precincts, their boundaries, location, and telephone 
numbers, as well as proposals with respect to candidates for 
chairmen of precinct electoral commissions. 
  An absolute majority of top officials of rayon executive 
committees and city mayoralties have submitted these documents 
and information in a timely manner. 
  Executive committees of such rayons as Kamenskiy, 
Komratskiy, 
Grigoriopolskiy, Rybnitskiy, and Sloboziyskiy Rayon Executive 
Committees, as well as the mayoralties of the cities of Bendery, 
Dubesar, Rybnitsa, and Tiraspol ignore the provisions of the 
elections law and directives of the Central Electoral 
Commission, refusing to send the necessary information and 
organize the preparations for, and the conduct of, elections to 
Parliament. 
  The aforementioned rayon executive committees and city 
mayoralties block the preparation for and the conduct of 
elections in respective rayons, and prevent residents of these 
population centers from exercising freely their right to elect 
and to be elected. 
  Based on the above, the Central Electoral Commission 
resolved: 
  1. To demand the Government of the Republic of Moldova 
jointly with the executive committees of Kamenskiy, Komratskiy, 
Grigoriopolskiy, Rybnitskiy, and Sloboziyskiy Rayon Executive 
Committees, as well as mayoralties of the cities of Bendery, 
Dubesar, Rybnitsa, and Tiraspol, take appropriate measures for 
the preparation for and the conduct of elections in these 
population centers in accordance with the provisions of the Law 
on Elections of Parliament and Parliament's Decree on the 
Procedures for Enacting the Law on the Elections of the 
Parliament dated 19 October 1993. 
  2. To make it incumbent upon the chairmen of Kamenskiy, 
Komratskiy, Grigoriopolskiy, Rybnitskiy, and Sloboziyskiy Rayon 
Executive Committees, and the mayors of the cities of Bendery, 
Dubesar, Rybnitsa, and Tiraspol to submit for the Central 
Electoral Commission's approval the composition of a technical 
group and announcements of the mayoralties of respective 
population centers regarding electoral precincts, their 
boundaries, location, and telephone numbers, as well as 
proposals with respect to candidates for chairmen of precinct 
electoral commissions, and decisions of communities and cities 
councils on the composition of precinct electoral commissions 
before 20 December 1993. 
  3. To inform the Republic of Moldova's procurator of 
noncompliance with the Law on Elections to Parliament on the 
part of aforementioned rayon executive committees and city 
mayoralties in order to take appropriate steps in accordance 
with the current legislation.

<F P=106> [Interview with the President of the Seabeco Group Boris </F>
Birshteyn by unidentified INFOTAG agency correspondent; place 
and date not given: "Boris Birshteyn: `There Is A Sensible 
Compromise Between the Three Branches of Power in Moldova"] 
  [Text] President of the Seabeco Group Boris Birshteyn 
paid a brief business visit to Moldova a few days ago. An 
INFOTAG agency correspondent conducted a brief interview with 
him. 
  [INFOTAG] Mr. Birshteyn, how do you see the current 
situation 
in Moldova? 
  [Birshteyn] In my opinion, as compared to neighboring states 
the situation in the republic today is healthy. Healthy in the 
sense that all three branches of power have found a very 
sensible compromise. This leads me to the conclusion that 
Moldova is going the right way. 
  [INFOTAG] The opposition would disagree with you. 
  [Birshteyn] The existence of an opposition is a normal 
phenomenon inherent in any civilized state. Everybody has a 
right to his own opinion. Some political forces believe that 
Moldova should unite with Romania; others--with the CIS; and 
still others see it as an independent state. 
  [INFOTAG] Which one of the three options is more realistic? 
  [Birshteyn] What is realistic is that in the final analysis 
the people choose their own way. My opinion is this. Since 
Moldova has gained independence, it should be preserved. I know 
many examples of countries fighting for their independence. But 
I cannot remember a single reverse example of a country looking 
for a way out of independence. 
  [INFOTAG] Why do you think this is happening? 
  [Birshteyn] I think that the roots of this phenomenon are in 
the current difficult economic situation. But if we look today 
at Moldova, which is in a deep economic crisis, and compare it 
with neighboring states, I am optimistic. For instance, the 
Ukrainian leadership today is facing a much heavier burden of 
problems than the Moldovan authorities. 
  [INFOTAG] This does not make it easier for the people. 
  [Birshteyn] The population must realize that it is 
impossible 
to build a new healthy economy without having lived through the 
current difficulties. Moldova has an absolutely realistic 
opportunity to become, shall we say, in about five years a pearl 
in the center of Europe. 
  The Seabeco Group has an interest in working in Moldova. As 
a 
human being, I like this land and the people living here. I 
think that the company has already demonstrated in practice that 
we did not come here to grab something--we came here to help. 
  [INFOTAG] What about business interests? 
  [Birshteyn] We are not hiding the fact that in time we count 
on making money here. I want to point out that I am not in the 
position of a businessman looking for quick profits. I am in no 
hurry because I understand that any serious business begins with 
investing money. 
  [INFOTAG] There is a lot of controversial information in 
Moldova regarding Birshteyn's "mission" in stopping the 
bloodshed in Bendery. What really happened? 
  [Birshteyn] My role was quite modest. I simply brought 
together all those people who were in a position to adopt a 
sensible decision. 
  [INFOTAG] Tell us your secret: What projects is the Seabeco 
Group working on in Moldova these days? 
  [Birshteyn] There are several projects in the works that we 
hope to implement in the republic. All involve agriculture... 
  [INFOTAG] And to be more specific... 
  [Birshteyn] These are projects involving complete-cycle 
production facilities that will make ready-to-use products 
instead of selling raw materials. It is profitable both for the 
state and the producer to sell the finished product. My opinion 
is that it would be wrong to shift production into 
nontraditional spheres. 
  Agriculture is a traditional business for Moldova. This is 
what we need to develop. 
  [INFOTAG] Your company has ceased working in Kyrgyzstan. 
Why? 
  [Birshteyn] I am flabbergasted over people's lack of 
integrity when I hear my name "trashed around" in the Kyrgyz 
parliament. This is all dirty intrigues and dirty politics... 
  [INFOTAG] What about the gold reserves? Is it true that they 
have been taken out of Kyrgyzstan? 
  [Birshteyn] We have not taken anything out of Kyrgyzstan. On 
the contrary, we have invested a lot of money and effort. Logic 
says that people should be grateful to us. Alas. History puts 
everything in its proper place, however. By such, if I may call 
them "actions," Kyrgyz politicians are making a reputation for 
themselves. 
  Instead of creating conditions to attract foreign 
investment, 
some current politicians in Bishkek are choosing the option of 
going around the world begging. This is not a solution. 
  [INFOTAG] By the way, speaking about conditions--how are 
they 
in Moldova, in your opinion? 
  [Birshteyn] Moldova is creating precisely these conditions. 
I 
do not want to say that there are no difficulties for foreign 
businessmen here. They do exist, and unfortunately quite a few. 
But it also is absolutely clear that in the end, when searching 
for a solution to any problem, no matter how complex, we will 
find mutual understanding. 
  [INFOTAG] From the point of view of a businessman, which 
economic sectors in Moldova deserve major financial infusion? 
  [Birshteyn] In my opinion, the potentially promising sectors 
in the republic would be agriculture, light industry, and 
tourism. Moldova is a very beautiful corner of the world; 
provided a certain infrastructure is in place, it could become 
attractive for many categories of tourists. 
  [INFOTAG] On 29 November the republic introduced its own 
national currency--the Moldovan leu. Since that time the foreign 
currency exchange has been registering a small but steady 
decline in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar in relation to 
the leu. In your opinion, is this a real or an artificially 
created phenomenon? 
  [Birshteyn] Unfortunately, I am not familiar with the real 
situation in this area. But I want to say that introducing a 
national currency is a competent step, and most importantly, 
timely. A monetary unit is one of the attributes of statehood. 
  With respect to the decline of the U.S. dollar rate in 
relation to the leu, my guess is that the National Bank probably 
has a stabilization fund. I think that we should not get 
euphoric on the subject of the declining exchange rate of the 
American currency. Although of course it is necessary to strive 
for stability of the leu. Even though it will not be easy to 
maintain the rate. 
  [INFOTAG] In your opinion, should political forces in 
Moldova 
learn a lesson from the election results in Russia? 
  [Birshteyn] I think there is not much of a lesson for 
political parties in Moldova to be learned from the results of 
the elections to the State Duma of Russia. Why? The situation in 
Chisinau is completely different. I think there will be no 
surprises at the elections to the new parliament. I am certain 
that the winners in the elections will be logic and common sense.

<F P=106> [Article by Oazu Nantoi: "Let Us Not Urge Going Forward </F>
Looking Backward"] 
  [Text] The subject of the article "Who Is the Leftist of 
Them All?" (KISHINEVSKIYE NOVOSTI No. 51, 4 December of this 
year) [For a translation of this article, see pages 75-77 of the 
FBIS REPORT: CENTRAL EURASIA, FBIS-USR-002, dated 10 January 
1994] was the difference between socialists and social-democrats 
in Moldova. First, we have to thank Mr. Morev for drawing this 
distinction, because at the other end of the polemic spectrum 
there are attempts to discredit us--social-democrats--precisely 
by putting us in the same boat with socialists. 
  Now on substance. Mr. Morev accuses us of being a party of 
national bourgeoisie. Yes, the social democrats as early as in 
the spring of 1991 submitted to the parliament an alternative 
draft of the Law on Privatization, and this is just as true as 
the fact that our draft contained a privatization mechanism 
(which later was included in the final law) that gives every 
citizen of Moldova a chance to own property. 
  It is this privatization mechanism in the social democrats' 
version, that is based on the idea of privatization through 
registered national wealth bonds (rather than through 
depersonalized vouchers as in Russia), and that, if we finally 
succeed in implementing this mechanism, will contribute to 
forming in the Republic of Moldova a rather numerous and stable 
stratum of property owners, who, as any schoolboy knows this 
days, are a guarantee of social stability, dynamic economy, and 
real social protection in the society. 
  It is not the social democrats' fault that the State 
Privatization Program was adopted by the parliament (in which 
the Conciliere--Accord club, currently headed by Mr. Morev, 
carried rather substantial weight: more than 30 deputies) almost 
two years after the adoption of the aforementioned law. And that 
esteemed deputies, including Mr. Morev and his club mates, 
should probably ask themselves: What kind of a government have 
we formed that still does not implement the laws we have passed? 
  Or another example of election-time populism: "We think," 
Mr. 
Morev tells us, "that on 27 February 1944 it is necessary to 
submit to a referendum the question of the political 
independence of the Republic of Moldova, and its joining the CIS 
and its economic union." But why did you, the people's 
representatives, not resolve all these issues when the 
parliament still continued to function, albeit as a formality. 
  The SDPM [Social Democratic Party of Moldova] never 
concealed 
its position regarding the need to hold a referendum on the 
issue of Moldovan statehood. Everybody who is familiar with our 
activities, knows this, as well as that from the moment the 
party was founded in May 1990, social democrats consistently 
supported state independence. We present this position 
absolutely clearly not only in Chisinau, but also in Moscow, 
Bucharest, Tiraspol, and Komrat. This position is "what you see 
is what you get"--when we proclaim ourselves supporters of state 
independence in Chisinau, we do not send our 
representatives--like the Socialist Party did--to the congress 
of the peoples of the USSR (Moscow, September 1993). 
  Also very endearing is Mr. Morev's concern regarding 
establishing "true people's power" on Moldovan soil. In short, 
Soviet power. But have not citizens of our country had the 
opportunity to see for themselves that what had been called 
Soviet power could exist only in the environment of one party's 
diktat, and as soon as this diktat disappears, Supreme Soviets 
inevitably drive themselves into a dead end, and take the entire 
society with them? 
  "Demo-cracy" is precisely "people's power." But democracy 
can 
only exist when there is a functioning law-based state: clear 
separation of powers, multiple parties, periodic free elections 
on a multiparty basis, and a referendum. And all of this only on 
the foundation of a constitution, which the current deputies 
also for some reason failed to adopt. But democracy is not a 
"citizens rally" under the title of "High National Assembly" and 
not 380 people's representatives who do not answer to anything 
and who are holding sessions under the banner "All Power to the 
Soviets." 
  Now regarding the Moldovan social democrats' position on the 
tragic events in Moscow at the beginning of this year's October, 
as mentioned by Mr. Morev. It is enough to read our official 
documents of that time to see that the SDPM was not ecstatic 
over the no-win situation in the Russian Federation, as well as 
over the turn of events when instead of the force of law Moscow 
chose the right of force. In our statement on the topic of the 
latter, we expressed our deep concern over confrontational 
processes in Russia and expressed hope that a way out of the 
conflict would be found on the basis of free expression of the 
people's will. 
  I would like to note, however, that while we strive to move 
toward modern European social democratic values, the SDPM is 
certainly not a "foreign-oriented" political force. After all, 
the real orientation of a party shows, let me put it this way, 
in the domestic market. And here I have to remind our political 
opponents that when blood was being spilled in Moldova on the 
left bank of Dniester, many now "bold" political parties for 
some reason remained mum... And so did some individual people's 
deputies, who now are very "brave." 
  The only party that issued a stern warning that the 
resolution of the Dniester crisis by military means, reliance on 
violent methods, will bring Moldova to a catastrophe to the 
state structures and the public in the spring of 1992 were 
social democrats. Unfortunately, our lone voice was not heard. 
  In conclusion I would like to point out that there are 
people 
now who are trying to resurrect a split in the society that 
existed in 1989-1990. At the time the opposing forces "marked" 
people by their ethnic attribute. Now the people are quite tired 
of hysteria and are more inclined to think about the daily 
bread. However, the temptation to divide everybody into "us" and 
"them" turned out quite resilient, so now the readers are 
reminded that Nantoi used to belong to the "front" (not as a 
cochairman, though--just a deputy chairman)! 
  The Popular Front, just like the Communist Party, initially 
brought under its umbrella people with very different political 
views. I have never been a Communist Party member, but I 
remember very well that some leaders of the National Front of 
Moldova [NFM] had been, and so did Mr. Morev. 
  It took some time for the logic of political events to sort 
out all this confusion and call things their proper names. At 
least I do not intend to deny the facts of my biography: I broke 
up with the NFM in the beginning of 1990 precisely because I 
stuck to my beliefs and did not try to use my position in the 
Front to secure some prestigious job. 
  By the way, a few words about the attitude toward 
"frontism." 
Social democrats have advocated early elections and forming a 
professional parliament on a multiparty basis since last year. 
The greatest rebuke of this idea came from NFM deputies, as well 
as other parties of "democratic orientation." And, strange as it 
may be, most deputies who belong to the Conciliere--Accord club, 
not being "frontists," for all practical purposes ended up in 
the same boat with the NFM. (And Deputy V. Krylov, who 
carelessly voiced his support for an early disbanding of 
parliament, which had discredited itself in the eyes of 
citizens, was replaced as the club leader by "nonfrontist" V. 
Morev). 
  Therefore, as Kozma Prutkov used to say, let us "look into 
the root of things" and not count KISHINEVSKIYE NOVOSTI readers 
as people without memory and without ability to analyze facts. 
As to taking politicians' words at face value, this is not 
recommended in any country.

<F P=106> [Statement of the Social Democratic Party of Moldova </F>
National Coordinating Council: "Danger of the Undermining of the 
National Privatization Process"] 
  [Text] Since the moment it was formed the SDPM [Social 
Democratic Party of Moldova] has been guided by the principle 
according to which the endowment of the citizens of Moldova with 
private property has been the main guarantor of the 
irreversibility of the democratization of society, and the very 
mechanism of privatization shapes its social structure. 
  Proceeding from this, the SDPM proposed in the spring of 
1991 
the alternative draft law "Privatization" providing for its 
realization for registered public property vouchers with the 
participation of all citizens of Moldova. The law 
adopted by parliament in June of the same year contains all the 
basic provisions of the bill proposed by the social democrats. 
It was possible, therefore, to avoid the danger of the 
mafia-type privatization of public property for money. 
  As the process of privatization approached the practical 
implementation stage, resistance on the part of both the 
opponents of economic reform and those who are attempting to 
hand over the people's property to a small group of "moneybags" 
has grown increasingly openly. 
  A method of the direct robbery of broad strata of the 
citizens of Moldova via deprivation of their right to real 
participation in privatization is the displacement of vouchers 
from this process. 
  Back at the start of 1992 the V. Muravschi government, with 
the support of certain parliamentary circles, blocked the 
adoption of the State Privatization Program for a whole 14 
months. Subsequently, in the process of its adoption in 
parliament in 1993, the opponents of public privatization sought 
revisions to it palpably limiting the possibilities of 
privatization for vouchers. While paying lip service to the 
concept of public privatization, the A. Sangheli government in 
practice blocked its practical implementation. 
  Thus the allocation of funds for the preparation of public 
property vouchers and their processing and issue to the citizens 
has been impeded in every possible way. The list of facilities 
of incomplete construction authorized by legislation for 
privatization for cash has not been extended. The issue of 
vouchers to retirees has been blocked thus far. In a whole 
number of localities the authorities are putting obstacles in 
the way of properties subject to privatization being put up for 
auction. The so-called State Property Fund--one further 
bureaucratic structure designed to torpedo in practice 
privatization for vouchers--was created beneath the signboard of 
protection of the property interests of the Republic of Moldova. 
  Finally, the opponents of public privatization have openly 
gone against their own people, seeking with the assistance of 
the Ministry of Economics and the above-mentioned Fund the 
adoption on 29 November 1993 by the Committee for Monetary 
Reform of a decision on the unrestricted use in the 
privatization process of the Moldavian lei and convertible 
currency together with public property vouchers, without 
limitation of the spheres of their circulation. 
  The SDPM has already observed that because of the continuing 
decline in production and the absence of the requisite commodity 
backing the Moldavian lei faces the threat of rapid 
depreciation. The organizers of such monetary reform, 
endeavoring to conceal the deplorable results of the policy they 
are pursuing, have taken an unprecedented step--a cardinal 
change in the essence of privatization in Moldova and the 
emasculation of its social focus. 
  In making possible the displacement of the voucher by 
money the present government is condemning it to devaluation and 
creating obviously unequal opportunities for the participation 
in the privatization process of millions of citizens. Public 
property is in fact being handed over to several corrupt 
clans. 
  As a result of the above-mentioned step Moldova's production 
potential will in a short space of time have been grabbed by 
criminal capital, and the citizens will have been deprived 
forever of the right to own property created by their labor. The 
buying up for a pittance of the public property vouchers and 
their exchange for large blocks of shares will impede for a long 
term the creation of a securities market--a practical measure 
under Moldova's conditions en route to the strengthening of the 
national currency. 
  In the version that is being imposed on us privatization 
will 
be undertaken by a narrow stratum of "moneybags," and the 
process of Moldova's economic recovery will drag on for decades, 
demanding increasingly new foreign loans, for which our children 
and grandchildren will have to pay. 
  The SDPM declares that under the conditions of the total 
lack 
of control on the part of the paralyzed legislative body the 
government is directly violating current legislation. The mere 
fact of the use of wording of the "with subsequent confirmation 
by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova" type testifies 
that the present government has gambled on avowedly antireform 
political forces coming to power on 27 February 1994. 
  The SDPM appeals to the president of the Republic of Moldova 
for the reversal of the antipopular decisions depriving all of 
us of the right to property. 
  The SDPM calls on the unions of the Republic of Moldova to 
come to the defense of their members' real interests. 
  [Dated] 2 December 1993, Chisinau

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Kisherin by Viktor Starik; place </F>
and date not given: "`The Main Policy Is the Economy'"] 
  [Text] Our paper has already informed readers that a 
new social and political organization--the Economic Revival of 
Moldova Party--has been formed in the city of Belts. A sponsor 
of the formation of the new party is the well-known entrepreneur 
A. Kisherin, head of the Kisherin &amp; Co. concern. Our own 
correspondent in Belts met with Mr. Kisherin and asked him to 
answer a number of questions. 
  [Starik] Aleksandr Alekseyevich, as far as I know, you were 
never a member of any party or involved in politics previously. 
Why did you, a prosperous, respected person, doing what you like 
best, want to get into.... 
  [Kisherin] Do not go on, I know what you are going to 
say--politics is a dirty business. And I agree, but only when 
ambitious people who are backed by nothing other than a set of 
populist phrases and slogans take up politics. They, truly, make 
all kinds of promises and quite unconcernedly go about their 
business, enjoying the blandishments of power. I ask forgiveness 
for the excessively strong language, some people will not like 
it, naturally, but speaking openly, plainly is in my nature. 
This is my problem and my good fortune. I have had unpleasant 
situations and have made enemies, but even more have I found 
friends, who like my candor. They trust me and believe me. This 
was a factor that brought me to the party. 
  I never was, truly, a member of any party. I was involved in 
the economy and I understand some things here and I can see that 
it is currently on the brink of ruin. Struggling alone makes no 
sense. We have assembled a team of fellow thinkers who evaluate 
events identically and who know how to find a way out of the 
impasse situation. 
  [Starik] You see light at the end of the tunnel, then? 
  [Kisherin] Yes, together we have formulated a program for 
the 
extrication of the republic's economy from the impasse. We are 
publishing this program and will not, therefore, touch on it 
now. Specially since we will not be revealing any special 
truths: We will simply struggle to ensure that the manufacturer 
and entrepreneur may work efficiently and productively, 
manufacture output, pay people, and well, for their work, and 
sell the commodities where there is demand for them. 
  [Starik] This is in the sphere of the economy. What does 
your 
party offer in the social and political plane? 
  [Kisherin] It seems to me that our society simply cannot rid 
itself of the complexes of the socialist system, when everyone, 
be he of Solomonic wisdom or an outright slacker, must be 
supported. At the expense of the state. It is time to understand 
that the main policy in all spheres should be the economy. It 
should put man at the forefront. If we resolve economic 
problems, political problems, the social problems will disappear 
of their own accord. 
  You took a stab at me here, saying I am a prosperous 
individual. Yes, I can allow myself to take my family to Miami, 
Switzerland, wherever I like. No problems. But why should others 
have them--young families, students, old people who have spent 
all their lives working for this system, and large families that 
cannot now make ends meet, and the state has forgotten about 
them. It was for the sake of social justice that we created the 
Economic Revival Party, and it will struggle for a better life 
for all strata of society and influence government policy in 
this respect. And seek a preponderance in favor of the working 
man. 
  Look what is happening, after all: Production is grinding to 
a halt, and people capable of working well are finding 
themselves on the street, not to mention old people, the infirm, 
and children. And why? Because some people wanted to play at 
politics for politics' sake. Having totally forgotten about 
economics. But it does not allow itself to be dependent on 
political ambitions. It is supported on its own laws, which no 
demonstration or edict can abolish. We believe, therefore, that 
the time has come for people who have proven by action that they 
know how to manage to come to power. If only in the example of 
their own enterprise, plant, or factory. Those who are called 
the bread and salt of the economy. 
  Our information: The Kisherin &amp; Co. concern is an 
enterprise of a broad agro-industrial profile. It is known as 
one of the republic's highly profitable enterprises with a 
well-funded social infrastructure. Average wages in the concern 
constitute R150,000 (this material prepared before the money 
exchange). More than 500 new jobs have been created in the past 
two years. Aside from its main profile--the cultivation of 
agricultural products--the concern has a network of commercial 
stores selling consumer goods. The production of packing crates, 
which have helped the farms of the republic considerably in 
saving and selling what they have grown, has been organized here 
as of spring of this year. 
  [Starik] So in creating the party you set your sights on 
acquiring power? 
  [Kisherin] I emphasize once again that there should be at 
the 
helm of the state competent and decisive people who know 
precisely what needs to be done. And the interests of whose 
party they represent are secondary. Just as long as the people 
believe and support them. 
  [Starik] It is being said that the Economic Revival of 
Moldova Party is a millionaires' party. 
  [Kisherin] Ah, this habit of pinning on labels! People are 
still afraid of becoming bourgeois and appearing, according to 
stereotypes, like bad little boys. What is wrong, pray, in a 
person getting on thanks to his intellect, ability, know-how, 
and enterprise. Not by thievery, but by his personal attributes. 
Why is being a millionaire in our Sovman consciousness 
considered a vice, and in America people are proud of this and 
aspire to wealth? What, don't they understand anything, those 
people across the ocean? But we have digressed. 
  There are in our party many industrialists, entrepreneurs, 
bankers, leaders of state-owned enterprises and private firms, 
specialists, and many ordinary workers and peasants. And they 
came to us voluntarily in order to establish together a normal 
life and in order that each of us, be he a member of the 
Economic Revival Party or not, may hope to become a millionaire. 
  [Starik] Are you yourself, Mr. Kisherin, a millionaire? 
  [Kisherin] It is somewhat difficult becoming a millionaire 
with our permanent economic disorders and almost regular 
monetary reforms. But I am able to provide my family with a 
decent living and have a foreign car in the garage and money to 
enable me to feel in charge of the situation in any country. 
Everything earned by the concern is constantly being put to work 
and is making profits. For me and my subordinates. Such is the 
law of the market economy. 
  Decent wages should be received not just by the workers of 
the Kisherin concern, but also by the other inhabitants of our 
republic. And this is possible on one condition: the 
unrestricted development of enterprise. People are reluctant to 
understand this as yet, unfortunately. There is much work to be 
done by our party, using facts and figures, for this simple 
truth to triumph. Democratically, without any social upheavals. 
  [Starik] Aleksandr Alekseyevich, your concern is known also 
for its extensive charitable activity. The church in 
Drokiyevskiy Rayon's village of Kotovo was restored with its 
money, and you support Belts television, the Yunost movie 
theater, artistic groups of the city and the republic, 
athletes.... Will not your assistance grow scarce in connection 
with the formation of the party? After all, it could be that 
some of the resources will be needed for the party coffers. 
  [Kisherin] A party, if it is based on certain economic 
principles, should support itself. Plus the dues and personal 
contributions of its members and organizations, but only for the 
accomplishment of program tasks. We have no intention of 
maintaining a bureaucratic machinery like the former rayon and 
city party committees. Everyone, not apparatchiks, should work 
with the masses. 
  As far as the charity is concerned, we will continue this 
program. Within the framework of the Kisherin &amp; Co. concern 
and 
also within the framework of party activity.

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Bricag, chief specialist of the State </F>
Department for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources: 
"The Ecology. Who Is Supporting Us in International Cooperation 
for Protection of Nature"] 
  [Text] One of the priority areas of the foreign 
policy of the Republic of Moldova is international cooperation 
in the area of environmental protection. Moldova is joining in 
the activity of international environmental protection 
organizations and is participating in the implementation of the 
corresponding conventions and agreements. To do this, an 
Administration of International and Social Relations has been 
created under the State Department for Environmental Protection 
and Natural Resources, and under the National Institute of 
Ecology--a Bureau of International Programs and Projects. The 
solutions to problems of international cooperation of the 
Republic of Moldova in the area of environmental protection is 
discussed by a chief specialist of the State Department for 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, Valeriy 
Bricag. 
  The concrete results of the state department's international 
activity were the ratification by the parliament of the Republic 
of Moldova of the Biodiversity Convention and the endorsement of 
such important documents as the World Charter on Nature, the 
Convention on Crossborder Impact of Industrial Accidents, and 
the Convention on Protecting the Animal Kingdom and the Natural 
Environment in Europe. Moreover, in July 1993 the parliament 
adopted a decree on the creation of a National Autonomous Center 
of the Republic of Moldova in the International System of 
Information on the Environment (INFOTERRA), which gave us access 
to the World Environmental Data Bank. 
  It should be noted that in international cooperation in the 
area of environmental protection, preference should be given to 
concluding bilateral and regional agreements at the state level. 
The endorsement of international conventions should take into 
account, on the one hand, the republic's financial and technical 
capabilities and, on the other, the interests of the state and 
the world community. Both state and nonstate organizations can 
enter international environmental protection organizations. 
Cooperation with international funds, organizations, scientific 
centers, and financial structures should include primarily the 
development and implementation of national ecological projects. 
  As early as 1990, the State Department for Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources came out with an initiative to 
conclude agreements at the level of environmental protection 
organs of the Union republics. This activity has been 
continued--draft agreements have been sent to all the 
independent states of the former USSR. But not all of them have 
shown a readiness to cooperate at this level. Only the first 
protocol has been signed between the State Department for 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of the Republic 
of Moldova and the Ministry of Environmental Protection of 
Ukraine. 
  The Interstate Ecological Council (MES), which anticipates 
cooperation among the CIS countries, was formed in February 
1992. But the Republic of Moldova did not sign the document to 
enter the MES. Moldova has not been represented at a single 
session of the MES. But a department worker participated in the 
work of the group of experts for preparing for the first session 
of the MES, and another one participated as an observer in the 
work of the first meeting of the Coordination Group under the 
MES for cooperation with UNEP [United Nations Environment 
Program] and other international organizations. This group was 
formed by a decision of the third MES session, which took place 
in Tashkent in May 1993, and its goal is to coordinate the 
activity of the MES member countries for creating specialized 
organs for cooperation with the UNEP and other international 
organizations, and also for developing and implementing joint 
ecological projects under the aegis of the UNEP. 
  In the former USSR, the role of a specialized organ for 
cooperation with international environmental protection 
organizations, including UNEP and the World Bank, was assigned 
to the Center for International Projects (TsMP) under the Union 
State Committee for the Protection of Nature. The CIS countries 
decided to take advantage of the experience of the TsMP and, on 
its basis, to create a consultative-executive organ of the 
coordinating group under the MES. 
  Thus, the CIS countries developed their own mechanism for 
interstate and international cooperation, but it is too early to 
judge its effectiveness. In October of this year, an official 
appeal was addressed to the chairman of the parliament of the 
Republic of Moldova from the secretariat of the MES, considering 
the entry of the Republic of Moldova into this organization. I 
think we should get rid of our excessive suspicion regarding all 
structures created within the framework of the former USSR. 
  Representatives of Russia are working in many international 
organizations. The Russian lobby is very influential there. This 
could have decisive significance for us--the success of our 
cause will depend on the position of one or another 
representative of an international organization. Joint entry and 
coordination of activity will help incline international 
organizations to support our country. The TsMP is making a 
commitment to render assistance in international support for 
Moldovan ecological projects and is also prepared to help in the 
organization of a similar center in our republic. 
  We are losing a great deal as a result of delay in solving 
these problems, and we are being left out of the picture. Thus, 
the British company Alexander Jib and Company has monopolized 
the right to develop and implement the project for protecting 
the basin of the River Prut, which will enable it to dispose of 
funds allotted by the World Bank. 
  Our relations with Romania are being arranged on the basis 
of 
the Protocol on Cooperation between the State Department for 
Environmental Protection of the Republic of Moldova and the 
Ministry of the Environment of Romania. In keeping with this, a 
Romanian-Moldovan commission was formed for working together in 
the Prut basin. But there has been no marked success in this 
area. Cooperation is limited mainly to unilateral aid from 
Romania. Financial and technical aid has been rendered to the 
Moldsilva Association and the National Institute of Ecology--for 
forestry and radiological research on the territory of Moldova. 
  Following the lines of cooperation within the framework of 
international conventions, we will have to solve difficult 
financial problems. Thus, Moldova has not joined the Geneva 
Conference on Crossborder Air Pollution over Large Areas. The 
reason is the lack of hard currency to subsidize measures within 
the framework of the Convention. As for the Vienna Convention on 
Protection of the Ozone Layer, not joining it has entailed 
serious consequences for our economy. Starting in 1994, 
international sanctions and bans will be introduced on exports 
and imports of freon-emitting items. The corresponding sanctions 
will be applied to countries that have not joined the Washington 
Convention on International Trade in Species of Wild Flora and 
Fauna That Are Threatened With Extinction. 
  In this connection, it must be noted that countries of the 
former USSR have the opportunity to join these conventions by a 
simple confirmation, announcing this to the corresponding 
depository with an official government note. The same thing 
pertains to international organizations of the UN system. And if 
we are still not cooperating with such well-known organizations 
as the UN Environment Program (UNEP), the United Nations 
Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the UN Center for 
Human Population (HABITAT), the World Meteorological 
Organization (WMO), and others, this is because of our 
inefficiency and sometimes simply because of our ignorance of 
the procedures for addressing, joining, and entering them. 
  A center for international programs and projects would help 
to eliminate this information gap and establish permanent 
contacts with dozens of international funds, organizations, and 
centers that would be extremely useful to our country. For 
example, the Regional Center for Environmental Protection in 
Central and Eastern Europe (REK) in 1994 allotted $600,000 in 
financial aid to nongovernmental organizations engaged in the 
development and implementation of environmental protection 
projects. And through the DZhYeF [expansion not given] Fund of 
the World Bank, $208 million is being allotted just for projects 
within the framework of the Convention on Biodiversity. In order 
to participate in these projects, we must either make a request 
for financing our projects or submit an application to enter the 
REK, MSOP, and so on. But here, as they say, we have fallen 
slightly behind. 
  For the sake of clarity, I will give some other facts. Just 
during the past two years, Ukraine has been able to organize the 
participation of its specialists in seminars financed by the 
governments of the United States and Poland, and the World Bank, 
for training specialists in the area of ecological projects and 
programs. The United States, additionally, finances the Center 
for Ecological Education and Information formed in Kiev. Canada 
has allotted to the Ukraine $3 million for a program for saving 
the Dnieper River. The Know-How Fund from England renders the 
Department for the Introduction of International Projects 
consulting aid in the implementation of 13 projects for 
ecological restoration of Ukraine. The World Bank has already 
allotted to the country about $1 million for carrying out 
projects in the Carpathian preserves and the Danube Delta, and 
the European Community is financing the development and 
introduction of a system of monitoring, legislative acts, and 
standards. 
  Summing up what has been said, I must note that the State 
Department for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of 
the Republic of Moldova has adopted a number of measures to work 
in the main areas in which our country should cooperate in the 
area of environmental protection. Specialists of the state 
department are participating in the implementation of a program 
for protecting the Danube River and a program for ecological 
restoration of the Black Sea basin. Materials are being prepared 
for entry into the International Union for Protection of Nature 
and Natural Resources and the Regional Center for Environmental 
Protection in Central and Eastern Europe. Negotiations are being 
conducted with representatives of international organizations to 
hold the international fair Eco-94 at the beginning of next 
year, and with representatives of the international convention 
for one called the "Role of Information in Overcoming the 
Ecological Crisis in Countries of the Former Socialist Camp 
During the Period of Transition to a Market Economy." Lists of 
international conventions and agreements that are of primary 
significance to Moldova are being systematized and prepared to 
be submitted to parliament.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Borodayev: "The Railroad and the National </F>
Economy"] 
  [Text] Of course, journalists frequently turn to the 
chief of the Moldovan Railroad, G. Mikenberg, with their 
questions. However, it was perhaps for the first time in the 
last few years that so many representatives of the mass media 
gathered in his office. 
  The press conference was organized on the occasion of 
the issuance of the government Decree on Measures To Develop 
Railway Transportation. 
  This was a long-awaited decree. G. Mikenberg dwelled on its 
key aspects. The document provides for developing the Program 
and Chart for the Long-Range Development of Railway 
Transportation, taking into account its integration into the 
European transportation complex, as well as building new 
sections of the network and upgrading certain most significant 
facilities. 
  In addition to the proprietary funds of the railroad, 
appropriations from the republic budget, bank credit, and 
off-budget funds are supposed to be allocated for the 
development of railway transportation. The feasibility of 
attracting foreign capital and loans from international 
organizations for purchasing rolling stock and the most 
significant types of machinery and materials was acknowledged. 
The task was set to organize in Moldova the repairs of certain 
types of cars, devices, and equipment and the manufacturing of 
spare parts, making use of the production capacity of local 
industrial enterprises. 
  The adoption of the decree does not at all mean that the 
railroad is indebted to the state. On the contrary, the railroad 
of Moldova operates in a stable and profitable manner, without 
subsidies. It fully meets the need for freight and passenger 
carriage alike, is converting two sections to electric traction, 
and is building a new spur line, Revaca-Cainari, which will make 
it possible to reduce the distance to the station Bessarabskaya 
by more than 100 kilometers. 
  However, a number of specific difficulties have recently 
developed that the railroaders are not in a position to overcome 
solely with their own resources. 
  In the last two years, the railroad has not received a 
single 
diesel motor coach train, a single freight or passenger car, or 
a single wooden tie. Some 32 percent of diesel motor coach 
trains qualify for retirement. The numbers of broken-down 
passenger and freight cars are snowballing. More than 1 million 
rotten ties lie on main and entry-and-exit tracks. This is an 
alarm signal from the railway sounding full blast. At present, 
it is still able to handle the volume of carriage, whereas 
tomorrow a crisis may break out in the course of which not only 
the carriage of freight and passengers will fail to be ensured, 
but the guarantee of safe traffic will also disappear. This is 
why it is hard to overrate the issuance of the government decree. 
  There is no way to do without foreign investment. At 
present, 
one compartment coach costs 1.1 million Deutsche Marks, and a 
diesel motor coach train, $5 million. In addition, it has been 
resolved to build the Chisinau-Bucharest main line. To be sure, 
the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development has 
taken an interest in this project and is prepared to invest in 
construction. 
  Moldova received 13,000 cars as a result of the division of 
the car stock among CIS countries. There are many cars that are 
somewhat difficult to repair because of the erstwhile strict 
specialization. We have begun to repair certain things in 
overhaul workshops here. The rest we send for repairs to other 
states selecting places that are cheaper and more advantageous. 
However, even this claims considerable funds. 
  All the enumerated problems are objective. There are a great 
many subjective ones! They are threatening to tear the railroad 
into pieces. In this instance, furious assault has been mounted 
on the part of Ukraine. Over there, it has been resolved at the 
level of the parliament to take away from Moldova the stations 
that are located on the territory of Ukraine. If they succeed 
the railway of Moldova will be torn into six sections. To the 
credit of railroad personnel, we must say that they are also 
preparing for the worst. A number of scenarios have already been 
developed under which the unity of the railroad and the 
management of technical processes will be maintained. 
Nonetheless, they are awaiting with hope the results of 
government-to-government negotiations between Moldova and 
Ukraine that will dot all "i's" in railroad property disputes 
between the two states. 
  What about the Dniester area? Over there, they just would 
not 
give up the desire to establish their jurisdiction over the 
subdivisions of the railroad located on the Left Bank. The 
economic absurdity of such striving has been proven. However, 
yet another cycle of their expansion is building up again. 
  But the appetites of Right Bank officials are no smaller. 
The 
Ministry of Health Care is simply obsessed with the notion of 
taking health care establishments away from the railroad 
personnel. The government rejected these claims. They did not 
calm down, and appealed to the parliament. The parliament acted 
the same way the government had. A new attack is now beginning. 
Why is the Ministry of Health so bent on doing it? There is one 
argument: All medical establishments should report to a single 
center. However, departmental medical services of the railways 
have been codified in all CIS countries, in Romania, Poland, 
Bulgaria, and Hungary because of the specifics of railway 
transportation. What specifics? There is a special approach to 
employees who are associated with traffic, that is, traffic 
safety and the lives of a multitude of people. There are special 
requirements for sight, hearing, fatigue resistance, and 
psychological condition. There are prerun examinations of 
locomotive engineers. There are intricacies of occupational 
hygiene. There are services to railway workers who live in 
out-of-the-way locations--at junction points, small stations, 
and so on. 
  The attitude toward employees on the part of the mayor's 
office of the city is hard to understand. On one occasion, they 
took away a secondary school, on another, the building housing a 
committee of the trade union of railroad workers and the 
editorial office of the industry newspaper. They are now trying 
to liquidate the children's hospital of the 
railroad--notwithstanding that the railroad has built in 
Chisinau huge residential subdivisions, hospitals, polyclinics, 
shops, and the Palace of Culture (which, incidentally, they are 
also dyeing). The railroad is continuing to build a lot of 
beautiful things, and helping the city to meet its needs. 
  How can they fail to appreciate this contribution to urban 
facilities? How can they trample on the rights of railway 
workers? 
  The fact that the government has stated weightily by way of 
its decree that it is extending its wardship and protection to 
the main line should cool off the fervor and ambitions of some 
zealous figures who wish to destroy the enterprise that has 
evolved for a long time, as well as a stable collective.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel A. Kochug, deputy minister of </F>
defense of the Republic of Moldova and chief of the Department 
of Civil Defense and Emergency Situations, by A. Verin; place 
and date not given: "A New Emergency Situation Service Created"] 
  [Text] A new Emergency Situation Service was created in the 
republic in September of this year. What is this successor to 
Civil Defense like? That was the topic covered in a conversation 
with Colonel Anatoliy Kochug, deputy minister of defense and 
chief of the Department of Civil Defense and Emergency 
Situations. 
  [Verin] Systems for the defense of the population and the 
economy have a rich history. Nevertheless in the most highly 
developed countries of the world they came into being and 
developed mainly after the Second World War. Actually that took 
place in the USSR as well as a system of nationwide measures 
conducted in peacetime and wartime to ensure protection of the 
population against the use of modern means of destruction. What 
is the Civil Defense like today? 
  [Kochug] Civil Defense is constantly developing its field of 
activity and expanding, and presently its task consists not so 
much of the defense of the population under conditions created 
by the change in modern means of destruction, as conceived by 
most of our countrymen, associating it only with the shelter and 
gas mask. Under conditions of modern production with its 
concentration of vast amounts of energy and creation and 
utilization of a great number of materials, including some that 
are dangerous to man and his environment, there was a sharp 
increase in the probability of accidents and catastrophes. 
  Natural disasters, which bring destruction of human life 
along with great economic losses, are constantly making 
themselves felt. The 1968 earthquakes in Moldova the Chernobyl 
catastrophe at the atomic electric power station that same year, 
the 1988 earthquake in Armenia, and the catastrophic flood in 
central regions of the Republic of Moldova serve as sad examples. 
  There were 28 emergency situations caused by fires, leakage 
of poisonous substances, explosions in residences, food 
poisoning, railway accidents, and other events occurring in just 
10 months of this year in the republic. As a result 11 people 
were killed, seven wounded, and seven more poisoned. 
  [Verin] Consequently life itself is setting forth the tasks 
of ensuring the protection of the population together with 
physical assets of the republic against industrial accidents and 
catastrophes as well as ecological and natural disasters? 
  [Kochug] Absolutely correct. We do need realistic help in 
the 
form of a legislative base and legal back-up of measures for 
prevention (and a decrease in the consequences) of emergency 
situations. Such activity itself, however, is conducted through 
the creation of new organizations within existing structures of 
state administration. We believe that the establishment of the 
Department of Civil Defense and Emergency Situations within the 
Ministry of Defense was a timely measure. This determined the 
role and place of Civil Defense in the overall scheme of state 
organs of power. Other questions of considerable importance are 
also being resolved at the same time. For instance, the 
presently existing non-military Civil Defense units are 
ineffective in handling consequences of accidents, catastrophes, 
and natural disasters. 
  [Verin] Can we expect a time when the process involving 
adoption of the laws will be completed? 
  [Kochug] Yes, the extraordinary events that are taking place 
both within the republic and beyond its borders, compel us to be 
vigilant. The interaction of society with the environment and 
preservation of the biosphere for the benefit of the people has 
now become one of the most pressing problems. Under conditions 
created by political instability, a sharp decline in the rates 
of production, the economic chaos, lack of necessary laws (the 
disregard of those that were adopted), as well as the 
irresponsibility of power structures and managers of a number of 
ministries, government departments, enterprises, organizations, 
establishments, and national economic facilities it is all the 
more important to assign primary importance to the problem of 
Civil Defense in our republic on the territory of which almost 
all types of emergency situations of industrial and natural 
kinds are possible. 
  Moldova is in a seismically hazardous zone where the force 
of 
an earthquake could reach eight or nine points. In the republic 
there are eight atomic electric power stations at distances of 
150--400 kilometers with different kinds of reactors, similar to 
those at Chernobyl which are destroyed easily in case of an 
accident while fuel is scattered over large areas. There are 
around 70 chemically dangerous facilities in operation in the 
republic which employ about 20,000 (with over half-a-million 
people living in their proximity). Thousands of tonnes of highly 
toxic and other explosive and flammable substances are 
transported by truck and rail in the republic. Hydraulic 
developments along Dniester and Prut rivers threaten around 170 
populated points with flooding of more than 1,000 square 
kilometers with a population of more than 160,000. The indicated 
factors have repeatedly created situations that were close to 
being emergencies. 
  [Verin] Last week your department conducted a check of the 
state of Civil Defense and training together with the Ministry 
of Transport of the republic. What was its purpose? 
  [Kochug] Emergency situations should be regarded as 
phenomena 
conditioned by various factors because of which it is necessary 
to prepare ahead of time for their manifestation while working 
out and implementing measures aimed at their neutralization and 
lessening of harmful consequences. Therefore with consideration 
of the circumstances which might develop on the territory of the 
republic as a result of an emergency situation we tested the 
capability of the ministry to resolve these tasks on the 
engineering, radiation-chemical, and medical-biological level, 
along with other elements. At the same time we conducted a 
series of practical measures in the process of which management 
at various levels of the ministry and the personnel of the units 
obtained and consolidated required experience. I will note that 
railway workers demonstrated a good training level and the 
proper understanding of established tasks, even though the 
concept of the exercises required them to function in a 
practical manner. Naturally, the deficiencies revealed in the 
course of our joint work must be eliminated rapidly but on the 
whole this ministry has good workers devoted to their work and 
to duty. 
  [Verin] Colonel, what practical steps are presently being 
taken by the Department to prepare for the consequences of 
emergency situations? 
  [Kochug] In accordance with a government decision we are 
creating five emergency rescue units. At present we are faced 
with complex and important tasks involved in housing these 
units, establishing military order, the field regulations, 
supply of equipment and specialized gear for them, as well as 
creation of the necessary training-material and a methodological 
base making it possible to undertake fruitful training in order 
to be constantly prepared to resolve tasks confronting the 
fighters-rescuers. 
  Adoption of the law on Civil Defense in the Republic of 
Moldova is on the agenda. The draft of that law has now been 
prepared and was submitted to a parliamentary committee together 
with a series of statutes and decrees, and other documents are 
also being prepared. 
  [Verin] Thank you. Now we know who we must rely on in the 
most complex situations.

<F P=106> [Article by Jukka Perttu: "Finland Promises To Help Estonian </F>
Oil Cleanups"] 
  [Text] A bill has still not been issued for the Kihnu 
incident. 
  Finland supports Estonian oil cleanup efforts at sea. The 
environment ministers of both countries, Andres Tarand and Sirpa 
Pietikainen, agreed last Wednesday in Helsinki that Finland 
would support Estonian oil cleanup operations by offering, among 
other things, training, equipment, and expert help. Finland also 
agreed not to charge Estonia for all the costs involved in 
cleaning up after oil spills in Estonian waters. 
  The Finnish aid is financed by, among other things, adjacent 
area cooperation funds. 
  Finland intends to continue its support during a five-year 
transitional period, but the period may be extended, if 
necessary. 
  On the other hand, the permanent agreement signed by the 
environment ministers is based on equality, as each country is 
obligated to lend assistance in case of oil spills. The 
agreement provides the basis for cooperation between 
environmental protection authorities in case an oil spill 
accident happens in the Gulf of Finland. 
  Russian oil, for example, is exported through Estonian ports 
for foreign destinations. 
  Estonia's defenses against oil spills are still quite weak. 
The country has two vessels with oil recovery equipment. In 
addition, the Estonian Board of Navigation has ordered from 
Finland two 18-meter-long workboats. There is also some other 
oil spill equipment in the country. Senior inspector Olli 
Pahkala from the Ministry of the Environment said that the oil 
companies at the new oil terminal in Tallinn had acquired their 
own oil spill equipment. 
<H5>  Cooperation and Experiences </H5>
  The cooperation between Finland and Estonia was put to the 
test last January when the coastal tanker Kihnu leaked oil into 
the waters of Tallinn. Two oil cleanup vessels and a sea rescue 
helicopter were rushed from Finland to provide help. 
  Sources at the National Board of Waters and the Environment 
told us that a bill covering the expenses had not yet been sent 
to Kihnu's owners. The board has been unable to issue a bill as 
it has not yet, in its turn, received all the outstanding bills 
from other agencies that participated in the operation. 
<H5>  Tarand Thanked for the Help </H5>
  The ministers also signed a joint planning agreement and 
program for 1994. In addition, Tarand and Pietikainen have 
conducted negotiations regarding environmental cooperation 
between the two countries . 
  Tarand thanked for the help with a pleased smile: "Of all 
environmental aid received by Estonia, about half has come from 
Finland." 
  Pietikainen, on her part, praised the Estonian efforts to 
protect its shores. The country's coastline has been protected 
from builders.

<F P=106> [Summary of study by economist Teet Rajasalu: "Estonia's </F>
Economy Stabilized In 1993"] 
  [Text] 
  Estonia's economy passed its lowest point of the last 
few years in the Spring of 1993, but stability of the economy 
was reached by the end of the year. By 1995, real growth of the 
economy could start, wrote economist Teet Rajasalu in his study 
"Estonia's Economy For the Year of 1993." What follows is an 
abbreviated version of the chapter dealing with the balance of 
economic development and the condition of its primary markets, 
along with projections for the next two years to come. 
  Thanks to the monetary reform and current economic policies, 
Estonia's economy has reached a balance for the most part. The 
trade is balanced, inflation stabilized. 
  The growth of unemployment has been stopped and, even if 
this 
summer's drop in unemployment turns out to be a seasonal 
phenomenon, one can presume, at least, that the growth rate of 
unemployment has been slowed down for the time being. 
  The ratio of foreign trade (including services) and the 
current ratio of payments are pretty much balanced out. 
  Estonia's monetary market is characterized by a steady 
growth 
of assets backing the kroon, accompanied by some monetary 
expansion. Interest rates are coming down, and credit resources 
are increasing. 
  Only the credit market is still clouded by confusion 
stemming 
from foreign loans, on one hand, and changes in ownership 
relations and the emerging markets for securities and 
privatization securities, on the other. 
<H5>  Low Purchasing Power Balanced the Market </H5>
  Estonia's trade had already balanced itself during the first 
half of 1992. This was a result of rapidly increasing prices, 
and a relatively slow growth of profits. By the middle of 1993, 
the purchasing power of an average salary had increased to 38 to 
40 percent of the fourth quarter, 1989 level. It was the low 
purchasing power of the population that helped balance out the 
supply and demand on the market of consumer goods. 
  A significant role in balancing the trade market was also 
played by increasing imports. Thus, the import of food items for 
the first three quarters of 1992, at prevailing prices, was 
rated at 27 to 35 million kroons, from where it went to over 200 
million kroons for the fourth quarter, and to 293 million kroons 
for the first quarter of 1993. Thus, the value of imported food 
items has grown close to 10 times, while the actual increase in 
volume, at comparable prices, should be somewhat smaller.

  Last year, Estonian producers competing on the marketplace 
were protected by the lower prices of domestic goods. Due to 
inflation, most goods are gradually reaching the price level of 
imported goods. Inflation taking place up until now has been 
mostly on the supply side and brought about by increased 
production costs. The greater the number of goods, whose prices 
are in competitive balance with those of imported goods, the 
less of a chance there is for any further price increases or 
inflation. The danger of driving the domestic goods out of the 
marketplace, however, will be increased. This became evident in 
daily life as far back as 1992, when problems arose with butter 
and its imported substitutes. Over a period of time, cheese and 
eggs have reached the price level of imported goods, with 
sausage products expected to get there soon. Also approaching 
world market levels are prices for pastry products, building 
materials, sanitary equipment, real estate and cars, as well as 
hotel rates and construction fees. 
<H5>  Level of Income Extremely Low </H5>
  The income level of the population is considerably below the 
average level of countries determining world market prices. The 
income level is 10 to 30 times lower than that of the Nordic 
countries or member states of the European Community. The need 
for increased income raises doubts about the government's income 
policy which, in order to curb inflation, restricts the growth 
of income. Also speaking in favor of future income and price 
increases is the fact that Tallinn is becoming the favorite 
shopping place for Finnish tourists, and the additional demand 
created by them is driving the price levels much too high for 
the local population. 
  However, an increase in the income and demand stemming from 
the purchasing power of the population can lead to increased 
consumption of imported goods, without boosting the consumption 
of domestic production. A growth of imports will, on the other 
hand, bring about a drop in domestic production, which will 
cause the income of the population to drop. Income is 
diminishing even without any administrative interference from 
the government. Diminished income reduces the demand for 
imported goods, and the trade ratio will be balanced.

<H5>  Inflation Running at 25 Percent For the New Year </H5>
  One can assume that inflation in Estonia will slow down 
gradually. For 1994, consumer prices are projected to go up by 
roughly 25 percent, and for 1995, somewhere between 15 to 20 
percent. At the same time inflation will remain relatively high 
compared to developed industrial countries, where it is 
anticipated to run at 3 percent for 1993 and 1994. 
  Estonia's inflation rate is kept high by continuing changes 
in the proportion of prices, and the steady movement of prices 
toward world price levels. This process must also take in the 
normalization of the population's income levels, i.e. cost of 
labor, that is part of the wage-price spiral which, through 
increasing production costs, is causing the prices to go up. 
Secondly, it should be considered that the rapid drop in 
inflation up until now is due largely to obsolete technology and 
low depreciation costs, making the normal renewal of assets 
impossible. Not renewing the assets at world market prices, 
however, will bring about a noticeable increase in the 
depreciation levels of assets and prices of finished products. 
  This is why, in Estonia's situation, maximum suppression of 
inflation should not be the prime objective, as that would 
stretch out the period needed for adaptation to world market 
conditions. More feasible would seem to be an economic policy 
that does not put excessive limits on price and income increases 
in the open (effectively competing) sectors of the economy. What 
is significant here is not the rate of inflation as such, but 
making sure that the inflation remain on the supply side, the 
economy be open, the payments balanced, a balance achieved 
between price proportions and the level of income in the closed 
(non-competing) sector of the economy; and also that minimum 
wages and pensions be in a socially equitable proportion to the 
wage level of the open sectors. 
<H5>  The Kroon Not To Be Revalued Soon </H5>
  The population's income could also be raised without upping 
the level of nominal wages, but rather by a gradual revaluation 
of the kroon. This would mean stability for the prices of 
domestic products, a drop in the prices of imported goods, and 
lower inflation, or stopping inflation altogether. In foreign 
trade, too, this would increase both the cost of production for 
import, and the demand for imported goods. 
  To do that, one would first have to give up using a fixed 
rate of exchange. This could, to be sure, reduce confidence in 
the Estonian kroon, and protecting the exchange rate of the 
kroon may prove to be difficult for Bank of Estonia. At the same 
time, it would give a certain freedom of movement in case there 
are any significant changes in the German economy, and the kroon 
linked to the German mark will be revalued excessively or 
devalued, for that matter. Right now, these possibilities are 
legally ruled out. 
  Secondly, implementation of the entire economic policy would 
be concentrated in the hands of Bank of Estonia. By determining 
the exchange rate, it would be implementing both price and 
income policies, and the role of the Pricing Office in 
regulating prices would be reduced. Also changed would be the 
role of the Social Services Ministry in formulating the income 
policy. Good pension laws, wage scales, tax rates, etc. would, 
in the case of stable prices and wages, stay in effect for a 
long time without changing. 
  Even if transition from a fixed exchange rate, to a 
periodically adjustable fixed rate, for example, may some day be 
necessary, it is not expected to take place within the next two 
years. First, the parity reserve of the kroon's purchasing power 
is sufficient to hold out for a couple of years which, even at 
projected rates of inflation, will guarantee a purchasing power 
higher than the exchange rate. Secondly, it is not likely that 
the current government of politicians, and the government 
coalition setting the tone at Riigikogu would give that much of 
a mandate to Bank of Estonia to control and direct the economy. 
Obviously, the government is not willing to limit itself to 
fiscal policy making, and turn the entire monetary policy over 
to the central bank, as is the custom among classical market 
economies. 
<H5>  Balance of Payments Negative For 1995 </H5>
  For the balance of payments, a growth in the trade deficit 
is 
projected. Even though exports are growing significantly, they 
also generate additional income that creates a demand for 
imports. As the imports increase, the trade balance will remain 
negative, despite the growth of exports. The balance of services 
has been positive, so far, and is likely to remain so in the 
future. It is expected that the surplus from services will still 
cover the deficit of the trade balance for 1994. Beginning with 
1995, however, the balance of payments may turn out to be 
negative. 
  As for the capital balance, the situation in undetermined. 
Direct investments of foreigners in Estonia will probably be 
going up in the years to come. In addition to those, there may 
also be portfolio investments, the volume of which has been 
insignificant up until now. Should the privatization procedure 
change, and simple buying of shares in state enterprises opened 
up to both domestic and foreign capital, the chances of 
increasing portfolio investments will also go up. Also not ruled 
out are portfolio investments in foreign countries, especially 
in cases where no effective application for the capital can be 
found locally. 
  Even though possible errors and inaccuracies are 
considerable, in 1994, there should be an increase in the total 
amount of gold and convertible currency reserves, shown as 
negative amounts in the table for the balance of payments. 
During the first 10 months of 1993, the gold and currency 
reserves of Bank of Estonia have increased by more than 2 
billion kroons. The increase in assets backing the kroon is 
projected at 2.4 billion for 1993, and up to 3.8 billion kroons 
for 1994. By 1995, the trade deficit will probably be so large 
that the growth of reserves will either slow down or stop. This 
will also impact the money market and the possible emission of 
currency. 
<H5>  Growth of Exports Continues </H5>
  The projected development of Domestic Gross Product (DGP) 
stems primarily from changes in demand. But ultimately it is 
spending that determines the projection of DGP. According to 
projections, the intensive growth of exports should continue 
during 1994. This increases the volume of production in Estonia. 
The increased volume of operations, will bring about an 
operating surplus, mixed profits from business, and higher 
wages. At the same time, the growth in 1994 will still be 
largely inflationary. Productivity will not go up much. The cost 
of production will assume an ever-increasing significance among 
exporting companies, making it necessary to increase 
productivity and reduce the work force. All this requires 
increasing investments to update production. 
  In the best of cases, one can expect the first significant 
results to show up in 1995. Increases in salaries will continue, 
but productivity will go up also. This way, salary increases 
will have less of an impact on production costs and prices. In 
1995, the purchasing power of wages and the actual volume of 
consumer spending should begin to go up. This brings about 
increased activity on the domestic market which, in turn, will 
cause the volume of producing goods and services to go up. The 
increased activity on the domestic market also increases the 
demand for imported goods. Competition will get keener, some 
domestic producers will be driven out of the market. Motivation 
to reduce production costs will also increase. Along with the 
livening of the economy, investments will grow in both fixed and 
current assets, increasing demand even further.

  According to projections, conditions for economic growth and 
motivation for increasing investments should be developing 
during 1994 and, beginning 1995, the economy could start showing 
actual growth. If projections are realized, the DGP volume for 
1994 would be roughly 30 billion, and for 1995 up to 38 billion 
kroons. Using the June, 1992 prices as a base figure, the value 
of DGP would be 14.2 and 14.6 billion kroons respectively, 
yielding an annual growth of 5 and 3 percent respectively.

<F P=106> [Article by Aap Tanav: "Sildmae Knows What To </F>
 Risk 
With"] 
  [Text] 
  Last Friday EVEA [Estonian Small Business Association] 
awarded the honorary title of `Entrepreneur's Friend '93' to 
Economic Minister Toomas Sildmae--the man who, on every 
possible occasion, has been getting a 'no confidence' showing 
from ERSP [Estonian National Independence Party], that is part 
of the government coalition. The first such showing took place 
on February 8, the day Sildmae took his oath of office 
before Riigikogu [Estonia's parliament]. 
  "The award of `Entrepreneur's Friend' was obviously given to 
me in recognition of my attitude toward entrepreneurs, that is 
different from that of life-long bureaucrats of earlier times," 
said Sildmae the night before yesterday, after the EVEA 
[Estonian Small Business Association] representatives had been 
to the Economic Ministry to present the minister with the pin 
and the certificate confirming the title. 
  Sildmae is convinced that, considering Estonia's 
size and 
its geographic location, the future of our economy can only be 
in small and medium-size business enterprises. He has had a 
considerable share in the creation of the Credit Fund for 
Businesses with Small and Medium-Sized Capital Requirements, the 
utility of which has repeatedly been questioned by the prime 
minister as well as other members of the government. In the 
opinion of many of the European Community experts, lending money 
at a lower interest rate from Estonia's own commercial banks 
amounts to state subsidy. 
<H5>  An Estonian Entrepreneur Is Relatively Honest </H5>
  Sildmae is satisfied with the new income tax law that 
establishes a uniform 26-percent tax rate for natural persons as 
well as legal entities. 
  "Collecting income tax is dialogue between the entrepreneur 
and the tax collector. The objective of the new law was to find 
an optimal level at which there is no point to lie or to hide," 
Sildmae says and rates the Estonian entrepreneur as a 
relatively honest being who no longer has to hide his profits. 
Estonians are relatively honest, especially when compared to 
their Eastern neighbors. In the Western business world of 
developed countries which Sildmae, for lack of a fitting 
term in Estonian, called the business community, 
unwritten rules prevail. "If you cheat once, you will simply be 
left outside of that circle." 
<H5>  Privatize Everything But the Nuclear Plant </H5>
  "The privatization process is slow and one could speculate 
that, following the present policy, it would take about 
two-to-three years to privatize perhaps 80 percent of the 
state-owned enterprises. The rest will take at least 10 years, 
says Sildmae, who is also a member of the Privatization 
Agency's administrative council, and supports the position that 
everything that could be done using private capital, should be 
done using private capital. 
  There are currently 380 state enterprises within the 
administrative scope of the Economic Ministry. Some of them have 
been partially privatized, others are in the process of being 
sold. In Sildmae's opinion, companies that produce and 
sell 
energy cannot be privatized in the near future. For the time 
being some strategic areas like the railroad, for example, 
should also remain the property of the state. 
  "Once the economy evolves, a business culture will emerge 
and 
give substance to the word 'agreement' that, in the rest of the 
world, is acceptable not only in writing but also verbally, and 
onecan start building on that. There are money-printing 
facilities in the world that are based on private capital. If 
there was a nuclear power plant in Estonia, maybe that should 
not be privatized," Sildmae says. 
<H5>  Investment Climate Free of Risk </H5>
  Over the past few years, Estonia has made its way on the map 
of the world. A big job has already been done in the 
Scandinavian countries and in Europe, and Sildmae is out 
to 
conquer new regions. Along with Prime Minister Mart Laar, he 
visited Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. Along with President 
Lennart Meri, he went to Kuweit, Turkey, Jordan and, only 
recently, returned from Marocco. 
  "This is how agreements are developed for economic 
cooperation, protection against mutual double tariffs, and for 
protecting investments. These, in turn, make possible the 
development of enterprise based on private initiative," says 
Sildmae who, up until now, has put his signature on only 
one 
international agreement that regulates foreign trade relations 
between Estonia and Austria. He thinks that, compared to the 
rest of Eastern Europe, Estonia's situation is very promising, 
and that we have managed to convince foreign investors of the 
relatively risk-free nature of our investment climate. During 
the year now ending, foreign investments made in Estonia have 
been larger than those made in Latvia, Lithuania and Belarus 
combined. This success can be attributed largely to several laws 
passed by Riigikogu lately, such as the right-to-own law, along 
with its implementation. 
<H5>  Approaches of Ministries Differ </H5>
  The Economic Ministry headed by Sildmae coordinates 
the 
preparation of quite a number of laws. Mentioned, among these, 
should not only be the national law to support private 
enterprise, the regional policy law, and the preferred regions 
law, but also the law dealing with the city of Paldiski, and the 
three laws that are closely linked to the decree signed by 
Sildmae in June of this year, dealing with restrictions on 
advertising for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. These 
are laws on advertising, tobacco and alcohol. This summer's 
decree is not going to take effect with the new year, as 
planned, because everything is held up by the consumer 
protection law. 
  "The Economic Ministry's approach to legislation differs 
from 
that of the Ministry of Justice, which wants to create volumes 
of legislation that would cover the entire field of commercial 
law. This, however, would take a long time and, since life 
cannot be put on hold, we better get the necessary laws ready 
one by one," says Sildmae, not willing to wait until 
Estonia 
gets smart enough to compile such large volumes of laws that 
have taken other states decades, or even centuries to assemble. 
  Sildmae's impatience is understandable considering 
that, 
in order to insure rapid development of Estonia's economy, he is 
expecting investments in the range of $100 to $200 million a 
year to be made in Estonia. 
  "This year's 1 billion Estonian kroons is not enough. 
Looking 
at downtown Tallinn can be deceptive. The cellulose plant alone, 
which Estonia really needs, requires investments to the tune of 
500 million DEM. The areas calling for large investments in 
Estonia are many, like our energy production, for one," says 
Sildmae, as he tries to find reasons why production should 
go outside of Tallinn: "When you look at Estonia on the world 
map, and talk about the investment climate, one can see it has 
become suitable. The same is happening inside Estonia. The 
climate is suitable in Tallinn and the Harjumaa district. It 
gets worse going North-East, and worse yet going South-East." 
  It was for the express purpose of enhancing regional 
development that the Innovation Fund and the Estonian Export 
Credit Fund were created at the Economic Ministry, in addition 
to the credit fund for small business. Sildmae does not 
believe that any production facilities requiring investment 
could be financed by Estonia's commercial banks at the current 
borrowing rates. This type of credit could only work for 
something with rapid turnover, like sales. 
<H5>  Altruistic Creative Potential </H5>
  Besides entrepreneurs, Sildmae wants to support the 
formation of all possible clubs, cooperatives and associations, 
because he sees them as a valuable source of creative potential. 
  "When we started out at the ministry a year ago, our credo 
was that we are not the smartest," Sildmae says, 
describing 
the style he and his team had. "Our success hinges on being able 
to connect the all the sides of the quadrangle: Civil servants, 
entrepreneurs, scientists and foreign consultants." 
  The fact that the economic minister is a man of action, was 
proven by Sildmae in August when he, along with some 
kindred 
spirits, formed the Taxpayers' Alliance, which he also calls 
G-13. 
  "The Taxpayers' Alliance is a completely apolitical 
organization, the members of which simply get together over a 
cup of coffee, to discuss the processes taking place in 
Estonia's society, and to find solutions to the problems facing 
us. To stay in shape, one has to keep evolving. G-13 was one 
such opportunity. Its members come from different walks of life, 
representing different ambitions, and different political 
views," Sildmae says. He characterizes the launching of 
this 
highly controversial organization as a blue-eyed, if not 
altruistic attempt to show that there is a non-partisan force, 
springing from economic realities. 
<H5>  Sildmae's Job Is Done </H5>
  When he took office in February, Sildmae said that 
he had 
agreed on a term of up to one year with Prime Minister Laar. 
That year will be up on February 5. In the meantime, the 
economic minister, as a person, has caused so much controversy 
in government circles that the media has come up with a slogan 
"Sildmae home for Christmas." 
  "I have also been a civil servant prior to my previous life 
and have promised that I will never enter state service again. 
After my January talks with Messrs. Kannik, Luik and Laar, I 
made a different decision knowing full well that it will bring 
me both profit and loss. I thought it would be possible, in 
about a year, to build up a ministry that would be viable and 
could work out an economic strategy for Estonia. Today, this job 
is done," says Sildmae who has consolidated four 
ministries 
under one roof, and reduced the number of his subordinates from 
270 to 150. 
  "By motivating people, and by giving them a chance for 
self-actualization, we can get by with a smaller number of 
employees. People just roll up their sleeves and get to work," 
Sildmae says. 
  He has held out until Christmas, and soon we'll see how it 
goes with the year that was promised. On January 10, 
Sildmae 
will appear before Riigikogu to respond to the inquiry initiated 
by the Isamaa faction regarding the economic minister's 
participation in business ventures. 
  "Actually, I have already responded to this inquiry before I 
took office. For the duration of my term as minister, I have 
turned over my stock portfolio to a lawyer, who will also get 
all the earnings from them," says Sildmae who, besides his 
interest in the Finest Hotel Group (10 percent), and AS Rebaco 
(that controls the Hanseatic Bank), has a relatively less known 
block of shares in AS Tomut, a design and construction firm 
registered in Tartu. 
  It is of utmost importance to Sildmae that, after his 
departure, the ministry retain the same general atmosphere, and 
that the new minister be an expert, and not a politician. 
  He is apparently returning to his former position as 
director 
of the Finest Hotel Group. This could also be deduced from the 
fact that Andres Eesmaa, who is heading the hotel company 
currently, is still using the title of acting director, and has 
not been appointed to head the company officially.

<F P=106> ["Statement by President of the Republic of Lithuania </F>
Algirdas Brazauskas on NATO Membership for Lithuania"] 
  [Text] Today, I have forwarded a letter to NATO Secretary 
General Manfred Woerner, in which I officially requested the 
admission of the Republic of Lithuania to the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization, taking into account the resolution of the 
Seimas of Lithuania dated 23 December 1993. 
  Lithuania assesses the Partnership for Peace initiative 
favorably. At the same time, we hope that the NATO summit on 
10-11 January will open the doors of this organization to the 
countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and that a way will be 
found for partnership to gradually grow into membership. 
  We are fully aware that with the present statement, 
Lithuania 
is embarking on a new, complex, and responsible stage in 
rapprochement with the European Union and NATO, which will call 
for determination, new solutions, and large material resources. 
I believe that much will be clarified following my visit to 
Brussels scheduled for 27 January of this year. 
  The position of Lithuania regarding NATO membership is not 
directed against neighboring states or any other European 
country; all of them should find a place in the new security 
structures of our continent. Just as before, we come out in 
favor of close cooperation among Baltic countries in all areas, 
including the area of defense, and in favor of reinforcing 
security and stability in the entire Baltic Sea region. 
  Vilnius, 4 January 1994

<F P=106> [Report by Department of Information and the Press of the </F>
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania--ELTA: "Letter by P. 
Gylys to the U.S. Secretary of State"] 
  [Text] Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania Povilas 
Gylys has sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. 
  Lithuania, reads the letter, is particularly interested in 
close cooperation and assistance from the United States in the 
area of national security and defense and the reinforcement of 
economic reforms and democratic institutions. 
  Despite the fact that the last Russian soldier has left 
Lithuania, we still find ourselves in a security vacuum, the 
letter reads. The presence of the army of a foreign state in 
Latvia and Estonia is a factor of instability in the entire 
region. The large Russian Army concentration in Kaliningrad 
Oblast gives rise to particular concern. Lithuania would like to 
invite the attention of the international community to the need 
to demilitarize this region. 
  The letter notes that the Russian notion of "neighboring 
foreign countries" is unacceptable to Lithuania. The fact that 
Russia's foreign policy may become more nationalistic and 
aggressive with regard to the Baltic states following the 
parliamentary elections also causes concern. 
  The minister noted that Lithuania, in its striving to blend 
into Western political, economic, and security structures, 
considers NATO its future security guarantor. Lithuania, in 
which there is no foreign army and no problem of ethnic 
minorities, strives to reinforce cooperation with NATO. We 
welcome the "partnership," hoping that this will become a 
stimulus for cooperation "from partnership to membership." 
  Foreign investment is an important factor in the development 
of the economy of our country. U.S. investment is extremely 
important to Lithuania in this context. Our country intends to 
sign several treaties with the United States, including the 
treaty "On Incentives and Protection for Investment." 
  Toward the end of the letter, the minister offered W. 
Christopher and his family holiday wishes.

<F P=106> [Article by Ceslovas Jursenas, chairman of the Seimas, </F>
Seimas member from Ignalina-Svencioniai Electoral District No. 
53, under the rubric "Topics of the Week. Their Ramifications 
for the Future of Lithuania": "Ceslovas Jursenas: 'We May and 
Must Work Well for the Good of Lithuania'"] 
  [Text] Naturally, the last week of the year could not go by 
without an analysis and discussion of the operation of the 
Seimas. We did this both at a meeting of the leadership of the 
Seimas and among our associates. To my mind, the best result is 
that, if we were to compartmentalize the work of the Seimas by 
session and month, it has become more intensive, organized, and 
fruitful. As the leader of the Seimas, I certainly find this 
gratifying. Of course, we argue at plenary sessions, and 
sometimes quarrel. However, our productivity is obvious. What 
has been required of the Seimas under the Constitution has 
mostly been completed. We will discuss and adopt at our session 
the things we have not completed after all, the draft legal acts 
we have not managed to translate into the form of laws; this is 
why the session was extended. What remains is to pass several 
articles of the law on Seimas controllers or ombudsmen, and to 
vote on this law, which establishes a new and very important 
constitutional institution. In the future people will be able to 
turn to it with complaints about bureaucratic, unlawful actions 
of officials and employees of government and self-government 
structures. That is, along with state control which monitors how 
state property is used, how the budget is implemented, and so 
on, we will have an office which is called upon to analyze 
specific actions of officials and defend the legitimate 
interests of citizens. 
  The adoption of the 1994 state budget on time certainly is a 
favorable aspect of what the Seimas has accomplished. This is of 
special note because the budget was adopted as the Constitution 
requires for the first time in the years of independence, i.e. 
the full four years. Is this a good or a bad budget? I would say 
it is mediocre because we did not succeed in meeting all needs; 
the situation of the state is still quite difficult, but we do 
already have a budget, and certain prospects together with it. 
If we consider that in 1993 Lithuania hit the bottom in its 
socioeconomic development and achieved a certain stabilization, 
albeit at a low level, this means that in 1994 we should have an 
opportunity to elevate ourselves and climb out of the hole of 
the crisis. I believe that the Seimas has facilitated this by 
way of its legislative proceedings, its cadre decisions, and its 
activity. 
  As far as the budget specifically is concerned, as I see it, 
it is primarily called upon to meet social needs. This budget is 
intended for the people to a greater degree than those we have 
had so far. I believe that everything possible has been done to 
meet their needs, and that the government, in keeping with its 
policy, will help retirees, the handicapped, and other 
low-income strata of the population if new funds become 
available. 
  Agriculture, for which 400 million lits were appropriated, 
was the second concern of the budget. Although agrarian deputies 
counted on greater funds, judging from their criticism, things 
that were done for the rural areas exceeded our potential to 
begin with. It was also important that Seimas commissions 
analyzed and revealed shortcomings in relations between 
producers of agricultural products and representatives of 
processing enterprises and mutual complaints were clarified; we 
now have an extra opportunity to regulate mutual settlements. 
  There was no dearth of criticism concerning expenditures 
from 
the budget for state government. I would say that these were 
largely populist statements; there are people who like to rail 
at the authorities and demand that wages and other expenditures 
of the government staff be cut. However, when I read letters 
from the people, of which a great many are addressed to me, I 
find out that complaints from the people are mainly due to a 
failure to sort things out, a lack of potential to do so, and so 
on rather than the desire to harm someone or gain advantage. If 
we keep cutting wages or outlays on the government staff, it 
will hardly retain good specialists. Competent and businesslike 
people will leave for some kind of commercial structures. If we 
were to look at it seriously, this would be an antistate 
decision because both the Seimas and the government structures 
need skilled workers no less than any other organization. Having 
increased expenditures, we have the legal and moral right to 
demand high-quality and effective work and the performance of 
their duty from the people. 
  We already have a preliminary plan for the future spring 
session. A comprehensive plan of sorts for all our laws and 
envisioned draft laws, amendments, and additions to the laws has 
been compiled in order to see graphically how the system of 
state government and state structures will be transformed in 
keeping with the Constitution. If in addition to that we refine 
certain articles of the Seimas Statute, I believe that the 
spring session will be held in a still better organized format. 
The draft laws on retirement benefits, taxes, land use, 
antialcohol control, and so on are among the most important 
draft laws. 
  It is natural that heated debates are now taking place at 
Seimas meetings. The truth is born from disputes. To be sure, it 
is possible to call into doubt the constructive nature of 
particular pronouncements and proposals of Seimas members. 
However, if different opinions exist, all of them must be heard 
and discussed. I know that many people are concerned about the 
prospects for relations between the position [as published] and 
the opposition. Some interpret the activity of the Fatherland 
Union party, such as was recently displayed at its congress, as 
well as at the Sajudis congress, as a threat to domestic 
political relations in the country. I think that political 
attacks of this kind are not viable and are transient. The 
consent of almost the entire Seimas is needed in order to hold 
early elections to the Seimas, as they proclaimed at these 
events; this case is clearly defined in the Constitution. This 
is resolved either by the Seimas itself or by the president 
dissolving the Seimas in a certain situation. The president's 
opportunities also depend on our considered or not considered 
actions. I believe that this composition of the Seimas works in 
a quite organized and effective manner; the members of the 
Seimas have improved perceptibly with regard to parliamentary 
work. Given the experience we now have, we may work calmly and 
work well for the good of Lithuania. I see no formidable grounds 
for early elections; if anyone does see them, let them make 
demands--it is their right. They wish to aggravate and inflame 
the situation. What can we do? However, we will have enough 
energy and patience to engage in our positive endeavor. It is 
precisely through such positive actions in both the legislative 
and executive areas that we will ensure that Lithuania moves 
ahead. As far as our interaction, for example, cooperation 
within the framework of the Seimas, it existed and must exist in 
the future. Of course, we cannot accept proposals of the 
right-wing opposition that would run counter to our electoral 
program or our principles. After all, we won elections, and are 
pursuing our own policy; the government and the president do 
this. However, we accept all constructive proposals, and many 
such proposals from the right-wing opposition have already been 
accepted. We are in favor of a constructive approach to 
work--this is our principled position, my personal position, 
that of the DPTL [Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania] in the 
Seimas, and finally, such is the position of the president. I 
repeat that we may and should work well to benefit Lithuania. 
  I would like to wish all people of Lithuania a quiet year of 
work. I am convinced that this year will be better than the 
last, and life will gradually become easier if we work in a 
quiet environment to benefit ourselves and advance the country.

<F P=106> [Article by Ramune Sakalauskaite: "Defense Council Meeting </F>
Participants Deliberated Defense Doctrine and the Future of 
National Defense"] 
  [Text] A one-and-a-half hour meeting of the Defense Council 
took place yesterday in the office of President Algirdas 
Brazauskas. Participants of the meeting in addition to 
Brazauskas were Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius; Seimas 
Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas; Jurgis Jurgelis, general director of 
the Security Service; Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius; 
Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys; Jonas Andriskevicius, chief of 
the armed forces; Gintaras Tamulaitis, deputy to the armed 
forces chief of staff; Vytautas Petkevicius, chairman of the 
Seimas national security committee; Algimantas Norvilas, the 
president's advisor on national security affairs. Two topics 
were deliberated at the meeting: Petkevicius presented the 
defense doctrine, and Linkevicius presented a plan for the 
reorganization of the structure of the national defense system. 
  Following the meeting, Andriskevicius, chief of the armed 
forces, indicated that a decision had been made to present to 
the Seimas the defense doctrine deliberated at the meeting. In 
his opinion, there had been no fundamental disagreements during 
the discussions, and there was ready agreement regarding 
difficult technical issues. With respect to a reorganization of 
the structure of the national defense system, a decision was 
made to separate the functions of the armed forces and the 
ministry. Asked whether there had already been a division of the 
functions, Andriskevicius replied, "The commission is working 
and the president expressed the hope that this issue be resolved 
as quickly as possible. So this is what we will do." 
  Andriskevicius indicated that those at the meeting were 
happy 
that good bilateral relations were continuing between Russia and 
Lithuania in the wake of the meeting between the countries' 
prime ministers. It is thought that certain technical military 
issues will receive a certain amount of accelerated attention. 
  Assessing the Defense Council meeting, Foreign Minister 
Gylys 
said that there had been discussion of how to establish public 
control of funds earmarked for national defense. This, he 
asserted, is one of the requirements for integration into 
international security systems. 
  To the knowledge of Norvilas, the president's advisor on 
national security affairs, the reorganization in the national 
defense system has already begun. The group working on the 
reorganization of the defense ministry has been entrusted with 
selection of one of four available draft proposals, and, 
following deliberation of it, with submitting it to the Defense 
Council.

<F P=106> [LIETUVOS RYTAS article: "Only One Former National </F>
Delegation Member Included on Team for Negotiations with CIS"] 
  [Text] Vilnius, 22 Dec (BNS)--The composition of the 
working group for Lithuania's negotiations with the CIS 
countries was confirmed at the Wednesday meeting of the 
government leadership. 
  Virgilijus Bulovas, ambassador extraordinary and 
plenipotentiary and a member of Seimas, has been appointed head 
of the working group, which will have four additional members. 
Bulovas previously headed the national delegation for 
negotiations with Russia, since dismissed by the president. 
  The other members of the group did not belong to the earlier 
national negotiating delegation. 
  They are Raimondas Barcevicius, vice-minister for industry 
and commerce; Arvydas Lescinskas, vice-minister for 
transportation; Ricardas Seibelis, director of the account 
settlement center of the Bank of Lithuania; Petras Zapolskas, 
head of the foreign ministry's CIS countries section. 
  Some of the members of the delegation for negotiating with 
Russia, dismissed by decree of the president, have decided not 
to dissolve their group. They have not, for the time being, 
outlined their status more clearly, but intend to do so at the 
first meeting of the group, which will probably take place right 
after New Year's. 
  Romualdas Ozolas, one of the members of the group, calls the 
decision by the former negotiators a "civic initiative" to 
observe and evaluate the negotiations with Russia as well as the 
treaties that are made with it.

<F P=106> [Article by Marius Laurinavicius: "Lithuania's Ambassadors, </F>
Assembled from West and East, Assess Their Activities and This 
Past Year's Foreign Policy Favorably"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the representatives of the Lithuanian 
diplomatic corps, gathered for the annual meeting-conference now 
taking place in Vilnius, continued to discuss Lithuanian foreign 
policy problems. In the morning, the ambassadors and heads of 
diplomatic missions participated in a discussion held in the 
Seimas of our country's foreign policy. 
  In the course of this Seimas meeting, an accusation was made 
from the rostrum that even among Lithuanian ambassadors there 
are some who act as politicians, not as officials of the nation. 
A. Januska, deputy foreign minister and director of the 
Political Department, requested by LIETUVOS RYTAS to assess 
these accusations and, if there are any such ambassadors, to 
identify them, said that the ministry did not believe that there 
were any such individuals and that there were no reproaches 
against any of them in this regard on the part of the ministry. 
According to Januska, this idea was voiced merely as a hope that 
there not be such diplomats. 
  Yesterday, LIETUVOS RYTAS talked to the heads of the three 
probably most important Lithuanian diplomatic representations. 
  The first thing we asked A. Eidintas, ambassador to the 
United States, was whether, in the wake of the departure of some 
of the workers at the embassy, he had now gotten his team 
together, and how the embassy was operating. The ambassador 
replied that this departure had not come as a great surprise and 
that the current workers are fully covering all aspects of the 
embassy's activity, that the work of the embassy did not stop 
for even one day, and that he had now come to Vilnius without 
any concerns regarding the embassy. 
  Despite the fact that most emigre Lithuanians favor former 
ambassador S. Lozoraitis, the ambassador maintained that at this 
time, relations with the Lithuanian Community of America are 
businesslike. According to the ambassador, the embassy and the 
Lithuanian Community of America had succeeded in agreeing that 
they were working toward the same goal and that for this reason 
it was not important who might be in charge of the government or 
who the ambassador might be: relations ought to be businesslike. 
The Community was now assisting the embassy. 
  On a five-point scale, the ambassador rated at a three the 
performance this year of the Lithuanian diplomatic service. He 
assigned this rating because he believes that the diplomatic 
service has been slow in getting on its feet. However, even this 
three reflects substantial achievement, in his opinion, because 
it is not easy to get going after such a long interlude. And the 
diplomatic representations are working and are of great 
political and especially economic use. 
  When asked to assess the achievements of Lithuanian foreign 
policy on the same basis, Eidintas said that everything was 
overshadowed by the withdrawal of Russian armed forces and that 
because this was accomplished, he would assign a score of five, 
despite all the areas where performance fell short, e.g. lack of 
a conceptual framework and absence of strategy. 
  Ambassador to Germany Z. Namavicius rated Lithuanian foreign 
policy this year with a score of four. He believes that truly a 
lot has been accomplished, and one can only be amazed by this, 
because our diplomats lack experience and there are almost no 
professionals among them. 
  When asked about possible solutions to the problem relating 
to visas, he said that this problem really was being worked on 
in Germany and that the interior ministry had been provided with 
what German president R. von Weizsaecker had promised on the 
occasion of his visit to Lithuania. The only thing holding up 
the process is the absence of a treaty on the insurance of and 
provision of aid to citizens in the event of an accident, and 
other such situations. The preparatory work for this treaty 
ought to be concluded as quickly as possible, but otherwise 
everything is developing very favorably for us. The ambassador 
believes that the treaty governing entry without visas will be 
signed sooner or later, perhaps as early as next year. 
  When asked what Lithuania could do to attract more direct 
investments from Germany, Namavicius said that the first thing 
Lithuania should do is something that it has not yet done, but 
which it may do in the future: sell land to be used for 
production facilities. Investors would then feel much more 
secure. The ambassador believes that Lithuania's duty and tax 
policy is sufficiently favorable, but it ought not change around 
every two months. With respect to where things stand on the 
investment front, the ambassador was pleased that the trends 
were good. In July, there were only somewhat more than 300 joint 
enterprises with Germany, whereas now the total is up to 443. 
There has not, though, been any large-scale investment, with the 
exception of the Siemens company, which may have broken the ice. 
  We asked ambassador to Russia R. Kozyrovicius whether, in 
view of the election results and statements by certain of 
Russia's highest officials that corrections in economic policy 
are anticipated now that the elections are over, one should not 
also expect changes in Russia's foreign policy. Although the 
ambassador believed that it was difficult to make any kind of 
predictions at this time, he indicated that in a certain sense 
Russia's foreign policy can be expected to change. The 
difficulty is to say in which direction it will go. The 
ambassador has noticed that the tone of Russian foreign minister 
A. Kozyrev has even become less harsh. Kozyrovicius would not 
want to believe that--with the entire world watching--Russia 
will begin to implement a foreign policy reflecting the results 
of the parliamentary elections. He would expect the emergence of 
healthy and wise forces who will carry out a normal, 
non-dictatorial, and non-imperial policy. 
  When reminded about the somewhat differing opinions of the 
main implementors of Lithuanian foreign policy as to whether 
Lithuanian foreign policy toward Russia will change or 
not--foreign minister P. Gylys maintained at a press conference 
on Tuesday that "there will be corrections" in the wake of the 
elections in Russia, whereas president A. Brazauskas indicated 
in an interview that appeared in a daily newspaper on Wednesday 
that our policy will not change--Kozyrovicius said that first 
there should be internal agreement, and foreign policy should be 
formed subsequently. The ambassador believes that Lithuanian 
policy should not change for the time being, because it is 
uncertain what kind of situation will evolve. According to 
Kozyrovicius, the results of the elections should not be totally 
ignored, however, and if Russian policy changes then Lithuania 
should change its policy as well.

<F P=106> [Article by Arturas Racas: "Discussion in the Seimas on </F>
Lithuania's Foreign Policy: For Some, Everything is Clear, Only 
Certain Ministers are Still Lacking; Others Maintain that 
Foreign Policy is Experiencing a Fiasco"] 
  [Text] With the participation of Lithuanian diplomats 
accredited abroad, there was a discussion in the Seimas 
yesterday on Lithuania's foreign policy. 
  Speaking first, Lithuanian president A. Brazauskas specified 
what he believes are the three highest priority directions for 
foreign policy: closer cooperation with the Baltic nations and 
the countries of Northern Europe, further integration of 
Lithuania into Europe's economic, political, cultural and 
security systems, as well as the improvement of relations with 
neighboring countries. 
  Developing the idea of closer cooperation with the Baltic 
countries, the president talked broadly about the problem 
concerning the construction of an oil terminal. He thought it 
entirely natural-- in the wake of the Latvian government 
proposal to do so--that the possibilities of constructing a 
terminal in Liepaja were being considered. "It is regrettable 
that some perceive this as politically motivated", Brazauskas 
said. 
  On the subject of relations with Russia, and specifically 
regarding military transport to the Kaliningrad region, the 
president noted that there will be consultations with foreign 
experts on this issue. The president also spoke out in favor of 
the demilitarization of the Kaliningrad region and of having it 
become a free economic zone. 
  The president of Lithuania specified the signing of a free 
trade agreement with the European Union as one of the most 
important tasks on the road into Europe. He said that 
heretofore, insufficient attention had been paid to economic 
relations with western countries, because greater attention had 
been paid to the normalization of relations with the East, 
which, in the opinion of the president, Lithuania has basically 
succeeded in achieving. According to Brazauskas, there needs to 
be a greater focus on the economic aspect of foreign policy and 
he encouraged the government to be more active in this area. 
  Continuing on the topic of Lithuania's journey into Europe, 
Brazauskas expressed regret that the Lithuanian constitution 
does not allow for the establishment of the position of a 
minister for Western European affairs, which Brazauskas believes 
would greatly facilitate Lithuania's integration into the West. 
He proposed that the Seimas consider the possibility of 
establishing such a ministerial position, and in the meantime 
assign these duties to the deputy foreign minister. 
  Having pointed out that of late there has been an increase 
in 
Lithuania of discussions and statements regarding the necessity 
of joining NATO, the president stated that "there is sufficient 
desire and determination." Furthermore, according to Brazauskas, 
Lithuania has more arguments for drawing closer to this 
organization than do its neighbors Latvia and Estonia. He also 
asserted that in the aforementioned countries, the discussions 
about joining NATO are not as emotional as in Lithuania. 
According to the president, a serious discussion of this issue 
has not even started yet in Estonia. 
  Brazauskas rejected accusations regarding the secrecy of 
foreign policy. "There is no secret or two-faced foreign policy, 
everything is open and straightforward," the president said. In 
his opinion, the current foreign policy is calm and appropriate; 
perhaps what was still needed was to provide information on it 
to a wider audience. 
  According to Brazauskas, relations with Russia are not 
tense; 
however, it is difficult to guess what they will be in the 
future. The president maintained that as Russian policy changed, 
Lithuanian policy would also be reviewed, but in either case, 
the issue of compensation for damages would continue to remain 
one of the most important topics of negotiation. 
  "We ought to be courageous, intelligent, and moderate," 
Brazauskas said in concluding his address. 
  Speaking next, foreign minister P. Gylys first listed many 
treaties that had been signed and the dates of many visits that 
had taken place. He acknowledged that "the lack of conceptual 
efforts was noticeable," but went on to remark that the 
government's program as well as the President's conceptual 
addresses served as a substitute for a conceptual framework for 
foreign policy. 
  The minister emphasized the geopolitical aspect of foreign 
policy and maintained that Lithuania could regard itself as a 
Central European country. This was the reason, in his opinion, 
that Lithuania should move into Europe subject to the same 
conditions that are applicable to the Visegrad countries. Gylys 
believes that Lithuania is rapidly pursuing these countries and 
will draw even with them in the near future. 
  In response to questions by Seimas members, Gylys asserted 
that there is no one directly responsible for the construction 
of the oil terminal, because a final decision on this issue has 
not yet been made. Gylys also indicated that NATO should not be 
turned into an idol before which Lithuania should be made to 
kneel. 
  Commenting on the free trade agreements with the CIS 
countries, the minister said that the treaties exist, but that 
because of the situations in these countries they are not being 
well implemented. Free trade is going on with the Kaliningrad 
region, according to the minister, it just has to be made 
official. 
  When asked by G. Vagnorius to answer straight out whether 
Lithuania intends to join NATO, Gylys said, "We aren't going 
anywhere, we are where we are, however, we are going towards 
NATO." 
  In the discussion that took place after the intermission, V. 
Pleckaitis proposed that the Seimas recommend that the President 
make an official application for relations with NATO, and, 
having drawn attention to the fact that Germany and Russia were 
drawing closer together, he asserted that Lithuania's political 
leaders sometimes participate in scenarios set up by Bonn and 
Moscow. 
  Stating that Gylys should comprehend that the pro-Russian 
policy which Gylys and J. Paleckis were implementing was a 
fiasco, V. Landsbergis urged that a more persistent effort be 
made to seek membership in NATO. He suggested that new elements 
be brought into the treaty discussions with Poland, namely, to 
talk of mutual interests, as well as of security issues relating 
to the Kaliningrad region. 
  A. Saudargas, who spoke on behalf of the 
christian-democratic 
faction, maintained that recently, the government had begun to 
proclaim what was, in effect, a new foreign policy. What 
supported such a conclusion was that the Lithuanian leadership 
had, in his opinion, "clearly and categorically forbidden 
Lithuania to join NATO by itself," (such a determination was 
expressed at the meeting Tuesday with diplomats accredited 
abroad), and "had expressed the intention to build an oil 
terminal in a neighboring country, which is in substantially 
greater direct danger than Lithuania." 
  The statement made by LDDP representative A. Tauras stood 
out 
from those made by most of the speakers. In his opinion, 
Lithuania should be a neutral, peaceful, and demilitarized 
country, and he again cited the seeking of neutrality and the 
guarantee of economic development as the fundamental purposes of 
foreign policy. 
  Seimas members L. Andrikiene and R. Ozolas found the 
statements they heard lacking in conceptual terms, in terms of 
foreign policy goals, and in terms of strategy. Ozolas blamed 
all members of Seimas for the lack of a conceptual framework, 
because in his opinion, there can be no foreign policy concept 
if there is no conceptual framework for the country. Ozolas also 
proposed creation by Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia of a plan 
for comprehensive defense against a possible threat. 
  Characterizing in general terms the discussion that had 
taken 
place, the foreign minister asserted that it had been useful. He 
proposed to the opposition that it formulate a conceptual 
framework for foreign policy and guaranteed that no one will 
need to go underground in the wake of this discussion. In 
concluding, the minister said, "Let the people discharge the 
responsibility that they are assuming."

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Yelagin, under the "The Military" </F>
rubric: "The Baltics Are Looking for Allies"] 
  [Text] Vyacheslav Ivanovich Yelagin was born in 1946. 
He graduated from the Moscow State University Foreign Relations 
Institute. He is the supervisor of a section of the department 
of the MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] of Russia. 
  The breakup of the system of bloc confrontation in Europe 
opened up the most favorable prospects before the Baltic 
republics for the conduct of a balanced policy in the sphere of 
military-political cooperation. The Baltic countries intend to 
cooperate closely with one another on this question, which, of 
course, is not at all unnatural. Just in recent months, a 
number of practical steps were taken for this purpose. A meeting 
of the ministers of defense occurred in September, and in 
November there was a conference of senior army ranks. One 
principal question was discussed: the elaboration of a unified 
defense policy of the Baltic states. Recommendations were also 
put forward for united efforts in a number of spheres of 
military construction. In particular, the parties came to an 
agreement on the unification of armaments systems and on the 
operational exchange of information of a defense nature. A 
coincidence of viewpoints was displayed regarding the 
possibility of the participation of the Baltic states in 
peacekeeping actions. The creation of a combined Baltic 
battalion of 650 bayonets is being proposed for this purpose. 
  Special attention is being given in military-political 
circles of the Baltic countries to their integration into 
Western security structures. Thus, one of the recent 
announcements of the ruling Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania 
notes that "close cooperation with NATO, NACC [North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council], WEU [Western European Union], and other 
organizations is consistent with Lithuania's national 
interests." And Lithuania intends to cooperate closely with 
Latvia and Estonia on this question. 
  The concept of the national security of the country was 
discussed at a conference of party leaders of the Estonian 
parliament. The political leaders came out for cooperation with 
the international defense structures of the West and the 
creation of regional security structures. The thesis of "total 
defense" was put forward at the conference, and the principle of 
abandonment of neutrality. A proposal was also heard to arm the 
citizens of the republic and to strengthen border security owing 
to the "Estoniazation" of the border area population. 
  The Baltics do not conceal the fact that what they would 
like 
to do most of all is to take the path of arranging close 
military ties with NATO in order to strengthen the security of 
their states in the face of foreign danger. They are calling on 
the North Atlantic bloc to give security guarantees, to conclude 
agreements on dispatching reinforcements in the event that 
crisis situations arise, to assist in the development of 
mobilization plans, training of command personnel, organization 
of the border service, and modernization of infrastructure 
facilities transferred by Russian military units, and to supply 
military equipment. 
  Active discussions are going on about the "Partnership for 
Peace" plan, with the aim of extracting from it the maximum 
possible strengthening of relations with the West. Lithuanian 
President Algirdas Brazauskas declared that Lithuania intends to 
strive for the signing of a treaty or an agreement with NATO on 
partnership and cooperation. Lithuania, in the words of the 
president, supports NATO efforts to extend the security zone to 
all the states of Europe who want this. 
  And nevertheless, the choice of the Baltics in the direction 
of unilateral cooperation with NATO puts one on guard. Forces 
that are in opposition to the governments of the Baltic states 
are especially active in this respect. For example, the 
"Fatherland Union"--a new party of an extreme right orientation 
established on the basis of the Sajudis movement and headed by 
Vytautas Landsbergis--is persistently striving for Lithuania's 
acceptance into NATO. And this despite the fact that the 
question of NATO membership was completely removed from the 
agenda at the meeting of the NACC in Brussels. 
  In turn, NATO headquarters in Brussels are prepared to give 
the Baltic republics as much help as possible in the formation 
of national armed forces, on condition that they are of an 
exclusively defensive nature and are not directed at changing 
the existing balance of forces in this region. What is more, at 
the "Future Security" conference held in Vilnius, General John 
Waters, the deputy commander in chief of NATO's combined armed 
forces in Europe, directed attention to the fact that the "slide 
of some states to positions of nationalism and militarism" is 
causing increasing concern among NATO's leaders. There are also 
no intentions in NATO under any circumstances, judging by 
statements of its representatives, to occupy military facilities 
abandoned by Russian troops. The maximum that the Baltics can 
expect, as Manfred Werner, the general secretary of the North 
Atlantic Alliance, gave Minister of National Defense Linas 
Linkevicius to believe, is NATO assistance in military 
construction; for example, in identifying defense systems and in 
teaching English to compulsory service soldiers and officers in 
training. However, the parameters of military relations of 
individual NATO countries with Baltic states, it appears, are 
beginning to go beyond the outlined scope of late. 
  Realizing that the possibilities for full membership in NATO 
now are unlikely, the Baltic countries are developing variants 
of establishing certain bloc formations as a counterweight to 
Russia. The thesis about the need for rapprochement with some 
neighboring states to the detriment of Russia's interests is 
receiving wider and wider circulation. Baltic politicians are 
repeating publicly that their countries will never be "under the 
Russian collective security umbrella." And friendly relations 
with Russia are seen in Vilnius, Riga, and Tallinn primarily in 
mutually profitable economic cooperation, without which it will 
evidently be difficult to live. 
  But the very same Landsbergis publicly accuses Moscow of "an 
imperial policy," claiming that Russia, he says, will recreate 
"a post-Soviet Euroasiatic union," and that in its relations 
with neighboring states it will conduct an official policy of 
"reintegration," accompanied by bloodshed in Moldova, in the 
Caucasus, and in Central Asia. 
  The arrangement of the heads of the governments of Russia 
and 
Lithuania concerning the preparation of an agreement on 
questions of military transit to Kaliningrad Oblast became the 
subject of sharp attacks on the part of the Lithuanian 
opposition. The basic argument, they say, is that the foreign 
policy of Lithuania is made secretly, behind the back of the 
Seimas. But the press organ of the opposition--LIETUVOS 
AIDAS--came to the direct stunning conclusion that "the military 
transit of Russia over Lithuanian territory is impermissible and 
equivalent to an escalation of aggression." But even this did 
not seem to be enough. The newspaper proposes to transform 
Kaliningrad Oblast into a kind of a subject of international 
trade between Russia, Lithuania, and Germany. Meanwhile, it is 
well known that no kind of military equipment is being 
transported through Lithuanian territory to Kaliningrad. Mainly 
building materials and foodstuffs are being transported there. 
To the credit of official Vilnius, it calls the future agreement 
on military transit "a vital necessity," recognizing the right 
of Russia to defend this territory. 
  Anti-Russian actions of this kind will hardly promote a 
strengthening of the international prestige of the Baltic 
countries. This thought was distinctly expressed during his 
visit to Lithuania by FRG President Richard von Weizsacker, who 
emphasized that peace and prosperity in the region of the Baltic 
Sea are possible only in the neighborhood of a peaceful and 
flourishing Russia. Current and future politicians of the Baltic 
states evidently should not forget these prophetic words. 
  The military doctrine of the Russian Federation was given a 
hostile reception in the Baltics. They see in it a threat to 
their national security interests and the aspirations of Russia 
to return to itself the status of a superpower and to resolve 
interstate relations from a position of strength. It seems that 
here the Baltic leaders are forgetting one simple truth: Our 
doctrine has a strictly defensive character. It provides for the 
use of force only in response to open aggression from outside, 
and also in the conduct of peacekeeping operations in areas of 
conflict in order to stop bloodshed. The Russian Armed Forces 
are called upon to guarantee the stability of the Russian state. 
Therefore, they do not constitute any kind of threat to the 
national security of the Baltic states. To think otherwise means 
to engage in wishful thinking. 
<H6>  * * * * </H6>
  The results of the parliamentary elections were met in 
Vilnius, Riga, and Tallinn with noticeable alarm. This kind of 
anxiety is quite understandable. The success of the 
nationalistic forces in Russia has put the world community on 
guard. But the Baltics, it seems, are pursuing their own 
egotistical interests. In contrast to other countries, the 
anti-Russian notes have gotten even stronger here against this 
background. Politicians of all ranks have again begun to speak 
about the "Great Russian chauvinism and aggressive revanchism," 
which, they say, threatens the security of the Baltics. Some of 
them have reached the point of calling on the West to take 
extraordinary measures to isolate Russia. Demands can also be 
heard to attract to their side states of the CIS to counteract 
Russia, in particular Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. Prime 
Minister of Estonia Mart Laar came out for the urgent 
integration of the Baltic countries into the European Union and 
NATO. All possible predictions are being made on the question of 
the withdrawal of Russian troops and the maintenance of the 
still remaining military facilities. 
  The impression is being created that the recent events in 
Russia are being used by these politicians for the justification 
of the tough line they are conducting both with respect to 
Russia and the Russian-speaking population that resides in the 
Baltic states. The elections that were held, as has already been 
announced in Moscow, will not have an influence on the foreign 
policy of Russia toward the Baltics, for in its essence it will 
remain that of the president.

<F P=106> [Interview with Boris Yevgenyevich Paton, president of the </F>
Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, full member of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences, and twice Hero of Socialist Labor, by 
PRAVDA correspondent Viktor Drozd; place and date not given: 
``Academies of All Countries, Unite!''--first paragraph is 
PRAVDA introduction] 
  [Text] The founding meeting of the International 
Association of Academies of Sciences (IAAS) was held in Kiev. 
One of the initiators of its establishment, President of the 
Academy of Sciences of Ukraine Boris Yevgenyevich Paton, a full 
member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and twice Hero of 
Socialist Labor, answers the questions of a PRAVDA correspondent. 
  [Drozd] Boris Yevgenyevich, how do you appraise the policy 
of 
Ukraine, Russia, and the other countries of the CIS with respect 
to science, first of all basic science? 
  [Paton] The cooperation of labor of scientists of Ukraine, 
Russia, and the other countries, which were a part of the USSR, 
is very significant. This cooperation enriched world science 
with outstanding achievements and discoveries. The harm, which 
is being done today to science in our countries under the 
conditions of the growing economic crisis and is hard to 
compensate for, is all the more perceptible. Creative 
collectives and traditional ties, which were established by the 
efforts of scientists of several generations, are 
disintegrating, the scale of basic research in the most 
promising, vitally important directions is decreasing. This then 
and there resulted in a substantial decrease of the overall 
level of scientific research, affected the quality of the 
training of scientists and scientific and technical personnel, 
and caused irreversible consequences in the entire system of 
education. Today the governments are no longer able to finance 
properly even the most prestigeous research institutions that 
are concentrated in the academies of sciences. Hence the mass 
``brain drain.'' 
  All this represents an unmistakable threat to the national 
interests of Russia, Ukraine, and the other sovereign states and 
is fraught with the most serious consequences for the 
intellectual potential of our peoples. For, as the great Pasteur 
noted, science should be the most sublime incarnation of the 
homeland. At all times in the most developed countries 
scientists enjoyed special attention and privileges. Precisely 
the labor of scientists promoted the economic and social 
progress of these states. It is appropriate to mention that in 
the five most developed countries (the United States, Japan, 
Germany, Great Britain, and France) the financing of science per 
scientific worker came in 1992 on the average to 
$130,000--several hundredfold more than in our countries. Such a 
situation threatens us with chronic backwardness and the 
irrevocable loss of previously gained leading positions in world 
science. 
  [Drozd] What must be done to correct the situation? 
  [Paton] It is necessary to formulate quickly a goal-oriented 
technological strategy, which has been coordinated with the 
program of the structural reorganization of industry and the 
conversion of the defense complex and with economic 
organizational transformations. Further it is necessary to 
increase state support of basic research and to develop the 
innovation process. To form what is called ``firm'' science, to 
establish large state sectorial and intersectorial scientific 
and technological centers in priority directions, and to ensure 
the rapid transfer of technologies between the civilian and 
military spheres. 
  All this should be provided for in the state concept of 
scientific and technical policy. Ukraine, Russia, and the other 
countries, which have come into being on the territory of the 
USSR, thus far do not have such a concept. The efficient 
coordination of the structures of the state management of the 
scientific and technical sphere and the financial support, which 
is independent of them, of priority basic scientific research 
are needed. 
  [Drozd] Will the established association, apparently, serve 
the restoration of the intellectual potential and broken 
scientific ties? 
  [Paton] The scientists of the academies of sciences of the 
republics, which were a part of the USSR, are sincerely 
interested in the continuation of cooperation that is based on 
the community of a large number of scientific schools. 
International experience also confirms that progress in science 
is impossible both without the narrow specialization of 
scientists and without the integration of sciences. The role of 
science and scientists in the establishment and strengthening of 
a favorable climate of interrelations among states is also 
indisputable. That is why the aspiration to preserve the jointly 
produced scientific potential is inducing people to specific 
actions. One of them is the uniting of leading scientists in the 
International Association of Academies of Sciences. 
  [Drozd] In what will the activity of the association 
consist? 
  [Paton] The concept of the association in the process of its 
formulation and discussion changed, subject to the political 
situation. And this is understandable. The changes in the state 
structure and the profound crisis of national and economic 
relations, by which the countries that were a part of the USSR 
were affected, are also affecting the sphere of science. It is 
therefore exceptionally important to create precisely now such 
conditions for the cooperation of scientists of the sovereign 
states, which would make it possible to use effectively the 
common intellectual potential. 
  Of course, the IAAS neither in its goals and functions nor 
in 
the nature of its activity will be any administrative 
superstructure over the national academies of sciences. Each of 
them (and not just those from the countries of the CIS) in its 
activity is completely independent of the association and is 
guided by its own charter and the legislation of its state. 
  The basic work of the association will be concentrated in 
permanent and temporary committees for fields, directions, and 
the most important problems of science, which can be established 
at scientific centers that hold a leading position in their 
field. Fundamentally important questions of the development of 
basic science will be discussed at sessions of the general 
assembly or at conferences of the association. 
  [Drozd] What assets will the IAAS have? Who will finance it? 
  [Paton] It is proposed to carry out the financing of the 
IAAS 
both by means of subsidies of the association members themselves 
and by means of expert and scientific consulting activity and 
charitable contributions. 
  [Drozd] How many national academies of sciences were 
founders 
of the association? 
  [Paton] The establishment of the IAAS has now been supported 
by 12 countries of the former USSR. The republics of the Baltic 
region have expressed interest in cooperating with the 
association after its establishment. The Academies of Sciences 
of Vietnam, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic are also among 
those who signed the agreement on the establishment of the 
Association. The last two did so as observers. Representatives 
of the international scientific community: Sir Arnold Bergen, 
president of the Academy of Europe, and Prof. Mohammed Hassan, 
executive secretary of the Academy of Sciences of the Third 
World, also took part in the founding meeting of the IAAS. The 
agreement on the association is open for signing by the 
academies of sciences of other states.

<F P=106> [Article by DELOVOY MIR commentator Igor Krylov under the </F>
rubric ``Examination'': ``Russian Science Through the Eyes of 
European Specialists''--first paragraph is DELOVOY MIR 
introduction] 
  [Text] The international conference ``The Science and 
Technology and Innovation Policy of Russia'' was held at the 
Russian Academy of Management. Two voluminous documents, which 
analyze in detail the situation in Russian science: the ``Base 
Report'' (more than 200 pages of text), which was prepared by an 
expert group of the Ministry of Science and Technology Policy of 
Russia, and the conclusion based on it--what is called the 
``Evaluation Report'' (67 pages of text), which was written by 
experts of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD)--were discussed. 
  The OECD traces its history back to 1948--the organization 
was established for the purpose of restoring the war-ravaged 
European economy on the basis of the Marshall Plan. Today the 24 
most industrially developed countries of the world are the 
members of the OECD. More than 20 committees belong to the 
structure of the organization. An expert group of one of 
them--the Committee for Scientific and Technical 
Policy--performed to the order of Russia much evaluation work. 
  In the summer of last year the Ministry of Science and 
Technology Policy addressed to the OECD the request to conduct a 
survey. The examination was necessary for the objective 
distribution of western financial aid and adjustments of the 
scientific and technical policy of Russia. 
  According to the assessment, which Minister of Science Boris 
Saltykov gave at a press conference, the conclusions of the 
examination of the OECD for the most part confirmed the 
correctness of the policy being pursued by his department, the 
``Evaluation Report'' does not contain any particular surprises 
for him, while many of the recommendations of the OECD have 
already begun to be used in practice. ``The process is even more 
important than the result'' is how the minister expressed 
himself. 
  Thus, what are the basic recommendations of the examination 
of the OECD and how did the participants in the representative 
world scientific forum (in addition to Russian specialists 
delegations of 19 OECD member countries and eight international 
organizations participated in the conference) appraise them? For 
precisely these recommendations will be of fundamental 
importance for western foundations, banks, financial groups, and 
firms when implementing various projects for the support of 
Russian science. 
  The first thesis that is heard persistently in the 
``Evaluation Report'' is that the scientific potential of Russia 
is its second national wealth after raw material resources. But 
the structure of science is extremely distorted and 
``excessively overweighted'' by the defense, space, nuclear, and 
machine building complex. This structure is absolutely 
unsuitable for a market economy, and for this reason the OECD's 
examination concludes that the decrease of the number of people 
employed in science and scientific service by two-thirds is 
inevitable. Calculating the real possibilities of Russia in the 
maintenance of scientific personnel, the report names 300,000 
people. OECD experts recommend reductions first of all at the 
expense of technical and administrative personnel, as well as 
inefficient sectorial science. 
  The Russian Federation Ministry of Science and Technology 
Policy did not agree that there are still too many scientific 
personnel in Russia, and specified its policy in the following 
thesis: 
  ``To halt the further destruction of the scientific 
potential, to cultivate new structures alongside old ones.'' 
However, here it was admitted that sectorial science needs 
significant institutional reorganization and market 
reorientation. 
  This evaluation was confirmed by data of Russian 
specialists. 
Thus, the following facts from the ``Base Report'' were cited in 
the statement of Nadezhda Gaponenko, chief of the department of 
scientific policy and forecasting of the Center of Research and 
Statistics of Science: No more than 10 percent of sectorial 
science is capable of working at the world level, no more than 5 
percent of the assets being invested in it lead to the 
development of innovative technologies. At the same time 
sectorial scientific research institutes in the number of 
personnel and expenditures make up more than 70 percent of the 
entire research infrastructure. 
  The second most important thesis of the ``Evaluation 
Report'' 
is that the mechanism of the management of science, which exists 
in Russia, is inefficient due to the lack of unified monitoring 
of the distribution of budget allocations. The OECD experts gave 
a negative assessment to the removal from the Ministry of 
Science and Technology Policy of the functions of the 
supervision of the higher school, which took place at the 
beginning of 1993, and to the removal of Boris Saltykov from the 
post of vice premier. Representatives of the Ministry of Science 
and Technology Policy also acknowledged this, having spoken 
about the return in 1993 to the old system of the formation of 
the budget of science, in case of which the Ministry of Defense, 
the Ministry of Atomic Energy, the Russian Space Agency, the 
State Committee for Industrial Policy, the RAS [Russian Academy 
of Sciences], and so on determine a large portion of it. Under 
the conditions, when the Ministry of Science and Technology 
Policy actually controls only a small portion of the budget of 
civilian science, the monitoring of the effectiveness of the use 
of assets is impossible. Consequently, as compared with 1992, 
when the Ministry of Science and Technology Policy controlled 
the science budget entirely, the chances of Russia to attract 
western investments to this sphere have worsened significantly. 
  Estimating the amounts of foreign investments in Russian 
science, the report names a figure of $500 million (of it 
approximately half is along the lines of state programs, the 
other half is investments of private firms). The OECD experts 
rate very pessimistically the prospects of subsequent private 
investments in this sphere: ``Russian scientific organizations 
understand cooperation as an exercise in the obtaining of aid 
that is intended for the maintenance of the existing structure 
of science, while private business of the OECD countries is 
seeking projects that are of mutual interest.'' So that the 
report recommends that the directors of scientific research 
institutes (and first of all sectorial scientific research 
institutes) seek financing from their colleagues in domestic 
industry. For the present the OECD experts have estimated the 
contribution of industry to the financing of research and 
development in the total amount of expenditures at less than 5 
percent. Such a situation, in their opinion, is irrational and 
inefficient. In no country of the world will the state budget be 
able to provide all scientific and technical financing. 
  At the same time there are areas that were rated at 
top-priority ones for western financing. First of all these are 
the acquisition of foreign scientific literature and the 
subscription to journals. The report states indignantly that 
instead of the allocation of $12 million for subscription in 
currency, which were envisaged by the 1992 budget, the libraries 
of the RAS received from the USSR Academy of Sciences an 
``heir's debt'' of $175 million. 
  Other priority spheres are aid to Russian scientific centers 
with instruments and equipment, materials and agents for 
experiments and the establishment of telecommunications systems. 
The state of the scientific museums and libraries of Russia with 
unique collections aroused particular concern of the OECD 
experts--their affairs are so deplorable that the report demands 
the quickest financial aid for urgent rescue measures. 
  In evaluating the programs of aid to Russian basic science, 
the report dwells first of all on the successes of the Soros 
Foundation, which is distributing $100 million among 25,000 
selected scientists. According to the estimates of the OECD 
experts, western investments already come to about 30 percent of 
all Russian funds for science, including its military sector, 
which is an exceptionally important lever of influence on 
research themes. 
  The OECD experts do not dramatize the problem of the ``brain 
drain,'' estimating its scale by the figure of on the order of 
30,000 specialists--this is 10-15 percent of the total losses 
that have been incurred by the sphere of science in the last 
three years. For the solution of the problem the ``Evaluation 
Report'' recommends summer seminars of young scientists and 
programs of the practical training of thoae with undergraduate 
degrees and graduate students at western scientific centers. The 
experts believe that given guarantees of regular trips abroad, 
talented Russian scientists will remain in the country and will 
acquire enormous psychological support, while constantly working 
together with western colleagues. 
  The report rates very critically the situation in the area 
of 
the social sciences, not seeing prospects of a demand for social 
scientists either in Russia or in the West. The OECD experts 
believe that the social scientists, who received training in the 
USSR, were simply deprived completely of humanities knowledge in 
its worldwide understanding, and only a few are capable of 
adaptation. 
  The innovation part of both the ``Base Report'' and the 
``Evaluation Report'' is most poorly developed, which was 
repeatedly noted by the speakers: Mikhail Tsimbalov, chief of an 
administration of the Committee for Patents and Trademarks, 
Dmitriy Piskunov, director of the analytical center of the 
Ministry of Science and Technology Policy, and others. This lack 
of development is connected in many respects with the lack of 
the necessary statistical data on the sphere of innovative 
activity, about which Prof. Yuriy Yakovets, head of a chair of 
the Academy of the National Economy, spoke bitterly. 
  As a whole the report notes that, in spite of the 
introduction of a package of laws on the protection of 
intellectual and industrial property, in Russia the questions of 
the reliable protection of the rights of patentees have not been 
settled, thus far the Patent Court has not been set up. The OECD 
experts note that the resources and finances, which are being 
allotted from the budget of the Committee for Patents and 
Trademarks, are obviously inadequate for the accomplishment of 
urgent tasks and the bringing of the new Russian patent system 
``out of its infancy.'' 
  Among the other obviously undeveloped items of the technical 
policy of Russia the OECD experts noted the uncontrolled 
destruction of such most important units of the scientific and 
technical infrastructure as the system of certification, 
standardization, and scientific and technical information. The 
process of the privatization of institutions of the scientific 
sphere, according to the data of the ``Base Report,'' is at the 
initial stage--37 scientific organizations have been privatized. 
In the opinion of the experts of both Russia and the OECD, 
people are continuing, alas, to carry over mechanically the 
forms and methods of privatization from the sphere of physical 
production to privatization in science. The procedural questions 
of the evaluation of intellectual property in the process of 
privatization have also not been settled. The ``Evaluation 
Report'' demands that Russia establish precise norms--what can 
be privatized in the scientific sphere and what is ``inalienable 
public wealth'' that is not liable to privatization. 
  In evaluating as a whole the recommendations and conclusions 
of the OECD experts, it is merely possible to state that Russian 
science (with the exception of individual most advanced areas of 
basic research) can hardly count on major western investments, 
particularly from the private sector. I am certain that the main 
benefit of the performed expert work for the team of first-class 
professionals, which the leadership of the Ministry of Science 
and Technology Policy is forming around itself today, also 
consists precisely in this. At any rate, Minister Boris Saltykov 
stated firmly and unequivocally: ``The recommendations of the 
OECD are very useful, but we are obliged to form our own 
scientific and technical policy.''

<F P=106> [Article by journalist Pavel Zybin: ``Do We Need </F>
Antarctica?''--first paragraph is IZVESTIYA introduction] 
  [Text] With the arrival of autumn, when the time to send 
the next Antarctic expedition on its way is coming, many people 
are asking themselves this question over and over again. Is it 
not too great a luxury for the country, whose economy is 
experiencing far from the best of times, to allow itself such 
expensive projects? 
  In the words of Valeriy Kalatskiy, first deputy chief of the 
Federal Service of Russia for Hydrometeorology and Environmental 
Monitoring, even from a purely economical standpoint it is 
necessary to preserve the Russian scientific stations in 
Antarctica. 
  Such enormous work has now been done that for Russia it is 
more advantageous to complete it and not to give it up and then 
start all over again. At the Vostok continental station a hole 
2,751 meters deep has already been drilled, unique scientific 
data, the value of which it is difficult to overestimate, have 
been obtained. So much money has already been invested in this 
project that if the station is shut down, the losses will prove 
to be greater than the assets which it remained to invest. 
  This year Rosgidromet [the Federal Service of Russia for 
Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring] is not receiving 
the full financing of the expedition. However, life is making it 
incumbent to enter the market, scientists are not only going 
about with an outstretched hand. In accordance with bilateral 
understandings with the United States it is succeeding in 
financing in part the research in Antarctica. Another two 
intergovernmental agreements with Chile and Italy on the 
conducting of research in Antarctica with the use of the Russian 
scientific and material potential have now been prepared. It is 
a matter, first of all, of the Vostok station--one of two that 
are located in the center of Antarctica. These agreements are 
making it possible to partially finance the expedition. And 
nevertheless there is not enough money, because financing is 
being carried out with a delay. The prices for fuel, for 
example, have increased by nearly tenfold, while the indexing of 
expenditures is being carried out with a coefficient of 1.8. 
  Now five operating stations out of eight remain. But it is 
necessary to recover somehow from the situation. If in the 
immediate future it is not possible to settle the question of 
financing, the Vostok station will have to be shut down, 
inasmuch as there is practically no fuel left there. Precisely 
the question of the delivery of fuel is now ``bringing to a 
standstill'' the entire expedition. 
  But Vostok is a unique station. If we lose it, we will lose 
not only the material support of foreign partners, but also 
scientific data, which are so necessary. Work is being performed 
here under the ozone layer monitoring program, the deep drilling 
of the glacial cover, which here is nearly the greatest on 
earth, is being carried out. 
  These data are necessary for the making of a forecast, on 
the 
basis of which decisions on the reaction of the decrease of the 
ozone layer and the change of the climate, behind which lie 
enormous material expenditures on the scale of the country, will 
be made at the state level. But this is not so much a scientific 
question as it is an economic one. 
  One must also not forget that as a result of geological 
research in Antarctica mineral deposits were discovered. To 
ignore this means not to care about the future, to say nothing 
of the international obligations of Russia and our prestige.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Vladimirovich Belov, deputy </F>
chairman of the Russian Federation Committee for Patents and 
Trademarks, by DELOVOY MIR commentator Igor Krylov, under the 
rubric ``Innovations''; place and date not given: ``The Patent 
Situation in Russia''--first paragraph is DELOVOY MIR 
introduction] 
  [Text] On 1 September new amounts of the patent fees were 
introduced in Russia. But last week in Uzhgorod (Western 
Ukraine) delegations of the CIS countries held talks on the 
prospects of the creation of a common CIS patent and an 
interstate patent office. These events--extremely important ones 
for the development of the innovation process--were at the 
center of the conversation of DELOVOY MIR commentator Igor 
Krylov with Vladimir Belov, deputy chairman of the Russian 
Federation Committee for Patents and Trademarks. 
  [Krylov] Vladimir Vladimirovich, first of all about the main 
parameters of the situation: How many applications for patents, 
useful models, and trademarks are people now submitting? 
  [Belov] Last year yielded 34,000 applications for patents, 
this year we expect not less than 40,000. The decline has 
halted, and invention activity has gone up, though slowly for 
the present. From foreign firms 2,313 applications were 
received, 9,515 were received from the republics of the CIS. The 
breakdown of the granted patents of Russia is also 
noteworthy--legal persons receive about 60 percent, inventors 
themselves receive the remaining 40 percent. As a whole this 
approximately corresponds to world practice. 
  As is known, the patent law of Russia introduced a deferred 
system of examination, but nearly half of the applicants do not 
use it--they submit a petition for the conducting of a full 
examination at the same time as the application for a patent. In 
world practice on the average not more than a fourth of the 
applications are submitted with such petitions. Here, I think, a 
certain inertia of the thinking of our patent experts and the 
lack of a habit for the deferment of the examination for the 
present are working. Many applications, incidentally, contain 
the request to speed up the publication of the patent and to 
give it earlier than the 18 months that are envisaged by the 
law. As a rule, this is connected with the patenting of an 
invention abroad and other requirements of its quickest 
commercialization--advertising, participation in exhibitions, 
and others. 
  The number of applications for trademarks for several years 
now has been increasing steadily--in 1992, 29,000 of them were 
submitted, the annual increase came to 12.5 percent. Russian 
applicants submitted 17,000 applications, 4,000 were submitted 
from countries of the CIS, 12,000 were submitted from remote 
foreign countries. Incidentally, Ukraine yields on the order of 
80 percent of the applications for trademarks and 60 percent of 
the applications for patents from nearby foreign countries. Is 
this not evidence of the close interweaving of our economies? 
  In 1992, 2,730 applications for industrial designs were 
submitted, and the tendency for the protection of this important 
type of industrial property to decline thus far, unfortunately, 
has not been overcome. The legal protection of useful models was 
introduced with the coming into force of the new patent law--on 
14 October 1992. On 1 September 1993 about 100 applications had 
been submitted. Apparently, applicants for the present are 
taking a close look, but I link precisely with useful models the 
hopes for the increase of invention activity. According to my 
predictions, in the future not less than half of the 
applications for new technical solutions will be received 
precisely for useful models. 
  [Krylov] Do you foresee difficulties in the process of the 
examination of useful models and the consideration of disputes 
about the legitimacy of the granting or the violation of a 
patent for a useful model? For the procedure of the examination 
of a useful model, as is known, is at sight--they grant a patent 
``at the risk'' of the applicant, without guarantees. 
  [Belov] Indeed, conflicts and disputes about the validity of 
a patent for a useful model are possible. We do not forecast too 
many misunderstandings with regard to useful models. But 
nevertheless we are developing a procedure of their examination 
before taking them to court. That is, before the submission of 
an objection to the Appellate Chamber the interested parties 
will be able together with an expert to determine the conformity 
to the criteria of patentability of the granted patent for a 
useful model. But as a whole, as I have already said, we do not 
expect many such disputes--the term of the legal protection of a 
useful model is only five years, while the fees for them are 
lower than for patents for inventions. 
  [Krylov] It may, perhaps, interest many people, why they 
established the patent fees in fixed amounts, when there is 
hyperinflation outside. After all, at the State Motor Vehicle 
Inspectorate and so on today they take many fees and fines on 
the basis of the amount of the minimum wage. 
  [Belov] The point is that the maximum term of effect of a 
patent is 20 years, while during this time the minimum wage will 
be revised so many times.... How is one to calculate the fee? On 
the basis of the minimum wage for the year of priority, or the 
granting of the patent, or the making of a specific payment? 
  Moreover, several republics within the Russian Federation 
have their own minimum wage norms, which differ from federal 
norms. As a whole I believe that it is necessary to allow the 
applicant to work under the conditions of stable patent fees, in 
spite of the complete instability of the ruble. No one here ever 
calculated how much revenue patent fees can yield, to what 
extent they are capable of covering the work of the patent 
office.... Everything went to the state budget. Now the question 
of the division of patent fees is constantly arising during the 
discussion of the questions of the establishment of the 
Interstate Patent Office of the CIS. Armenia, for example, is 
demanding for itself 100 percent of the patent fees.... 
  There is another urgent thing: The model of the patent 
convention of the CIS, which is being discussed today, differs 
from the European model or the model of the Agreement on 
International Patent Cooperation. The applicant, who submitted 
an application for a CIS patent during the first year, does not 
have the right to choose--he should pay the patent fees in all 
the countries that are parties to this agreement. In general 
talks on any patent problems of the CIS member countries proceed 
slowly and with difficulty. The main result of the meeting held 
in Uzhgorod was the fact that we arrived at a preliminary 
agreement--30 percent of the patent fees go to the budget of the 
Interstate Office, the rest goes to the member countries. 
  The main problem today consists in the fact that all the 
partners to the talks without exception believe: Russia 
personally should advance all the expenses on the establishment 
of the Interstate Patent Office. They substantiate this by the 
inheriting by Russia from the USSR of the property of the former 
State Committee for Inventions and Discoveries. 
  [Krylov] The fact that any property and financial talks of 
the CIS member countries proceed with extreme difficulty, is not 
surprising. But still is there a convergence of positions? What 
has changed in the positions of your colleagues from the young 
patent offices of the states of the CIS? 
  [Belov] I would say that the period of patent euphoria has 
ended. They actually understood all the labor intensiveness and 
complexity of patent work. Today the complete lack in the patent 
offices of the CIS countries of any patent statistics is greatly 
complicating the work. And this is when there are still few 
applications and it is quite easy to count them.... We, 
incidentally, since 1992 have been putting out an annual report 
of the Russian Federation Committee for Patents and Trademarks, 
which has been completed in accordance with all international 
standards of patent statistics. For without clear knowledge of 
the patent situation in its own country any patent office simply 
cannot operate.

<F P=106> [Article by Stanislav Simanovskiy, Yuriy Naido; ``SOS: limit </F>
of decline reached'' under the rubric: ``Current Interview''; 
first sentence is bolded subhead] 
  [Text] The process of undermining national technological 
security has reached a limit beyond which it takes on an 
uncontrollable character. 
  Raw material and the intellect - these are the basic wealth 
of our Fatherland which, at the present historical juncture, are 
the only basis of social-economic transformations. Much is said 
and written about raw materials. The intellectual resource, of 
course, also is of colossal economic potential. If it is not to 
be lost... 
  However we are losing it. Expenditures for science at the 
beginning of 1980s were 4.5-4.7 percent of the national income; 
in the past and current years they are about one percent. And, 
the national income itself has dropped. The technical 
armamentarium of national science which, even without this fact, 
constitutes just a little more than 1 percent of the U.S. level, 
continues to fall. The average salary of a scientist here is 
approximately half that in industry; in America the proportion 
is the reverse. A substantial number of our more highly 
qualified specialists are emigrating. Thus, in the NASA system 
alone (USA) more than 100 of our former citizens are engaged in 
space-related research. In Israel 90 percent of 
military-industrial complex specialists are former Soviet 
citizens. In France, 30 percent of mathematics teachers hired in 
the universities in the past year are Russian. 
  All these are merely particular facets to the dangerous 
process which is already turning into a catastrophe for Russia. 
  National technological security is an integral part of a 
more 
general concept, the national security. A clear definition of 
the latter remains to be developed on the basis of a formulation 
of contemporary and future national state interests of Russia. 
However, the alarm must be struck quickly in the case of an 
obvious threat to these interests. Otherwise, no formulations at 
all will be needed. 
  The task of ensuring technological security can be 
represented as a system of measures directed toward the 
maintenance of the maximally achievable level of the development 
of the domestic scientific-technical and production potential 
given any development in the international situation. This 
refers to a level which would guarantee the survival of the 
national economy through our own intellectual and technical 
resources, which would guarantee its defense adequacy and 
economic independence. The most evident signs of the breakdown 
of the countryUs technological security is the disintegration of 
the national scientific and technical potential and the 
formation of a one-sided technological dependence on the more 
developed Western countries. Today Russia is experiencing the 
influence of both of these factors. Moreover, there is on hand a 
process of intense disintegration of RussiaUs 
scientific-technical potential in the form of the erosion of its 
personnel component, brain drain, deterioration of the 
material-technical and information base of science, the lack of 
demand for scientific and technical achievements, etc. 
  Domestic science and technology, in particular, have been 
placed in circumstances in which their further development has 
begun to a substantial degree to depend on Western material and 
financial assistance. However, even with the outwardly entirely 
positive role of this assistance, it even now carries within 
itself the anlagen of further disintegration of national 
technological security. 
  Analysis of the forms and methods of the rendering of 
financial and material support to Russian science by the West 
(the amount of the help, both actually furnished as well as 
promised, amounts today to nearly half a billion dollars, or 
almost 500 billion rubles at today's dollar exchange rate) shows 
that, apart from a large number of positive factors, it also has 
definite negative consequences. 
  Above all, the system of information collection itself, 
concerning scientific developments, institutions, and research 
personnel for the submission of applications to receive grants 
and other forms of assistance from foreign organizations 
(scientific establishments, funds, international organizations, 
etc.), offers the West the possibility of possessing an 
exhaustive notion of the contemporary state and problems of the 
development of the Russian scientific-technical potential, to a 
degree of knowledgeability that Russian governmental bodies 
responsible for the development of domestic science and 
technology do not have. 
  It seems appropriate to point out that by now more than 10 
different funds have been established in the West for the 
support of science in Russia and the other countries of the CIS. 
Among these are the well-known Soros Fund (USA), which has 
allocated $100 million to the countries of the Commonwealth for 
1993-1994, the National Science Fund of the USA ($25 million), 
the McArthur Foundation ($3 million), and the Mitterand Fund, a 
general European fund (4 million ECU). 
  The detailed knowledgeability regarding our potential 
enables 
the West to identify the most promising lines of research and 
the most qualified and productively working scientific personnel 
for their later use in one form or another in the interests of 
the development of Western science and technology, and economy 
as a whole. The financing of the work of individual Russian 
scientists and of scientific collectives through the system of 
foreign grants and other forms of assistance, the provision of 
contemporary research equipment, instrumentation, and materials, 
and other forms of aid to the general extent indicated above, 
which is also comparable to the extent of domestic financing of 
Russian science (680 billion rubles in 1993), have yet another 
negative aspect. This offers the West the possibility of 
destroying a substantial portion of the scientific-technical 
potential of Russia from the solution of urgent national 
economic scientific and technological problems confronting it, 
thus creating in our country a peculiar sector serving the needs 
of the Western economy. In truth, whoever pays the piper calls 
the tune. 
  Moreover, the possibility arises of the closing down of 
particular lines of development of Russian science and 
technology, even of blocking them, especially in those fields in 
which the particular achievements might prove competitive on the 
world market for the industrial products prepared on their basis. 
  Due to the substantial (up to 60-100-fold) difference in the 
pay of the Western and the Russian scientist, the West thus 
saves a great deal of money for science. On the other hand, the 
receipt by Russian scientists and specialists of currency from 
Western grants and other assistance leads to social tension in 
scientific collectives, and places scientific establishments and 
institutes under obviously unequal conditions. In their race for 
currency wages, given the acute deficit in domestic investments 
in science and technology, many scientists and whole scientific 
collectives are ready to sell scientific and technical 
achievements abroad for nothing, which in a number of instances 
exceed the world level and which constitute a genuine national 
property of Russia. 
  The latter phenomenon is especially dangerous in the sphere 
of the military-industrial complex, since it is directly related 
to the weakening of the country defense potential. This practice 
has become very noticeable recently; however, measures for its 
control had not been worked out. In fact, the transfusion to the 
West of a substantial portion of RussiaUs national wealth is 
taking place without equivalent compensation. 
  It must be stated, regrettably, that the question of 
RussiaUs 
technological security has somehow fallen from the field of view 
of the countryUs leadership. The blunder that has been 
permitted, which is of strategic significance, must be 
eliminated as fast as possible, since the process of undermining 
the national technological security has reached a limit beyond 
which it takes on an uncontrollable character. 
  From our point of view, the core of the preservation and 
strengthening of Russia's national technological security under 
the new conditions must be the principle of equal technological 
dependence of the partners in international collaboration, to be 
formed exclusively under the conditions of international 
scientific-technical cooperation. 
  This principle presupposes the openness of Russian 
scientific-technical potential to the outside world, and 
rejection of autarchy, which corresponds to the spirit of 
economic reform, RussiaUs interests, and the interest of the 
international community. We have in mind also the equivalence of 
the potential damage to the partners in case of a rupture in 
international technological relations. There is a stake in the 
guarantee of an even-handed, synchronized technological 
development of the participants in international collaboration, 
which excludes the possibility of their lagging markedly one 
behind the other or of one outstripping the other. 
  The reality is such that the preservation and growth of the 
scientific-technical potential of our country is possible only 
given the provision of the optimal combination of internal and 
external sources of influence. External factors will probably be 
predominant in todayUs conditions. However, Western aid in its 
various forms should not simply be welcomed, but the appropriate 
mechanism for its most effective acquisition, distribution, and 
use in the interests of Russia should also be created. 
  The viability of domestic science, and consequently, the 
technological security of Russia can and must be achieved 
through our own efforts, through the mobilization of internal 
sources and reserves, above all through broad state support of a 
national scientific-technical potential. It is advisable above 
all to strengthen the legal foundation. For this purpose a 
package of laws should be adopted regarding scientific-technical 
policy, the scientific academies of Russia, the academic 
scientific institution, the status of the scientific worker, and 
the protection of intellectual property, state and other 
secrets. An ensemble of legislative and normative acts, 
regulating the process of brain drain both from Russia abroad 
and from the countries of the former USSR into Russia is also 
required. 
  It would make sense to create a data bank on Russian 
scientists and specialists (including undergraduates and 
graduate students) who would be able to go abroad for possible 
on-the-job training or contract work. A data bank on Russian 
technologies of interest for potential foreign partners is also 
a practical necessity, with the aim of possible commercial sale 
without harm to the countryUs security. It is evident that this 
logically presupposes also the creation of an interdepartmental 
authority (similar to the existing Gostekhkomissiya [State 
Commission for New Technology], but expanding and supplementing 
its function) to control the process of the transfer of Russian 
technology abroad for temporary or permanent operation, a kind 
of Russian COCOM [Coordinating Committee]. 
  It seems advisable to organize on a comprehensive basis the 
coordination of the efforts of the international community to 
offer assistance for the preservation and development of the 
Russian scientific-technical potential. Such coordination would 
include also the creation of an international information system 
in this sphere, of a unified financial fund or bank, and of an 
insurance company. All this would make access to external 
sources of financing simpler and socially fair in the interests 
of all of Russian science, and not of an isolated portion of it.

  [Abstract] Previous work on the possibility of obtaining 
M[.sub]22[/]Cl[.sub]3[/] actinoid clusters showed that all 
bivalent actinoids having an electron configuration of [f[.sup]n- 
1[/]d[.sup]1[/]][.sup]2+[/] are capable of co- 
crystallization with Gd[.sub]2[/]Cl[.sub]3[/], and the 
possibility of individual actinoid cluster synthesis was 
demonstrated. However, attempts of such synthesis by classical 
means proved unsuccessful. Other attempts by electrochemical 
means also proved unsuccessful. In the present work, an attempt 
of An[.sub]2[/]Cl[.sub]3[/] cluster synthesis (where An = 
Th, U, and Np) from melts resulted in reduction to the metallic 
actinoid, and it was concluded that actinoid cluster synthesis 
from melts is not possible by this method. References 6: 3

  [Abstract] All lanthanides and actinides starting with 
protactinium may exist in a homogeneous melt in the 2+ oxidation 
state. When the stabilization energy of the d-level exceeds the 
energy of f-d-excitation, the f-elements are characterized with 
participation of d-electrons in the chemical bond. These 
elements include the lanthanides and Y. The presence of a 
d-electron in the valency orbital is a required condition for 
formation of a condensed cluster, such as 
M[.sub]2[/]Cl[.sub]3[/]. The classical method for this 
synthesis is based on the reaction of the metal with the 
tri-chloride in a melt. However, a basic factor inhibiting this 
reaction in the case of GdCl[.sub]3[/] is the fact that the 
Gd[.sub]2[/]Cl[.sub]3[/] cluster is not thermally stable 
at temperatures above 923 K, while most di- and tri-chlorides 
have melting points considerable higher than this value. It then 
becomes necessary to add an inert component to the melt which 
has a melting point lower than 923 K, such as LiCl (m.p. = 879 
K). In the present work GdCl[.sub]3[/] was reduced with 
divalent lanthanide in a homogeneous melt containing 
NdCl[.sub]2[/] or DyCl[.sub]2[/] at 888 K. After 25 hours 
the Gd[.sub]2[/]Cl[.sub]3[/] cluster is formed. This type 
of reduction does not take place in the presence of TmCl[.sub]2[/].

  [Abstract] In a previous work it was demonstrated that 
curium can exist in the hexavalent state. Where microquantities 
of this substance were sufficient for the proof of valency, 
larger amounts of curium (VI) are needed for purposes such as 
(VI)/(V) pair potential, absorption spectra, states of 
existence, etc. In the present work an attempt was made to 
oxidize curium (III) in solutions of sodium carbonate and 
bicarbonate saturated with N[.sub]2[/]O and treated with 
_g_-radiation from Co[.sup]60[/]. It was assumed that 
oxidation of curium (III) to curium (IV) would lead to 
disproportionation to form curium (VI). However, curium (III) 
fails to oxidize on radiation. Oxidation of curium (III) with 
sodium perxenate in cold sulfuric acid was also unsuccessful.

  [Abstract] Comparison of thermodynamic and optical 
properties and stability in aqueous alkaline solutions of 
heptavalent neptunium, plutonium, and americium, makes it 
possible to predict certain properties of curium (VII). The 
oxidation potential of a metal pair M(VII)/M(VI) in 1 mole per 
liter NaOH increases almost linearly in the series Np-Pu-Am. 
Extrapolation shows that the Cm(VII)/Cm(VI) potential is 1.3 
volts. This value indicates that curium (VII) could at some time 
exist in an alkaline solution. In the present work it is 
postulated that on the basis of published data, preparation of 
curium (VII) in cold alkaline solutions is possible by reaction 
of strong oxidizers with curium (VI). Possible oxidizers include 
ozone, the O[.sup]-[/] ion-radical, and any compound having 
an oxidation potential of 1.3 volts in this medium.

  [Abstract] Neptunium sols are important for the preparation 
of neptunium dioxide microspheres, although information on 
Np(IV) sol preparation in the published literature is sparse. It 
has been demonstrated that heating a solution of neptunium (IV) 
hydroxide in excess nitric acid results in 70 percent conversion 
of neptunium to the colloidal state, depending on the 
temperature and acidity. Also, preparation of uranium (IV) sols 
by oxidation- peptization has been well established, and 
therefore it is reasonable to assume that neptunium (IV) sols 
may be prepared by an analogous method. In the present work 
neptunium (IV) hydroxide was prepared by treating neptunium (IV) 
oxalate with ammonia. The hydroxide had minimum oxalate ion 
content and Np (V) impurity. It was then peptized with 
hydrochloric, nitric, and acetic acids to yield Np (IV) sols in 
2-2.5 mole/liter concentrations and not over 4 percent Np (V) 
content. Absorption spectra are presented. Figure 1; references

  [Abstract] A study examined the effect of annealing 
temperature and structural state on the formation of the 
magnetic properties (permeability and coercitive force) of 
amorphous alloys. An amorphous strip of 
Fe[.sub]80[/]B[.sub]10[/]Si[.sub]10[/] measuring 20 
m in thickness and 10 mm in width was used for the studies. 
The alloy was obtained by enriching iron with 2 atomic percent 
of the stable isotope [.sup]57[/]Fe to make it possible to 
obtain quality Mossbauer conversion electron spectra in a 
relatively short amount of time. The alloy strip was studied in 
its initial state and after cycles of isochronous annealing in a 
vacuum of about 10[.sup]-3[/] Pa for 1 hour at temperatures 
of 50 to 800C. The specimens were also studied by x-ray 
diffraction, Mossbauer absorption spectroscopy, and sliding-beam 
x-ray diffraction. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the 
Fe[.sub]80[/]B[.sub]10[/]Si[.sub]10[/] demonstrated 
that in its starting state, it is amorphous. The first signs of 
its crystallization, manifested in terms of the appearance of a 
weak intensity against the background of the ``halo'' that is 
characteristic of amorphous materials, were observed after 
annealing at temperatures of 295-315C. As the annealing 
temperature was increased, the percentage of crystalline phase 
increased. The study 
Fe[.sub]80[/]B[.sub]10[/]Si[.sub]10[/] was found to 
undergo four stages of structural development: No structural 
changes were evident at 0-300C. At 300-400C, a 
body-centered crystal lattice with the characteristic close 
atomic order similar to that in the amorphous matrix developed; 
this process was accompanied by an explicit change in 
orientation of magnetic moments. At temperatures of 
400-500C, the percentage of body-centered crystal lattice 
increased until the amorphous matrix completely disappeared 
(after the specimen had been held for 1 hour at 455C), and 
processes of close demixing began. At 500-800C, a 
transition to an equilibrium phase diagram occurred. In its 
equilibrium state, the specimen consisted of two phases: a 
body-centered crystal lattice and Fe[.sub]2[/]B. The 
Mossbauer spectroscopy studies pinpointed the temperature of 
onset of crystallization at around 250C and indicated that 
the crystal regions lie at a depth of about 15 nm. The first of 
the above stages (i.e., 0 to 300C) included three stages of 
structural relaxation. They were identified by changes in the 
specimen's magnetic characteristics at 75, 175, and 255C. 
No structural changes were evident in the first two stages. In 
third stage, which is the most favorable from the standpoint of 
optimizing the magnetic properties of amorphous strips and 
increasing the stability of its properties over time, was 
accompanied by the appearance of nanocrystal regions in the 
near-surface layer of the amorphous strip's contact side.

  [Abstract] A study examined the morphology, dimensions, and 
orientation of particles of the ferromagnetic phase in 7.5- to 
15-m-thick microstrips of the cold-deformed stainless steel 
alloys 0Kh12N12M3 and 0Kh12N12K3. The study specimens, which had 
been deformed by rolling to a degree of 98 percent with 
intervening cycles of tempering, were examined under light and 
transmission electron microscopes. The structural studies were 
performed on specimen strips with a thickness of 10 m. The 
alloy 0Kh12N12M3 was determined to have a coercitive force of 
29.5 kA/m, a saturation induction of 0.13, and a residual 
magnetization of 0.09. The alloy 0Kh12N12K3 was determined to 
have a coercitive force of 62.9 kA/m, a saturation induction of 
0.15, and a residual magnetization of 0.13. The particles of the 
specimens' _a_-phase were found to have very diverse shapes and 
sized and to contain the following characteristic types of 
particles/regions: 1) isolated small equiaxial or 
anisotropically shaped _a_-phase particles with a cross section 
of 4 to 10 nm and an axis (l/d) ratio of &lt;3:1; 2) 
highly fragmented (i.e., in a block structure) particles of 
rather diverse shape with cross sections of 10 to 165 nm; and 3) 
colonies of elongated uniaxial particles with cross sections of 
4 to 20 nm and an axis ratio between 3:1 and 12:1 (the direction 
of their long axes was generally close to the direction of 
rolling, and the particles often appeared to consist of 
individual fragments or chains of smaller particles within the 
confines of the defect band); and 4) regions with a relatively 
low density of _a_-phase measuring 0.5-3 m. The studies 
indicated that the main contributor to the study alloys' level 
of magnetic properties are anisotropic particles with a 
heterogeneous structure consisting of disoriented fragments 
(blocks) and/or individual microparticles separated by 
_g_-phase 
interlayers. Figures 4, table 1; references 17: 7 Russian, 10

  [Abstract] A study examined the distribution and effect of 
titanium in the structure of the various components of the 
composite Nb/Cu-Sn when it is used as an alloy-forming element 
in the amount of 0.2 percent by weight. The studies were 
performed on free bronze consisting of copper plus 13 weight 
percent tin and 0.2 weight percent titanium after homogenization 
at 700C for 20 hours and on multifilament composites 
consisting of Nb/Cu plus 13 weight percent Sn and 0.2 weight 
percent titanium (each composite contained 7,225 1-mm-diameter 
filaments) after diffusion annealing at 700C for 72 hours. 
The fine structure of the composites and bronze were studied 
under a JEM-200 CX electron microscope, and the distribution of 
their elements was studied on a JCXA-733 scanning 
microscope/microanalyzer. The studies established that during 
the annealing process, the titanium diffuses from the bronze 
matrix through the Nb[.sub]3[/]Sn layer into the niobium 
filaments. During the course of this process, the growth rate of 
the diffusion layer increased along with its thickness, and the 
anisotropy of the grains' shape decreased. No reduction in grain 
size was observed, however. The thermodynamics and kinetics of 
this redistribution of titanium in the composite were explained 
in terms of previously published mathematical studies of the 
partial free energy of titanium in solid solutions, the change 
in free energy during the face-centered crystal lattice 
body-centered crystal lattice transition, and the condition of 
local equilibrium on the interface between solid solutions. The 
mechanism of the diffusion of titanium from the bronze into the 
filaments was shown to be more complicated but was also 
explained. Figures 7; references 14: 5 Russian, 9 Western.

  [Abstract] A study examined the effect that alloying the 
bronze matrix of an Nb/Cu-Sn composite with gallium in the 
amount of 2 percent by weight has on the alloy's various 
components before and after diffusion annealing. The studies 
were performed on free bronze consisting of copper plus 11 
weight percent tin and 2 weight percent gallium after 
homogenization at 700C for 20 hours, as well as on a single 
filament of Nb/Cu plus 11 weight percent tin and 2 weight 
percent gallium after hot compaction and on a composite 
consisting of 7,225 filaments of the same composite that had 
been subjected to diffusion annealing at 700C for 72 hours. 
The study specimens were examined under a JEM-200 CX 
transmission electron microscope and JCXA-733 scanning electron 
microscope/microanalyzer. The addition of gallium to the study 
composites was demonstrated to cause an increase in the number 
of twins and _e_-phase formations in the bronze matrix due to a 
decrease in packing defect formation energy. During the course 
of diffusion annealing, the gallium diffused into the 
Nb[.sub]3[/]Sn layer and was partially preserved in the 
bronze matrix. Gallium was also found to increase the grain size 
in the superconducting layer and to not facilitate any increase 
in its thickness. The dissolution of gallium in 
Nb[.sub]3[/]Sn in large quantity during the course of 
diffusion annealing was found to result in an increase in the 
electrical resistance of the said phase in its normal state and, 
consequently, in an elevation of the upper critical field. This 
result is in turn associated with the higher current-conducting 
capability of gallium-alloyed conductors in high magnetic fields 
versus that of their nonalloyed counterparts. Figures 8;

  [Abstract] A study examined the effect of low-temperature 
annealing at 200C for 100 hours on the structure and 
superconducting properties of 
YBa[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]7-[/]. Two series of 
single crystals measuring 1 x 2 x 0.1 mm with stoichiometric and 
nonstoichiometric compositions were prepared. The first were 
grown by the method of dissolution in a melt, with a 
close-to-eutectic mixture of BaO and CuO serving as the solvent. 
The melting and crystallization were performed in 
Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-stabilized zirconium dioxide 
crucibles. The starting mixture consisted of 44.8 percent BaO, 
53.5 percent CuO, and 1.7 percent Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]. 
Before the crystallization, the melt was held at 1,030C for 
4 hours, cooled at a rate of 1/h from 1,000C to 
880C, and then further cooled to room temperature at a rate 
of 100/h. The single crystals in the second series were 
subjected to additional oxidative annealing in an oxygen 
atmosphere at 400-650C for 26 hours to achieve oxygen 
stoichiometry. The specimens were studied on a DRON-3M automated 
system. The low-temperature annealing was conducted at 200C 
for 35 and 100 hours. In complete consistency with 
Khachaturyan's theory, the structure of the single crystals with 
a stoichiometric composition (i.e., 
YBa[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]7[/]) turned out to be 
stable and did not undergo any noticeable changes as a result of 
the low-temperature annealing at 200C for 100 hours. Their 
coarse twin structure was completely maintained, their 
diamagnetic response curve remained virtually unchanged, and 
their high temperature of transition to a superconducting state 
prior to annealing remained the same. The single crystals with a 
nonstoichiometric composition, on the other hand, underwent 
significant changes after low-temperature annealing for 200 
hours. Their coarse twins were replaced by a finely disperse 
tweed structure, and many differences between their 
electron-diffraction patterns recorded before and after 
annealing were evident. Their striation after annealing was 
attributed to waves of atomic displacements. Figures 7; 
references 7: 1 Russian, 6 Western.

  [Abstract] Traditional computer architectures are 
inadequate to solve some problems in real time and simple 
parallel computing is inadequate for database operations, 
especially when the database is large. A complete topology 
between processors is needed for efficient processing in real 
time. The ability to reconfigure memory and processors decreases 
the total number of iterations required to process large data 
files. This article examines the possibility of using a 
hypercube switching network to reconfigure processor elements 
and memory in database machines. Two hypercubes are united to 
form a four-dimensional hypercube. Any processor can be linked 
with any memory unit, and any memory unit can be linked with any 
other memory unit. The hypercube can be used to perform 
randomization, sorting, and other relational algebra operations.

  [Abstract] This article examines means of solving the 
Dirichlet problem for the Helmholtz equation in singly-connected 
nearly rectangular regions using Walsh-Pally transforms. The use 
of fast Walsh transforms increases the solution speed (by a 
factor of 1.5-2 over the fast Fourier transform) and reduces the 
amount of computer memory needed. It is found that solving the 
two-dimensional Helmholtz equation may be reduced to solving the 
one-dimensional problem. Figures 2; references 12: 11 Russian, 1

  [Abstract] Systems of differential equations are commonly 
used to mathematically model objects. Nonlinear systems can be 
described using the theory of differential Taylor transforms. 
Models based on these transforms can be solved quickly. The 
simplicity of representing Taylor models and organization of the 
computing process is the basis for the synthesis of functional 
transform structures. Here the mathematical model is converted 
into a spectral model by replacing functions and actions on 
functions with T-spectra and operations on functions with 
operations on differential spectra. The spectral model is a 
system of recurrent equations. The desired functions are found 
in the form of segments of Taylor power series. Linear and 
nonlinear systems of equations can be studied with Taylor 
notation. The example of finding the T-spectrum of trignometric 
and hyperbolic functions is presented. The parallel computing 
structure synthesized here can reproduce T-models of 
trigonometric functions in real time. The advantages of a 
parallel specialized computer over a personal computer are 
shown, specifically, the scheme presented in this article is a 
factor of 80 faster than a YeS-1840 personal computer.

  [Abstract] This article presents an aircraft navigation 
method using reference points. The method makes it possible to 
reduce the volume of cartographic information stored in on-board 
memory. The method is based on analysis and comparison of the 
mutual positions and distances between reference points in a 
fragment of the field observed by sensors and a reference map. 
This approach is similar to a person finding his location by 
identifying known constellations whose position in the sky 
depends on time and the location of the observer. The set of 
observed reference points and the map are described by special 
graphs, and the comparison procedure is formalized as finding 
the maximally isomorphic subgraphs. Results of mathematical 
modeling are described and the accuracy of the method is 
evaluated. Figures 6; references 6 (Russian).

  [Abstract] This article examines discrete orthogonal 
transforms in Galua fields implemented without multiplications. 
Algorithms in which multiplication is replaced by register 
shifts are found to be more efficient. Discrete orthogonal 
transforms are examined in finite fields with representation of 
the input in nontraditional notation systems (e.g., systems with 
an irrational base, Fibonacci codes, ``golden'' proportions, and 
their generalizations) whose basis is generated by a linear 
recurrent sequence. Table 1; references 3: 2 Russian, 1 Western.

pulsed automatic systems are obtained on the basis of 
w transforms which require a positive determination 
of the Hermitian conjugate matrix. These criteria are modified 
so that analysis of the absolute stability of the system is 
reduced to computer verification of the strict continuation of 
the real polynomial. Figure 1; references 18: 15 Russian, 3

  [Abstract] The surface temperature of gallium arsenide 
crystals was determined when they were irradiated by laser 
pulses of a threshold density. Changes of the polished surface 
morphology occur at this temperature. This temperature turned 
out to be about 900 K, which is significantly below the GaAs 
melting temperature. Methods, based on studying relaxation of 
the irradiated crystal transient conductivity were employed for 
the temperature measurements. This involved applying the fact 
that the transition temperature from impurity conductivity to 
intrinsic conductivity can be taken as a reference temperature, 
and the condition that when the temperature is exceeded during 
irradiation, it is accompanied by appearance of a long lasting 
component on the relaxation curve of the transient conductivity. 
Using a set of crystals with a different concentration it was 
possible to determine the temperature on the surface at a 
particular irradiation density. Figures 2, references 6: 4

  [Abstract] Silicon samples, implanted by [.sup]40[/] 
Ar[.sup]+[/] (10[.sup]15[/]cm[.sup]-2[/] 
dose) ions and P[.sup]+[/] (10[.sup]16[/] cm[.sup]-2[/] 
dose) ions with 40 keV energy, were examined employing the 
methods of multiangular ellipsometry and selective moistening 
with a layer-by-layer removal of the implanted section using 
anode oxidation. With implantation by Ar[.sup]+[/] ions, the 
maxima of the experimentally obtained profiles _th_, n and k 
lie 
nearer to the surface, than with implantation by ions 
Ar[.sup]+[/]. This can be explained by the fact that the mass 
of Ar[.sup]+[/][[.sup]2[/]] ions is greater, and the 
implantation dose is slightly smaller than for P[.sup]+[/]. 
With implantation by Ar[.sup]+[/], as well as by 
P[.sup]+[/] ions, the profiles _th_ and k are identical, and 
correspond to the defects' distribution profile in the implanted 
layer. The profile of the n changes is, probably, determined by 
a joint action of the defects and impurity. Figures 3,

  [Abstract] Numerical computations of electron minibands in 
the (GaAs)[.sub]N[/](AlAs)[.sub]M[/] superlattice 
conducted previously by pseudo-potential or strong coupling 
methods demonstrated that the mixing character between electron 
states G and X[.sub]z[/] is significantly different for even 
or odd M. In studies by other authors cited here, the miniband 
structure of the GaAs/AlAs superlattice was computed within the 
framework of the effective mass method applying some boundary 
conditions for the electron wave function, and contrary to the 
empirical results, the even or odd property of the M monolayer 
was not affecting the miniband spectrum. It is demonstrated in 
this study that these boundary conditions require a revision. 
After introducing a sign changing multiplier, depending on the 
number of the superlattice monolayer, the computations in 
approximation of the effective mass also indicate a dependence 
of the GX-mixing effect on the even-odd property of the M 
number. Electron dispersion for two lower miniband is found in 
the superlattice transition region from type I to type II.

  [Abstract] Epitaxial phosphide-gallium p-n-structures on a 
Si-substrate were obtained by the method of gas-phase epitaxy in 
an open chloride system. Their electrical and electroluminescent 
characteristics were examined. The current-voltage 
characteristic at small values of current (6x10[.sup]-8[/] - 
6x10[.sup]- 4[/] A/cm[.sup]-2[/]) exhibits a tunnelling 
behavior. At direct currents, it is exponential (with a 
pre-exponential multiplier 10[.sup]-8[/] A/cm[.sup]2[/] 
and a 75 meV characteristic energy); at reverse currents, it is 
to a power 4). The voltage cut-off is about 1.85 V, the 
breakdown voltage is 12- 18 V and the differential resistance is 
4.5 Ohm. The capacitance- voltage characteristic is to the 
second power with a cut-off voltage of 1.8 V, the slope 
1.75x10[.sup]-4[/] nF[.sup]- 2[/]/Vxcm[.sup]-4[/]. With 
a reverse bias, the obtained structures emit a visible light. 
The electroluminescence spectrum is wide, decreasing to the side 
of large energies of photons in the 1.6 - 2.5 eV range; the 
quantum output of the electroluminescence comprises 
10[.sup]-3[/]%, and does not depend on current. The 
totality 
of experimentally obtained data agrees with the concept of 
avalanche breakdown (with a reverse bias above 12 - 18 V), due 
to shock ionization, which generates the light radiation.

  [Abstract] A new approach to the elimination of interfering 
echo signals in long-distance telephone channels is presented 
based on a combination of traditionally separate 
echo-suppression techniques. The use of both echo rejection and 
echo compensation models within the same equipment is desireable 
to take advantage of the relative technical simplicity of the 
former and the superior signal-handling capabilities of the 
latter. Optimization of the internal characteristics, i. e., 
suppression methods, of echo suppressors has application to 
dynamic, stochastic, discrete and both controlled and 
uncontrolled systems. The effectiveness criterion for the 
suppression method is composed of three subindicators: technical 
difficulty of echo-suppression (in terms of complexity of 
computation); signal quality (expressed in user rating units); 
functional reliability (determined by the expanse of the 
functional conditions). Echo rejection and compensation methods 
are evaluated by the use of computerized simulation or modeling. 
Algorithms are worked out for input, output and primary control 
signals using a recognition device, threshold limiting device 
and a delay line. Block diagrams detail signal processing stages 
in the echo-rejection model, the echo-compensation model and the 
echo-path simulation model. Use of a summing circuit in the 
latter allows an analysis of the effect of various types of 
additive interference for modeling of echo-suppressor breakdown 
conditions. Modeling of external additive noise effects is 
achieved by means of generators employing smoothed noise 
distribution, Gaussian noise distribution, harmonic interference 
and pulsed interference. Results of the evaluation of all 
methods, including the combined method of echo suppression, are 
to be examined in the second part of the article. Figures 3; 
references 13: 12 Russian.

  [Abstract] Analysis of the effects of powerful explosions 
on ground areas containing buried communications cables reveals 
that, in many cases, established limits on such blasting 
operations may be relaxed without significantly affecting the 
mainline cable integrity under dynamic load. Allowable distances 
from the location of the blasting charge, as determined by 
individual cable characteristics, may even be within the throw 
zone of the blast. Employing an analogy to underground pipes, 
the cable is viewed as a structural member resting on a cushion, 
its momentary deformation independent of the orientation of the 
blasting charge relative to its location. Moreover, movement of 
the cable and ground are synchronous and conform to the 
hypocentric distance from the blast. Formulas for determining 
the necessary strength of underground cable are arrived at based 
on computations of the coefficient of seismic intensity, and 
bending moment and radius of curvature of the cable structure. 
Final values for allowable distance are determined to be the 
greater of all values obtained by computation and comparative 
analysis. Charts specifying inherent characteristics for dozens 
of different cable designations are provided for selection of 
the proper cable diameter, rigidity, load-bearing strength, 
jacket thickness, etc. for use in or near areas of seismic 
disturbance. The authors offer their findings as a basis for new 
departmental standards for cable requirements. Figures 3; tables 
2; references: 6 Russian.

  [Abstract] State-of-the-art in the development of computer 
systems with massively-parallel architecture is reviewed. 
Computers with a SIMD (single-instruction, multiple-data) and 
MIMD (multiple-instruction, multiple-data) architecture are 
briefly discussed. This category of architecture is subdivided 
in a large number of sub-groups including: systolic massive 
architecture, linear massive architecture, a matrix forming 
processor massive, etc. The particular features of some 
representative architectures and structures of high level 
parallel processing with simple and complex processor elements 
are examined. Along with various foreign made computers of 
average capacity with complex processor elements, functioning of 
the ``Intelligent Computer 1'' (IK-1) is described. This is a 
parallel multiprocessor system, for general application, 
developed in the Ukrainian AS Cybernetic Institute. Bit- 
sequential processing and role of Hypercube, Theta-Network, and 
Universal Readjustable type communication networks are also 
discussed. Figures 3, references 50: 3 Russian, 47 Western

  [Abstract] Application of a standard demodulator with a 
two- beam filter (TBF) at the input, synthesized by a delay 
line, is examined in this article. Devices with a negative 
frequency feedback (NFFB) are normally employed as noise immune 
demodulators of frequency modulated (FM) signals. The examined 
device is just as effective as the NFFB, but its construction is 
much simpler. With a particular selection of delay, the noise 
band of this filter can reduce the noise band at the demodulator 
input by a factor of two. The phase characteristic of the filter 
between the AFC zeros is linear. With application of linear 
pre-distortions, changes introduced by the TBF into differential 
gain and phase keep them within a norm. A block diagram of the 
device, is provided and its functioning is discussed. 
Computations of differential phase and differential gain 
produced by using the TBF were performed with the assumption 
that a linear pre-distortion filter of TV signals was used at 
the transmitter side. Noise immunity of FM TV signals with a TBF 
at the input was computed and numerical modeling was carried 
out. Efficiency of employing non-linear pre-distortions is also 
examined. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that 
application of the TBF with reception of FM TV signals and 
employment of non- linear pre-distortions is effective. Figures

  [Abstract] The suitability of atmospheric refraction 
measurements from satellites (ISZ) in order to obtain periodic 
data on the weather parameters of the atmosphere and plot their 
vertical profiles and the efficiency of remote refractometric 
probing as well as the expediency of developing an instrument 
for measuring atmospheric refraction prompted the development of 
an instrument which combines the functions of gas analyzer and 
refractometer whereby refraction is measured on the basis of the 
apparent vertical dimension of the sun disc. Block diagrams of 
two design versions and the optical train of the refractometer, 
a block diagram of the signal processing system, and a video 
signal diagram for one line are cited. Both designs are based on 
filming the sunset and sunrise from Salyut orbiters through the 
earth's atmosphere at a small angle between the direction toward 
the sun and the satellite orbit plane whereby the transmitted 
ray perigees dissect the atmosphere almost vertically with a 
small horizontal displacement on the scale of weather variations 
in the weather fields. A vidicon or a dissector can be used as 
the photodetector. Figures 3; references 6.

  [Abstract] Commissioning of the small Dobromyslyanskaya 
hydroelectric power plant on the Chernitsa River in Belarus 
after retrofitting and an overhaul is reported. Initially, the 
plant was equipped with two hydroelectric units with RO123-V-84 
turbines; the new power station employs commercially produced 
pump units serving as turbines and induction motors running as 
generators. This design has advantages both from the cost and 
delivery schedule viewpoints. Data on the power plant equipment 
option costs in 1990 prices are summarized. The range of factors 
which must be taken into account is selecting the pump is 
outlined. Analyses show that pump impellers have a 75% 
efficiency within a broad head range, which is lower than that 
of turbines, but this is compensated for by the low cost of 
equipment which is cheaper by close to tenfold. The particular 
features of induction motors make them especially suitable at 
small power plants with a low head. The power plant overhaul was 
financed by the Vitebsk electric grids under the leadership of 
G.I. Kubarovskiy; plant construction and erection were conducted 
by the Girdotekhnik Association (Lithuania) and Belyy Ugol 
enterprise under the direction of N.V. Shanin. Figures 1; tables

  [Abstract] The design and operating principles of Tokamak 
fusion reactors, their principal parameters, and recent advances 
in controlled nuclear fusion (UTC) research are outlined, and 
the performance indicators of T-15, TFTR (US), JT-60 (Japan), 
JET (Euratom), and ITER (joint development by Euratom 
member-countries together with the United States, Russia, and 
Japan) are compared. The specific requirements imposed upon the 
reactor's electromagnetic system--the most complicated and 
expensive component reaching more than 20% of the entire 
structure's price tag--and the three key problems which must be 
solved in developing the electromagnetic system, i.e., 
developing a superconducting cable, electric insulation, and 
structural cryogenic materials, are discussed in detail. The 
three principal stages of the research program aimed at solving 
these problems--examining short samples and determining the 
current carrying ability in magnetic fields of up to 12 T or 
more, developing production practices for making 500 m long 
conductors and examining model coils made from this conductor, 
and examining model toroidal and poloidal field coils under the 
conditions which simulate actual windings operation--are 
presented. A schematic diagram of the ITER fusion reactor and 
conductor and test bench design drawings are cited. Two winding 
and conductor fabrication methods developed by the Inorganic 
Materials Institute imeni A.A. Bochvar are summarized, and the 
outcome of the early R&amp;D efforts is analyzed. Two brands of 
steel have been selected for the electromagnetic system: 
03Kh20N16AG6 and 03Kh13N9G19AM2. The conclusion is drawn that 
the findings obtained thus far attest to the possibility of 
developing an electromagnetic system for an ITER reactor with a 
22 MA plasma current and a fusion power on the order of 1 GW. 
Large-scale research at the second and third stage must address 
the scientific and engineering issues related to developing 
these unique structures. Figures 4; tables 4; references 2: 1

  [Abstract] The most detailed and exact information 
regarding the distribution and concentration of stresses in 
machine rotors is obtained by using three-dimensional ``frozen'' 
models. A model is made of optically active epoxy materials 
heated in a thermostatted chamber until they become highly 
elastic and then set into rotation. During the rotation process, 
the model cools slowly to room temperature. After the model has 
cooled, the deformations and optical anisotropy induced in it by 
centrifugal forces are fixed (in other words ``frozen''). The 
model is cut into thin plates (sections) that are in turn 
illuminated with polarized light in a polariscope. The stresses 
and strains in the sections are then determined on the basis of 
the patterns of the interference bands. The stresses and strains 
measured in the model are then recalculated for a full-scale 
structure based on dimensionality and similarity methods. The 
use of three-dimensional models has several advantages: They are 
easily machined and glued, and they make it possible to measure 
stresses in internal areas of rotors that cannot be measured by 
stress gauges or brittle coatings. In cases of stresses induced 
by a combination of centrifugal forces and the pressure of 
liquid on the rotor's wall, the model is filled with glycerin or 
silicon, and the calculations are based on two sets of 
measurements -- one when the model is filled with liquid and one 
when the model is empty. A series of formulas for measuring the 
stresses and strains on and in rotors is presented, and use of 
the proposed method and formulas is illustrated by way of the 
example of a model of the impeller of a high-speed pump. Figures 
5; references 5: Russian.

  [Abstract] Two global decreases in the total transparency 
of the atmosphere have been observed in long-term measurements 
of the total fluxes of direct solar radiation in the Arctic and 
Antarctic. These were associated with the eruptions of Agung in 
March 1963 and El Chichon in April 1982. Direct measurements of 
the spectral aerosol optical depth of the atmosphere at both 
poles showed that a new decrease in total transparency since 
1982-3 is associated with an increase in aerosol attenuation. 
Measurements of optical d epth using the ABAS solar photometer 
were used to pinpoint the effect of the eruptions of Mt. 
Pinatubo (Philippines) and Mt. Hudson (Chile). It was found that 
the aerosol optical depth of the atmosphere in 1992 was a factor 
of 2-3 larger than the average value and was comparable with the 
value observed in the Arctic after the El Chichon eruption. 
Tables present atmospheric transparency values and aerosol 
optical depth figures for this time period (and other periods, 
for comparison). Figures 2; tables 2; references 4: 3 Russian, 1

  [Abstract] One of the authors' previous articles proposed 
the possible role of HC compounds in the destruction of the 
ozone layer due to photodissociation of HC with the formation of 
NO radicals. This article addresses the contribution of HC to 
the formation of atmospheric NO. Atmospheric HC content is 
seasonably variable (highest concentrations occur in summer) and 
depends on the degree of industrialization of a region. HC is 
photochemically formed at the surface of bodies of water, and is 
dissociated by solar radiation, forming NO radicals. It is 
important to determine the rate of photolysis of HC. A slight 
dependence of this rate on altitude was found. Data is presented 
of ground-level measurements of HC over the course of the day. 
It is found that the contribution of HC to the formation of 
atmospheric NO is probably small compared to known sources of 
NO. However, on individual days when HC content reaches extreme 
levels, HC photolysis may lead to the formation of a significant 
amount of NO radicals. Consideration of the formation of NO from 
HC may be important in solving local problems, in particular, in 
the study of air pollution near reservoirs or industrial areas, 
key sources of HC. The combustion of organic fuel may be an 
important source of atmospheric HC. Tables 2; references 6: 4

  [Abstract] When one uses the path of a signal to determine 
the distance between a source and receiver, the classic 
requirement of object visibility is eliminated. The prime source 
of information becomes the radiation scattered by the medium 
between the source and receiver. This article examines one 
possible method of determining the distance to a pulse source 
using the time dependence of the degree of polarization of 
recorded scattered radiation. If the distance is known, this 
method may be used to obtain information on the microphysical 
properties of the scattering medium. It is found that the time 
required to reach the maximum degree of polarization is directly 
proportional to the distance between the source and receiver. If 
one knows the scattering angle and the sighting angle one can 
determine the distance by measuring the maximum polarization 
time. The factor of pulse length is considered. An alternate 
method is presented which involves measurements taken at two 
unequal sighting angles. Figures 3; references 3 (Russian).

  [Abstract] In 1991, intergeneric hybrids of hexaploid (2n = 
42) triticale and diploid (2n = 14) barley were bred through a 
culture of immature inflorescences from two constant lines of 
triticale, i.e., (6TA 502 x Rosner) x AD 206 and TPG 2333, and 
the experimental winter barley line Bemir 2. Further research 
has been conducted to determine the optimum age of the 
inflorescence and to identify the respective conditions 
resulting in more effective callus formation and regeneration 
during in vitro culture of the study hybrids. Inflorescences of 
various age (from the setting of the spikelet tubercle to 
meiosis) and lengths (from 0.8 to 80 mm) were sterilized, 
divided into small segments measuring 1-2 mm each, and placed in 
agar-treated Murashige-Skoog medium supplemented with 2,4-D (2.5 
mg/l). The inflorescences were cultured at 28C. Every 2-3 
weeks, they were subcultured in modified media with a graduated 
decrease in the concentration of 2,4-D or replacement of 2,4-D 
in the medium by 6-BAP (0.5 mg/l), _a_-NUC (0.2 mg/l), and 
casein hydrolysate (1 g/l). To regenerate plants, the callus 
tissue was placed in a lit climate chamber with a temperature of 
26C and relative humidity of 70 percent. Callus incubation 
was observed 4-8 days after explantation and was most active, 
i.e., nearly 100 percent effective, in those inflorescences that 
were 20-40 mm long and in the pre-meiosis stage of development. 
Different types of callus were observed to form depending on the 
development of the explant in the starting medium. Embryoid-like 
structures grew most often in the hormone-free medium. Depending 
on the stage of the inflorescence's development, the number of 
plants regenerated per explant ranged from 1.4 to 64.6. Several 
of the calluses in the experiments remained capable of 
morphogenesis for 10 months. The appearance of embryoid-like 
structures from callus tissue formed by immature inflorescences 
and their development into plants were taken as confirmation of 
the possibility of breeding the said intergeneric hybrids by 
somatic embryogenesis. Table 1; references 11: 3 Russian, 8 
Western.

  [Abstract] Zvezda [Star] is the first winter wheat of its 
type obtained at the Timiryazev Agriculture Academy by distant 
hybridization using graduated crosses F[.sub]1[/] 
[Triticum durum (Kharkov 46) x Agropyron 
glaucum] x T. aestivum F[.sub]1[/] 
(Mironovskaya 808 x Lyutestsens 329). Since 1992, it has been 
regionalized in the Moscow Oblast. It is of the variety 
lutescens. Its spike is cylindrical and of average length and 
compactness. Its glume is oval with weakly pronounced venation. 
Its teeth are short and straight, and its grain is oval with a 
medium stria. The variety has not yet been studied genetically. 
According to unpublished data, it is a hexaploid form. Zvezda is 
distinguished by its potentially high productivity. Experiments 
performed by researchers at the Timiryazev Agriculture Academy 
and state tests have established Zvezda yields of 8.5-8.7 metric 
tons/hectare in the Kiev Oblast and Lithuania. In comparative 
tests conducted in 1987-1991 in the Moscow Oblast, Zvezda yields 
averaged 5.04 metric tons/hectare over the 5-year period as 
opposed to an average yield of 4.43 metric tons/hectare for the 
standard Zarya wheat. In commercial tests conducted in 1990, 
Zvezda again outperformed Zarya (6.16 versus 2.36 metric 
tons/hectare). Zvezda's main advantage over standard varieties 
is its high (albeit not 100 percent) resistance to damping-off. 
Zvezda is also distinguished from standard wheat varieties from 
the standpoint of its growth and development rate, which is very 
close to that of wheat grass. Under favorable conditions, the 
central part of its spike has up to 6-8 caryopses in each 
spikelet, which is 35-40 percent higher than in Zarya and 
Mironovskaya 808. Given this grain content in each spike, 1,000 
grains naturally weigh less than in standard varieties and 
amount to 35-37 g. According to data from the All-Russian State 
Commission on Agricultural Crop Variety Testing, Zvezda's frost 
resistance may be characterized as average. Field observations 
in the extreme winters of 1984-85 and 1986-87 indicate that it 
possesses higher-than-average frost resistance, however. These 
contradictory frost resistance data are due, above all, to the 
biological peculiarities of the variety. Tests have shown Zvezda 
to be particularly susceptible to diseases when given high doses 
of nitrogen fertilizers, especially late in the season. 
Herbicides and retardants also appear to reduce Zvezda's 
immunity significantly. Its grain possesses good bread-baking 
properties. Its gluten quality and a number of other indicators 
make it perhaps superior to even Mironovskaya 808. Table 1.

633.111.1''321'':631.526.32] 
  [Abstract] The variety Saratovskaya 58 was developed at the 
Scientific Research Institute Agriculture of the Southeast by 
graduated hybridization. The starting plant was selected from 
the population of the last cross of Saratovskaya 46 x 
Saratovskaya 39. It has been regionalized in regions I and III 
of the Saratov Oblast since 1991 and in the oblast's II region 
since 1992. It is of the variety lutescens. The spike is 
cylindrical and of average compactness. Its glume is of average 
size, and the tooth of its glume is short. The grain is red, 
oval, and glassy. A total of 1,000 grains weighs 35.9 g. 
Saratovskaya 58 is a medium-maturing variety, with a growth 
period averaging 84 days and with a period of 45 days from the 
appearance of shoots to the heading stage, which is practically 
on a par with the standard Saratovskaya 46. Saratovskaya 58 is 
more drought resistant than the latter and thus provides a more 
stable yield from year to year under the conditions of the right 
bank of the central lands along the Volga. The upper leaves of 
Saratovskaya 58 have a higher water retention capability than 
Saratovskaya 46. When compared with varieties previously 
regionalized in the said region, Saratovskaya 58 has a higher 
multiyear yield: In tests conducted over a 3-year period at 
government variety-testing sections in the Saratov Oblast, 
Saratovskaya 58 averaged 2.1 metric tons per hectare versus 1.8 
metric tons per hectare for the standard. In commercial tests 
conducted in 1989 at the Kolkhoz imeni N.G. Chernyshevskiy in 
the Novoburasskiy Rayon of the Saratov Oblast, the yield of 
Saratovskaya 58 was 16 percent higher than that of Saratovskaya 
46. Saratovskaya 58 is virtually completely resistant to smut 
and is resistant to sprouting of the grain (in comparative 
tests, only 0.2 percent of Saratovskaya 58 grains sprouted 
versus 30.5 percent of Saratovskaya 46 grains). From a grain 
quality standpoint, Saratovskaya 58 is a hard wheat, and from 
the standpoints of gluten and protein content, it is somewhat 
superior to the best hard wheat (Saratovskaya 29). Saratovskaya 
58 has a higher gluten content than the standard Saratovskaya 46 
and is in quality group 1. Like all hard wheat varieties, 
Saratovskaya 58 must be raised in rather fertile soil that is 
free of weeds, and it must be sown as early as possible in 
moist, well-prepared soil at a rate of 120-150 kilograms of seed 
per hectare. Table 1.

agricultural sciences, Kustanay Scientific Production 
Association; UDC 633.111.1''321'':631.526.32] 
  [Abstract] The spring wheat variety Karabalykskaya 85 was 
developed at the Karabalyk Agricultural Test Station at the 
Kustanay Agricultural Scientific Research Institute by the 
method of individual seed selection from the hybrid population 
Cesium 51 x Saratovskaya 39. It has been regionalized in the 
Chelyabinsk Oblast since 1991. Karabalykskaya 85 is of the 
variety lutescens. Its glume is shaped like an elongated egg 
with pronounced venation, and its tooth is short, straight, and 
blunt. Its grain is oval, glassy, and of a semiglassy 
consistency, and 1,000 grains weigh 32-36 g. It is a 
medium-maturing variety that ripens at the same time as 
Saratovskaya 39. It has average resistance to damping-off and 
has a rather high potential productivity that averages 3.46 
metric tons/hectare, which is 0.31 metric tons/hectare higher 
than the standard. The results of commercial tests of 
Karabalykskaya 85 at various sovkhozes were fairly good: At the 
Petropavlovsk sovkhoz in the Upper Ural Rayon of the Saratov 
Oblast, its grain yield was twice that of Saratovskaya 29. Its 
brown rust resistance is close to that of the standard, its 
susceptibility to root rot is somewhat lower than that of other 
regionalized varieties, and it is resistant to smut. The 
processing qualities of the grain of Karabalykskaya 85 are high 
and meet the requirements set for hard wheat grain. 
Karabalykskaya 85 should be sowed at the optimum time for given 
soil/climate zones at a rate of 4.0-5.0 million seeds/hectare. 
The soft spring wheat variety Erythrospermum 35 was developed by 
a team at the Karabalyk Agricultural Test station at the 
Kustanay Agricultural Scientific Research Center and Kazakh 
Grain Farming Scientific Research Institute by the method of 
individual selection from the hybrid population Erythrospermum 
29/70-19 x Lutescens 26/67-211. It has been regionalized in the 
Kustanay, Kokchetav, Karaganda, and Dzhezkazgan oblasts since 
1991. It is of the variety erythrospermum. Its spike is of 
average length and compactness, and its glume is shaped like an 
elongated oval with marked venation. The tooth of the glume is 
of average length, straight, and sharp. The grain is red, 
semielongated, and over average size (1,000 grains weigh 34-40 
g). Erythrospermum 35 is a medium-maturing variety that matures 
6-8 days later than the standard Saratovskaya 29. It has average 
resistance to damping-off. In comparative variety tests, 
Erythrospermum 35 outyielded the standard by 0.65 metric 
tons/hectare at an average level of 3.3 metric tons/hectare (the 
maximum yield of 5.4 metric tons/hectare was achieved in 1985). 
It also demonstrated good results in commercial tests (a yield 
of 0.67 metric tons/hectare, which was twice as high as the 
yield of Saratovskaya 29). Erythrospermum 35 is highly resistant 
to damping-off both under natural conditions and against the 
background of an artificial infection. During the years of the 
study, its rate of susceptibility to this disease did not exceed 
6-8 percent, while the susceptibility of Saratovskaya 29 was 
between 34 and 63 percent. Erythrospermum 35 is about as 
susceptible to rust as Saratovskaya 29, but its grain is more 
resistant to sprouting than the standard varieties, and it is 
less susceptible to root rot than other regionalized varieties. 
It should be sowed late (after 25 May) at a rate of 4-5 million 
seeds/hectare.

<F P=106> [Interview with Olga Frolova, professor and department head, </F>
Sociomedical and Epidemiological Research Department, 
Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Perinatology Scientific Center, 
Academy of Medical Sciences, by ROSSIYA correspondent Genadiy 
Shalayev under the ``Firsthand'' rubric: ``Caucasus Gives Birth; 
Good for All of Russia''; first paragraph is boldface ROSSIYA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Professor Olga Grigoryevna Frolova, head of 
the Sociomedical and Epidemiological Research Department, 
Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Perinatology Scientific Center, 
Academy of Medical Sciences, responded to the questions of our 
ROSSIYA correspondent. 
  [Shalayev] Olga Grigoryevna, it seems like Russian women 
have 
stopped giving birth. Young mothers with baby carriages have 
become a rarity, especially in the cities. What does this say 
about science? 
  [Frolov] There has been a landslide drop in the birth rate. 
Population growth is falling sharply. In 1989, 18.2 children 
were born for every thousand persons. In 1990 the figure dropped 
to 14.6 children, and in 1991 it dropped to only 12. A small 
increase in population throughout Russia as a whole is being 
achieved thanks to the Northern Caucasus region, the Eastern 
Siberia region, and to a lesser extent the Far Eastern region. 
The absolute indicators are decreasing, however. 
  Let's open the handbook of the Russian Federation State 
Committee on Statistics. In the northwestern region, for 
example, the number of deaths has exceeded the number of births 
by 13,000, and in the central region, deaths have exceeded 
births by 60,000. In a year in Moscow, 94,000 have been born and 
114,200 have died. That is too rapid a population loss. 
  [Shalayev] And how is the pattern emerging with respect to 
age groups? 
  [Frolov] There has been a decrease in birth rate throughout 
all age groups, even in the periods from 20 to 24 and from 25 to 
29 years. And that is the time of greatest reproductive 
activity. As far as those who are not yet 20 are concerned, they 
worry us greatly because they are a group that is very 
vulnerable from a social standpoint. In addition, their sexual 
activity, coupled with disregard of modern contraceptive methods 
and just simple ignorance of them, has led to an increase in the 
number of abortions and unplanned births that have resulted in a 
multitude of problems. 
  And there is yet another suppressing force -- the ratio of 
the number of marriages and divorces. In Russia as a whole in 
1991 divorces were registered in more than 40 percent of 
families. In Moscow the situation is even worse: More than half 
of all families divorce. 
  [Shalayev] Have you not tried to explain what is inhibiting 
maternal instinct and interfering with the idea of having 
children in a family? 
  [Frolov] We have tried. We conducted a suitable survey of 
Moscow women. It turned out that one in five women gives birth 
only because she is at the critical age of 30 years and cannot 
wait any longer. As far as social problems are concerned, 56 
percent of Moscow residents polled are not having families out 
of material considerations: 60 percent because of a shortage of 
products and 80 percent because of difficulties in feeding and 
caring for their children. That was a year ago. This year we are 
preparing to repeat the study. Perhaps Russians have somehow 
recovered from the socioeconomic shock. Although we are not 
entertaining any particular illusions. 
  [Shalayev] And well, what about those who are giving birth? 
Is everything all right for them? 
  [Frolov] Here are the results of yet another study recently 
conducted in accordance with the modern method of evaluating the 
health status of pregnant women. Only one in four turned out to 
be healthy. This naturally affects the health of children. Only 
28 percent of infants discharged from the obstetric hospital are 
healthy; 41 percent have some sort of abnormality, and 31 
percent are at increased risk from a health standpoint. Of the 
latter group, only 29 percent remain healthy for their first 
year of life. Add the well-known quality of our medicine to 
this... 
  [Shalayev] What do the statistics say about maternal 
mortality during childbirth? 
  [Frolov] It is unfortunately increasing. According to the 
State Committee on Statistics, there were 47.4 deaths per 
100,000 childbirths in 1990 and already 52.4 by 1991. In our 
country maternal mortality is now ``miscalculated'' according to 
World Health Organization indicators. They count all women who 
have died from medical and illegal abortions and from premature 
and timely births and within 42 days of giving birth. In the 
United States, for example, this indicator amounts to 7.2. In 
Finland it is 6.6, in France it is 10.9, and in Japan it is 12. 
Sweden has the lowest maternal mortality at 2.9. In Russia there 
has also been an increase in infant mortality, when children 
under 1 year of age die. 
  [Shalayev] What can be done? 
  [Frolov] In Russia a special family planning program has 
been 
developed, and budget funds have already been allocated for it. 
A federal program to reduce maternal mortality is also being 
prepared. But it can only provide general arrangements. We have 
taken the maternal mortality statistic in its dynamics and asked 
a computer what the indicator is like in individual territories. 
It turned out that a minimum of six regional programs are 
needed. A number of territories, such as the Kemerovo Oblast and 
Tuva Republic, have a high maternal mortality that has remained 
stable. In other regions it is high or average but is 
moderating. There trend has been toward a decrease in Tumen, the 
Irkutsk Oblast, and Moscow. There are regions with a low 
indicator, let's say the Krasnoyarsk Kray, Karelia, and 
Mordovia. In a word, a differential approach is needed: In one 
place, the fight against toxicosis must be intensified; in 
another, special attention must be paid to family planning.

<F P=106> [Article by Galina Toktaliyeva under the ``Our Sins'' </F>
rubric: ``And the Madonna Walked After the Israelite: In Russia 
today the number of abortions is twice that of childbirths''] 
  [Text] Abortion was never a sovereign problem of the 
inherited estate of obstetrics and gynecology. Reflected in it, 
as in a microcosm, is the trouble of the nation, providing a 
foundation for the contradictions regarding the coming 
demographic Apocalypse. The question of artificial termination 
of pregnancy has always been a question of belief. Christian 
teaching, like Islam, considers this sin one of the gravest. 
  According to data from the Social Demography Center of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences, the country's population will 
decrease to 147 million by the end of the millennium: the death 
rate will surpass the birth rate by an average of 1 million 
persons each year. 
  ``Abortion has been the main problem ravaging our land for 
more than 70 years,'' states Professor I. Guzov, leader of the 
Russian Right to Life Movement. ``It was thrust upon us by the 
Russian Bolsheviks, and only after rejecting it can the country 
be reborn.'' 
  In fact, the mass nature of artificial terminations has had 
a 
noticeable effect on the demographic situation. But other 
factors are destabilizing it as well. Let us say, from the 
standpoint of the child mortality level, we are far 
outdistancing the developed countries of the West, and even by 
the most cautious estimates, this indicator is 4 to 6 times 
higher than the ``civilized'' indicator. In recent years, thanks 
to paid medicine, the situation has been complicated by 
physicians' mercenary thinking. 
  The movement against abortion arose in Russia with the 
active 
support of Western religious organizations, particularly the 
Dutch organization Rainbow. In its actions, Right to Life will 
not go as far as what I. Guzov considers to be the ``extremists 
of the Western organization,'' who picket gynecological clinics 
and chain themselves to abortion tables. ``Our main task is to 
inform Russian women of the truth about abortions,'' he 
continues. 
  At the same time, there are organizations such as the 
philanthropic fund Good Hope, which in addition to performing 
educational work, tries to provide specific referral assistance 
to women who have decided to give birth despite their grave 
material and family conditions. Religious communities from 
abroad send them, let's say, sewing machines and material so as 
to help the future parents or single mothers earn a slice of 
bread for themselves. 
  L. Lyubarskaya, chairperson of Good Hope, told of how, 
having 
five children, she took ill. The physicians could not cure her, 
and her husband drove her to a monastery. An old monk who had 
taken vows of schema asked, ``How many children do you have 
little mother?'' ``Five.'' ``And how many years have you been 
married?'' ``Sixteen.'' ``That is the reason why you are ill. 
You have too few children.'' The women soon gave birth and 
recovered. Now she has eight children.... 
  But can the church help every child-loving pregnant woman 
who 
has been left without the resources to exist? As is well known, 
the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. ``The church is 
poor, and philanthropic aid to the fund from abroad is simply 
miserable,'' says L. Lyubarskaya. ``But we are trying as hard as 
we can to make mothers' lives easier.''

<F P=106> [Article by Gennadiy Aleksandrov under the ``Money Can't Buy </F>
Everything'' rubric: ``The Magnificent Six''] 
  [Text] ``Treated at no charge -- treated to no purpose.'' 
This homespun sentence, popular in the recent socialist past, 
was evidently first spoken by some humorist after vain attempts 
to restore his health at a public hospital. And it was 
immediately seized by the broad masses of patients and 
physicians: Both knew that you can only hope for qualified and 
quality medical care after you transfer some amount of good 
cognac from a slack wine store to the physician's office. 
  Now other times have come upon us, and one of the main 
achievements of socialism, free medicine, is gradually lowing 
its position in favor of medical care requiring payment. 
  Well, many of our fellow country women know what it means to 
give birth for free in a conventional Soviet -- I beg your 
pardon -- Russian maternity hospital. But if it were for money? 
Would it really be more pleasant? 
  An employee of the Medilyuks, a medical cooperative that I 
randomly selected from a directory and that is affiliated with 
the Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Perinatology Scientific Center, 
who wishes to remain anonymous shared the following information. 
  The Medilyuks rents a building at the center. The 
cooperative 
has single- and double-occupancy rooms. There is one nurse and 
two physicians for every four women. There is one pediatric 
nurse and physician for every four infants. Each infant 
compartment contains one newborn. 
  And in the center's free-care department, women lie 
literally 
up against the wall in six- to eight-bed rooms, each infant 
compartment holds six infants, and there is one physician and 
two nurses for 40 women giving birth and one physician and one 
nurse for 40 infants. 
  Among the other advantages of births for payment, the 
Medilyuks workers list single-use instruments. But the bed 
linens are laundered in the common laundry center. In the 
cooperative there are individual meals at a a cost of about 
1,000 rubles a day (of that amount, 200 rubles goes for the 
cook's salary), and food is bought to the room. 
  But the main thing is that here births occur in a separate 
room in the presence of a physician, midwife, hospital 
attendant, and anesthesiologist. The medical personnel, as my 
anonymous informant emphasized, have had at least 12 years of 
work experience. The physicians are all candidates and doctors 
of medicine from the very same Scientific Center. They ``treat'' 
in their off time. 
  And now about prices. First visits, depending on the 
physician's academic degree, cost a mother-to-be about 3,000 to 
3,500 rubles. Repeat visits are less expensive -- only 
2,000-2,500. Service for the course of a week in cases of 
physiological (that is, normal) births costs 150,000 rubles. In 
cases of pathological births and cesarean section, the cost is 
50 percent higher. But a mother giving birth will remain in the 
hospital for 10-11 days. 
  ``Is this really expensive?'' the cooperative employee asked 
me. If you consider the mad course of the dollar, of course it 
isn't. Normal births cost on the order of 150 ``greenbacks.'' 
But if you take the average Russia salary, not exactly every 
woman will be lining up at the Medilyuks. But in actuality there 
is a line. The cooperative can only service six women giving 
birth at a time -- that is the number of beds. 
  Not every woman can end up as part of the ``magnificent 
six'': Only women who have reached their 37th week of pregnancy 
and who have no type of infection can enter the Medilyuks. And 
if you are a woman who has some pathology and there is no 
guarantee of a live birth, you cannot give birth in the 
cooperative for any amount of money. In the normal way and in 
the public hospital, please. 
  It seems that the receiving physicians do not want to risk 
the name of their precious enterprise. And indeed, I repeat that 
they are the same people who deliver babies during the day free 
of charge as employees of the government medical institution. 
Two or three shifts in the cooperative can cover their monthly 
government salary. 
  According to this scheme, free medicine is doomed to 
obscurity. But medical care requiring payment does not offer any 
guarantees. Everything will still be ``as with them.'' Really, 
people turn to medical offices requiring payment in the hope of 
receiving the full attention and qualified assistance of a 
physician -- something they are deprived of in government 
polyclinics and hospitals. They go there, and they meet the very 
same specialists. This is all strange....But it is nevertheless 
necessary to give birth. ``Think for yourself, decide for 
yourself'' when and how.

  [Abstract] The issue of the real danger posed by chemical 
compounds used in agriculture, especially in areas whose 
agricultural production structure determines their high 
territorial pesticide burden per unit of arable land, is 
addressed against the backdrop of the use of chemicals on an 
increasing scale, and an attempt is made to examine the 
dependence of the child health indices on the territorial 
pesticide burden, investigate the likely mechanisms of its 
pathogenic action, and develop preventive measures. To this end, 
the state of child health in three rural settlements with very 
different pesticide usage rates (1:6:13 or 3.74, 22.1, and 49.0 
kg/ha for the active ingredient) is assessed, and the child 
health status is evaluated by a complex of basic indicators. 
Morbidity data are obtained by examining diagnoses for the past 
three years for 5,363 children, including perinatal infant 
pathology. The child complex physical development indices from 
base villages, the child health group distribution in villages 
with equal agricultural chemicalization rates, and the metabolic 
status of lipid child health systems in base villages 
(M+/-m) are summarized. The outcome of cytochemical 
studies of the peripheral blood leukocytes' enzymatic activity 
attests to unfavorable structural and functional shifts under 
the effect of various pesticide burden levels. Parallel studies 
of the metabolic status of the lipid systems and lipid 
peroxidation attest to profound changes at earlier immune 
response stages under the effect of pesticide burdens. The 
findings confirm that in the areas of high chemical usage, the 
physical development of children lags while the incidence of 
development disharmony and retardation is high. The percentage 
of healthy children in these zones is lower and the number of 
children with chronic diseases is higher. An increase in the 
chemical use is directly related to the total morbidity and 
perinatal pathology as well as latent impairments in the 
protective and adaptation functions of the organism. Tables 3;

Mamatsashvili, R.Ye. Khazaradze, G.G. Chinchaladze, Public 
Health and Hygiene Institute imeni G.M. Natadze at the Social 
Security Ministry of Georgia, Tbilisi; UDC 614.7(479.22)] 
  [Abstract] The issue of public health is considered against 
the background of environmental pollution and environmental 
protection, and the increasing role of medical and biological 
research for preventing unfavorable consequence of industrial 
pollution is stressed. It is noted that the level of industrial 
discharges doubles every 8-10 years while 18-20% of all 
public 
health expenditures are related to diseases caused by 
contaminated atmospheric air alone. Due to the concern about the 
long-term effect of toxic agent inhalation, the environmental 
factors are examined in a number of Georgian towns and cities, 
e.g., Tbilisi, Batumi, Zestafoni, Rustavi, Sagaredzho, etc. The 
study shows that contamination in four out of five cities is 
extreme due to inefficient discharge treatment, poor vehicle 
emission control, inadequate tree planting, and unsatisfactory 
street cleaning. Shortcomings in waste water treatment in the 
above cities and the resulting contamination of the Black Sea 
are noted. A study of population morbidity confirms the 
unfavorable effect of atmospheric contamination on the public 
health status and makes it possible to establish a statistically 
reliable correlation between the total atmospheric air 
contamination index P and population health levels in the 
administrative territories under study of r=0.69. The 
findings determine the principal emphasis and character of 
efforts aimed at improving public health and reducing the demand 
for medical assistance; these measures basically amount to 
consistent implementation of deliberate measures aimed it 
improving the air quality.

  [Abstract] The combined effect of ethanol and pesticides, 
particularly ethanol's ability to aggravate the toxic effect of 
pesticide, is discussed, and the combined effect of 
0,0-dimethyl-0-(2-2-dichlorovinyl) phosphate (DDVP) and ethanol 
is investigated. To this end, an experiment is carried out on 84 
male rats with a mean weight of 220-240 g separated into six 
groups (with one control group) with different exposures to one 
or both agents. The condition of the test animals was 
ascertained by examining a complex of physiological and 
biochemical indicators and pathomorphological research. The 
status indicators of white rats after oral administration of 
DDVP and ethanol is summarized; the study indicates that the 
effect of ethanol upsets the behavioral reactions of the animals 
who displayed a tendency toward a decreased spontaneous motor 
activity (SDA) and a considerable increase in the latent period 
of cognitive reflex (LPPR); the summation threshold index (SPP) 
increased only in rats who received ethanol alone. A study of 
the mixed function oxidase (OSF) shows that it is induced 
somewhat in animals exposed to ethanol or the ethanol-and-DDVP 
mixture. The conclusion is drawn that the extent to which the 
two substances and their combinations affect the test animals 
increases in the following sequence: ethanol, DDVP, 
DDVP+ethanol, and ethanol and DDVP+ethanol against the 
background of alcoholization. Thus, given contact with an 
organophosphorous pesticide, ethanol may have an unfavorable 
aggravating effect, especially if taken regularly. Tables 1;

  [Abstract] The wide-ranging use of toxic chemical 
substances and materials leading to an increasingly frequent 
development of the so-called ecotoxicological situations (ETS) 
due to the discharge of dangerous chemical substances into the 
environment (OS) is discussed, and the impracticability and 
inexpediency of analyzing all of most of the close to 50 
thousand organic and hetero-organic compounds is noted. This 
necessitates selection of priority pollutants which must be 
analyzed in critical ecotoxicological situations (KETS) when the 
contamination sources are unknown and there are no data on the 
chemical compounds which led to the critical ecotoxicological 
situation. The principal criteria which determine the chemical 
substance priority (or ranking) depend on the medium for which 
its danger is being assessed. The danger classes of organic 
compounds and danger classes of organic compounds based on their 
persistence and sorption ability in the soil are summarized; 
altogether, five classes are identified on the basis of lethal 
doses (LD[.sub]50[/]) and lethal concentrations 
(CL[.sub]50[/]) as well as maximum permissible concentrations 
(PDK) established by the Public Health Ministry. The study made 
it possible to identify the principal list containing 82 
substances and eight compound classes and a supplementary list 
of 47 compounds which are to be analyzed in the soil during 
critical ecotoxicological situations. Tables 2; references 16:

  [Abstract] The radiocarbon method for dating archeological 
specimens of biological origin is based on measurement of the 
carbon-14 activity under the assumption that this nuclide 
stopped entering the organism during the time of its demise. 
Many other assumptions are also made. In the present work the 
possibility of a change in isotope composition in cotton and 
flax fabrics as a result of heterogeneous isotope exchange 
between the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere and that in the 
fabric. Labeled carbon dioxide is shown to be fixated strongly 
in the fabrics. It was concluded that changes in carbon isotope 
composition in archeological specimens are possible and that 
this factor must not be overlooked. References 2: 1 Russian, 1

  [Abstract] A nontraditional dataflow computer architecture 
whereby the sequence of tasks in the dataflow-controlled 
computer (EVM UPD) is determined only by the readiness of the 
relevant data and if resources permit, jobs are executed 
concurrently and independently, is discussed, and an earlier 
study is expanded. An evaluation of the dataflow computer 
performance with changes in the multisequencing factor 
K in the neighborhood of unity calls for developing a 
probabilistic model with a random processor loading, i.e., given 
commensurate data processing durations in the storage blocks and 
processors. The dependence of the dataflow computer performance 
on the types of jobs being executed is considered and compared 
to the performance of a von Neumann series computer. An 
efficient recurrent procedure is developed for determining the 
steady-state dataflow computer model probabilities, making it 
possible to assess the computer performance as a function of the 
number of processors, storage blocks, their speed of response, 
work load parameters, throughput, and communication networks. An 
efficiency analysis demonstrates that as the number of 
processors increases to ten or higher, the dataflow computer 
performance is better than that of computer systems with 
traditional architecture. The specific boundary depends on the 
algorithmic and architectural parameters of the system under 
study. Figures 14; references 8: 5 Russian, 3 Western.

  [Abstract] Discrete mathematical models of hologram 
descriptions are examined. They are based on phase dependencies 
of the Frenel integrated transform and use raster 
representations of holograms and objects in the form of 
unidimensional hologram projections of acoustic sections of 
objects. Raster representations allow two dimensional quasi 
holograms to be processed in a computer by using special 
unidimensional high-speed procedures, as well as coordinated 
filtration methods. Ways to form hologram descriptions in the 
Frenel zone are examined, which is fundamental for modelling 
acoustic holography problems. Figure 1; references 7.

  [Abstract] The upper boundary of the average probability of 
error is obtained with discrete-weight addition of an arbitrary 
number of diverse signals, received in statistically non-uniform 
channels with Nikagami fading. It is demonstrated that in the 
presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-correlated 
diversity reception channels, and also when there is energy 
asymmetry, the discrete-weight addition is an effective method 
of signal processing, including a situation when majority 
addition is inefficient. This feature can be used as a criterion 
for selecting the engineering solutions when designing the 
addition devices. Figure 1; references 7: Russian

  [Abstract] A system for autocorrelation processing of 
random pulsed signals is examined, and its fundamental 
probability characteristic is obtained. It is demonstrated that 
if some limited a priory information on the structure of random 
pulsed input signals is available, the estimates of their 
initial periods can be obtained by applying autocorrelation 
processing, while a high level of noise rejection of mutual 
interferences is provided. A block diagram of the system 
containing n parallel connected processing channels is provided, 
and the probabilities of correct determination of the channel 
number, probabilities of the signal transmission, and of false 
alarm were analyzed. The following conclusions were formulated: 
for a specified ratio f[.sub]i+1[/]/f[.sub]i[/] there 
exists an optimal threshold value K, where the probability 
P[.sub]i[/] of correct determination of the channel number is 
maximum, and the probability P[.sub]false alarm[/] is 
minimum; with increased ratio f[.sub]i+1[/]/f[.sub]i[/], 
when K is specified, the probability P[.sub]false alarm[/] is 
reduced; the increased ratio f[.sub]i+1[/]/f[.sub]i[/] may 
lower the threshold K, and as a consequence, increase 
P[.sub]i[/] for a specified P[.sub]false alarm[/]. Figures

  [Abstract] Geometric optics is used to resolve 
electromagnetic wave scattering on an optically dense revolving 
body with a multilayered absorbing coating. The unknown 
scattering field is found by adding the rays re-reflected in the 
coating at the point of observation. A recurrent algorithm is 
developed for constructing a ray pattern of the field for a 
multilayered body, whose boundary is depicted by arbitrary 
smooth functions. In order to determine the accuracy of the 
solution, it is compared with the results of rigorous 
calculations and with experimental data for a sphere, round 
cylinder and oval body. Figures 5; references 10.

  [Abstract] The reflection of electromagnetic waves from an 
inhomogeneous semiconductor transfer layer with a perfectly 
conducting screen is examined. Using an analytical solution of 
the wave equation, an expression is obtained for the 
reflectivity of the electromagnetic waves, depending on the 
thickness of the layer, the width of the transition region, the 
concentration of electrons, the degree of absorption and the 
length of the irradiating wave. Figures 5; references 3.

  [Abstract] For simple shape radiators, the characteristics 
of antennas made of conductors with infinitely small radii _r_ 
can be analyzed by applying approximate analytical expressions. 
Algorithms were developed, and cylindrical spirals (CS) over an 
infinite perfectly conducting screen were numerically examined 
applying a random shape ultrafine wire radiator analysis method. 
A comparison was also made of this method with the ``Mei 
Integral Equations method''. The computation results obtained by 
the two methods agree with accuracy of 1 - 2%. In order to 
estimate the boundary limits of this method, the functional 
dependance of the radiator's characteristic as a function of the 
conductor's radii was also made and the numerical results were 
compared with the analytical. A cylindrical spiral (CS) was 
examined with a number of turns N=6 and the winding angle 
_l_=14. It was demonstrated that when _r_ was reduced 
from 
10[.sup]-2[/] _l_ to 10[.sup]-5[/]_l_, the input impedance 
Z[.sub]0[/] changed from (105-j33) Ohm to (511-j19) Ohm, and 
the directive gain from 11.5 to 2.5. Frequency relationships of 
the Z[.sub]0[/] and the directive gain for CS with 
_r_=10[.sup]- 5[/] _l_ are shown in a graph. Figures 3, 
references 9: 6 Russian, 3 Western.

  [Abstract] Revised experimental data on the magnitude of 
the refraction angle and refraction attenuation of radio waves 
in Venus's atmosphere are presented using the results of 
bistatic radar measurements of the planet. In order to describe 
the refraction effects, a theoretical model is developed. This 
model is used to determine parameters which are necessary to 
calculate radio communication lines in the troposphere using 
refractive index versus height. The experimental data are 
compared with the results of calculations made using a 
theoretical model. Ratios which link the length of the phase 
path and integral absorption of radio waves in the atmosphere 
with parameters of the theoretical model are obtained. These 
ratios may be used to calculate communication routes in Venus's 
atmosphere. Figures 4; references 16.

  [Abstract]A study of the characteristics of a relaxation 
SQUID magnetometer is performed. Two modifications are made to 
the base- line system of the SQUID by introducing an additional 
inductive coupling for the interferometer with power bus and a 
shunting circuit. The experimental results conformed to the 
theoretical analysis and showed the positive influence of these 
modifications in the form of an increased conversion 
coefficient, and a reduction in the effect of unstable power 
current and external interference. This reduces requirements 
established for the power circuits and for shielding the 
electronic components of the SQUID from external magnetic 
interference for magnetometers operating under high interference 
and on an unstable power line. The proposed correction for the 
control characteristic of the relaxation SQUID may be used to 
improve precision and accuracy characteristics of SQUID 
magnetometers. Figures 5; references 10.

  [Abstract] Methods for optimizing the energy parameters of 
nonlinear models of electronic power amplifiers with a 
nonresonant random load are discussed. These amplifiers are used 
to construct final stage broadband short-wave radio 
transmitters. The approach considered here may be used to 
calculate possible energy characteristics of various types of 
broadband power amplifiers with a prescribed load, for which the 
influence of harmonic components of the output signal spectrum 
must not be disregarded. Figures 2; references 5

  [Abstract]The study shows that a planar ZnSe/GaAs structure 
fulfills all the main requirements for semiconductor chemical 
sensors. Moreover, it is also possible to use this material as a 
gas detector. The fact that the stoichiometry is controllable 
when the layer structure is synthesized and the lack of defects 
in the crystal package reduce the effect of chemical activity of 
the working medium. In the broad range of partial hydrogen 
pressures, the ZnSe layer is characterized by a relative change 
in resistance of 5-50% with little sluggishness, fast 
recovery 
and a good reproducibility rate for the results. 2 figures, 5

  [Abstract]An analysis is performed to determine the reasons 
which lead to the difference in dose dependencies for the 
intensities of various luminescence bands in semiconductors. In 
other words, various luminescence bands have different 
(heightened or lowered) resistance to radiation exposure. It is 
shown that this difference might actually be due to more than 
the radiation stimulated change in the concentration of 
luminescence centers. Another factor may be the difference in 
the types of dependencies for the intensity of luminescence 
bands as a function of the intensity of luminescence excitation. 
The noted difference in dependencies must be taken into 
consideration when establishing radiation stimulated changes in 
the concentration of the luminescence centers from the dose 
dependencies of the intensity of the luminescence bands. 2 
figures and 16 references.

  [Abstract]A study is made of the processes which occur when 
GaAs layers are doped with a Zn acceptor impurity during liquid 
phase epitaxy from a Ga-Bi melted solution. The thickness of the 
GaAs : Zn or Bi epitaxial layers as a function of the melted 
solution composition is complex in nature. This is explained by 
the complicated form of the liquidus isotherm curves in the 
Ga-Bi- As system and the change in the mass transfer processes 
in the microinhomogenous liquid phase. The nature of the way 
atoms in the Zn mixture behave in epitaxial layers, in the 
substrates and in satellite substrates during the growth 
processes is researched by using photoluminescence methods with 
layer-by-layer stripping. An explanation is given for the 
nonlinear relationship of the concentration of Zn in GaAs layers 
versus the content of Bi in the Ga-Bi solvent. This explanation 
is associated with the change in the vacancy concentration in 
the gallium sublattice and the nature of the Zn diffusional 
transfer in the liquid phase. The constant doping level in the 
epitaxial GaAs layer with the given solvent composition shows 
that the basic doping mechanism is the capture of Zn impurity 
atoms from the liquid phase during the growth process.

  [Abstract]Numerical calculations are performed for the 
transient characteristics of vertical GaAs field-effect 
phototransistors with various levels of lighting and voltage 
values on the source and shutter, which creates a potential 
barrier for electrons. Photocurrent, potential energy 
distributions, and times to establish steady state and the gain 
in phototransistors with a concealed shutter for small light 
sources are calculated and the results presented. It is shown 
that for both a small barrier and a large barrier, the times for 
establishing steady photocurrent amount to several nanoseconds 
and depend on the voltage on the shutter. As voltage on the 
shutter is increased, speed increases. However, the photocurrent 
of the structure simultaneously decreases. A reduction in 
photocurrent at high voltages on the shutter causes a reduction 
in the properties of the structure. 5 figures, 1 chart and 21

  [Abstract] Simple mathematical models of microwaveguides 
are proposed. These microwaveguides are based on scalar 
isotropic approximation. A numerical algorithm for calculating 
the transfer characteristics of devices with a waveguide 
transmission line is developed. In order to reduce the influence 
of solid waves, a uniform directional coupler is proposed for 
use. The amplitude- frequency characteristics of a filter 
containing two aperture apodized interdigital transducers joined 
by a directional coupler are measured and the results given. The 
topology of the devices is also analyzed. It is shown that the 
mathematical model which is used for the waveguide is adequate 
for the results of the experimental research. Moreover, the 
technical characteristics of the devices exceed traditional 
analogs. Figures 5; references 7.

  [Abstract] The popularity of lifting, stabilizing, and 
control surfaces executed as grid wings and a scarcity of 
aerodynamic analyses of numerous wing shapes necessitated the 
development of an aerodynamic analysis method which would make 
it possible in the nonlinear problem formulation to determine 
the aerodynamic characteristics of the planforms, side frames, 
wings, and fin assemblies within a broad range of geometric 
parameters of grid wings and select optimum grid wing 
configurations from the aerodynamic characteristics viewpoint. 
An algorithm for determining the aerodynamic characteristics 
based on a vortical model is proposed, and an approximate method 
of analyzing the aerodynamic characteristics (ADKh) of frame 
grid wings and the frame fin assembly as a whole is developed. A 
comparison of analytical data to the experimental results makes 
it possible to speculate that the procedure proposed for 
analyzing the aerodynamic characteristics of frame grid fin 
assemblies, rectangular slip plates, and slender wings is 
adequate for practical applications and may be recommended for 
implementation in aircraft, ship, and vessel computer-aided 
design systems (SAPR). Figures 10; references 6: 5 Russian, 1 
Western.

  [Abstract] The principal problem arising in the study of 
subsonic radiative wave propagation under the effect of laser 
radiation, i.e., finding the mechanisms of its propagation, 
measuring its velocity, and establishing the wave structure, is 
addressed on the basis of numerous published sources. In 
particular, a steady-state model with nonequilibrium radiation, 
numerical calculations of the problem of plane subsonic 
radiative wave propagation, steady-state model of an ultraviolet 
laser-supported subsonic radiative wave, the dependence of the 
subsonic ultraviolet laser-supported radiative wave parameters 
on the radiation flux, two-dimensional subsonic radiative waves, 
the quasi-steady subsonic radiative wave propagation conditions, 
the effect of the irradiation spot radius, the effect of the 
radiation nonuniformity, and the effect of the thin 
reduced-density channel are considered in detail. The conclusion 
is drawn that such laser pulse parameters as the pulse duration, 
power, and wavelength and the properties of the gaseous medium 
surrounding the obstacle are the determining factors in the 
laser-supported radiative wave propagation. The analysis is 
based on the analogy between the propagation of optical 
discharges and combustion and detonation of flammable 
substances. Figures 7; tables 2; references 45: 44 Russian, 1

  [Abstract] The urgency of studying shock tubes for 
simulating hypersonic flows and examining aerophysical processes 
which accompany the movement of flying vehicles and meteorite 
bodies in the earth's and other planets' atmosphere, 
particularly large-scale shock tubes capable of obtaining 
extended quasistatic high-temperature gas flows whose duration 
is sufficient for taking various measurements on models of 
winged vehicles, prompted an investigation into hypersonic flows 
in such tubes with multiple diaphragms. In particular, the flow 
structure in such tubes at various operating conditions and 
regimes is examined; in so doing, the shape and structure of the 
shock wave front are determined, the quality and duration of 
working flows are evaluated, and the shock wave parameters are 
measured in order to use large-scale shock tubes in hypersonic 
aerodynamic and aerophysical research. In addition, the shock 
wave interaction with various models, e.g., spacecraft and 
aircraft, their components and modular configurations, 
terrestrial structure elements, etc., is also studied using the 
installation. The study made it possible to obtain data on the 
fundamental physical and chemical properties of air at high 
temperatures and pressures. The installation developed by the 
Central Scientific Research Institute of Mechanical Engineering 
has a channel with a 0.5 m diameter, a close to 200 m length, 
and a gas holder with a 3 m diameter and 23 m length. The 
findings have been implemented in the development of such 
delivery vehicles as Vostok and Proton, Soyuz reentry modules, 
Luna, Venera, and Mars descent modules, and Energiya-Buran 
complex. Figures 4; tables 1; references 14: 11 Russian, 3

  [Abstract] The thirty-year experience with developing the 
equipment and practices for welding nuclear reactor core 
components, radioactive isotope modules for various purposes, 
and other nuclear industry products accumulated at the NIKIMT 
Scientific Production Association is reviewed. Attention is 
focused on achievements in the field of argon arc welding of 
fuel elements (TVEL), magnetic field-controlled arc welding 
(DUMP-process), and electron beam welding. In particular, the 
SA-477, SA 457, SA-466, and SA-450 argon arc welding machines, 
SA-448 elevated pressure argon-helium arc welding machine, and 
SA-330, SA-340, SA-413, and SA-451 electron beam welding 
machines are described in detail. Today, the association is 
supplying the industry with small batches of power supply plants 
for 6 kW welding machines with a 75 kV accelerating voltage. 
This broad range of equipment and methods makes it possible to 
weld virtually all core elements of domestically made reactors. 
Some of the original units which have been proposed and 
implemented in the nuclear industry are suitable for use in 
various branches of the national economy. Figures 9.

  [Abstract] The stringent requirements imposed on the toxic 
substance concentration in process media transported mostly over 
electrochemically polished stainless steel pipes which are 
usually fabricated by gas-shielded nonconsumable electrode 
welding prompted the development of comprehensive support for 
pipe welding in clean rooms. The equipment and machine tool 
attachments necessary for ensuring the requisite welded joint 
quality from the viewpoint of protecting the weld metal and heat 
affected area (ZTV) from oxidation are outlined in detail. The 
Kama-1 pipe welding head developed, manufactured, and tested by 
the NIKIMT Scientific Production Association for welding small 
diameter pipes (5-14 mm) and its successor--the Kama-2 head--are 
described and their specifications are cited. Equipment for the 
ER-273 power supply unit for single- and multiple-pass wedding, 
a TV endoscope, ODA welding head attachments, and a manual pipe 
cutter developed by the association are described and their 
technical data are summarized. All above equipment can be stored 
in a specially designed transportable case. Figures 6; tables 2.

  [Abstract] A combination of stringent requirements imposed 
on the welded joint quality, a wide range of welded materials 
and product types, and diverse welding condition in erection 
practices necessitated optimization of the types of 
semiautomatic welding machines and their unification. To this 
end, the association carried out a systemic analysis of domestic 
and foreign semiautomatic welding machines and a structural 
analysis of their principal functional systems. The study 
revealed that today's industry needs could be met by four types 
of semiautomatic welding machines for steel and aluminum sheet 
joints (using wires). A modified design of pipe welding heads on 
the basis of the ODA 46-72 base prototype, the SA-616 pipe 
welding head, the SA-577 automatic welding machine for welding 
pipes into tube plates, the Kama-1 chamber head for the SA-621 
machine, and the self-propelled SA-615 welding head designed on 
the basis of modular components are described in detail. All 
designs employ the building block principle with the following 
components: welding wire feed mechanism for all standard sizes; 
three types of control equipment; and five types of wedding 
heads with four types of welding wire with a single central 
brake; in addition, replaceable and fast wearing parts, e.g., 
feed rollers, guides, current leads, etc., are also unified in 
the mechanisms and burners. It is noted that the possibilities 
of unifications have not been fully exhausted. Figures 5.

  [Abstract] The association's achievements in the field of 
nondestructive testing, particularly the development of a broad 
range of both traditional and special-purpose skill-intensive 
processes, procedures, and facilities on the basis of radiation, 
acoustic, eddy current, magnetic, optical, and other types of 
inspection are reviewed, and it is noted that several institute 
departments are engaged in addressing other testing issues. A 
number of designs in the field of nondestructive testing 
realized on the basis of the institute's own unique developments 
is summarized. Attention is focused on developing methods and 
facilities for ultrasonic testing of austenite welds and 
procedures which would make it possible to classify the detected 
flaws. In recent years, more than 30 types of reactor vessel and 
primary circuit testing equipment have been developed by the 
institute. It is noted that the institute's work in this field 
is characterized by its comprehensive approach to solving 
problems. The outlook for further development in the field of 
nondestructive testing is discussed. Figures 7; references 3.

  [Abstract] The specific features of nuclear power industry 
installations and the resulting requirements imposed on the 
welding practices, structures, and operating rules, particularly 
the harmful impact of the installation environment on the 
operating personnel and equipment, prompted the development of 
remote controlled welding facilities and processes which are 
more stable and informative. For illustration, the SA-296 
automatic welding machine for gas-shielded consumable and 
nonconsumable electrode welding of annular butt joints is 
considered and its components are outlined. A family of welding 
machines developed on the basis of these components is 
described. The design of the automatic welding arc length 
control device (ARND) which is crucial for use in the nuclear 
industry is discussed. An analysis of the welding process and 
equipment requirements for routine maintenance and repair 
operations in nuclear power plants and the development and 
operating experience accumulated in this field make it possible 
to recommend that emphasis be placed on raising the automation 
level by using welding adaptation systems. Figures 3.

  [Abstract] The need to take into account random factors in 
order to control the peat brick plant dryer operation more 
effectively prompted the development of a computer simulation 
technique for analyzing the material balance of the peat brick 
plant. The model makes it possible to establish the effect of 
the raw material moisture and ash content variance on the 
specific peat rate per ton of bricks and identify reserves for 
saving milling peat. The study also shows that the peat brick 
plant output can be stabilized by computer-based automation of 
the dryer operation. The formulae for computing the material 
balance are derived. The effect of the raw material moisture and 
ash content on the specific milling peat consumption and the 
peat moisture content behavior in the Peko dryer are plotted. 
The raw material, steam, and air consumption in the Peko dryer 
is summarized. The control algorithm developed for the computer 
and the devices which control the screw rotation speed and the 
gate and fan position on the basis of the computer analysis and 
a DZ-28 microcomputer-based unit used for stabilizing the dryer 
operation are described. The use of computer simulation makes it 
possible to lower the peat consumption and increase the plant 
output while computer-based dryer control improves the product 
quality, lowers the specific power consumption, and increases 
the labor productivity. Publication of the article is approved 
by the editorial board for consideration and implementation in 
the industry. Figures 3; tables 1.

  [Abstract] An acute shortage of installed capacity coupled 
with the obsolescence and wear of thermal power plant equipment 
as well as a sharp rise in energy prices and increasing reliance 
on Russian natural gas prompted the Belarussian power industry 
to search for ways of increasing the utilization efficiency of 
gas by using waste heat recovery gas turbine plants (UGTU) and 
binary steam gas plants. The factors which affect possible fuel 
savings and the criteria for correct selection of the type of 
power plants are outlined. A formula for calculating the 
equivalent fuel economy is derived. An analysis shows that the 
greatest fuel economy can be achieved by using extraction (heat 
supply) gas turbine plants (GTU) and steam gas plants and that 
fuel savings can be increased further by using binary extraction 
gas turbine plants with backpressure turbines. The urgency of 
implementing low-power extraction turbine-based gas turbine and 
steam gas plants is stressed, and it is noted that such 
low-power plants can be brought on stream much faster than 
powerful plants. References 3.

  [Abstract] The effect of the purity of gases transported 
over various types of pipelines with welded joints on the 
"memory" of modern electronic devices, the scarcity of detailed 
data on the extent to which the welding practices and welds 
serve as sources of trace amounts of impurities, and the lack of 
relevant regulatory documents governing the design and process 
parameters prompted a reevaluation of the practical aspects of 
wedding on pipelines intended for carrying superpurified gases 
in the electronics industry. The appearance of superfine residue 
on the welded pipe surface with particles 0.5-1 m in 
size 
and changes in the weld and heat affected area (OShZ) surface 
composition, e.g., the appearance of nonmetallic inclusions, are 
discussed, and certain factors which determine the weld and heat 
affected area protection inside the pipe are described in 
detail. The effect of the shielding gas purging duration which 
ensures a twentyfold replacement of the gas atmosphere as a 
function of the flow velocity (in order to eliminate the fine 
deposit), the weld and heat affected area surface quality as a 
function of the plate surface preparation on the fusing side, 
and the effect of the welding conditions and inner surface state 
on the weld surface roughness are summarized. The findings 
demonstrate that the weld is the principal source of elevated 
impurity desorption which can be lowered by taking into account 
the effect of the welding method and conditions on the weld 
surface roughness, shielding gas rate, and protective device 
design on the development of nonmetallic inclusions, evaporation 
products, and changes in the phase composition of the heat 
affected area surface. Tables 3; references 8: 7 Russian, 1

  [Abstract] It was demonstrated earlier that ordinary 
fractal geometry methods are inapplicable for research on many 
natural processes and objects and therefore the concept of 
self-affine sets was introduced. These self-affine sets are 
characterized by two different fractal dimensions, local and 
global (both these values coincide in the case of ordinary 
self-similarity). Many unsuccessful attempts have been made to 
develop an adequate and convenient method for evaluating the 
fractal properties of such sets, but a number of difficulties 
were encountered. A new method is therefore proposed for 
evaluating the scale invariance of self-affine sets which is 
based on investigation of the scale properties of mean values 
and dispersions. The method is explained in detail. Examples are 
cited from different branches of the earth sciences (field of 
specific intensity of seismic process, relief of surface of 
solid Earth, sequence of geomagnetic field reversals during the 
last 160 million years) showing that self-similarity is 
characteristic of the most diverse natural processes and that 
the proposed method makes possible reliable evaluation of their 
fractal dimensions. In cases when counterscaling reveals 
considerable asymmetry, as in the case of regional relief, it is 
possible to speak of a more complex structure of the set than 
simple self-similarity in which the fractal characteristics, 
determined "from inside" and "from outside" the set, differ 
significantly. In such a situation the determined fractal 
dimensions can be identified with local and global self-affine 
sets respectively. Figures 3; references: 5 Russian, 6 Western.

  [Abstract] Research on the reaction of ground water to 
disturbances caused by underground nuclear explosions was 
carried out during the period 1983-1989 using data from 96 
observation holes in the Semipalatinsk test range at distances 
0.3-10 km from the epicenter. The observations were made at the 
time of 44 underground nuclear explosions (29 in deep holes and 
15 in drifts) with a TNT equivalent from 6 to 150 kilotons. A 
change in hydrogeological conditions was caused by a change in 
the mechanical state of the rocks. The greatest change in water 
conductivity was observed in the neighborhood of holes 
containing the least water. In holes penetrating andesitic 
porphyries there was an average increase in water conductivity 
from 0.26 to 0.52 m[.sup]2[/]/day, corresponding to an 
increase in total rock porosity from 3.8 to 5.3%. An 
underground nuclear explosion results in disruption of natural 
hydrogeological conditions in a region with a relative radius 
r/q[.sup]1/3[/] to 1000 m/kt[.sup]1/3[/], which is greater 
by an order of magnitude than the radius of the zone of 
fracturing induced during an explosion and which corresponds to 
the zone of irreversible local disruptions of the medium. 
Changes in hydrogeological conditions were caused by: an 
increase in the effective pressure of the fluid in water-bearing 
rocks; a change in the mechanical, and therefore, the filtration 
properties of reservoir rocks; formation of new filtration 
channels; formation of underground voids as a result of an 
explosion and their subsequent filling with ground water.

  [Abstract] Short-term precursors of earthquakes were 
defined as variations in a geophysical field that satisfy three 
primary conditions for the amplitude of the variation (it must 
exceed a precursor threshold equal to two standard deviations of 
the quantity in question during periods of seismic calm), the 
time interval prior to a particular seismic event (hours and 
days), and the distance from where the precursor was measured to 
the epicenter of the earthquake (epsilon[.sup]M[/] 
kilometers, where M equals magnitude). Each of these components 
of the definition was elaborated individually. This definition 
was then used as a basis for performing a statistical analysis 
of a wide variety of short-term precursors recorded at a number 
of observation stations over a large area around the epicenters 
prior to the Tanshan*** and Haichen*** earthquakes in China. The 
quantitative analysis of this data point to a definite 
correlation between the short-term precursors of an earthquake 
and the formation of its seismic focus. According to all the 
data available for this particular study, the value for the 
correlation between the time frame and amplitude of short-term 
precursors, on the one hand, and the distance of these 
precursors from an earthquake's epicenter and the magnitude of 
that particular earthquake, on the other, lies between 0.57 and 
0.84, with an average value of 0.70. It was concluded that the 
statistical correlation between short-term anomalies in a 
geophysical field and specific earthquake parameters indicate 
that these anomalies are indeed precursors of actual earthquakes 
and that they should be used to forecast the time frame within 
which a particular seismic event is expected to occur. Figures

  [Abstract] The author investigates the applicability of the 
widely used approximation method for the description of acoustic 
fields in moving media, which is commonly applied to the 
measurement of ocean sound fields. The method, which is based on 
Rayleigh's ``Theory of Sound,'' consists in replacing the the 
actual moving medium with some immobile one, which has the 
effective speed of sound, dependent on the speed of the current. 
  Analytical estimates were made of the error in determining 
the phases and amplitudes of the rays arriving at the point of 
observation. The validity of the estimates was confirmed by 
simple models of the medium, with exponential laws on the 
variation of the speed of the current and of the velocity of 
sound, which made possible an accurate computation of the path 
of the rays and eikonals. The validity of the estimates was also 
confirmed by means of numerical modelling. 
  It was demonstrated that the main component of error in 
calculating the level of sound pressure under conditions of 
multiple rays is the error in the determination of the phase of 
the field at the rays, and that this error increases with 
distance. This knowledge made it possible to construct formulae 
expressing the error, and thereby provided a simple method for 
estimating the applicabiity of the approximation method in 
calculating the intensity of an acoustic field. In conjunction 
with these formulae the approximation method can be used 
successfully.

  [Abstract] A theoretical analysis was made of the effect of 
wind waves on the point scattering function of viewing systems 
used in the observation of undersea objects. The author points 
out initially that, while in the case of diffused illumination 
from a fairly wide light source the optical transmission 
function can be described as a Gauss function, in the presence 
of directed illumination from a single light source, such as the 
sun, the Gauss function no longer applies, and determining the 
optical transmission function becomes extremely difficult. In 
this case an analysis of the point scattering function is more 
useful. 
  Through a series of formulae the author determines the 
integral paramemeters of the point scattering function under 
conditions of a rough sea surface illuminated by direct sunlight. 
  The author concludes that distortions of the point 
scattering 
function are mainly caused by the effects of the 
cross-correlation of light radiation falling on the sea surface 
and of that coming from beneath it, and are specific for the 
conditions of directed illumination. At the same time the degree 
of distortion is dependent on a number of factors, chief of 
which are the angle between the direction of illumination and 
that of observation, the depth of the undersea object under 
observation, and the roughness of the waves, which is determined 
by surface wind velocity.

  [Abstract] The author makes an anlaysis of free and forced 
gyroscopic (inertial) waves in a continuously stratified ocean 
of constant depth, using f-plane approximation. 
  The vertical structure of the waves is examined, and through 
a series of formulae the long- and short-wave approximations of 
their dispersive dependencies are obtained. A study is also made 
of Airy wave packets, which are generated during the evolution 
of initial disturbances in the ocean. The special features of 
the generation of gyrsoscopic waves by periodic and by moving 
disturbances are described, and a comparison is made of the 
effectiveness of wave generation by surface and by bottom 
disturbances. 
  On the basis of his investigation the author concludes that 
gyroscopic waves possess properties which differentiate them 
substantially from internal waves. The main differences lie in 
the frequency range of their occurrence, in their vertical 
structure, in the directions of their propagation in relation to 
the generating sources, and in the spatial structure of fields 
of gyroscopic waves behind moving disturbances. Effective 
generation of gyroscopic waves can be expected in layers of 
quasi-homogeneous depth during the flow of currents past 
irregularities in the terrain of the ocean floor. The question 
of experimental detection of gyroscopic waves in the world ocean 
remains still to be explored.

  [Abstract] Measurements of intense internal waves were 
conducted over several years by temperature sensors with spaced 
antennae distributed over the shelf zones of the Caspian Sea and 
the Sea of Japan. 
  The author's examination of the measurements showed that the 
discrepancy between the dispersive relationship of linear 
internal waves of the first mode and the parameters of measured 
waves is connected with the non-linearity of the latter. The 
waves which were observed showed features which were evidence of 
their soliton nature, such as, for example, their greater speed 
as compared to linear waves, and the dependence of their speed 
on amplitude. Some typical manifestations of soliton 
manifestations in internal waves in the shelf zones were 
multi-stage tidal bores and precursor waves. 
  The author concludes that the most reliable means of 
identifying solitons in on-the-scene oceanological 
investigations is by means of qualitative concurrence. As 
regards a quantitative comparison with the equation of Cortevega 
de Brisa, there does not appear to be full concurrence in all 
parameters, although in some cases the agreement seems to be 
very close. This can be explained by the numerous factors which 
are not considered in the equation, such as the current, the 
proximity of the bottom, etc. Nonetheless the properties of 
solitons in shelf zones are sufficiently pronounced so that they 
cannot be obscured by external environmental factors and the 
variability of these factors.

author constructs a stochastic classification model for the 
characteristics of the empirical distributions of fields of 
various types. As experimental material he uses 15 samples from 
surveys of ocean temperature fields obtained on expeditions by 
research ships of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in various 
dynamic zones of the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean. 
  By means of the criterion X[.sup]2[/] algorithms were 
constructed for the optimal classification of empirical 
histograms according to general populations. Using the results 
of the measurements an analysis was made of the general 
populations of horizontal l[.sup]+[/][.sub]-[/] scales for

  [Abstract] On the basis of data relating to currents 
obtained in the Mesopolygon experiment, which was conducted in 
the tropical part of the North Atlantic in 1985, the authors 
made a statistical examination of an internal wave field, with 
particular emphasis on inertial and tidal waves. 
  It was found that the chief anomalous features of inertial 
and tidal waves were their increased intensity, and that the 
intensity depends on the depth of the horizon, as well as on 
frequency and time. At the same time the intensity of the waves 
decreased considerably towards the ocean's surface. 
  Conclusions which could be drawn from the above were first 
that inertial and tidal waves are generated locally in the lower 
levels of the ocean, and secondly that on the average they lose 
their energy as they rise towards the surface. 
  On the basis of similarities between some of the data 
obtained in the Mesopolygon experiment and data obtained in 
other regions, the authors speculate that the generation of 
inertial and tidal waves in this area may be caused by an 
intrusive lens of Mediterranean waters.

  [Abstract] The author points out initially that, although 
some researchers believe that tidal internal gravitational waves 
in the ocean possess a modal structure, others are of the 
opinion that the formation of a field of vertically standing 
internal gravitational waves in such a variable medium as the 
ocean would probably not occur. Using data from soundings 
carried out by a drifting scientific research ship, the author 
attempts to determine the amplitude functions of the individual 
modes of tidal internal gravtitational waves by means of an 
analysis of vertical temperature soundings. 
  Soundings, which were carried out in the region of 910' 
North latitude and 17606' West longitude, were at 30-minute 
intervals and reached a depth of 600 m. For an analysis of the 
profiles of the vertical soundings the method of empirical 
orthogonasl functions was used. 
  The conclusions which could be drawn from the results of the 
soundings were as follows: 
  1. In the part of the ocean which was examined the average 
state of a random field of internal gravitational waves on tidal 
frequency can be represented in the form of a superposition of 
vertically standing internal waves. 
  2. In the open ocean the mechanism for the generation of 
tidal internal waves with a modal structure may be the 
parametric instability which is produced by tide-forming forces.

  [Abstract] Empirical models of the vertical distribution of 
ozone in the altitude range 10-32 km have been published, but 
data on tropospheric ozone are lacking and data from the 
existing ozonometric network are inadequate for constructing 
zonal, global or regional models. However, data from the world 
ozonometric network were used in constructing models of the 
partial pressure of ozone in the troposphere for 35 stations. 
The data taken into account included the mean climatic 
distribution of the wind, climatic characteristics of the 
tropopause and location of the principal jet stream zones over 
the northern hemisphere. The seasonal variation of ozone partial 
pressure was determined for the 300- and 500-gpa surfaces for 
different points in the hemisphere. These data revealed that the 
classical seasonal variation of tropospheric ozone density with 
a summer maximum and a winter minimum is not always observed. 
The constructed models of the vertical distribution for these 
stations show that the accepted seasonal variation of ozone 
density occurs only in regions not subject to the influence of 
jet streams. In the latter, however, the ozone maximum, as in 
the lower stratosphere, is in the spring. It can be postulated 
that under definite synoptic conditions a considerable quantity 
of ozone is pumped into the troposphere from the stratosphere.

  [Abstract] The reasons for the appearance of ozone 
miniholes over the northern hemisphere in January 1986 and 1987 
are discussed. This phenomenon is usually observed in the period 
October-March, its appearance has an irregular character and may 
vary from year to year. These miniholes occur in the northern 
hemisphere middle and high latitudes when there is no global 
ozone hole in the Arctic. An attempt is made to establish 
correlations between changes in wave activity in the lower 
stratosphere and ozone distribution anomalies in the northern 
hemisphere high latitudes. The many processes involved in the 
development of these miniholes are analyzed. A comparison of the 
computed three-dimensional Eliassen-Palma flows and variations 
in the total ozone content indicated that the appearance and 
evolution of ozone miniholes over the North Atlantic, Europe and 
Siberia are related to changes in wave activity and the 
direction of vortical transport of ozone by planetary waves. 
Weakening of wave activity and anomalous transport from the low 
latitudes may be reasons for the appearance of ozone miniholes. 
The filling of ozone miniholes is associated with an increase in 
wave activity. The analysis of these ozone anomalies in the 
northern hemisphere middle and high latitudes indicates that 
natural, not anthropogenic factors are responsible for the 
formation and evolution of ozone miniholes. Figure 1;

  [Abstract] From February 1989 to December 1991 the 
Institute of Physics of the Atmospphere of the Russian Academy 
of Sciences conducted regular measurements of concentrations of 
soot in the air over the city of Moscow. Aerosol samples were 
collected around the clock by two sampling devices, one located 
in the center and the other on the outskirts of the city. At the 
same time sodar observations of the type of stratification of 
the lower part of the boundary layer of the atmosphere and of 
the layer of intermingling were conducted, while information on 
reverse trajectories of the transfer of air masses and on the 
direction and velocity of the wind were obtained from the 
Hydrometeorological Center of the USSR. The correlations between 
these factors and soot concentrations were determined. 
  Results of the monitoring of soot aerosol indicated that 
concentrations were very similar at both sampling stations. This 
appeared to be a result of the fact that the sources of soot 
pollution were evenly distributed throughout the city, and that 
the circulation of air over the city was such as to cause 
additional transfer and intermingling of pollutants. As a result 
of this concentrations tended to be the same over the entire 
urban area. 
  Conclusions which can be drawn from the results of the 
monitoring are as follows: 
  1. Concentrations of soot in Moscow in 1991 were higher than 
in either of the two preceding years. 
  2. The soot content in the air over Moscow depends on the 
output volume of the sources of soot aerosol within the 
city--(these are mainly related to automobile traffic),--on wind 
velocity, and on the type of stratification of the boundary 
layer of the atmosphere. 
  3. In summer the city is cleared of soot through the arrival 
of clean Arctic air masses and as a result of convection, while 
an increase in soot concentration can be observed when surface 
inversions are present and during the time of the most intense 
automobile traffic. 
  4. In winter the highest concentrations of soot occur mainly 
during surface and raised inversions, and the lowest during 
uniform stratification and when the intensity of automobile 
traffic diminishes during the night hours.

  [Abstract] The results of a statistical analysis of air 
pollution in individual cities and in a number of regions are 
presented. A special classification of synoptic situations was 
made based on observational data for more than 30 cities. It was 
found that there is a significant correlation between urban air 
pollution and some synoptic situations. Situations characterized 
by positioning of an anticyclone, ridge, trough and also the 
western periphery of an anticyclone over the investigated region 
favor the formation of regions of high air pollution. This is 
manifested particularly clearly relative to the stable ridge of 
the Siberian High, with which cases of low air pollution are 
never observed. The formation of regions with a low pollution 
level is associated with cyclonic situations, particularly with 
the rear of a cyclone and its cold northern periphery. A high 
pollution level is observed in regions of a warm front, and also 
in the warm sector of a cyclone. A cyclonic circulation 
accompanied by a front is observed twice as frequently in the 
case of high air pollution as in the case of low air pollution, 
and this despite the fact that in given situations factors (such 
as a strong wind and precipitation) may be operative which favor 
air purification. On this basis methods are proposed for 
predicting air pollution in cities and regions for a period from 
one to several days. Figure 1; references 20: 14 Russian, 6

  [Abstract] The functional model used to simulate 
spring-grain growth divided the growing season into vegetative 
and reproductive periods, taking into account the monthly 
average photosynthetically active solar radiation, 
precipitation, soil moisture, atmospheric carbon dioxide, and 
air temperature, as well as the phytomass of leaves, stems, 
roots, and reproductive organs. The model included functions 
describing the distribution of assimilated substances in the 
plant organs and the consumption rates of these substances due 
to respiration. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium were 
limiting factors in the model. Six climate-change scenarios were 
tested: global warmings and coolings of 1 and 2.5 degrees 
Celsius combined with no change, a 5 percent decrease, or a 10 
percent decrease in precipitation. Results were obtained for 18 
economic regions of the former USSR based on the average 
conditions in each. Warming by 1 degree substantially improved 
yields in the Northwest and Eastern Siberian economic regions, 
the Baltic countries, and Belarus, while cooling by 1 degree 
decreased yields everywhere except Central Asia and Kazakhstan. 
All the climate-change scenarios reduced yields in the 
Volga-Vyatsk, Volga, North Caucasus, and Western Siberia 
economic regions of Russia and in Moldova, Ukraine, and the 
Transcaucasus. Temperature changes of plus or minus 2.5 degrees 
combined with decreased precipitation made practically all areas 
of the former USSR unsuitable for grain production. Figures 3;

  [Abstract] An accident occurred at the Tomsk-7 
radiochemical plant on 6 April 1993. A container with 
approximately 20 m[.sup]3[/] exploded with the escape of 
uranium. A radioactive track with an area about 100 
km[.sup]2[/] was formed in the terrain. An initial 
reconnaissance was made for determining the general direction of 
transport and fallout of radioactive substances, followed on 
12-13 April by a detailed survey of the snow-covered terrain at 
1:100 000. The direction of the survey runs was virtually 
perpendicular to the axis of the radioactive track; each run was 
20 km long. A map shows the polluted area. The energy release of 
the radioactive products was estimated at 4700 R x 
km[.sup]2[/]/hour. The total quantity of radioactive products 
beyond the limits of the industrial site of the plant was 
estimated at 530-590 curies. It is shown that in the most 
polluted central part of the track with pollution levels 300 
R/hour or more the accumulated dose of gamma radiation from 
the radionuclides detected at the time of the survey 
(ruthenium-103, ruthenium-106, zirconium-95 and niobium-95) will 
not be more than 1 roentgen during the first year. During 
subsequent years there will be little gamma radiation from 
radioactive pollution. Figures 2.

  [Abstract] A study was made of possible changes in river 
pollution in zones of mixed and broadleaf forests, wooded steppe 
and steppe in the European territory of Russia, the Baltic 
states, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova for three global warming 
scenarios. Water quality was evaluated using an index taking 
into account the pollution of river waters, river runoff and the 
type of water use. The most unfavorable situation with the 
quality of river waters in the middle latitudes of the European 
CIS and in the Baltic countries is anticipated with a global 
warming of about 1.2C. A further warming, accompanied by an 
increase in water runoff, should result in a considerable 
improvement in water quality over almost the entire territory. 
With a warming by 1.2C over an area of about 1 200 000 
km[.sup]2[/] (46% of the total considered area) in which 
at 
the present time the norms are not impaired there will be a 
worsening of the quality of river waters to 1.5-2.0 of the 
maximum admissible concentration or more, which will cause 
definite difficulties in the case of use of these resources for 
drinking purposes. Further research must be centered on 
predicting the influence exerted on water pollution by probable 
changes in the intraannual distribution of runoff. Figures 4;

  [Abstract] The influence of water management activity in 
the Amudarya and Syrdarya basins on the increase in 
anthropogenic withdrawals of river runoff and the decrease in 
level of the Aral Sea is analyzed. The total water withdrawals 
in the Syrdarya and Amudarya basins increased threefold between 
1950 and 1978, from 30 to 103 km[.sup]3[/], with the greatest 
withdrawal in 1985 (109 km[.sup]3[/]. The irrigated area 
during this same period approximately doubled. During the last 
decade of the studied period virtually the entire volume of 
annual water resources was withdrawn for irrigation. The 
increase in total withdrawals beginning in 1956 did not 
immediately exert an influence on the decrease in sea volume and 
decrease in its level because the five-year period 1956-1960 was 
a period of high waters. As a result the sea received an 
additional water inflow which stabilized the sea level and 
caused some increase which continued until 1960. After 1961 the 
sea level constantly dropped with a brief interruption in 
1969-1970 due to the high waters of 1969. The research revealed 
the quantitative relations between the decrease in the volume 
(level) of the Aral Sea and the increase in water withdrawals 
and unreturned expenditures of river runoff in the sea basin. 
The relative constancy of the natural level and the volume of 
the Aral Sea persisted under conditions of a relative constancy 
of the total withdrawals of river runoff in the range 30-40 
km[.sup]3[/] as long as the water consumption in the basin 
did not exceed 40 km[.sup]3[/]. A further increase in water 
consumption in the basin caused a continuing increase in the 
unreturned expenditures of river runoff, resulting in a 
corresponding decrease in volume and a drop in sea level. The 
threat of an ecological catastrophe in the Aral Sea basin is 
entirely evident. Figures 3; references: 10 Russian.

  [Abstract] During March 1993 extremely high atmospheric 
pollution was not registered (in March 1992 one such case was 
observed), nor were such cases registered in the first quarter 
of this year (two such cases were observed in the first quarter 
of 1992). During March in 7 cities (Omsk, Glazov, Tomsk, 
Kemerovo, Norilsk, Tolyatti, Moscow) in 12 cases the presence of 
pollutants in concentrations of 10 times the maximum admissible 
concentrations (MAC) were observed (in March 1992 this was true 
in 58 cases in 14 cities). In Moscow during March two cases of 
high atmospheric pollution with ammonia with 28 MAC and two 
cases of pollution with carbon monoxide with 12 MAC were 
observed. In this month extremely high pollution levels (MAC 
greater than 100, with a sharp worsening of organoleptic 
properties) resulted from 22 accidents in 16 water bodies (in 
comparison with March 1992 with 25 such events in 17 water 
bodies). During March 1993 there were 153 cases of high 
pollution in 103 water bodies, especially rivers. Various cases 
of oil spills in Russian rivers occurred. During March 1993 
radiation conditions in the Russian Federation did not change 
substantially in comparison with February. The diurnal 
concentrations of radioactive aerosols in the atmosphere and 
their fallout onto the underlying surface were at the level of 
the background values.

  [Abstract] The increasing use of the simulation method in 
the science of membranes which traditionally employs models 
membranes--liposomes, monolayers on the water-gas surface, and 
"black" lipid membranes as well as biological membranes which 
are highly labile, thus limiting the selection of research 
methods, and reports about the high stability of polymer 
liposomes which are used, inter alia, to study the 
mechanical interaction of liposomes with the cells and fix 
enzymes in the lipid membranes, prompted a review of the 
preparation of polymer membranes from polymerizable lipids--the 
closest analogues of natural phospholipids--and using these 
membranes in simulating membrane-dependent biological processes. 
Various methods of initiating polymer reactions in lipid 
bilayers are considered, and the stability of polymer membranes 
from diacetylene-, dien-, styrene-, methacryloyl-, and 
thiolipids is analyzed and compared. The issues of polymer 
membrane applications in simulating the intercellular 
recognition processes and examining phase transitions are 
addressed. In particular, the general approaches to producing 
polymer lipid membranes, the types of polymerizable 
phospholipids and the properties of polymer membranes, and 
biological process simulation using polymer membranes are 
examined in detail. Special attention is focused on protein 
incorporation in polymer membranes and polymer liposome 
interaction with the blood component cells (hemocompatible 
materials). Figures 10; tables 2; references 107: 10 Russian, 97

  [Abstract] The earlier study which showed that low 
acetylcholine (AKh) doses stimulate the Ca[.sup]2+[/] influx 
into the Helix pomatia neurons and increase the 
intracellular cAMP level is continued, and it is noted that the 
effort failed to establish the neurotransmitter concentration 
threshold at which the Ca[.sup]2+[/] exchange changes in the 
neurons. To bridge this gap, an attempt is made to ascertain the 
minimum acetylcholine concentration which no longer affects the [.sup]45 
[/] 
Ca[.sup]2+[/] influx into the Helix 
pomatia neurons. To this end, nervous ganglia of 
Helix pomatia incubated in 2 ml of physiological 
solution containing 10 l of the [.sup]45[/]Ca isotope with 
or without addition of 10[.sup]-10[/]-10[.sup]-18[/] 
mole/l of acetylcholine during a 1-120 min time span are 
investigated. The experimental procedure consisting of two 
series of tests is outlined. During the first, the effect of low 
acetylcholine concentrations was studied on snails in a 
physiologically active state (Jun-Jul) and in the second 
(involving two sessions)--on snails preparing for hibernal 
hibernation (late November). The effect of various concentration 
of acetylcholine on the [.sup]45[/]Ca influx into the 
Helix pomatia neurons after various incubation 
periods is plotted. The study shows that an increase in the 
incubation period shifts the acetylcholine triggering threshold 
toward lower concentrations; below an acetylcholine 
concentration of 10[.sup]-18[/]-10[.sup]-19[/] M even 
after 90-120 min of incubation, acetylcholine no longer affects 
the [.sup]45[/]Ca influx. The findings warrant a serious 
reevaluation of existing notions of effective neurotransmitter 
concentrations and open up the possibility of utilizing 
homeopathic doses of biologically active substances in treatment 
practices. Figures 3; references 5: 4 Russian, 1 Western.

  [Abstract] One of the principal problems hindering further 
improvement of primary DNA structure identification methods--the 
development of ordered sequencing strategies for a planned DNA 
fragment study--is discussed, and it is suggested that the 
problem can be resolved by synthesizing a collection of primers 
of all possible sequences and after obtaining all necessary data 
on the sequence, selecting the primer for the subsequent step 
from the primer. Yet the inordinate size of such a collection 
prompted F.W. Studier to use a combination of shorter 
oligonucleotide components in place of one long primer. Stacking 
interaction of the terminal links of the adjacent short 
nucleotides leads to an elevated stability of the resulting 
duplexes. A set of three pentanucleotides makes it possible to 
set up a primer bank containing only 1,024 pentanucleotides, 
thus lowering the sequencing cost and simplifying the procedure. 
The use of modified oligonucleotides with an increased affinity 
for complementary sequences greatly enhances the planned 
sequencing potential; today, it is possible to substitute 
primers containing adenine and cytosine with stronger binding 
analogues. Figures 2; tables 1; references 2: 1 Russian, 1

  [Abstract] The genus specificity of the human 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (AKTG)--a peptide consisting of 39 
amino acids which is produced and secreted in the hypophysis and 
which stimulates biosynthesis of secretion of corticosteroids in 
the adrenal cortex--and the desire to avoid unnecessary immune 
reactions as well as the expense and tediousness of chemical 
synthesis of the human adrenocorticotropic hormone prompted a 
study of the expression of the human adrenocorticotropic hormone 
in the form of a hybrid with S. aureus protein A. 
This hybrid protein can be easily isolated from 
Escherichia coli proteins. This system was used to 
obtain the insulin-like growth factor IFH-I and to produce the 
bovine adrenocorticotropic hormone. The plasmids containing most 
of the S. aureus protein A gene as well as the 
plasmids containing the bovine adrenocorticotropic hormone pUC 
19/1, pUC 19/7, and pUC 19/Pro were used to construct 
recombinant plasmids. The experiment procedure is outlined. The 
hybrid gene sequence constructed as a result contains the 
sequences which encode protein A of S. aureus and 
human adrenocorticotropic hormone located in the same reading 
frame. Synthetic adapter sequences whose specific cleaving will 
eventually make it possible to isolate the end product from the 
fused protein are built in between these sequences. The fused 
protein synthesis detection procedure is described and the 
possibility of protein A secretion by E. coli cell 
derivatives is established. The conclusion is drawn that the 
constructed plasmids direct the human adrenocorticotropic 
hormone-containing fused protein synthesis in E. 
coli. The authors are grateful to A.A. Shulga for help with 
mutagenesis. Figures 1; references 9: 4 Russian, 5 Western.

  [Abstract] The complexity and shortcomings of existing 
physical, chemical, and bacterial test methods of sterilization 
control prompted the development of color nutrient media which 
would make it possible to take into account the outcome of 
bacteriological control by a change in the color of the medium 
itself. This would also make it possible to relax the 
bacteriological skill requirements in evaluating the control 
procedure outcome and thus expand bacterial control 
applications. The following three formulations are developed as 
a result of an exhaustive preliminary experiment: a prepared 
Hiss medium with a bromocrezol purple (BKP) indicator, a color 
nutrient medium with a bromocrezol purple indicator, and a color 
medium with a bromothymol blue (BTS) indicator. The sensitivity 
of each medium was assessed by its ability to change color after 
inoculation by small microorganism doses. A comparison of the 
color nutrient media sensitivity to Bacillus 
stearothermophilus and B. licheniformis, a 
comparison of the B. licheniformis spore growth at 37 
and 55C temperatures, the effect of temperature on the 
B. licheniformis ability to grow in the bromothymol 
blue medium, and the Hiss medium sensitivity with an addition of 
glucose to the growth of B. stearothermophilus spores 
are summarized. The effort made it possible to develop workable 
color nutrient media for analyzing the outcome of 
bacteriological control of sterilization and recommend the Hiss 
medium as the most efficient; if spores of the B. 
stearothermophilus bacteria grow, the medium changes color 
from the original lilac to yellow. The use of color media makes 
it possible to assess the results by the medium color after an 
inoculum exposure to 55C in a thermostat, since the growth 
of foreign microflora at this temperature is almost impossible. 
Color nutrient media have successfully passed tests in numerous 
practical institutions with invariably good marks. Tables 4.

  [Abstract] The multiple stage microorganism development 
nature whereby each stage is characterized by certain 
morphological, biochemical, antigen, and pathogenic properties 
resulting in diverse clinical manifestations and the failure to 
apply modern hardware and light transmission and absorption 
methods to studying the stage-by-stage microorganism evolution 
prompted the development of a procedure of using a 
photo-electrocolorimeter to determine the microorganisms' 
development stages and examine their properties at each stage. 
The procedure is based on using a KFK-2MP 
photoelectrocolorimeter since the bacteria are only 0.6-3 m 
in size, and their study calls for an instrument whose 
dimensions are several times smaller than the subject of 
inquiry. The proposed method is thus quite suitable because the 
luminous flux wavelength falls within a 315-980 nm range which 
is smaller than the bacterial cell by two- to threefold. A day 
old Escherichia coli culture cultivated at a 37C 
temperature is the subject of investigation. The experimental 
procedure is outlined. The bacterial population reproduction 
curve plotted by traditional microbiological and 
photoelectrocolorimetric methods are cited. The difference in 
the curves is attributed to the latter method's higher 
resolution (by 240 times). The findings confirm the possibility 
of using the photoelectrocolorimetric method for analyzing 
bacterial life and demonstrate its obvious advantages, e.g., the 
higher resolution (making it possible to trace the bacterial 
life changes at a 5 s interval), promptness, high sensitivity, 
and low labor outlays. Figures 2; references 5.

  [Text] Abstract. The principal clinical symptoms in 
patients and epidemiological characteristics are described in 
the article. 
  The authors of this report observed four patients, three of 
whom were identified in Pavlodar and one in Uralsk. 
  Helminths (Dirofilaria repens) belong to the 
genera of Nematodes and Nemathelminthes and have the dimensions 
of 100 to 110 x 0.2 mm and, as a rule, parasitize in nodular 
intumescence under the skin, subcutaneous fat, and the eye. 
  The larva migrans cutanea phenomenon, i.e., a 
parasite movement over substantial distances under the skin, has 
been recorded. 
  Dirofilarioses are transmissive helminths. Humans are 
infected with them in the locations where invaded animals 
proliferate (dogs, foxes, wolves, etc.) through mosquito bites. 
References: 4. 
  Key words: Parasitism--A form of cohabitation of two 
organisms advantageous for one and harmful for the other 
species; filaria--several species of white filamentary 
helminths; Dirofilaria--one of the filaria species; larva 
migrans cutanea phenomenon--parasite movement over a 
considerable distance under the skin; transmissible 
diseases--diseases whose etiological agents are transmitted by 
vectors. 
  Several dozen cases of parasitizing of animal filaria in 
humans identified as Dirofilaria have been recorded in the 
world, including the CIS. Moreover, single, usually sexually 
immature female and less frequently, male filaria have been 
detected in the organism of most patients. Helminths, as a rule, 
parasitize in nodular subcutaneous intumescence, subcutaneous 
fat, and the eye. 
  Filaria have been found in people living in the territories 
with subtropical and moderate continental climate. Cases of 
Dirofilaria have been described in the maritime kray [3] and 
Turkmenia [2]. In Kazakhstan, the first cases of local 
Dirofilarioses infestation were described by T.K. Besedina and 
N.A. Khokholnikova [1]. Both cases were identified in Alma-Ata 
in 1960-1961, and in the author's opinion, the southern 
Kazakhstan and Urals oblasts are regarded as likely infestation 
areas [4]. The latter two Dirofilarioses cases were recorded in 
Kzyl-Orda in 1964 and 1968. 
  The authors of this report have observed four Dirofilariosis 
patients in the last six months. Due to the increased frequency 
of the rare helminthism occurrence on the republic territory, it 
would be interesting to examine the principal climatic symptoms 
on invasion among the patients, especially its epidemiology. 
  Patient B, born in 1940, is a biology teacher in a Pavlodar 
secondary school. She fell acutely ill on 19 Mar 90, felt a 
sharp pain and an edema of the left eye. For several days prior 
to that, she experienced headaches every evening. On 20 Mar 90, 
she sought medical help at a trauma center of the oblast 
hospital where a filamentary helminth with a 110 x 0.2 mm size 
was removed from under the mucous membrane of the eyeball. 
  Patient S, born in 1954, is a designer engineer working in 
Pavlodar. A hyperemic spot which, with time, transformed into a 
1 x 5 mm node, appeared in the left groin area. The larva 
migrans phenomenon, i.e., a parasite movement over a 
considerable distance under the skin, was detected. The process 
was accompanied by pain in the elbow and radiocarpal joints and 
an edema of the tongue. 
  On 25 Sep 90, a 110 x 0.2 mm nematode was pulled from under 
the eyeball mucous membrane. 
  Patient P, a retiree born in 1930, is also a resident of 
Pavlodar. She fell ill in late February 1992 when she noted a 
hyperemic tumor-like formation on the forehead. She was bothered 
by severe headaches. The tumor disappeared several days later. 
On 8 March, she had sharp pain in the right eye and developed 
photophobia and lacrimation. On 20 March, a 106 x 0.2 mm 
nematode was removed from under the eyeball mucous membrane at 
the eye department of the oblast hospital. 
  Patient M from Uralsk is a retiree. In February 1992, she 
noted an edema on the front of the right crus and a 
zigzag-shaped reddening as well as pain in the area of the knee 
joint. Some time later, the reddening moved lower, and a 
pea-sized tumor appeared on the rear surface of the right crus. 
The movement of the reddening was accompanied by itching. After 
self-treatment of the tumor with Vishnevskiy ointment, no 
recovery was noted. After she sought medical assistance, the 
tumor was operated on, and a white 110-mm-long nematode was 
pulled from the purulent wound. 
  All patients recall numerous mosquito bites during the 
summer 
and none left Kazakhstan. The helminths extracted from them were 
sent to the republican sanitary and epidemiological station for 
identification; they are encapsulated preadolescent males 
belonging to the Dirofilaria repens species. 
  Dirofilarioses are transmissible helminthisms. They are 
widespread in the world among dogs, but foxes, wolves, coyotes, 
tigers, and wild cats may be the final ``host,'' although humans 
are only accidental ``hosts.'' Humans are infected in the areas 
of habitat of invaded animals through mosquito bites of the 
Aedes, Cubex and Anopheles species. The 
filaria development phase prior to the invasion stage depends on 
the intermediate ``host'' (10-20 days). After entering the 
mosquito's stomach together with the blood, the 
Drepens microfilaria migrate into the insect body 
cavity for 1.5 days. After reaching the invasion stage, the 
larva migrate into the head and mouth organs of the mosquitos 
and from there--into the human organism through bites. 
  An increase in the gnat population was noted in Pavlodar and 
Uralsk between 1982 and 1991: the mean seasonal indicator rose 
by twofold. Such a widespread proliferation of insects in the 
aforesaid regions is the factor which determine the unfavorable 
situation with the transmissible disease, including 
Dirofilariosis.

  [Abstract] The urgency of HIV research and the need to 
develop reliable yet accessible methods of storing infected 
cells, even HIV-producing cells, necessitated the development of 
improved freezing conditions for HIV-infected or HIV-producing 
cells, a study of their viability and the viral antigen 
expression on the cell surface and during storage in liquid 
nitrogen, and preservation of the representative morphology of 
the newly forming viruses. To this end, the H-9/III-B inoculated 
cell line infected with HIV-I (VICh) from Bulgaria cultivated as 
a suspension in the RPMI-1640 medium (by Flow, U.K.) with a 
15% 
embryonic calf serum is used. The experimental procedure is 
outlined. Glycerin and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were used as 
cryoprotectors. The cell viability and HIV antigen expression 
with various cryoprotectors at different freezing rates and the 
cell viability and HIV antigen expression at various points 
during storage are summarized, and the recovery dynamics of 
virus-producing cells after cryopreservation are plotted. The 
findings show that the frozen cell concentration does not affect 
subsequent cell viability; single multinuclear cells which 
disappeared after freezing, probably due to destruction, were 
detected on the eighths and ninth day. A comparison reveals that 
dimethylsulfoxide is less suitable for this conservation 
procedure. The highest survivability of the H-9/III line 
infected with HIV-I was observed after freezing in a 10% 
glycerin solution at a 1C/min rate to a -70C 
temperature with subsequent specimen placement in liquid 
nitrogen. The cells maintained their original viability and 
ability to express HIV antigen after an extended (12 months) 
storage of cryopreserved samples in liquid nitrogen. The above 
method makes it possible to preserve HIV isolates and 
HIV-producers for an extended period in labs with a minimum set 
of cryogenic devices. Figures 2; tables 2; references 6: 5

  [Abstract] The role of EHF (millimeter wavelength) 
treatment as a means of nonspecific activation therapy and the 
effect of electromagnetic radiation (EMI), especially 
low-intensity millimetric radiation, on recovery processes are 
examined. To this end, the outcome of EHF treatment of 66 
patients with limb injuries complicated by would infection with 
the help of the Yav-1 device under optimum operating conditions 
is discussed in detail. The patients were divided into two 
groups: 49 injured and 17 control patients. The irradiation 
duration varied within 30-60 min, and therapy consisted of 10-15 
procedures whereby the wound or chest area (or both) were 
exposed. The electromagnetic irradiation duration must be 
sufficient for the development of adaptation reactions (AR) in 
the organism, or activation or training. The morphological and 
functional changes in the course of adaptation reactions under 
radiation, the dynamics of the organism's adaptation reactions 
under EHF therapy, and the dynamics of the organism's adaptation 
reaction changes during EHF therapy as a function of exposure 
localization are summarized. The use of adaptation reactions 
makes it possible to substantiate the selection of exposure 
duration and method and the number of treatment sessions for 
patients with limb wounds complicated by purulent infection. 
This helps to manifest the therapeutic properties of EHF 
treatment more fully. It is noted that the above method does not 
exhaust all possible millimeter wave treatment methods. Tables

  [Abstract]Studies were carried out on 
(DBAxC57Bl)F[.sub]1[/] and DBA mice exposed to radiation in 
cages placed on radionuclide-contaminated soil for 1, 7 or 14 
days in the village of Yanov; dosage of gamma rays constituted 
0.024, 0.168 and 0.336 Gy. Proliferation of T lymphocytes was 
activated with all these doses. With the two lower doses there 
was accumulation mostly of the T helper type and with the 
highest dose, of the N suppressor type. In some cases mice were 
exposed to x-rays in single doses of 0.25-1.0 Gy. Changes in 
antibody production, relative weight and cellularity of the 
thymus and spleen, T lymphocyte content of peripheral blood and 
spleen, subpopulations of T lymphocytes in the spleen, ratio of 
Lyt1[.sup]+[/]/Lyt2[.sup]+[/] cells in peripheral blood 
and spleen. Labeled monoclonal antibodies and phenotypic 
markers, immunization with ram erythrocytes, lymphocyte 
cultures, [.sup]3[/]H-thymidine uptake and other methods were 
used to test humoral immunity, hemolysin and hemagglutinin 
titers, proliferative activity of splenocytes, blast formation 
and radioactivity of samples, at different post-exposure times. 
With lower doses there was activation of some immunological 
effector functions and with higher ones they were inhibited. The 
demonstrated proliferation of lymphoid cells, including 
suppressors, as the dosage of ionizing radiation builds up in 
the case of prolonged exposure to low levels thereof, triggers 
autonomous control attenuating the induced increase in 
lymphocytes and inhibiting effector manifestations of immunity. 
More precise interpretation of immunological responses of humans 
who had been in the zone of the Chernobyl accident or other 
contaminated regions is recommended, since use of 
immunostimulants is not only inadvisable, but even harmful in 
such cases. Figures 7, tables 2, references: 5 Russian, 4

  [Abstract]Immunological (modifications of passive 
agglutination of particles and enzyme immunoassay, agglutination 
of gelatin particles loaded with microsomal antigen, and 
radioimmunoassay of thyroid microsomal and antimicrosomal 
antibodies) and ultrasound screening (of the thyroid) methods 
were compared in a study of 6398 inhabitants of Korosten, 
Zhitomir Oblast, at the time of the Chernobyl disaster. 
Ultrasound screening revealed changes in the thyroid in 108 
cases; serum samples were taken from these and 22 subjects 
without changes for demonstration of antibodies to the 
microsomal fraction of the thyroid using immunological methods. 
There was a high degree of coincidence of diagnoses made by 
ultrasound and immunoassays, which indicates that the latter can 
be used for the said population to supplement the ultrasound 
findings. Figures 2, tables 1, references 7 Western.

  [Abstract]Experiments were carried out on rats kept in the 
10-km zone of the Chernobyl disaster (flood plain of the Pripyat 
River) for one month, exposed at dose rates of 20 mR/h. 
Radionuclides were assayed in the perfused isolated heart right 
after the exposure period and 6 months later, and findings were 
compared to control rats that were not exposed to radioactivity. 
Records were kept of heart rate, systolic, diastolic pressure, 
rate of rise and drop of pressure, and volumetric blood flow 
rate. The membrane filtration method, with [.sup]3[/] 
H-alprenol hydrochloride and propranolol 
antagonists, was used to test _b_-adrenoreceptors, with 
determination of specificity, binding sites and hormone affinity 
of the receptor. The experimental group of rats showed changes 
in amount, structural and functional properties of 
_b_-adrenoreceptors of the myocardium. Rate of contraction of 
the isolated heart and volumetric coronary flow diminished 6 
months after exposure. It can be assumed that restoration of 
_b_-receptor density after 6 months and their affinity for 
agonists is related to impaired interaction of 
_b_-adrenoreceptors and N protein. The functional state of the 
heart did not change with 30-day exposure to the contaminated 
zone, but there was alteration of mechanisms of its adrenergic 
regulation. Figures 1, tables 1, references: 10 Russian, 3

  [Abstract]This study was motivated by the chief distinction 
of of Chernobyl-related contamination from the standpoint of 
soil-plant migration of radionuclides, i.e., its spatial and 
aggregate heterogeneity. An independent statistical index of 
contamination heterogeneity was offered: the Bravais-Pearson 
coefficient of linear correlation between soil and dry plant 
biomass radioactivity for demonstration of ``hot'' particles as 
an indication of relative extent of contamination. Accumulation 
of _b_ emitter radionuclides was studied in the above-ground 
portions of rye, oats, barley, wheat and peas raised in 
1.5-liter containers with sod-podzolic soil taken in the 10-km 
zone of the Chernobyl disaster, as well as effects of soil 
micromycetes (Cladosporium cladosporioides and Penicillium 
rosco-purpurent) cultivated in Czapek's liquid mineral medium on 
dissolution of hot particles. Cesium-137 and Cerium-144 
radionuclides were absorbed at variable rates by the plants, 
depending on stage of growth. The rates were higher when in 
subsequent planted specimens, mainly in rye and oats, affected 
by their precursors. Experimental data on radionuclide migration 
were obtained with the use of this index, and its usefulness was 
validated. Figures 2, tables 2, references: 8 Russian, 2 Western.

  [Abstract]Studies were carried out in order to demonstrate 
a set of disturbances on the cellular, molecular, biochemical 
and whole organism levels after exposure to the disaster zone, 
as well as enhanced sensitivity to subsequent acute irradiation. 
Experiments were carried out on (CBAxC57Bl)F[.sub]1[/] mice 
in cages with wire mesh on all four sides and HeLa cell 
(carcinoma of the human cervix) cultures in plastic vials placed 
(in a roofed area) directly on contaminated soil for 1-12 days, 
as well as control animals and cultures kept in a clean area, 
with the same climate, beyond the 30-km zone of the disaster 
area. Cytogenetic studies were carried out to determine HeLa 
survival rate, number of micronuclear and giant HeLa cells, 
which revealed that there was enhanced sensitivity of the cells 
to subsequent acute irradiation, demonstrable for 12-15 
generations or more after exposure in the disaster zone, and it 
is a function of doses of chronic and acute radiation. Genetic 
studies were made of bone marrow somatic cells of experimental 
animals and revealed the most appreciable changes in number of 
aberrations per cell, and in chromosome type of aberrations, as 
well as lesions to bone marrow stem cells, disintegration of 
thymus chromatin indicative of interphase death, and decrease in 
peripheral blood leukocytes. Figures 1, tables 8, references: 15

Yanovo, on the border of the "brown forest" in the zone of the 
Chernobyl disaster. Feed and water were brought in from 
Chernobyl, with a control group of intact mice in clean zones. 
Exposure time ranged from 1 to 14 days, and dose rate was 100 
mR/h, after which experimental and control animals were taken to 
Moscow and exposed to acute radiation in doses of 3.0, 5.0, 7.0 
and 9.0 Gy, at a dose rate of 2.32 Gy/min,after 2, 7 and 30 
days. Effects were evaluated using the 
_k_[.sup]2[/]statistical criterion of reliability. Figures 
illustrate comparative survival rates of control and 
experimental animals as a function of time after acute 
irradiation. Radiosensitivity to subsequent acute exposure was 
modified in animals exposed to radiation in the disaster zone, 
the direction and intensity of this effect were a function of 
interval between exposure in this zone and acute irradiation. It 
is suggested that there are additional factors in the disaster 
zone that are involved in altering animal sensitivity to 
subsequent exposure to radiation. Figures 10, tables 1.

Abortions: The Transplantation of Human Embryonal Tissues: 
TKnow-howU and EthicsS, under the rubric: RWhatUs New in 
MedicineS] 
  [Text] An International Institute of Biological Medicine 
[MIBM] has been created at the Russian Scientific Research 
Center of Perinatology, Obstetrics, and Gynecology. 
Investigations and treatment of patients suffering, as commonly 
believed, from incurable and fatal illnesses, e.g., Down 
syndrome, diabetes, ParkinsonUs disease, AlzheimerUs disease, 
and many others, including various immune system deficiency 
syndromes, will treated in it. Doctor of Medical Sciences, 
Professor Gennadiy Sukhikh, who has become its General Director, 
has headed the Institute. The transplantation of human embryonal 
tissues is the method of treatment of so extensive spectrum of 
diseases. 
  The first studies in this sphere appeared as far back as the 
1920s, and moreover, in the USSR, recounted Chairman of the 
Council of the MIBM, Dr. Michael Molnar, an American of 
Hungarian extraction. But due to the exceptionally powerful 
anti-abortion movement in the US and Western Europe, 
governmental support of research projects, including the use of 
human fetal tissues, is so restricted that the progress achieved 
by Western medicine in this field is very slight for practical 
purposes. As a result, the development of new treatment 
technologies along these lines has not been noted. Russia is a 
different business.S 
  Russia is in fact a different business. Abortions had 
already 
been permitted in the Soviet Union for several decades, and 
until the present, have unfortunately remained the main method 
for the regulation of the birth rate; this is supported by the 
existing public health system. About four million abortions are 
carried out annually within the walls of medical establishments, 
and presumably as many criminal abortions. Thus, the resources 
of human embryonal tissues which are intended for use in the 
MIBM are comparable only with the reserves of oil and gas. 
  At first there were funds, and facilities, equipment, and 
personnel as well. The Russian Scientific Research Center of 
Perinatology, Obstetrics, and Gynecology of the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Health and the Biocellular Research 
Organization, Ltd. (USA) created the Russian joint-stock 
company, RMIBMS, officially registered in Russia. The charter 
fund was distributed in the following manner: Biocellular 
Research Organization, Ltd. - 51 per cent; Center - 49 per cent. 
Such a distribution of contributions will undoubted be 
reflected, sooner or later, in the economic policy of the MIBM 
and the level of interference in its affairs of the Russian 
Ministry of Health. 
  The Center of Perinatology, Obstetrics, and Gynecology is a 
recognized leader in the country in this field, and it has been 
entrusted with the development of medical indications and 
technologies for the interruption of pregnancy at various points 
of the gestation period. It has been decided that the Department 
of Human Reproduction will supply the MIBM with the necessary 
quantity of embryonal tissues and carry on medical research and 
the treatment of patients. 
  The obligations of the Biocellular Research Organization 
include the equipping of the laboratory for the isolation and 
preparation of the fetal tissues for the purpose of their 
subsequent transplantation. 
  Leading specialists of Russia, Europe, and the USA form the 
medical personnel of the MIBM. A Scientific Consultation Council 
has been formed, consisting of 15 major scholars of various 
fields of medicine, the overwhelming majority of whom are 
members of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. An agreement 
has been reached with the Russian GovernmentUs Medical Center 
regarding the use of its facilities. Thus, there is no doubt 
that the Institute's development will not encounter serious 
impediments, regardless of the contentions and objections of 
ethicists, legal scholars, and the church. Is this for good or 
ill? The dispute has already heated up. The German magazine, Die 
Stern declared the following in its article on the work of the 
MIBM: In the majority of countries the use of fetal cells for 
these purposes is generally prohibited out of the considerations 
of elementary ethics. And those scientific centers which conduct 
research along these lines utilize individual embryos... which 
the obtain after the decision of competent commissions, with 
observation of all ethical norms and with the full and voluntary 
consent of the women. Moreover, the German journalists accused 
MIBM specialists of using five-month fetuses. 
  The Director of the Russian Scientific Research Center 
[RNITs], Vladimir Kulakov, has been compelled to justify himself 
and to prove that only nonviable embryos, weighing up to 500 g, 
the results either of spontaneous abortions or medical 
abortions, have been used for medical purposes. Such 
manipulations with embryos that have not reached the 
half-kilogram boundary do not contradict either Russian law or 
the international system of calculating infant mortality. 
Previously this valuable biological material was simply liable 
to be thrown out. 
  The Russian Ministry of Health has granted the Institute the 
right of expert review in the field of transplantation of human 
fetal tissues. The new technology has also obtained in the RF 
governmentUs Department of Medicine. 
  The mechanism of treatment has not yet been studied 
completely. Nevertheless, there already are available, in the 
words of MIBM researchers, statistics and clinical data that 
indicate the high degree of effectiveness of preparations of 
embryonal tissues. 
  We have at our disposal Tknow-howU which enables us both to 
store and to prepare tissues for transplantation, says Gennadiy 
Sukhikh. They are reduced to pharmaceutical form (something like 
a jelly) and are placed in test-tubes, from which the material 
for injection is taken. 
  We obtain liver, pancreatic, brain, kidney tissue... Up to 
27 
types of tissues are used. Special preservative solutions are 
added. 
  Preliminarily we carry out histological, biochemical, and 
virological analyses. Testing for the presence of hepatitides, 
HIV infection, and syphilis is obligatory. The list of analyses 
will be expanded continually. 
  RA preparation from a specific types of tissues or their 
combination is administered to a patient, depending upon his 
illness. 
  RWhat is the percent of useful outcome out of the total 
volume of tissue you obtain?S 
  RI thinks 10-15 percent. But, taking the effectiveness of 
the 
preparations into account, that is not so low. For the treatment 
of burns, for example, there is enough tissue from one fetus; 
three to four fetuses may be required for the treatment of 
female infertility, when there is the possibility of 
compensating the ovaries. 
  How many first-class fetuses does the Institute need in 
a year? 
  About 500 abortions are required. There already is an 
agreement with several of the capital's regional antenatal 
clinics. When the system will be organized and the women 
recognize that the abortion can be done at the highest medical 
level, without detriment to reproductive function, the problem 
of supplying the Institute will be solved. However, at first we 
expect some shortage. 
  Physicians throughout the word are struggling to reduce 
the number of abortions, while today it seems that you are 
interested in increasing their number. Isn't this amoral? 
The number of abortions in the world and here in Russia will 
decrease. This is inevitable. And our interest infetal tissue 
will hardly affect the statistics. Moreover, humanity will never 
entirely relinquish abortions. 
  Do you not fear criticism of your activities? 
  What we are doing of course destroys many moral stereotypes. 
But we are physicians, and thus, rationalists. 
  Aren't you in danger of the fact that commercialization 
of this type of treatment may lead to moral catastrophe, or even 
to crimes? 
  Human embryonal tissues will never be the object of 
commerce, 
since this field has always been under the professional control 
of the health protection system. That means that nowhere and to 
no one should the thought occur that abortions could at some 
time become an object from which material benefit is extracted, 
if medical science discovers an opportunity for the use of human 
embryonal tissues in treatment technologies. 
  All of our pediatric patients will be hospitalized together 
with their parents in the pediatric unit of the Central Clinical 
Hospital of the Russian Government's Medical Center. Adult 
patients will undergo treatment in the corresponding departments 
of the Central Clinical Hospital [TKB], which, from the point of 
view of its material and technical level, is equipped and 
staffed in accordance with the standards of the US and the 
countries of Western Europe. 
  RI would like to note that the WHO has been familiar with 
our 
project since the beginning of its existence, follows its 
development, collaborates with us at present, and intends to 
preserve it in the future. When the methodology will be 
definitively developed and standardized, the WHO may recognize 
the MIBM as a collaborative center.

  [Abstract] The high incidence of iron deficiency anemia 
which, according to WHO, affects 84-90% of women in some 
parts 
of the world, and the lack of data on the assimilability and 
side effects of iron preparations prompted the Scientific Center 
of Regional Nutrition Problems at the USSR Academy of Medical 
Sciences to develop a new lactic product--Zhiger--with a 
specific antianemic effect. It is prepared on the basis of cow's 
milk with a special serum lactis or whey, vitamins, 
trace elements (Fe and Cu), and other biologically active 
components. The product has good organoleptic indicators and 
contains 2.5-2.7 g of protein, 2.4-2.6 g of fat, and 3.6 g of 
carbohydrates per 100 ml. Clinical tests of the new preparation 
were carried out at the Alma-Ata oblast hospital on anemic 
patients and patients diagnosed with chronic gastritis. The 
behavior of the hemoglobin, erythrocyte, color index, serous 
iron, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (SOE) in the blood 
before and after treatment with Zhiger, the behavior of certain 
hemopoietic indicators in anemic patients against the backdrop 
of gastritis before and after treatment with Zhiger, and the 
behavior of certain hemopoietic indicators in anemic patients 
before and after therapy (control group) are summarized. The 
findings demonstrate that Zhiger leads to a verifiable change in 
the hematologic indicators when used on patients with anemia of 
first degree. In patients with anemia of second degree, 
treatment resulted in positive blood indicator dynamics. Tables

  [Abstract] The issue of blepharospastic blindness, usually 
as a result of battlefield wounds, is addressed, and the 
shortcomings of known methods of cupping off this phenomenon are 
noted. The use of soft contact lenses (MKL) first introduced in 
the 1960s and their therapeutic properties, i.e., the ability of 
creating favorable conditions for the recovery of regenerative 
processes and protecting the damaged eye from infection as well 
as retaining the drugs in damaged tissues for a longer time, is 
considered. The outcome of eye burn treatment using soft contact 
lenses at various burn gravities, the visual results of eye 
burns after treatment using soft contact lenses, and the 
anatomical outcome of eye burns after treatment using soft 
contact lenses are summarized. The conclusion is drawn that soft 
contact lenses may be quite effective in correcting 
blepharospastic blindness and removing or alleviating the 
corneal syndrome and may be recommended for use in ophthalmic 
therapeutic films. Tables 3.

  [Abstract] Comprehensive uses of the Zaporozhye reservoir 
accompanied by a heavy man-caused burden due to agroindustrial 
agglomeration increase the urgency of the task of assessing the 
ecosystem's capability of assimilating the ingress of 
contaminants and determining the level of their environmentally 
permissible concentrations. In particular emphasis must be 
placed on assessing the constantly increasing intake of heavy 
metals which accompany man-caused pollution due to their 
mutagenic, teratogenic, and toxic effects. A formula for 
calculating the environmentally permissible or critical 
concentration of the contaminating elements is derived, and the 
year-to-year dynamics of heavy metals in the Zaporozhye 
reservoir, their Clark values, and concentration in the 
water-soluble fraction, the year-to-year dynamics of bottom 
sediment contamination in the Zaporozhye reservoir with heavy 
metals and their Clark values, and concentration in the 
water-soluble fraction, and a calculation of the ecologically 
permissible copper concentration and assimilation capacity of 
the Zaporozhye reservoir ecosystem for Cu are summarized. The 
analytical critical Cu concentration of 9.0 g/l is lower 
than 
the commonly accepted MPC in the fishery industry (10.0). The 
findings show that the Zaporozhye reservoir ecosystem is at the 
limit of its ability to assimilate man-caused copper 
contamination. Tables 3; references 35.

  [Abstract] The high bioindicator potential plant life in 
studies of the impact of radioactive water contamination after 
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident (1986-1991) prompted 
a broad range of research into the plant phytocenoses in the 
Kiev reservoir. To this end, the character of changes in the 
Kiev reservoir surface vegetation under the effect of acute 
radionuclide contamination and accumulation levels of the 
principal radionuclides in the vegetation mass were 
investigated. In so doing, overgrown areas were assessed by the 
aerovisual method, and the structure of the most important 
vegetation systems was studied by the transect method using data 
obtained by large-scale aerial photography survey of the Kiev 
reservoir vegetation in 1983, i.e., three years before the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident, as a frame of reference. 
The study reveals considerable changes which have occurred since 
the accident and which cannot be attributed to multiyear 
vegetation successions or the characteristics of the 
hydrological conditions during this period. In particular, the 
ecological areal of plants of the Potamogeton genus 
has shrunken considerably, probably due to its low radiation 
resistance and high [.sup]137[/]Cs and [.sup]90[/]Sr 
accumulation ability. The conclusion is drawn that large tracts 
of aeroaquatic vegetation play an unequal role with respect to 
the ingress of radionuclides into the bottom sediments and water 
depth, depending on their structural characteristics. By mowing 
vegetation and changing the level conditions one can alter the 
correlations between different types of aquatic plants and thus 
develop an optimum method by which the vegetation systems affect 
the radiation environment in a certain reservoir section as a 
function of the contamination character. Figures 7; references 6.

  [Abstract] Failure to implement numerous suggestions to use 
biological entities, including mollusks, for assessing the 
man-caused contamination of the environment, became an impetus 
for describing the pattern of the Dnepr river basin area 
contamination with [.sup]90[/]Sr of the Chernobyl origin 
plotted on the basis of _b_-radioactivity measurements taken in 
fresh water mollusk shells. The study is based on a collection 
of 630 mollusk samples most of which were taken in 1990-1991 
from rivers in the Dnepr basin. Mostly fresh water mollusk of 
the Viviparus, Contectiana, Lymnaea s.str., Planorbarius, 
Unio, Anodonta, Colletopterum, and Dreissena 
genera were selected for the radiometry study, and 
Succinea, Bradybaena, Cepaea, and Helix 
land snails were used for comparison. A correction for natural 
activity of [.sup]40[/]K was made. The background 
_b_-radioactivity of mollusk shells from the collection 
gathered 
before the start of nuclear tests in the atmosphere and water 
was close to 50 Bq/kg due to 40K while more than 90% 
of _b_-activity in the shells collected in the Chernobyl 
fallout 
pattern can be attributed to [.sup]90[/]Sr. This is evident 
from the energy characteristics of the _b_-particle flux, a 
good 
correlation between the specific activity of shells from [.sup]90[/] 
Sr contaminated terrain or water, and differences 
in the _b_- and _g_-activity ratios in fallout patterns with 
different radionuclide compositions. On the other hand, the 
mollusks' individual variability and taxonomy differences make 
only a slight contribution to the spread of experimental data. 
The conclusion is drawn that snail and mollusk shells are a 
convenient biological indicator of man-caused contamination and 
water quality and should be used extensively in areas with 
operating nuclear power plants and other installations. It is 
noted, however, that the Kursk, Smolensk, Khmelnitskiy, Rovno, 
and Zaporozhye nuclear power plants are not causing detectable 
river contamination at this time. Figures 5; references 8: 5

  [Abstract] The ability of heavy metal ions--the most common 
contaminants in the hydrosphere which cause numerous reactions 
in natural ecosystems at the cell and population level, e.g., 
the development of morphological anomalies in cyanobacteria and 
algae--to serve as environmental condition indicators and thus 
help resolve the issue of the mechanisms of heavy metal ions' 
impact on cyanobacteria and the character of their primary 
contact with cells prompted a study of the cyanobacteria 
sensitivity to the toxic effect of zinc sulfide. To this end, 
the Anabaena variabilis Kuetz strain CALU 787 from 
the collection of the St. Petersburg Biological Institute was 
examined due to this genus proliferation in stagnant water. The 
culture was grown in liquid medium No. 1 in 50 ml bulbs at a 
25C temperature with round-the-clock light at a 2,000 lx 
medium level. The experiment procedure is outlined. The data 
reveal three types of zinc ion impact on the culture growth: 
stimulated growth for 5 days (at 0.001 ml/g or 0.1 MPC), a 
prolonged lag phase after which the growth rate is the same as 
in the control group (at 0.01 ml/g or 1.0 MPC), and a drop in 
the cell density, especially in the steady-state growth phase 
(at 0.02-0.2 ml/g or 2-20 MPC). Both the growth inhibition and 
stimulation were equally treated as undesirable phenomena since 
any deviation from natural productivity is quite dangerous for 
aquatic ecosystems. The A. variabilis cell population 
behavior under various concentrations of zinc ions is plotted. 
The results confirm the A. variabilis high 
sensitivity to Zn ions. At zinc ion concentrations above 5.0 
MPC, intensive trichome fragmentation, morphological anomalies, 
and irreversible ultrastructural defects of the photosynthesis 
apparatus were observed. A 20 MPC concentration is lethal for 
A. variabilis. It is speculated that the 
morphological anomalies under some experimental conditions are 
not caused by the specific effect of zinc ions, and may be used 
as bioindicators of the habitat. Figures 2; references 9: 8

  [Abstract] Radioecological studies of the Kiev reservoir's 
littoral zone conducted both before (1979-1986) and after 
(1986-1991) the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident are 
reviewed, and the importance of the littoral areas due to the 
development of a many aquatic plants and invertebrates is 
stressed. A comparison of the radionuclide accumulation levels 
and parameters in the littoral component would make it possible 
realistically to assess the impact of radiative contamination, 
understand the radionuclide dynamics in abiotic and biotic 
components, and identify the radionuclide accumulation traits in 
hydrobionts at various trophic levels under the conditions of 
global and accident-related radioactive contamination of plain 
reservoirs. The study methods and materials and sampling 
procedures are outlined. The radionuclide concentration was 
measured by radiochemistry and _g_-spectrometry methods using 
an 
instrument consisting of a DGDK-40A detector, a system of Vektor 
input modules, and AI-4096-A90 amplitude analyzer. The 
concentration of long-lived radionuclides ([.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]137 
[/] 
Cs) in the ecosystem components in 1979, the 
accumulation coefficients, contribution, and ratio of long-lived 
radionuclides in the ecosystem components in 1979, the 
contribution of [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]134[/] 
Cs+[.sup]137[/]Cs to the total radioactivity 
of ecosystem components in 1986-1991, and the radionuclide 
accumulation coefficients in the ecosystem components in May-Jun 
86 are summarized. The study shows that the radionuclide 
concentration dynamics are due to the washing out of radioactive 
elements from the 30 km zone around the nuclear plant and depend 
on the complex hydrological and hydrochemical processes in the 
estuary of the Pripyat river and littoral zone. Since 1987, 
strontium made a dominant contribution to the radionuclide 
content in the water and mollusks while cesium has been detected 
in fish since mid-1986 and in higher aquatic plants--since 1988.

  [Abstract] The widening gap between the rates at which new 
contaminants appear the maximum permissible concentrations (PDK) 
are developed for them and the impossibility of reliably 
extrapolating the experimental observation data to natural 
reservoirs made MPCs irrelevant in today's toxicology studies 
and called for conducting environmental research at the 
biocenosis level. Thus, only standards and forecasts developed 
on the basis of studies of natural biocenosis under natural 
conditions may be regarded as reliable, especially since the 
man-caused factor has become a customary event in such research. 
As a result, methods are proposed of establishing MPCs not from 
test-tube data but for the specific ecosystem and the pollution 
sources which affect it. The proposed system of biological 
analysis and monitoring methods was refined in large bodies of 
water with a powerful current system, i.e., Ladoga, Onega, and 
Baykal lakes. A block diagram of such biological analysis under 
complex hydrological conditions is cited, and the contaminated 
flow ecosystem dynamics are plotted. The systemic approach used 
is divided into three phases. The biological analysis system's 
concluding stages involve setting the standards for the 
man-caused burden and establishing monitoring and prediction 
methods for use in the most severe cases, i.e., large bodies of

reservoirs with a less complicated hydrological conditions while 
maintaining the principal analysis premises. Figures 2;
