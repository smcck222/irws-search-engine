  [Text] A Transafrique Boeing 737 aircraft which carried 
food aid for Caritas, an aid organization, met with a major 
accident on the landing strip at the airport of M'banza Congo, 
the capital of Zaire Province, yesterday. Vivaldo Prata, the 
Voz da Resistencia do Galo Negro correspondent in the area, 
reports: 
  [Begin Prata recording] The Boeing 737 aircraft had come 
from 
Luanda. At about 1430 [1330 GMT] yesterday, as it tried to land 
at M'banza Congo [words indistinct] that was carrying people 
[words indistinct]. [end recording] 
  That air crash resulted in seven people killed and a number 
of others suffered serious injuries. The aircraft (?hit) a 
truck carrying people to attend a funeral. It is thought that a 
lack of (?maintenance) [words indistinct] before leaving Luanda 
may have been the main cause of the accident [words indistinct] 
the M'banza Congo landing strip (?has the necessary conditions) 
for aircraft to land and take off. What is more, a Transafrique 
Hercules C-130 aircraft was able to land at M'banza Congo 
without any problems only a few hours later. 
  [Begin Prata recording] Meanwhile, also yesterday [words 
indistinct] normal landing [passage indistinct]. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Plan and Economy Minister Augustin </F>
Ngirabatware by Eugene Lambene in Libreville on 27 April -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Ngirabatware] I brought a message from the 
president of the Republic, which I delivered yesterday, and I am 
going on to another African country. However, I am not on an 
African tour. This is not a media campaign because we do not 
have the time yet to undertake such actions. It is absolutely 
necessary for us to explain some issues concerning the political 
and military situation in our country. The Rwandan Patriotic 
Front's [RPF] media campaign and that of its acolytes is such 
that -- if I can say so -- the world has received information 
solely from the RPF which, we know, is often full of lies. Our 
experiences gained since the beginning of the war in October 
1990 can testify to this. 
  [Lambene] What is your government saying about the 
massacres? 
  [Ngirabatware] The RPF is directly and indirectly 
responsible 
for these massacres. Undeniably, the RPF -- probably with 
external support -- assassinated President Habyarimana. All the 
other massacres that followed in Rwanda and the ethnic troubles 
originated from the assassination of the president of the 
Republic. A private radio in Rwanda had mentioned the 
assassination plot earlier and people (?argued) that the 
president knew very well that he was being trailed and that he 
was running the risk of falling victim to a very fatal 
assassination plot. The only difference is that he never knew 
whether it was going to happen on the road, in his house, in the 
office, or in the air. At any rate, people never thought of it 
happening in an aircraft, especially as Kigali International 
Airport and its suburbs were under the control of the Belgian 
contingents of the UN peacekeeping force. 
  [Lambene] Investigations are going on. Are there any facts 
so far to establish which side is responsible? 
  [Ngirabatware] Up until now, the Rwandan Government has not 
accused any side. However, many factors can be put together to 
establish that the RPF, with the support of others, is 
responsible for this assassination. 
  [Lambene] Which supporters, for example? 
  [Ngirabatware] We cannot mention them just like that, but 
what we do know is that the RPF's military equipment does not 
include SAM-7 missiles which were used in killing the president 
of the Republic. We also know that the RPF does not have 
specialists who can handle such missiles and we have noticed 
that on the battlefield even white soldiers were counted among 
the dead. So, there is other external support apart from the 
usual support from Uganda. Certainly, the RPF has other 
supporters, probably mercenaries or supporters from other 
circles. 
  [Lambene] Presently, the massacres are continuing in the 
field and unfortunately enough, they will continue further. The 
problem is, it is easy to enter a civil war but it is very 
difficult to get out of it. What steps have you taken to get 
out of it? 
  [Ngirabatware] Getting out of this civil war in Rwanda will 
be a complex issue. We are saying this because, now, the 
civilians are clearly behind the soldiers, behind the Rwandan 
Armed Forces. This means that, even if a great number of 
civilians are armed with cut and thrust weapons and with modern 
weapons, the ultimate goal of this provisional government is to 
get out of this conflict. The first objective of the present 
transitional government headed by Prime Minister (Jean Kambanda) 
is to renegotiate with the RPF to which he has offered a 
cease-fire. Second, we want to bring peace to the country 
because there is fire on almost all the hills of Rwanda. We 
adhere entirely to the Arusha peace agreements even if there are 
still imperfections in this agreement. Nevertheless, we believe 
that it is only through negotiation and peace that lasting peace 
can be achieved in Rwanda. We are also telling the RPF to cease 
fire first and to let us sit around the same negotiating table 
so that we can talk about peace again in Rwanda, especially as 
the government is convinced that the RPF cannot take power in 
Rwanda by the force of arms. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by L. Elias] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 28 SAPA -- Voting in 
KwaZulu/Natal has been extended to midnight on Friday, the 
Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] said early on Thursday. 
  A decision was taken at a Joint Operations Committee meeting 
on Wednesday afternoon that polling stations remain open through 
the night on Thursday and up to midnight on Friday if they have 
the necessary ballot forms, Inkatha Freedom Party stickers and 
if there were voters still in the queue. 
  The IEC has also asked the National Peace Secretariat [NPS] 
to help with the election due to the problems experienced by the 
IEC on Tuesday and Wednesday, NPS Chairman Dr Antonie Gildenhuys 
said. 
  The decision to extend the elections followed a number of 
serious failures in effectively operating some of the 9,000 
polling stations. The failures led to the Inkatha Freedom Party 
on Wednesday threatening to withdraw from the elections. 
  The second day of general voting, hastily declared a public 
holiday, will determine the fate of the election. It will be 
decisive in the question of whether or not the election period 
should be extended. 
  IEC promises that polling stations would remain open for as 
long as queues determined the need were largely not fulfilled 
late on Wednesday night as long suffering voters had the doors 
shut on them at many locations. 
  Simultaneously, IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johan Kriegler once 
more expressed his confidence that matters would improve. 
  But the serious failure of the polling machinery, 
particularly in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] 
area, has cast a shadow on the election outcome. Observers 
expressed doubts of sufficient improvement. 
  The worst performances of polling stations were in areas 
where the IFP has its strongest potential support: 
KwaZulu/Natal and the PWV. 
  Talks between the IFP, the IEC and Home Affairs Minister 
Danie Schutte led to a special operations centre being set up in 
Ulundi to sort out election problems as they crop up while a 
special plane and two SA National Defence Force Puma helicopters 
would be put at the disposal of election officials in the region 
for logistical purposes, Home Affairs Department spokesman Niel 
Dubois said after the meeting on Thursday morning. 
  He said 4-million extra ballot papers, with the IFP strip 
printed and not stuck on, were being rushed to the region and 
will be at polling booths by 7AM on Thursday. 
  The moves are a result of an urgent meeting between Home 
Affairs Minister Danie Schutte and IFP leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi which was held in Ulundi early on Thursday to iron out 
voting problems experienced in KwaZulu/Natal on Wednesday. 
  Mr Justice Kriegler told the press there was little chance 
of 
an IFP withdrawal. The race was on, its horse was in, and 
withdrawing it would only result in it running last. 
  Earlier on Wednesday Mr Buthelezi said the lack of IFP 
stickers at many polling stations countrywide meant the 
elections would not be free and fair. 
  He said the IFP had never agreed to an IEC instruction to 
electoral officers that the party's name be written by voters at 
the bottom of ballot papers if stickers were in short supply. 
  About 60 per cent of rural Natal voters were illiterate, he 
pointed out. Secrecy of the ballot would be affected by the 
provision. 
  The necessity for the stickers arose when the IFP entered 
the 
electoral process at the 11th hour. 
  The first two days of voting, Tuesday and Wednesday, were 
marred by shortages or a total lack of ballot papers and other 
voting materials in many parts of the country, leading to calls 
by several political leaders for an extension of the voting 
period. 
  Pan Africanist Congress leader Mr Clarence Makwetu accused 
the IEC of inefficiency and "conniving" to rig the elections. 
He said his party might contest the freeness and fairness of 
the elections. 
  Mr Justice Kriegler said the South African Police were 
investigating the ballot paper debacle, although there was as 
yet no evidence of any crime having been committed. He admitted 
the IEC had underestimated the size of the electorate. 
  The IEC gave orders to unnamed private firms for the 
emergency printing of 9.3 million extra ballot papers, and made 
plans for private and South African Air Force aircraft to fly 
them to polling stations on Thursday. 
  State President Mr F W de Klerk said extending the voting 
period in areas where people had not had a proper opportunity to 
vote could be considered, but every effort should be made to 
avoid it. He declared Thursday a public holiday to enable 
people to vote. 
  He said he thought the IEC had made "major mistakes" in 
planning for the elections, but it was pointless to "rave" about 
those mistakes. "We must ask ourselves how we can solve these 
problems," he said. 
  Mr Justice Kriegler said if the poor performance of polling 
stations in the PWV region was repeated on Thursday, he would 
seriously consider declaring the elections in the region unfree 
and unfair. "It will not be a disaster for the whole country," 
he said. The elections in the region would be re-run within 12 
weeks. 
  However, he said he did not foresee a repeat of Wednesday's 
30 per cent failure rate in the region. 
  Millions of voters streamed to the polls on Wednesday and 
the 
IEC said about 2,000 reports of problems at polling stations had 
been received. 
  It said voting effectiveness had been 84 per cent in the 
Western Cape, 80 per cent in the Eastern Cape, 100 per cent in 
the Northern Cape, 75 per cent in Natal, 87 per cent in the 
Orange Free State, 80 per cent in the Eastern Transvaal, 75 per 
cent in the Northern Transvaal, 95 per cent in Northwest 
Province and 70 per cent in the PWV. 
  There were several bomb explosions on Wednesday and reports 
of violence at some polling stations, but no deaths were 
reported. 
  Eighteen people were seriously injured in the morning when a 
bomb exploded at Jan Smuts International Airport at Kempton 
Park, near Johannesburg, apparently the latest in a bombing 
campaign blamed on right-wing extremists opposed to democracy. 
  Bomb attacks on Sunday and Monday, including massive 
car-bombs in downtown Johannesburg and nearby Germiston, claimed 
21 lives. Thirty-one people have been arrested in connection 
with the blasts, including members of the Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement]. 
  In other incidents on Wednesday: 

  -  Two houses were damaged by an explosion near Postmasburg 
in the Northern Cape; 
  -  The National Party's [NP] offices in Newcastle, Natal, were 
damaged by a petrol bomb. Two men were arrested; 
  -  Police defused a homemade bomb set to explode against a water 
tower outside Soutpan, about 50km west of Bloemfontein; 
  -  An NP agent in Port Elizabeth, Mr George Holmes, was abducted 
by a group of men who left him stranded at Summerstrand after 
tearing up his electoral report; 
  -  An IEC vehicle transporting ballot papers to a polling 
station 
in Eldorado Park, southwest of Johannesburg, was hijacked by 
four men. It was later found by police, with many of the ballot 
papers missing; 
  -  Telephone lines were cut between Three Sisters and Victoria 
West in the Karoo, but communications in the area were restored; 
  -  Border peace committee monitors were sent to Middledrift in 
Ciskei, where IEC monitors were held hostage for a time by a mob 
angry about the non-delivery of ballot papers; 
  -  Police were called to disperse 150 angry Muslim residents who 
were prevented from voting when the Marlboro Gardens, Sandton, 
polling station closed 20 minutes before the 7PM deadline; and 
  -  Angry voters broke down the doors of a polling station in 
Mdantsane, Ciskei, when it shut after apparently running out of 
election supplies in the morning.

<F P=106> [Report by Pierre Claasen] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 28 SAPA -- The Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] has decided not to extend South 
Africa's first democratic election beyond Thursday. This was 
announced by IEC spokesman Humphrey Khoza at a Gallagher Estate, 
Midrand news conference on Thursday [28 April] morning. 
  He added that the situation on the ground would nevertheless 
be watched closely and that the decision would be continually 
re- evaluated. "On the basis of the situation on the ground we 
have no reason to think that voting will continue tomorrow," he 
said. 
  He had been informed on Thursday morning that the IEC was 
satisfied with the progress of the poll -- and that the 
extension of voting days was not considered necessary. When 
pressed on the possibility of an extension, he replied that as 
matters stood at present, he foresaw no such possibility.

<F P=106> [News conference by IEC Chairman Johann Kriegler in </F>
Johannesburg with correspondents at IEC headquarters at the 
Gallagher Estate, Midrand; conference moderated by the IEC's 
Pieter Cronje--live, broadcast in progress] 
  [Text] [Kriegler]... the Cape, the [Orange] Free State, 
North West -- I am proud and pleased to say in the PWV 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] everything is under 
control, voting ID going well, we are reasonably satisfied that 
all prospective voters will be able to cast their votes in those 
areas, if not by seven o'clock tonight, within the extended 
hours that will be allowed by the presiding officers at any 
voting stations where there are still people waiting. With 
regard to the Eastern Transvaal, overall the picture is good; in 
KwaMahlangu there was a problem that has been resolved and we 
are satisfied that there also the prospective voters will be 
able to exercise their franchise by close of business tonight. 
With regard to the Northern Transvaal, the Eastern Cape, and 
KwaZulu/Natal, there are distinct problems in the erstwhile 
homeland or self-governing or independent territories namely 
Venda, Gazankulu and Lebowa in Northern Transvaal, in the 
KwaZulu part of KwaZulu/Natal and in the Transkei/Ciskei 
components of the Eastern Cape Province. 
  The IEC is satisfied that because of its difficulties in 
provisioning those areas, the voters there have not had a fair 
and free opportunity to express their view. It is therefore The 
IEC's view that extension of voting for those areas for tomorrow 
should be instituted. It is not within the power of the IEC to 
do so, and a recommendation to that effect has been made to the 
Transitional Executive Council, and via that body to the state 
president. I'm confident in the light of the strong evidence of 
substantial inadequacy of voting, that the citizens of those 
areas will be granted the opportunity. But I reiterate it's not 
within my power, nor that of the commission. 
  [Cronje] May we take the questions singly? Would you please 
introduce yourself, no supplementary at this stage until we've 
had a first round of questions. 
  [Correspondent John Baptist] Judge, I would like to ask, Mr. 
Mandela made an allegation earlier today that there had been 
massive sabotage at the polls. Could you comment on this please? 
  [Kriegler] I dealt yesterday with sabotage as one of the 
possible inferences to be drawn from the gross undersupply in 
various parts of the country of IEC material. I will not at 
this stage be prepared to express a preference form anyone of 
the inferences. It is certainly one of them. 
  [Correspondent Desmond Howell] Judge, when will counting 
start in those areas where voting ends today, and when will you 
start announcing those results? 
  [Kriegler] Counting will not start until voting has closed 
so 
that there can be no influencing of voters still voting, by 
possible leakage of count figures from counting stations. But I 
should say counting is a much more complex exercise than most 
people realize, there are many hours of reconciliation of 
returns from voting stations, from districts, from areas to be 
done, allocations to be done, and ballot boxes according to the 
particular voting district. In addition a possible volkstaat 
[homeland] concept, consideration of the debate in that respect 
necessitates a special subdivision of voting stations and there 
are many hours of work to be done long before awe get around to 
actual counting. To answer your question firmly and 
unequivocally, counting will not start, that is counting proper 
will not start until Saturday morning. 
  [Crone] Reg Nkondo, REUTERS. 
  [Nkondo] I'm Reg Nkondo from REUTERS. I just want to find 
out whether in the areas where people will be allowed to vote 
tomorrow, is there going to be a holiday or is it going to a be 
a normal working day. 
  [Kriegler] Decidedly not a holiday, maybe a happy day 
because 
it is a voting day, but not a holiday. 
  [Crone] Karin Brynard. Karin? 
  [Correspondent Karin Brynard] I am Karin Brynard, RAPPORT. 
The areas you referred to as the areas that had problems. What 
is the extent of the problems? 
  [Kriegler] It is clear that voters were not given a 
reasonable opportunity to cast their votes. In some areas for 
instance in the Northern Transvaal as many as 120 voting 
stations did not open at all until three o'clock this afternoon. 
  [Cronje] Kaiser with THE STAR, please. 
  [Correspondent Kaiser Motsumi] Mr. Justice Kriegler, Kaiser 
Motsumi from THE STAR. The fact that voting will be taking place 
in some parts of the country, are you in a position to tell us 
whether the voting will be going on for the whole day until 7 
P.M. again, of if it will be closing a little earlier tomorrow? 
  [Kriegler] The recommendation will be 7 o'clock so as not to 
confuse voters. Those have been the voting hours and it's as 
well that it remain like that. 
  [Cronje] Over there, please. 
  [Correspondent Gregory Katz] Justice Kriegler, Gregory Katz 
from the DALLAS MORNING NEWS. What will be the status of 
ballots in which there was no IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] 
sticker and presiding officers were told to hand write IFP and 
to sign the ballot themselves, and to hand write a square? Will 
those ballots be allowed or are those spoiled ballots? 
  [Kriegler] I have dealt with this a couple of times and I 
think I will have to deal with it a couple of times more. That 
is not a regular ballot, it is an irregular ballot. It does not 
comply with the letter of the law. However, it is a ballot 
which expresses unequivocally the wish of the voter. Therefore, 
although an irregular ballot, it may well be taken into account 
as an adequate expression of the voter's choice of party. Could 
I... Pieter, Pieter? 
  [Cronje] Yes, I am here, judge. 
  [Kriegler] I am terribly sorry to be rude to the media 
there. 
I simply have to -- I've got to go back to this meeting and go 
and get this extension finalized one way or another. 
  [Cronje] Can I limit it to three more questions? Will you 
take them? 
  [Kriegler] Can we take two and call it a day, please? 
  [Cronje] Fine. I have the gentleman over here and then the 
gentleman over here. 
  [Correspondent Sonny Raboch] I am Sonny Raboch, Radio 
Nigeria. Judge, the situation, well, we are getting clearer 
pictures now, but what I would like to find out -- in the event 
that there is an act for an act of Parliament, since you've said 
that IEC cannot take a decision of this nature except by an act 
of Parliament, are we expecting that the voting may be forced to 
continue as far as midnight tomorrow? 
  [Kriegler] No, no! No, if the Transitional Executive Council 
and the state president accept the IEC's recommendation, it is 
(?down more or less) to proclaim, formally to proclaim the 
amendment of the Electoral Act as a matter of detail. 
  [Correspondent Paolo Banard] Paolo Banard from [name 
indistinct] in Italy. Judge, to what extent did you liaise with 
the chief minister, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, in the past 24 hours 
to come to the recommendation that in these areas the elections 
should be extended? 
  [Kriegler] The Inkatha Freedom Party's representatives and I 
have been in contact this morning, as I have been in contact 
with the leaders of many other parties. Dr. Mzimela, cabinet 
minister of the former KwaZulu government and an IFP Central 
Committee member is sitting in the meeting to which I will ask 
your permission now to return. 
  [Cronje] Judge, thank you very much. Go well. Thank you 
ladies and gentlemen. 
  [Kriegler] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by M. Merton] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg April 27 SAPA -- The South African 
Police [SAP] are to investigate the Independent Electoral 
Commission's [IEC] ballot paper distribution system to see if it 
has been interfered with, IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann 
Kriegler said on Wednesday [27 April]. 
  The IEC has been criticised by various political parties for 
inadequate or non-existant supply of ballot papers at voting 
stations. 
  The IEC also announced at a media briefing at Gallagher 
Estates, midrand that it had started printing an additional 9.3 
million ballot papers. Mr Justice Kriegler said it was possible 
the statistics of the last census on which the initial ballot 
paper requirement had been based had been too low. 
  Mr Justice Kriegler however said "there was no evidence of 
any kind indicating a possible crime". 
  The police investigation was sparked by an inference made by 
the IEC in view of the large-scale lack of ballot papers, he 
added. 
  Another possible reason for the problem was a greater rate 
of 
urbanisation than calulated from the basis of the last census. 
Too many ballot papers were supplied to rural areas, while urban 
areas experienced shortages, he said. 
  Another reason could be that millions of black South 
Africans 
did not register under the apartheid regime, Mr Justice Kriegler 
said. 
  The supply of ballot papers was also complicated as more 
voters than expected arrived at voting stations. 
  The IEC had calculated that about 60 to 70 per cent would 
vote on Wednesday. 
  Now it seemed as if most voters had arrived at the stations 
on the first day of South Africa's all-race elections, Mr 
Justice Kriegler said. 
  Mr Justice Kriegler also declared that Thursday would be a 
public holiday. 
  Additional ballot papers were already being printed in 
Johannesburg, the Eastern Cape and at SA Defence Force [SADF] 
premises. Mr Justice Kriegler said he did not know how secure 
these premises were. The new ballots would be distributed with 
the help of the SADF, he added. 
  The new ballot papers would have the Inkatha Freedom Party's 
entry printed on them, he said. 
  About two million papers were allocated to Natal, the 
Eastern 
Cape and the [Orange] Free State. The Western Transvaal would 
receive 1.5 million papers each, the Western Cape 600,000, the 
Eastern Transvaal 700,000 and the North Western and PWV 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regions 500,000 each.

  [Excerpts] Bujumbura, 29 Apr (AFP) -- Factional fighting 
erupted overnight in Burundi's capital Bujumbura, where mortars 
and smoke bombs were fired in a northern suburb, military 
sources said Friday [29 April]. The fighting broke out as 
security forces, mainly from the minority Tutsi tribe, carried 
out an arms sweep intended to disarm civilians from the majority 
Hutu group following clashes with soldiers. It was unknown 
whether there were casualties. 
  A military spokesman said soldiers had only fired smoke 
bombs 
to encourage civilians to leave the northern suburb of Kamenge 
and the adjoining neighbourhoods of Cibitoke and Kinama. Armed 
civilians had reportedly fired mortars from the three areas 
during several weeks of clashes with soldiers. 
  Military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jean-Bosco Daradangwe 
said civilians had been "taken hostage by militiamen who wanted 
to use them as human shields." "We hope that these men will 
surrender and that we will not need to use tougher measures to 
disarm them," a government source said. [passage omitted] 
  Civilians were to have laid down their arms Thursday in the 
presence of diplomats and Interim President Sylvestre 
Ntybantunganya. But the ceremony never took place because "an 
extremist group opposed the idea," a diplomat said. The 
government then ordered the Army to disarm the hardline groups, 
the diplomat said.

  [Text] Libreville, 28 Apr (AGP-GAB/PANA) -- Official 
sources in Libreville have disclosed that on 26 April, there was 
a technical reshuffle of the cabinet formed by Prime Minister 
Casimir Oye-Mba on 25 March. The reshuffle follows the 
resignation of Jean-Pierre Bagnena, leader of the opposition 
Gabonese Socialist Party, and Jean-Francois Ntoutoume Emane, 
member of parliament of the ruling Gabonese Democratic Party. 
  Mr. Bagnena refused the post of secretary of state for 
health 
because he was not consulted beforehand, while Ntoutoume Emane 
refused the post of minister of state control, decentralization, 
territorial administration, and regional integration because he 
was dissatisfied with the duties and functions assigned to his 
department. 
  The resignation of the two ministers brings the number of 
cabinet ministers down from 38 to 36. The presidential decree 
which announced the technical reshuffle also stated that the 
state secretariat for health has been scrapped. Furthermore, 
the decree stated that Pierre Nziengui Mabilat, minister of 
small- and medium- scale enterprises, has been named interim 
minister of state control, decentralization, territorial 
administration, and regional integration.

  [Excerpts] Nairobi, April 28 (AFP) -- Fighting raged in 
Rwanda on Thursday [28 April] as a cholera epidemic threatened 
the central African nation swamped in ethnic bloodletting and 
relief officials launched impassioned pleas for aid. More than 
40 orphans, half of them seriously wounded and some with arms or 
legs hacked off, were flown to Italy on Thursday after being 
rescued from an orphanage by aid workers. 
  The headquarters of the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front in the 
capital Kigali came under intermittent mortar and artillery fire 
Thursday. But the exchanges were shorter and less intense than 
on Wednesday, said a UN spokesman speaking by telephone from the 
capital Kigali. 
  The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) meanwhile warned 
that cholera was likely to sweep Kigali, strewn with rotting 
bodies, some half eaten by dogs. Much of the capital is without 
water and the situation in the rest of the country is equally 
catastrophic, UNICEF's Peter McDermott said. "I'm sure there 
are already cases of cholera," McDermott told AFP on his return 
from Kigali on Thursday. He said fighting had prevented medical 
teams from assessing needs. 
  Two tonnes of chlorine flown in by UNICEF were stuck in a 
warehouse at the airport which was hit by a shell Wednesday, 
though 40 tonnes of food and emergency supplies have been partly 
distributed to needy civilians, McDermott said. 
  Relief agencies meanwhile launched impassioned pleas for 
international aid for Rwanda, where the UN has slashed its 
peacekeeping force from 2,500 to 270 because it feared for their 
safety. [passage omitted] 
  "Half the population urgently need help," said Philippe 
Gaillard, the Red Cross chief in Kigali. Rwanda's population is 
estimated at seven million. Gaillard said that before the 
fighting, a million Rwandans displaced by the three-year civil 
war already depended on food aid. Another million have fled 
their homes since April 6, he said. "The international 
community must not forget Rwanda, even if it has to be concerned 
with Gorazde and South Africa too," Gaillard said. "It's the 
heart of darkness in Rwanda," Red Cross spokesman Tony Burgener 
said. 
  Unable to work safely in Kigali, aid agencies are organising 
relief operations from border towns in neighbouring Uganda, 
Zaire, Burundi and Tanzania. 
  They bring in food and medicine, and evacuate casualties. 
  Red Cross workers went to the north-eastern town of Gisenyi 
on Thursday to see 350 orphans who may also need to be evacuated 
to Zaire. 
  In Kigali, for the first time in two weeks the Red Cross was 
able to get 13 wounded people to hospital without being harassed 
at the numerous roadblocks manned by militiamen, soldiers or 
rebel guerrillas. 
  The Red Cross had stopped evacuating casualties after 
militiamen murdered six wounded people being driven to hospital 
in a Red Cross vehicle two weeks ago.

  [Excerpts] Nairobi, 28 Apr (AFP) -- Rwandan Government 
forces shelled rebel positions from the Kigali airport Friday 
[29 April] amid exchanges of small arms fire around the capital, 
which is littered with corpses and threatened by cholera, a 
United Nations official said. UN troops and Rwandan gendarmes 
meanwhile guarded a hotel where 300 Rwandan civilians holed up 
after pro-government militiamen threatened to butcher them, 
Abdul Kabia, executive director of the UN Assistance Mission in 
Rwanda (UNAMIR), told AFP by telephone from Kigali. [passage 
omitted] 
  "Last night was very quiet, but shooting started this 
morning, with heavy mortar fire coming from the direction of the 
airport where government forces have set up their heavy 
weapons," Kabia said. "There was no return of the mortar fire, 
but there were small arms exchanges between the two sides around 
town," he said. "There is still no breakthrough on the political 
front." A unilateral ceasefire declared by the rebel Rwanda 
Patriotic Front from Monday collapsed almost immediately. Kabia 
said the UN had received no response from either side to 
ceasefire proposals which it put forward this week. 
  "Kigali is like a ghost town," he said. Many civilians have 
fled the embattled city, some for rebel-held territory to the 
north and others for neighbouring countries. Those left are 
desperately short of food as stockpiles of maize and beans were 
looted when fighting erupted three weeks ago. Water and 
electricity have been cut. Piles of unburied, rotting corpses on 
the streets raised fears of a cholera epidemic. The mostly 
Tutsi rebels seemed locked in a stalemate with militiamen and 
government soldiers mainly from the majority Hutu tribe. 
"Neither side seems able to gain the upper hand," said an aid 
worker, also contacted by telephone in Kigali. "It's hell here."

<F P=106> [Report by Chris Lewis] </F>
  [Excerpts] You're listening to Swiss Radio International. 
This is Red Cross Review. [passage omitted]. We begin this 
month's program with Rwanda where the death of President Juvenal 
Habyarimana in a suspicious plane crash has plunged the country 
into an inferno of ethnic and political violence. Aid workers 
say several hundred thousand people have been killed. Hospital 
patients have been murdered en masse and more than a million 
people have been driven from their homes. [passage omitted] 
  Since then things have if anything got worse. Attempts to 
organize a cease-fire have collapsed. The slaughter of 
civilians has continued unabated and aid workers, including the 
ICRC have been forced to withdraw from much of the country. The 
ICRC continues to operate in Kigali but at a reduced level and 
is taking steps to launch cross border relief operations from 
Uganda and Tanzania. Aid convoys continue to reach Kigali but 
officials say they are now very limited in the extent to which 
they can help the victims of the violence. [passage omitted] 
  Under the current circumstances there is only so much the 
ICRC can do. It has set up its own medical facilities and some 
700 patients are now being treated there and at Kigali central 
hospital. But armed militia men have not hesitated to stop 
delegates taking people to hospital. In fact delegates were 
forced to stop doing so after six wounded were dragged from an 
ICRC vehicle and shot in front of their eyes. Others have been 
murdered within minutes of leaving hospital. Even encouraging 
people to gather together for treatment or shelter in itself 
exposes them to the risk of wholesale massacre. 
  And delegates themselves are unlikely to feel any safer 
since 
the UN's decision to withdraw peacekeeping troops earlier this 
month. [Passage omitted]

  [Text] We just received a report from one of our 
correspondents on the plenary session at the Palais du Peuple 
where the High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament 
[HCR-TP] was supposed to submit a report on its activities since 
the expiration of the 19 April deadline. The results were 
eagerly awaited by the Zairian people this afternoon. In 
accordance with Parliament regulations, the deliberations should 
have and could have immediately begun. However, when the 
members filled the conference room, and after the bureau was 
installed, about 20 members of the Sacred Union of the Radical 
Opposition [USOR] moved in to prevent the session from starting 
by whistling, booing, chanting and singing. 
  Up to 1830, the members of the HCR-PT bureau were unable to 
utter one word. They could not even announce the points on the 
agenda or begin the session. Some HCR-PT members left the room 
discouraged but some were there until 1930. The Tele-Zaire team 
was prevented from filming because their flashbulbs were broken. 
After the bulbs were replaced, the team was able to film some 
images which we will show you as soon as possible.

search for peace for Angola. Our correspondent Manuel da 
Conceicao reports. 
  [Begin Conceicao recording] The negotiating teams from the 
government and UNITA continued to work today without the 
presence of the mediator. It seems as if the government and 
UNITA want to end differences on the point under discussion. 
Thus, an agreement on whether or not to review electoral law is 
expected to be reached in the next few days. Tomorrow, the 
negotiating teams from the government and UNITA will continue to 
discuss the revision of the electoral law. Mediator Alioune

Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] continue to discuss peace in Lusaka 
under UN mediation. Reports from the Zambian capital yesterday 
said the two sides have finally agreed to review the Electoral 
Law. 
  Independent sources have described that move as a 
qualitative 
step forward in the thorny Lusaka talks marathon. Meanwhile, UN 
sources have said that there are not too many differences 
concerning the points under discussion and that a plenary 
meeting should be called soon. 
  The UNITA and MPLA-PT delegations have been discussing since 
22 April the specific principles and modalities that will govern 
the implementation of the electoral process. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Edmundo Galiza Matos] </F>
  [Text] As usual, UN Special Representative Dr. Aldo Ajello 
granted his Friday news conference in Maputo today and he 
announced that the Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] will 
meet on 3 May to try to find realistic solutions to various 
problems in the Mozambican pacification process. Aldo Ajello 
noted that the CSC meeting will try to set deadlines for closing 
down government and Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] 
assembly areas as well as for winding up the demobilization 
process. 
  The UN special representative in Mozambique made it clear 
that he would like to see the whole process concluded in July, 
even though he agrees that could be done in June as proposed by 
the National Elections Commission, CNE, chairman. The electoral 
census is supposed to begin in June. 
  At another point in his news conference, the head of the UN 
Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] said he was very happy with 
President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano's pronouncements in 
his provincial tours, but he called for there to be consistency 
between words and deeds. He also disclosed that the Renamo 
demobilization process is making progress and he added that a 
list has been delivered containing more than 1,000 names of men 
supposed to go back to civilian life. That process is scheduled 
to begin today and be over by 6 May, and Renamo is supposed to 
demobilize 4,000 of its soldiers. 
  Meanwhile, 4,345 government and Renamo soldiers and officers 
are undergoing training in Manica, Boane, Dondo, Nacala, and 
Catembe. The UN special representative in Mozambique also 
disclosed that $8.163 [figure as heard] million is already in 
the hands of Unomoz. That money will be used to help Renamo 
become a political party. It is expected that a further $5.173 
million will be given Renamo for that purpose, in addition to 
funds which may also be allocated by the U.S. and French 
Governments. 
  The head of Unomoz also said that $2.006 million will be 
placed with the trust fund [preceding two words in English] for 
other political parties. He explained that it will be up to 
Unomoz to manage those funds. He also disclosed that the UN 
Security Council has sent a list of five international judges to 
be part of the Electoral Court. Those judges will come from 
France, Brazil, Nicaragua, Chile, and Portugal.

  [Text] Serious concern is developing over the delay in 
carrying out the confirmation hearing of Mrs. Dorothy Musuleng 
Cooper, the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] nominee 
to the post of foreign minister to the LNTG [Liberian National 
Transitional Government]. Mrs. Cooper should have been 
confirmed this week along with two other NPFL nominees who have 
already been confirmed and inducted into office for the 
portfolios of information and agriculture. Although TLA 
[Transitional Legislative Assembly] Speaker Morris Dukuly, has 
said he is awaiting instruction from the State Council before 
carrying out Madame Cooper's confirmation hearing, the statement 
runs contrary to the prerogatives of the various parties to 
present their nominees for the confirmation as already done by 
the NPFL. 
  NPFL leader, Mr. Charles Gankay Taylor, has made it 
expressly 
clear that the Transitional State Council has no hiring or 
dismissing power over any of the nominees of the various 
factions. Mrs. Cooper, the first woman to be appointed to the 
Foreign Ministry portfolio in Liberia, was recently nominated to 
the post by NPFL in place of Mr. Momolu Sirleaf after a 
contention from IGNU [Interim Government of National Unity] over 
the suitability of Mr. Sirleaf for the job. 
  A delay in carrying out Mrs. Cooper's confirmation 
represents 
a flagrant abuse of the conciliatory move by the NPFL to have 
Mr. Momolu Sirleaf replaced for the post of foreign affairs, 
considering that none of the various factions to the Liberian 
Council is under a binding obligation of so doing to the seat of 
another party to the Council. The delay tactic is another 
bizarre attempt by the Monrovia group to stall the transitional 
process leading to the holding of free and fair general and 
presidential elections and restoration of lasting peace to 
Liberia. The NPFL has vowed not to give in to any ploy that 
will cause any further delay in the peace process. Liberian 
women are also arguing that the delay in conducting confirmation 
hearings of Madame Cooper is a manifestation of prejudice 
against Liberian women who have distinguished themselves as 
capable of assuming high office in the country. 
  News just in says the NPFL is taken aback by the delay in a 
peace process, endangered by a Council of State negotiated for 
and subsequently sworn in to accelerate the process of peace in 
this country. The Council of State, in effect, has no authority 
whatsoever to appoint ministers or heads of public corporations 
and autonomous agencies. This is the exclusive domain of the 
negotiating parties after the Cotonou Agreement. According to 
an NPFL release, the chairman of the State Council is merely 
first among equals. As such, the NPFL is therefore disturbed 
that it is assuming the role of superstar, making decisions even 
when only two of five council members are present. This is 
totally unacceptable, according to the NPFL. Such a drift from 
the Cotonou Agreement can only lead to a total breakdown of the 
process, according to the NPFL statement. The NPFL leadership 
then urged all peaceloving Liberians and the international 
community at large to do whatever they can to make sure that 
this Transitional Government is finally and totally seated and 
functions.

  [Text] Lagos, 27 Apr (AFP) -- The human rights 
organization, Campaign for Democracy [CD], today ordered the 
Nigerian Government to put an end to the serious fuel shortage 
affecting the country by 29 April, otherwise it will call on the 
people to drive away the ruling "clique." "We want to state 
clearly and unequivocally that if the fuel crisis is not 
resolved by 29 April, by those who orchestrated it, the CD will 
call on the Nigerian people to go into the streets to drive the 
Abacha clique away," CD pointed out in a communique signed by 
its Secretary General Sylvester Odion-Akhaine, a copy of which 
was sent to AFP. 
  Furthermore, CD, a collective of some 40 student and human 
rights organizations, described the government's 26 April 
ultimatum to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation [NNPC] 
as "hypocritical," given that "the fraud perpetrated within the 
NNPC is orchestrated by government officials," the communique 
stressed. The government has given a seven-day ultimatum to the 
NNPC to restore fuel supply in the country. Nigeria is 
currently facing one of the most serious fuel shortages in many 
years and a chaotic situation is prevailing in the country. The 
CD communique called on the country to get ready for "a great 
confrontation...because the decisive moment has come."

  [Text] The director general in the Department of Defense, 
Retired Major (Sheku Kande), has told SLENA [SIERRA LEONE NEWS 
AGENCY] in an interview that the rebels have lost all their 
command and capability and are now in disarray. In a 
wide-ranging interview, Maj. (Sheku Kande), noted that the 
situation on the ground is now of high expectations and that 
government troops are now deployed in all strategic sectors in 
the country. He said their dispositions have increased 
tremendously and a rapid buildup has been implemented with the 
ability to conduct search-and-destroy missions. He disclosed 
that the principal aim of the rebels is to terrorize the 
civilian population by burning down villages and killing 
innocent and defenseless men, women, and children. 
  The director general noted that the Army has an answer to 
what he called the tactic-to-rule and strategic [word 
indistinct] and that a new concept has been developed which will 
soon be implemented. He expressed the belief that all 
peaceloving Sierra Leoneans will definitely be proud of the 
performance of the Armed Forces. Maj. (Kande) noted that the 
successful implementation of the NPRC [Provisional National 
Revolutionary Council] plan will finally see the end of the 
rebel war and added that government troops should continue to 
maintain the rhythm of their advances which will force the 
rebels to surrender. He said that there is every indication 
that the situation in Suri, Makali, and the Bo-Kenema highway 
has improved tremendously and stressed that we should however 
remember that we are [words indistinct] fighting a war against 
the most reckless and unpredictable enemy in the subregion. 
  Maj. (Kande) said we are not taking any chances and that 
every effort is being made to maintain security throughout the 
country. He urged all to report suspicious movements of people 
to the authorities as vigilance should be the country's 
watchword. In what he called a message of hope to both 
civilians and soldiers, Maj. (Kande) assured them of 
government's total commitment to ending the rebel war in the 
shortest possible time to ensure a new lease of life for all. 
He said the NPRC government counts on their loyalty and [word 
indistinct] and urged them to become watchdogs for the 
administration so that the principles on which the April 29 
revolution was born will continue to be implemented for national 
development. He later paid tribute to those who have lost their 
lives in the defense of Sierra Leone.

  [Text] The head of state, General Gnassingbe Eyadema, this 
morning received Rwandan Planning Minister Augustin 
Ngirabatware, who was accompanied by his Togolese counterpart, 
Yandja Yentchabre. After the audience, the Rwandan emissary told 
the media that he bore a message from Rwandan Interim President 
Theodore Sindikubwabo to Togolese President General Gnassingbe 
Eyadema on the current political and military situation in 
Rwanda. 
  [Begin recording] [Ngirabatware] I have just been received 
by 
President Eyadema to whom I delivered a message from the Rwandan 
president. Our discussions centered on the current political 
and military situation in Rwanda. On 1 October 1990, Rwanda was 
attacked from Uganda by an army composed of Rwandan refugees. 
We later negotiated a cease-fire with them and signed the 
Arusha peace agreements. On 6 April, President Habyarimana and 
his Burundi counterpart were killed in a plane crash by the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and its supporters. Since then, 
the country has been in flames and the transitional government, 
which was formed in accordance with the Rwandan Constitution, is 
doing everything to stop the interethnic conflict. 
  The Rwandan Government's second ultimate objective is to 
sign 
a cease-fire agreement with the RPF as it is convinced that the 
RPF can never seize power in Rwanda. The people do not support 
it. The Rwandan Government is convinced that all sons and 
daughters of Rwanda, both Hutus and Tutsis, must live together 
on the national territory in peace. This is the subject of the 
message I delivered to the president. I also answered President 
Eyadema's questions on the possible restoration of peace in 
Rwanda. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] On the military situation, what 
exactly is happening in your country? 
  [Ngirabatware] The military situation is very, very 
difficult 
to describe because of the RPF's method of fighting. The 
situation is really difficult to describe but on the whole the 
Rwandan Armed Forces are in the process of controlling the city 
of Kigali. RPF soldiers are scattered in pockets around Kigali 
but according to the latest information, it is time for mopping 
up operations. The RPF has made slight advances from the 
Ugandan border to the southeastern part of the country where the 
fighting is going on but the Rwandan Armed Forces are very alert. 
  [Correspondent] On the diplomatic level, taking current 
initiatives into account, is there any hope for the rapid 
restoration of peace in your country? 
  [Ngirabatware] Concerning hope, I, personally, am always 
optimistic. Even if the recent interethnic conflicts in Rwanda 
have scared me, I am, by nature, optimistic and I nourish the 
hope that Rwanda can overcome this crisis. 
  On the diplomatic level, the Rwandan Government appeals to 
all powers, both African and Western, to convince the RPF that 
the cease-fire is an obligation and a necessity, because the RPF 
does not care if human beings continue to die. Taking Rwanda's 
political structure into account the RPF cannot, in any way, 
seize power in Rwanda. The RPF is in the minority, but it is a 
strong minority, a minority that the Hutu majority in Rwanda 
must absolutely compose with. The two sides will certainly gain 
nothing from constant war, so the government is doing everything 
possible to ensure the implementation of a cease-fire. Of 
course, as usual, the RPF is not showing any clear desire for 
the implementation of this cease-fire but we will continue to 
demand its implementation. [end recording]

  [Text] Tanzania has denied a media report that it is paying 
little attention to Rwandan citizens being killed by government 
soldiers. An officer of the Rwandan Patriotic Front reportedly 
said that Tanzania has closed its borders with Rwanda, an act 
which he said is unlawful against innocent Rwandan civilians who 
are being killed. The story was carried by the Uganda DAILY 
ROCKET on 25 April. 
  A statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
International Cooperation said the story on Tanzania closing its 
border with Rwanda is baseless because large numbers Rwandan 
citizens cross into Tanzania's Kagera Region almost daily. On 
Tanzania's move to station troops alongside its border with 
Rwanda, the statement said the action was taken to safeguard 
Tanzanian citizens and their properties along the border. It is 
not for any other purpose, the statement added.

  [Text] The Government of Rwanda has apologized to President 
Ali Hasan Mwinyi for failing to attend the Rwanda peace talks in 
Arusha last weekend. 
  In a message delivered to President Mwinyi today by the 
Rwanda minister of communications and transport, Andre 
Ntagerura, and the Rwanda Justice Minister Agnes Ntamabyariro, 
the Government of Rwanda apologized for the failure to attend 
the meeting, citing travel difficulties in Zaire and 
misinformation as the reasons for their delegation's absence. 
They called on the president to continue his efforts to 
reconcile the warring factions in Rwanda in keeping with the 
Arusha peace accord signed last year. President Mwinyi agreed 
to call for another meeting at a date to be announced later. 
  Meanwhile, President Mwinyi held talks with the Belgium 
secretary of state for cooperation and development, Mr. Eric 
Derycke, on economic cooperation between the two countries and 
on the Government of Tanzania's efforts to resolve the political 
crisis in Rwanda.

  [Excerpt] Uganda has protested to the Rwanda Government 
over remarks made by the Rwanda Government Minister Justin 
Mugenzi on the BBC yesterday, implicating Uganda in the war in 
Rwanda. It called on the Kigali government to desist from 
making such unhelpful remarks which do not help in finding a 
solution to the tragic situation. The charge d'affaires of the 
Rwandan Embassy in Kampala, Mr. Joseph Bukeye was this morning 
summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where the minister 
of state for foreign affairs, Mr. Kirunda Kivejinja, presented 
him the protests from the Uganda Government. Mr. Kirunda 
Kivejinja told the charge d'affaires of the Rwandan Embassy that 
remarks made by Mr. Mugenzi on the BBC Focus on Africa, on the 
27th of April, that President Museveni controls the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF] and that if President Museveni directed 
the RPF, the killing taking place in Rwanda would stop, were 
baseless, irresponsible and dangerous. 
  Mr. Kirunda Kivejinja told Mr. Bukeye that the Government of 
Uganda and President Museveni have no control whatsoever on the 
RPF. He informed him that the Government of Uganda views such a 
statement coming from a senior official of the Rwandan 
Government with grave concern and finds it totally unacceptable. 
The minister drew the attention of the charge d'affaires to the 
tireless efforts that President Museveni had made in trying to 
find a lasting solution to the conflict in Rwanda. He said that 
to clear the allegation that Uganda was involved in the conflict 
in Rwanda, President Museveni has requested for a UN observer 
mission which is (?planned) to man the Uganda-Rwanda border.

  [Text] Rustenburg April 28 SAPA -- Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader 
Eugene Terreblanche said on Thursday he thought there would be 
more explosions if the government ignored the Afrikaner's claim 
to land. Speaking at a house where Transvaal Republic President 
Paul Kruger once resided outside Rustenburg in the Western 
Transvaal, Mr Terreblanche said South Africa was heading for 
revolution and war, but from this chaos would rise a "third Boer 
republic". 
  "Long live the third Boer republic which is already 
emerging!" he exclaimed in front of about 200 AWB supporters. 
The group was escorted to the venue by security forces, and 
defence force Ratel panzer vehicles lined the route. 
  About 50 armed awb members gathered around a sole black 
journalist at the rally in front of the house and racially 
abused and forcibly expelled him, fists flying in the melee. 
  Reacting to reports that some Ystergarde [Iron Guard] 
members 
had been arrested in connection with bomb blasts on the reef, Mr 
Terreblanche said that while AWB executive had not given 
instructions for the placement of bombs, he would never turn his 
back on the suspects and would support them in court. 
  Speaking on the stoep of the house while his followers 
sought 
shade beneath thorn trees, Mr Terreblanche made a vow, asking 
God to protect his nation and saying: "The struggle our fathers 
have started will continue until we died or won." 
  Once the Zulu nation had lost the elections and then 
realised 
they were "the biggest nation" in South Africa, the "hell and 
terror will go on where it left off a day or two ago". 
  Afrikaners would not be crushed in this struggle, but would 
emerge as the third, civilised, stronger force. From next week 
the awb would resist the radical black communist government 
"whom we know are trying to destroy us". 
  AWB spokesman Fred Rundle called on the media at the rally 
not to perpetuate the "farce" of there being free and fair 
elections.

<F P=106> [Address by Afrikaner Volksfront leader Dr. Ferdi </F>
Hartzenberg at flag-raising ceremony at Donkerhoek, Pretoria, on 
26 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] Honorable Mr. Chairman, honorable Rev. Sarel 
Cilliers, and honorable fellow countrymen. Tonight we stand at 
the same point where our people stood on 31 May 1902 when they 
lost their freedom after much sacrifice, much loss of life, much 
struggle, but also after much faith and deep nationalism, and 
the desire for freedom which drove them. 
  Friends, at midnight tonight, with the inauguration of the 
new constitution and the lowering of the South African flag, we 
have once again lost our freedom. According to this 
constitution, we are again a subjected people who will be 
governed by a foreign government. Friends, just as in 1902 when 
President Kruger, in exile in Switzerland, received the news 
that the war had been lost, that freedom had been lost, and with 
that message weighing down on him, he raised himself and sent 
his final message to his people. At that moment, when the 
nation was at its lowest point, he said: Build, because the 
future belongs to you. 
  Friends, President Kruger was able to utter those words 
because he firmly believed that his people and all the peoples 
of the world are ruled by the Holy Trinity, and therefore in the 
course of the century our people again got back their freedom. 
I say to you tonight, this great crowd of people gathered here 
at this early hour of the morning, I say to you that what you 
are doing here is what President Kruger did. When the flag was 
lowered, when we lost our freedom, that was the first great step 
on the road to reclaiming our freedom, when you once again 
raised our flag, and when you once again raised the flag of 
freedom. 
  Friends, that is the first step. It says to the world and to 
South Africa and to all who would listen that from this moment 
on, the desire for freedom and the struggle for freedom and the 
ideals of the Afrikaner will burn more strongly every moment, 
every day until that freedom has been regained and we are once 
again free in our own fatherland. We say today that step by 
step, bit by bit, we will reclaim our victory. We will keep 
that which rightfully belongs to us -- our schools, our 
hospitals, our local authorities. We will reclaim them until we 
once again are a truly free people with our own constitution, 
our own elections, in our own homeland, and where the Afrikaner 
nation's flag will once again flutter over us. 
  Friends, the Afrikaner nation is in the vanguard, carrying 
the freedom flame, because we know that after this election, and 
in the months ahead, nationalism and ethnicity will once again 
flare up, as is happening at this moment in Namibia/South-West 
Africa. There, six peoples are in the process of breaking away 
from the unitary state and from the subjection. They are in the 
process of restoring their kingdoms, claiming their 
self-determination and their land. Some of them, like the 
Basters, are already headed for the World Court. That 
nationalism is reawakening and breaking down the unitary state. 
  Here in South Africa, friends, the Afrikaner is in the 
vanguard. We are not going to wait for 3 or 4 years before 
stepping onto the road to freedom. We are beginning right at 
this moment, with our feet firmly on that road. Because we have 
our feet on that road, and because we have refused to sign our 
freedom away and because we have refused to allow others to 
decide on our future, thereby lowering ourselves to the level of 
advisers on our own future, because we refused to sign away that 
freedom, our hands are clean and we can demand the right of a 
free people in our own fatherland with a clean conscience 
[applause]. 
  Friends, we did not sign for a subordinate position, and 
that 
is why I believe that the Afrikaner nation, through what it has 
done until tonight, and what it will do henceforth is not only 
going to be in the interest of our people; it will not only 
bring our people's freedom; and that freedom which we are 
striving for, friends, is not a freedom at the expense of 
others. We have no desire to rule over another nation. Absent 
too, however, is the possibility that another nation can rule 
over us and we accept it without putting up a fight. Because 
friends, we cannot be made slaves, because as freely as the 
eagle flies, such is the flight of our spirit, because the 
spaces of this country have fed our spirit. 
  And that is why, friends, I believe that what we are in the 
process of doing now, the road we have chosen, the successes 
which we are going to achieve, they will also be to the 
advantage of other nations, because the precedent that we have 
set, they too can reap good from it. 
  But friends, it will not only benefit our nation and the 
people of South Africa, but it will also benefit all the nations 
in the world who are peace-loving and who want to be free, 
because world communism, which does not only want to dominate 
South Africa alone, which says that once this system has been 
established here -- which is their objective -- then they will 
stir up the impoverished southern world against the rich north 
to strike the final blow in subjecting the world to a communist 
government. 
  And that is why I believe that what we are doing is right. 
We believe it is divinely arranged -- that nations have to be 
free, that their places of abode and eras have been 
predetermined. And that is why we know it will be in the 
interest of the rest of the world. 
  But friends, it will also -- at the highest level -- be to 
the honor of the Holy Trinity whose name we will always profess 
so that the anti-Christ will be destroyed. This befits a 
Christian nation. And friends, I want to tell you tonight: We 
are entering the process of trials and tribulations; we are 
entering an era during which we will be tested, and this is 
already evident. We have always trusted people, we have always 
trusted other nations. But tonight the Afrikaner nation is 
standing alone before God, where it belongs. That is where we 
belong. For that reason, friends, I want to tell you tonight, 
in our history there has never been a power, another nation, no 
one who came to our nation's rescue. We only had one refuge, 
and each time we turned to that refuge, to the King of Kings. 
When we turned to Him, our nation rose again out of the depths 
and was placed on the highest levels. And that is why I say to 
you tonight, we are again standing there -- before our God. 
And friends, I want to ask you tonight, do we not find 
ourselves tonight in the most privileged position? While we 
were in the depths of darkness during the last decade, we knew 
where our salvation was. Once more we again know before whom we 
must bow. Now we know we may not place our trust in the world, 
in horses, in military vehicles and worldly forces. We must 
trust in God, the three in one. And friends, is a nation not at 
its pinnacle when it bows before its God when times are bad? 
That is where we are standing tonight. And that is why we have 
no doubts in the future. That is why we know, because the master 
of the world, because He is in control. We know there is a 
future. That is why we can tell each other tonight: Rise. 
Walk on the big road of South Africa. Build, because the future 
is ours. 
  Friends, let it be so, that this hour becomes the biggest 
hour in our history. Because in the hour that we were 
subjected, the nation turned to God; and in that hour the nation 
found the power, the will and the endurance to get up and act, 
and it attained its freedom. Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Report by Amanda Vermeulen] </F>
  [Text] The bombing campaign in SA has highlighted the 
growing rift in right-wing circles, with Freedom Front [FF] 
officials now openly criticising the militant far right. 
  Any members of right-wing organisations which might be 
involved in bombing soft targets and killing civilians were sick 
and cowardly, Hoopstad Freedom Front chairman and SADF [South 
African Defense Force] Sergeant-Major Obie du Plessis said this 
week. "I call them Klipdrift [liquor brand] soldiers -- they 
get drunk and then go around trying to be soldiers. They are 
fighting a war of cowards and we are not sympathetic to their 
cause. It is wrong to kill innocent people." 
  Du Plessis, a member of the SADF's special services, was 
instrumental in organising eight mobile polling stations to 
visit rural areas where farmers had refused to provide transport 
to polling stations for their workers. He denied farmers in the 
Hoopstad, Wesselbron and Bultfontein districts had been 
intimidating farm labourers, but claimed that Freedom Front 
supporters were being threatened by extreme right-wingers. 
  Du Plessis said he and Freedom Front leader Gen Constand 
Viljoen had received death threats. Businessmen in the area 
were being threatened with boycotts if they voted for the party. 
"We are accused of being traitors -- of betraying the volk 
[Afrikaner people]. But they pose no real threat. These 
right-wingers are hopeless and stupid. All they do is play 
soldier games. The Freedom Front knows what real war is, which 
is why we are negotiating, not fighting for a volkstaat 
[Afrikaner homeland]." 
  Du Plessis, a farmer himself, believed the Front had the 
support of 90 percent of the farmers in the Hoopstad district. 
However, many had recently resigned from the party, not wanting 
to be seen to be supporting the organisation publicly, following 
threats from CP [Conservative Party] and other right-wing 
organisations' supporters. 
  Du Plessis, who said he would not serve in the SADF under a 
black government, doubted whether there would be an uprising of 
farmers against a black-led government. However, he said 
attempts by the new government to disarm the farmers, most of 
whom fought in the Angolan and Namibian campaigns, could trigger 
a "10 or 20-year-long civil war that would make the war in 
Bosnia look insignificant. We would not fight a guerrilla war. 
After all those years of fighting against the ANC and the 
communists precisely because they fought a terrorist war, how 
could we turn around and do the same thing? No -- we are 
gentlemen and we would never resort to terror tactics."

  [Text] Zimbabwe and South Africa have established 
diplomatic relations at ambassadorial level. The two countries 
have for many years been represented at trade mission level. 
Zimbabwean Foreign AFfairs Minister Nathan Shamuyarira said the 
basis of the new diplomacy was South Africa's interim 
constitution which came into effect earlier this week. The new 
relations come into affect today.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  `Power' in Process of Democracy -- "Closely scrutinised, 
this 
incredible week has delivered enough faults and failings to fill 
an encyclopeadia. But there are times that close scrutiny is 
misleading, and this is one of them," begins the Johannesburg 
THE STAR in English on 29 April in a page-10 editorial. "The 
big picture is majestic," contends the editorial. "South 
Africans rose to the occasion in dignity and, on the whole, in 
remarkable peace." New problems and situations await the new 
South Africa, concludes THE STAR, but "if we have not yet found 
the answers to all the issues of the future, we have found the 
way to face them. This week we have seen and experienced -- and 
felt -- the power of the process of democracy." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Electoral Irregularities Viewed -- "It is unfortunate, 
though 
not altogether surprising, that the main feature of the 
election, apart from the actual voting, is the huge number of 
alleged irregularities, many of which are serious," begins the 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 29 April in a page-8 
editorial. The task of declaring the election free and fair now 
awaits the Independent Electoral Commission, IEC, and "those who 
carp at the supposed anomaly of the IEC judging its own 
performance should best be quiet. Anyone who thought this a bad 
idea should have said so months ago when the politicians set out 
the IEC's terms of reference." In order to declare the 
elections free and fair the IEC has "to satisfy itself that the 
numerous irregularities have been sufficiently evenly spread, so 
that no party has been substantially disadvantaged. The last 
thing we need is a major party rejecting the outcome because of 
legitimate grievances." A heavy responsibility awaits Judge 
Kriegler in making his decision on the elections, and "no one 
will envy him this responsibility." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Absence of Voting Intimidation -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in 
English on 29 April in a page-8 editorial is "proud of the total 
absence of intimidation" during the voting period across the 
country. "What seems evident is South Africans have become 
mature after the terrible changes in our lives lately. All that 
remains is that our people will accept the results with 
similarly responsible discipline." 
  People To Demand `Immediate Satisfaction' From New 
Government 
-- A second editorial on the same page warns that "people will 
demand immediate satisfaction from a new government after the 
elections. It will be impossible to satisfy all expectations as 
apartheid has left large sectors of our country in an 
overwhelming mess." "A new Government must be seen to act with 
vigour. The planning and clearing of areas for housing must be 
in evidence. The plans to proceed with putting up houses for 
millions of homeless people can then be developed in stages." 
<H8>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H8>
  Buthelezi, IEC `Incompetence' -- "The pattern is the same 
all 
over: the force of numbers and the strength of individuals 
overcoming the problems of the elections," notes Johannesburg 
WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English for 29 Apr-5 May. There was 
"calm" and "little violence" and "the inevitable conclusion is 
that the election can still work -- despite the IEC. There is 
no point in mincing words about that organisation. Despite 
hundreds of millions of rands, lavish salaries and massive 
popular support, they have messed it up through sheer 
incompetence. It has been a gravy train without wheels." The 
IEC "failed at its most basic logistical task: getting ballot 
papers to the polling stations." "When it became apparent that 
things were going wrong, Mr Justice J. Kriegler chose to fluff 
the details, covering the extent of the problem. He was cocky 
and super-confident, in defiance of the facts being put before 
him. He was dismissive of the media -- the link between himself 
and the public he so badly needs on his side -- and made little 
attempt to rally support behind him. It was a mistake." 
"Luckily, everyone has been leaning over backwards to make sure 
the election works -- with the sole exception of Chief 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi." "He disrupts the election preparation as 
much as possible, then he complains that it does not run 
smoothly. He should not be allowed to get away with it. Sadly, 
IEC incompetence has given him more ground than he should have." 
<H8>  NEW NATION </H8>
  Buthelezi `Exploits' IEC `Incompetence' -- Johannesburg NEW 
NATION in English on 29 April in its page-16 editorial cautions 
that "all is not won yet and the struggle to secure the election 
faces serious threats." The threats came mainly from Inkatha 
and the Pan- Africanist Congress (PAC), "each warning of the 
lack of freeness and fairness in the elections." The paper 
questions Buthelezi's "supposed commitment to transition through 
elections. He has punctuated virtually everyone of his comments 
by warning that the freeness and fairness of the election was 
being threatened -- by the incompetence of the Independent 
Electoral Commission (IEC), intimidation from the ANC and 
bombings by his old rightwing partners in the tattered Freedom 
Alliance." "It was Buthelezi's intractable attitude to 
negotiations and disdain for the reasonable principle of 
majority rule that must take a large part of the blame for the 
problems faced by the poll." KwaZulu was one of the areas most 
affected by the IEC's "shortcomings" but "this was not because 
of the IEC's incompetence but because of Inkatha's bellicose and 
sometimes violent resistance to the commission preparing these 
areas for the elections." Therefore, Buthelezi "must not be 
allowed to exploit the incompetence of the IEC, or the problems 
experienced in the management of these elections to delay the 
outcome of the poll. While it is his right to challenge the 
freeness and fairness of the elections, he must not be allowed 
to prevent the IEC from announcing a result soon."

closed and that voting is very slow at others. Several stations 
are expected to close before 7 PM this evening. Meanwhile, the 
Independent Electoral Commission has said that virtually nobody 
has turned up at some polling stations in Ciskei. Earlier this 
afternoon it was reported that there were problems in Transkei 
and that only 19 of the 52 polling stations in the (Indutiwa) 
district were opened. 
  Officials in the (Umgamakwe) district are apparently still 
waiting for ballot papers. However, voting is reported to be 
brisk in areas in Transkei where ballot papers have been 
delivered. Latest reports in Zululand indicate that voting is 
still continuing peacefully and very few voters are still 
waiting to cast their ballots. The first tally counts from 
counting stations across the country will be released tomorrow 
noon at the earliest. IEC commissioners said at Gallagher 
Estate, Midrand, that the counting of votes would begin at 7AM 
tomorrow morning, all being well. 
  IEC Commissioner Ron Gould said that ballots would be 
counted 
in batches of about 3,000. Before counting began, however, 
ballot papers would have to be sorted and spoilt ballots put to 
one side. Provincial and national ballots would be counted at 
the same time. Tally counts would be broadcast by the SABC 
[South African Broadcasting Corporation] as soon as they are 
made available. 
  The chairman of the IEC, Mr. Justice Johann Kriegler, says 
the election has been an outstanding success despite logistical 
hitches in some areas. Judge Kriegler and Commissioner Ron 
Gould appealed to the public to be patient while waiting for 
results as counting would be complicated by emergency decisions 
taken during the electoral process. Mr. Gould said that most of 
IEC officials doing the counting had never counted ballots 
before and that they were being trained to cope with unusual 
circumstances such as ballots with no IFP stickers on them.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 29 SAPA -- The counting procedure 
of votes cast in South Africa's first all inclusive elecion will 
be time consuming because it needs to be done carefully, 
Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] Chairman Mr Justice 
Johann Kriegler said on Friday [29 April]. He appealed to the 
public to be patient as counting would be done meticulously. 
  This time-consuming process, which was also affected by the 
breakdown of election administration in some areas, would 
obviously affect the next two phases of the election procedure. 
"This means, in a nutshell, that you (voters) must be patient," 
he said. 
  The next two phases are vote counting and announcing the 
election results, Mr Justice Kriegler said. 
  IEC international Commissioner Brian Gould explained the 
counting procedure in more detail. 
  Ballot boxes from about 9,000 voting stations will be sent 
to 
approximately 700 counting stations. Counting would not start 
until voting taking place on Friday in six areas was completed. 
  Mr Gould said the second phase of the election process would 
be the reconciliation of ballots in which counting officers open 
ballot boxes to balance the number of votes in the box from 
particular voting stations with the number issued at those 
stations. 
  "We expect that in some cases the numbers will not 
balance... 
we are not running a fast food operation here," he said, adding 
some problems could not be anticipated. 
  Mr Gould said reconciliation could "be bogged down" and take 
a day or more if there were many disputed ballots or other 
problems. 
  After reconciliation, the ballot boxes would be resealed 
until the actual counting started. Mr Gould added some 
reconciliation may take place on Friday. 
  During the counting, votes would be placed in piles 
according 
to the political party voted for. 
  A separate pile would be made for disputed votes. Counting 
officials in conjunction with political parties would decide on 
whether a ballot was disputed. 
  Mr Gould said four counting procedures would take place at 
the same time. Two for provincial ballots and two for national 
ones. 
  Counting results would be relayed by fax to the IEC's 
operations room in central Johanesburg. From there the 
provisional tallies would be made available to the media at the 
IEC's nerve centre at Gallagher Estate, Midrand, he said. 
  Mr gould said the first provisional results could be 
expected 
around noon on Saturday. 
  He did not want to commit himself to an earlier time as 
there 
might be unexpected problems. 
  He said unexperienced staff would count the ballots and 
might 
need time to familiarise themselves with the procedure. 
  "We have no idea whatsoever how this will flow," Mr Gould 
added. 
  Iec International Commissioner Jurgen Elkit said the 
provisional results would be followed by the "final results 
phase". At this stage all disputes needed to be resolved. 
  Seat allocation, the last and fastest phase of the election 
procedure, would allocate seats in the national assembly and the 
various provincial legislatures. 
  Seat allocation would not be influenced by the number of 
voters, even if more voters than the IEC expected expected cast 
their ballot. 
  Respsoneing to a question, J Elkit said he did ot want to 
compare South African and European elections. 
  "This election is the first democratic election in a huge 
country". Europe had gradually, over centuries developed "almost 
perfect" election systems. It would be grossly unfair to make 
comparisons. 
  Mr Justice Kriegler commented on the elections, saying: 
"overall an outstanding success; not so much because of IEC 
administration." He paid tribute to the patient voters who stood 
in long queues to cast their ballot on Tuesday and Wednesday.

  [Text] Johanesburg April 28 SAPA -- Provisional results of 
South Africa's first all-race election could be available as 
early as Saturday [30 April] afternoon. An Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] spokesman told SAPA unofficial 
results from the smaller counting stations could be available on 
Saturday afternoon. 
  Other results, including the national poll, would follow, 
but 
he could not say when. 
  The IEC initially said it would take 26 hours to certify the 
elections. Legally a period of ten days is allowed. 
  The IEC announced earlier on Thursday that counting at the 
800 stations countrywide would only start at 6AM on Saturday. 
  IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler said counting would 
be delayed because an additional day of voting in KwaZulu/Natal, 
Northern Transvaal and Eastern Cape, where voters were unable to 
cast a free and fair vote, had been recommended. 
  The commission spokesman was unable to say when the election 
would be certified. 
  All disputes needed to be resolved before the commission 
could certify the elections substantially free and fair or 
otherwise, he said.

<F P=106> [Address by ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa; place and </F>
date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] We wish to put it on record that the ANC has 
received extensive reports of violations of the electoral laws, 
electoral regulations, and the Code of Conduct in some parts of 
the province of KwaZulu-Natal. We are filing with the IEC 
[Independent Electoral Commission] a detailed complaint of a 
series of such violation by the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and 
its supporters. This is particularly rife in parts of Northern 
Natal and the Midlands. A list of such incidents will be made 
available to you later, but I will refer to it. 
  Evidence at hand already indicates the following violations 
amongst others: The removal of ballot boxes from polling 
stations by IFP supporters, the transfer of IEC voting material 
to pirate polling stations established by IFP supporters, 
threats against the IEC officers as well as the expulsion of ANC 
party agents from polling stations, and the lack of secrecy in 
polling booths where voters are coerced into voting for the IFP. 
  When our people went to the polls they knew that the days of 
voting would span from 26-28 April. A large number of our 
people have turned up at the polls in a very enthusiastic manner 
and we believe that, yesterday, many of our people streamed to 
the polls and despite all the other problems that were 
experienced, were able to cast their votes. The declaration of 
the 28th as a public holiday, in our view, has enhanced the 
volumes that will also go to the polls today. The measures that 
had been taken by the IEC to make sure that voting material is 
delivered to the polling station has also enhanced the voting 
process. We do not, as a result, at this stage believe that it 
is necessary to extend voting beyond the official date. 
  The IEC is also on record as having said they are willing 
and 
prepared to extend the hours of voting, meaning that polling 
stations do not necessarily have to close at 7PM. I am able to 
say that many polling stations across the country yesterday 
closed way beyond 7PM, thus allowing many of our people to vote. 
The same should happen today, but we do not believe that it is 
necessary for the day -- or another day to be added to the days 
of voting as we believe that many people are going to vote today 
and indeed many people did vote yesterday.

<F P=106> [News conference by ANC candidate Jay Naidoo with </F>
international and domestic correspondents at ANC Headquarters in 
Johannesburg -- live] 
  [Text] [Naidoo] Thank you. The ANC wants to reiterate its 
demand that every person in South Africa must be given the right 
to vote if they want to do so. It is in this context we have 
said that certain areas of our country, particularly the 
Northern Transvaal and Eastern Cape, where because of no fault 
of the voter, many people have not been able to vote and have 
only got the ballots late this afternoon, but the voting period 
should be extended for these areas till tomorrow afternoon. We 
believe that this is important because we don't want to be seen 
to disenfranchise anyone in South Africa. We welcome the 
announcement by Judge Kriegler that the IEC is recommending the 
extension of voting in these areas, including Natal. We believe 
that there is no political party in South Africa that will want 
to deny the opportunity to any South African to participate in 
this very important and historic election. 
  We, therefore, call on our people in these areas to go to 
the 
ballot stations in their millions and cast their votes for the 
new South Africa. It is also in this context that we...[pauses] 
our president, earlier this morning, expressed deep concerns at 
the missing ballots and the IEC as we understand has now 
instructed the South African Police to investigate what has 
happened to the missing ballots and Judge Kriegler himself, both 
yesterday and today, has not ruled out the question of sabotage 
in relation to certain specified incidents. We want to also 
take this opportunity to reiterate our concern about the 
disturbing reports coming out of certain areas of Natal and 
KwaZulu, particularly those that are under control of the 
KwaZulu Police and the KwaZulu administration. 
  In these areas we reiterate that we have evidence now of 
party agents of the ANC being expelled from certain voting 
stations, in other cases of KwaZulu, administration officials 
and KwaZulu Police intimidating people into voting for the IFP, 
displaying weapons, and displaying party propaganda material, 
and in a number of incidents we have identified what we call 
pirate polling stations, polling stations not approved by the 
IEC, that are now controlled by the Inkatha Freedom Party, and 
we are appealing to the IEC, to whom we have reported these 
incidents, to take stern action against these incidents. We 
want to, however, conclude by saying that the overwhelming 
evidence has shown that the vast majority of people in South 
Africa have participated in this historic event in a remarkably 
disciplined and calm way, and we welcome that, and we believe 
that the people of our country, both black and white, are now 
united in their desire to build a new South Africa, a desire and 
a wish that the ANC itself is committed to, and one can just say 
that today and over the last two days, we've had the dark cloud 
of apartheid removed and we can now concentrate on the task of 
rebuilding our country, rebuilding our economy, and repairing 
the irreparable damage that apartheid has caused to this country 
in the past and we, therefore, as the ANC, want to call on all 
our people, from the security forces to the government officials 
in civil service, to ordinary workers and businessmen and people 
throughout the country, to come together in a joint effort to 
build a better South Africa for all of us in the future. Thank 
you. 
  [Correspondent Callie Long] Apparently the state president 
is not in favor of the possibility of an extension. Your 
reaction to this? 
  [Naidoo] We would think that this is a gross injustice. The 
fact that there would be, in our calculations between a million 
and two million people in these areas that would be denied the 
opportunity to vote. We also are concerned that because these 
are areas that historically have been supporters of the ANC and 
our struggle against apartheid, and we cannot understand why a 
political party and the state president should support any 
action that denies a South African population that has 
historically been denied the right to vote by apartheid not to 
have that right, particularly if one sees that this has been 
caused by the inefficiencies, not in the part of people who were 
there in their millions to cast their votes, but by the fact 
that there were no ballot papers or sufficient supplies to 
ensure that these people had their right to exercise their 
ballot. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] This morning ANC President 
Nelson Mandela used the word sabotage to describe some of the 
incidents that have taken place. Now that's quite a strong 
word. Does this mean the ANC is casting doubt on the freeness 
and fairness of the electoral process as a whole? 
  [Naidoo] Absolutely not. We have said that there are certain 
specified incidents that have happened, and these have not just 
been said by the ANC itself, it's been said by the judge himself 
-- Judge Kriegler of the IEC. That should not however be used 
to cast any doubt on the bone fides of the electoral process as 
a whole. What we do have alongside those specified incidents 
would have denied large numbers of people in the northern 
Transvaal, and particularly in the Ciskei and the Transkei the 
right to vote, is the fact that millions of other people in our 
country have had that right to vote, and one cannot therefore 
disqualify the election on the basis that some people may have 
used sabotage to prevent certain parts of our country's people 
participating in this election. 
  [Correspondent Neil Lewis] If an extension is granted, it 
would cast a lot of pressure on the counting process. Won't this 
affect perceptions on the ground because people are expectant? 
  [Naidoo] Well, I believe that it would cause more problems 
for us if we deny people the right to vote. That is the bottom 
line that we have to understand. The expectations of people are 
enormous, but as we saw over the last three days, those 
expectations have been understood of our people, internalized by 
our people and they have displayed the most remarkable calmness 
and discipline which no one can dispute because it's there on 
our television screens. I think that our people expect that 
their fellow countrymen and women who had been denied the right 
to vote in certain areas are given that right and they will be 
prepared to wait, as many people have said, hours or days or 
even weeks, so that those people have that right to participate 
in the transformation of this country of ours. 
  [Correspondent] What is the ANC's view of the IEC's 
performance? 
  [Naidoo] Well, we believe that the IEC has been given a 
tremendous challenge and task to complete in a very short period 
of time. They had to do it under circumstances like the late 
entry of Inkatha in a way that created complications that could 
not have been foreseen. I do believe there have been many areas 
where we could have avoided the inefficiencies we saw; and 
therefore one must accept that overall, while there have been 
obstacles, we cannot go into the future on the basis of 
complaints, we cannot go into the future saying there have been 
administrative obstacles. Therefore our task, and all of us, 
our task is to commit ourselves, to put our resources together, 
to address the problems together with the IFP, and for all of us 
to go forward to that new South Africa. I don't believe that 
one can expect that there are people who have laid complaints, 
and complaints that may have been legitimate in many 
circumstances, but now say on the basis of that, that this 
election was not free and fair. We will not accept that. 
  [Correspondent] The PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], I think 
in 
the Western Cape, has already indicated that they will not 
accept the election is free and fair until the IEC solved all 
their problems. 
  [Naidoo] I have no evidence, or the ANC has no evidence 
before hand of any of these complaints that are alleged to have 
been committed by other political parties including ourselves. 
The second thing is that it is not the PAC or any other 
political party that decides whether this election is free or 
fair. It is the Independent Electoral Commission that has been 
set up in terms of the interim constitution to decide that 
matter. For anyone to argue that there has been any substantive 
evidence of intimidation across the spectrum of our country, in 
the glare of international publicity, the fact that we have 
international journalists, international monitors, the fact that 
this election is being conducted in our living rooms through our 
television screens, with the security forces present, I think 
that type of claim is absurd, and therefore should be treated 
with the attention it deserves. So we are concerned at the ANC 
that in relation to certain areas, there had been very definite 
problems that the IEC needs to resolve, but overwhelmingly we 
believe that the election has gone well in spite of the 
administrative problems that have happened because of the IEC. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Naidoo, the chances of the ANC's call 
being heeded, that ballot boxes which have allegedly been 
tampered with be disregarded, do you think the chances are good? 
  [Naidoo] Well, we are reiterating our demand. In those 
polling stations which have not been approved by the IEC, that 
we regard as pirate polling stations, that vote must be 
completely disqualified. In relation to other problems, we 
believe that, for example, the fact that there are ballots 
without the Inkatha sticker on, that we have agreed should be 
set aside and there should be a separate process to decide what 
to do about that, in conjunction with the IEC and the political 
parties. But that is what we are asking -- the votes in those 
pirate polling stations must be definitely disqualified, and the 
IEC must now come up with the evidence that we believe they have 
of where these polling stations are, who is running these 
polling stations, and what is happening in those polling 
stations. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Naidoo, how do you intend to get this 
message across to your supporters that if the extension is 
granted, that they should go and vote, because most of these 
areas are rural where they don't have televisions, radios, and 
probably don't read the newspapers? 
  [Naidoo] We have taken a number of steps already to ensure 
that these areas are reached. We are putting enormous resources 
of our own in terms of transport and people into these rural 
areas. We do believe that the media and the SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] in particular have a responsibility to 
regularly announce that these polling stations are now open 
tomorrow, that there will be material there, and people must go 
and cast their vote. I think this requires a collective effort 
on the part of all our people and all the political parties and 
institutions in our country. 
  [Correspondent Leo Louis] Mr. Naidoo, Leo Louis from 
(Southwick). It seems the state of emergency has failed if it 
is unable to deal with the question of intimidation, or alleged 
intimidation on the part of the KwaZulu Police? 
  [Naidoo] Well, let me reiterate again, that the intimidation 
we are (?arguing) has taken place in very specific areas of 
KwaZulu-Natal. We've got a list of incidents that cover certain 
of these polling booths and we are not arguing, in this case, 
that across Natal this has happened. We are saying there are 
very specific incidents in certain polling stations where 
inspite of the agreement we've had with the South African Police 
and the South African Defense Force, that there will be no 
polling stations where the KwaZulu Police and the KwaZulu 
Administration were left alone, we have found that there were 
several polling stations where this has happened, and the bottom 
reason and the root cause of this problem is the fact that 
Inkatha and the KwaZulu Administration and the KwaZulu Police 
have been in many instances allowed to do what they want in 
these polling stations, completely disregarding the party agents 
that come from other parties and even the IEC itself. 
  [Correspondent Sefako Nyaka] Mr. Naidoo, Sefako Nyaka from 
the SABC. Apparently there is a high level delegation meeting 
going on between the ANC and the IEC at the moment. Can you 
just give an indication of what is actually being discussed, and 
whether any concrete decisions have been taken so far? 
  [Naidoo] The meeting taking place this afternoon is a 
meeting between high officials of all political parties and the 
IEC. The main issues under discussion this afternoon have been 
the extension of voting time to the areas that I've disclosed 
already where people have not had the opportunity to vote, the 
question of security and intimidation that we are arguing is 
taking place in terms of certain polling booths in KwaZulu, and 
those have been the substantive issues. And we believe that 
through that meeting we have come to some sort of agreement 
around how to address these issues. It is in the interests, we 
believe, of the whole of South Africa that the agreements that 
have already been reached in this afternoon's meeting is now 
accepted by the parties' principals, and particularly in this 
case by the National Party. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Naidoo, how are international observers 
viewing the process at the moment? Any idea? 
  [Naidoo] Yes. Well, the reports that we have seen and this 
interview that we are hearing, and the interaction we have with 
the international monitors convinces us that the majority of 
those observers in the majority of polling stations across South 
Africa accept that this has been a remarkably calm and 
disciplined election. 
  [Correspondent] What is the extent of the pirate stations 
problem? Are there four, or five, or 10 or 12? 
  [Naidoo] We are arguing that there are 10 pirate polling 
stations in operation. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Naidoo, the allegations seem to be 
focussing on Inkatha alone. Have you heard any irregularities 
reported in areas that are controlled largely by the rightwing, 
like the Western Transvaal and so forth? 
  [Naidoo] Well, there have been other incidents and we are 
recording hundreds of incidents over the period of the last few 
days. We have chosen only to highlight the most important ones, 
where the most substantive intimidation is taking place that is 
preventing, we believe, thousands and thousands of members who 
want to vote -- we are not even arguing voting for the ANC -- 
who want to just exercise their right to vote, the secret vote, 
they have been prevented from doing that, and that is only 
taking place, in our minds, in certain areas controlled by the 
KwaZulu Government. 
  [Correspondent] The voting booths in the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] will be closing at 7 o'clock, that's 
approximately in an hour's time. Will the process of 
reconciliating all those votes start? Will the ANC be assisting 
the IEC with that? 
  [Naidoo] No, we will not be. There are counters identified 
and agreed...[break in transmission] particular advantage. We 
now have substantive evidence of gross intimidation in those 
areas, use of weapons, people being assaulted, people from the 
ANC being expelled, of chiefs taking the polling booths and 
relocating them to areas that they control -- and that is what 
we have always argued, and that is why we believed [words 
indistinct] that the South African Police and the South African 
Defense Force should have been present at every polling booth, 
and that was the agreement that was made, and we cannot 
understand why it was not implemented. 
  [Correspondent] Is the ANC in a difficult position regarding 
this whole question of free and fair, because if you complain 
too much about irregularities, could that not then be used by 
those who don't regard it as being free and fair? At the same 
time, you obviously want irregularities to be addressed? 
  [Naidoo] Certainly, and it is a dilemma which we must 
accept. 
But we do believe that there are certain irregularities that we 
cannot brush under the carpet. Where someone is denied their 
fundamental right to vote, that needs to be exposed, and action 
needs to be taken against any political party that does deny any 
individual in South Africa that right to vote. That is our 
position. But arguably, we can say today, and I am sure I speak 
with the majority of people in this country, and the majority of 
even party political leaders, that we've gone through the most 
remarkably calm and disciplined transition, and that what we 
have seen is a dark cloud lifted from South Africa, and a new 
spirit emerging that is uniting black and white, rich and poor, 
young and old around a new vision of a new South Africa. Thank 
you.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the ANC on the SAPA PR Service on 28 </F>
April] 
  [Text] As we enter the third day of the first ever 
democratic elections in our country, the ANC welcomes the 
massive enthusiasm shown by the people of KwaZulu/Natal as well 
as other parts of the country, despite the logistical problems 
experienced. In this regard we appreciate efforts which have 
resulted in the voting, proceeding well in many areas in Natal. 
Areas where voting has succeeded, are only those where the SAP 
[South African Police] has provided security. 
  We have along with other parties, made concrete 
recommendations to the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] to 
help resolve these logistical problems. 
  Further, we are encouraged by the relatively peaceful way in 
which the election has unfolded -- in a province recently 
plagued by intense violence. We urge our people to use this last 
day of voting to ensure that everyone entitled to do so cast 
his/her vote. 
  However, we wish to put it on record that the ANC has 
received extensive reports of violations of the electoral laws, 
regulations and code of conduct in some parts of the province of 
KwaZulu/Natal. We are filing with the Independent Electoral 
Commission a detailed complaint of a series of such violations 
by the Inkatha Freedom Party and its supporters. This is 
particularly rife in parts of northern Natal and the Midlands. A 
list of such incidents is attached to this statement. 
  Evidence at hand already indicate the following violations, 
among others: 

  -  Removal of ballot boxes from polling stations by IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] supporters; 
  -  Transfer of IEC voting material to "pirate polling stations" 
run by supporters of the IFP; 
  -  Threats against IEC officers and expulsion of ANC party 
agents 
from polling stations; and 
  -  Lack of secrecy in polling booths where voters are coerced 
into 
voting for the IFP. 

    These problems are in the main a consequence of inadequate 
security at these polling stations -- because either the KwaZulu 
Police [KZP] is the only security force present or there are no 
security forces at all. In the main the areas where violations 
are extensive, the security is exclusively provided by the KZP. 
This matter has been raised with the law and order sub-council, 
and we have been assured that steps are being taken to correct 
the situation. 
  We urge the IEC and the security forces to take immediate 
action to restore the integrity of the electoral process in 
these parts of Natal. 
  The ANC is confident that the IEC will resolve these 
problems 
in accordance with the relevant statues, thus inspiring 
confidence in the electoral process in this province. 
  [Dated] 28 April 1994

<F P=106> [News conference by IFP spokesperson Ziba Jiyane and </F>
unidentified party official; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Jiyane] Many of the problems experienced yesterday 
are continuing today, in fact, even worse problems have been 
reported by our informants on the ground in the whole process of 
elections. Now, the most disturbing thing about this is that in 
many areas we continue to have ballots without IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party] stickers being used in the vote, and we 
understand that there is now tremendous pressure being put by 
some political parties to cause the IEC [Independent Electoral 
Commission] to accept these as valid, and we have said from the 
beginning if anything could really threaten this whole election 
process it would exactly be that -- to count ballots without IFP 
stickers. 
  Now, nonapplication of IFP stickers in many areas has 
happened even today in areas like Chatsworth, Mtubatuba, 
Newlands West, Glenhills School, Zilungisele School, Nomhlebe 
Preschool, plus more than 17 others. Voting continued in all of 
them without IFP stickers and of course late opening of the 
stations continued to be a problem today, and shortages of 
supplies was a problem today, now polling stations on the IEC 
list which have not yet been opened at all, are such as the 
eight stations around Vryheid. We were told that these will be 
remedied by Judge Kriegler yesterday, and we have seen the 
situation deteriorating today. 
  But you see, ladies and gentlemen, we are more troubled by 
the fact that of the more than 20 million missing ballot papers 
we have now more and more evidence that certain political 
parties have possession of this. We have heard reports from 
KwaMashu that people were given ballot papers with IEC stickers 
at the back, which were already marked ANC. Now this happened 
in an area called (Amatikwe). Voters were given two or three 
ballot papers for national and provincial lists. Now, we also 
have here in our possession something signed by police which has 
been distributed all over the country, of evidence of many 
ballots that were distributed, around which have the clear 
marking of the ANC votes. These have been distributed and the 
police have alerted us here and all over the country. These 
were used in PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]. 
  Now, we just received also a message here as you saw me 
entering, reading it from Gerrie Beetge, who is an informant who 
will...[pauses] from an informant will not reveal his or her 
name, told Gerrie Beetge, that last night at the Nasrec 
[National Exhibition Center] stadium -- counting 34 polling 
station ballots in Soweto, Johannesburg, people opened boxes and 
removed the IFP sticker and replaced it with others. Today 
there are no IEC officials at the stadium and the IFP banners, 
etcetera, have been ripped off. Now this happened at Nasrec 
stadium -- now, in 34 polling stations in that area. We have 
evidence that the missing ballots are in the hands of certain 
political parties, because where else would they get he ballots 
with IFP stamped at the back and giving these to people on the 
queue, who in a station near Ntuzuma were not even inked, 
because the presiding officer allowed this despite protestations 
from our party agents. 
  I was first pleased to hear that Judge Kriegler has 
indicated 
that he has raised the issue of extending the election time to 
tomorrow because if that did not happen that would be a serious 
infringement of thousands of people's right to vote. It would 
effectively disenfranchise thousands of voters, in particular, 
in northern Zululand -- in northern Natal. Now I don't know if 
my colleague here will add other...Lastly, I would like you to 
also be informed of this because the real problem, the main 
problem today is the evidence that is coming in that the missing 
ballots are actually in the hands of certain parties, and so far 
the only evidence we have is that the ANC -- because including 
this ballot paper which the police has been warning us about, 
has possession of many ballot papers. 
  Now, there is a case, a serious case here also, with an 
affidavit in front of me here, which is still being investigated 
by the police, of what happened yesterday at 7 PM, Ntuzuma 
court, where people had to guard the ballot boxes. An Isuzu was 
seen full of ballot boxes, and its registration number was 
NU136960. It looked suspicious to the people there, and the cap 
of the Isuzu was white and the back was black. People were 
afraid and they approached this vehicle because there were too 
man people in the area and many cars parked behind the bakkie 
[pickup truck]. The Isuzu van was then moved outside the gate 
of this court. Furthermore, three women arrived carrying ballot 
boxes into Ntuzuma court, without any guards and were not marked 
with IEC identification. What struck us was that this truck was 
open without a canopy and nobody was looking after the boxes. 
We then rushed to the nearest police station in order to report 
this incident. The police opened a report, OB1680. Now, this is 
a common thing now, that lastly, besides this particular case of 
Isuzu, we have received at least three reports of people saying 
that private ANC cars, in particular, have been seen carrying 
away ballot boxes to destinations not known. 
  [IFP official] At the heart of the election campaign we 
noticed a government or a ZP vehicle which was in our yard here 
and was loading posters, and there were press people taking 
photographs, and within a couple of minutes we had been alerted 
by people in Ulundi that ZP and ZG number plates had been stolen 
from government vehicles and these same number plates appeared 
suddenly at the information center and there were a lot of press 
around taking photographs of these...I'm sure quite 
legitimately, because there were large numbers of pressmen here 
all the time, but I mean obviously it's very damaging, that it 
just goes to show that this...what in fact was happening, those 
numbers were stolen and in fact they used some vehicles that 
were driven into our information center, loaded up with IFP 
stickers, in order to try and create the impression that in fact 
government and KwaZulu Police transport was being used to 
transport IFP election material, and I'm afraid propaganda put 
out by Mr. Ramaphosa today is exactly the same thing. We have 
personally checked and you are welcome to go and check. Those 
officials will categorically deny that that ever took place. 
It's just sheer propaganda. 
  [Jiyane] ANC, in particular, are panicking. The reason why 
Ramaphosa has come out with such a diatribe on national 
television is because they see the tremendous amount of support 
that the IFP seems to be getting through these votes. The long 
lines in northern Natal for example, are IFP. In fact, all that 
he has alleged are things which are done by the ANC here. The 
party agents of the IFP are being intimidated by ANC people, and 
as you will all know, the IEC staff that are mostly presiding 
officers and others, do not include IFP people, because IFP 
entered late. The people who are intimidating party agents 
there are ANC partisan officers, as well as thugs who come, like 
the thugs who came to KwaMashu to threaten old people there, but 
we are confident that the IFP, if this election has any 
semblance of freeness and fairness, the IFP will win by a wide 
margin here.

<F P=106> [Interview with IFP spokesman Dr. Ziba Jiyane in Umlazi by </F>
announcer Lester Venter in the Johannesburg studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Venter] Dr. Jiyane. 
  [Jiyane] Hello. 
  [Venter] Thanks for joining us there Dr. Jiyane. Dr. Jiyane, 
the most serious of the allegations to my mind, that is being 
put by Mr. Naidoo there is that there are 10 voting stations, 
that he calls pirate stations, and we presume by that he means 
not under control of the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission], 
but he says they are under the control of the KwaZulu Government 
and the KwaZulu Police. What do you say to that? 
  [Jiyane] I would have said most ridiculous allegation. You 
see, first of all, when would we get ballot papers to use there. 
But in any case it would be illegal. There is a state of 
emergency here. They would immediately close those down. This 
is red herring again by Jay Naidoo, who finds every opportunity 
now to desperately besmirch the name the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party], which is surprising them beyond their expectations with 
the popularity and the turnout of its voters. This is a lie. He 
has been attacking the Zulu police when in fact there is a state 
of emergency here, they brought all the soldiers to do 
everything. The fact is, they are panicking. The IFP is about 
to deliver a resounding victory. 
  [Venter] Mr. Jiyane, Mr. Naidoo goes on to say the ANC wants 
the results from those stations, their existence of which you 
deny, to be discounted. Now let's just assume a hypothetical 
case: say a chief in some remote area of KwaZulu has launched 
out entirely on his own and he's put up a voting station that 
shouldn't be there, if that should be the case in cooperation 
with the IEC and a proper investigation has found that has 
happened, would you then agree with the ANC that those, whatever 
votes that were cast there, should not be counted? 
  [Jiyane] It is obvious there is nothing like that that can 
happen. First you must know that the IFP was not involved in 
the IEC formation and the delivery of the ballots. We know for 
a fact that now there is an alert by police because they found 
in PWV [Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging] votes at a regional 
level that were marked ANC. Those are the ballots that are 
missing. We have 22 million missing ballots, and those were the 
reason to believe that there are some of them in the hands of 
the ANC. Now, in KwaMashu a car, an Isuzu car drove away with 
10 boxes from an area that is predominantly IFP. Those were 
stolen by ANC people. 
  [Venter] Dr. Jiyane, I'd like to clear up [words indistinct] 
you have 2 minutes to do that. But just before, what is your 
source for saying that 22 million ballots are missing, because 
Judge Kriegler denied that last night? 
  [Jiyane] Well, he said that they are hoping to find them in 
some 10,000 little stations. The fact is, at Cape Town, a 
million of them were found and a person, his life was 
threatened, when he wanted to reveal this. In Empangeni, here 
in Natal, boxes were found in Royal Hotel in Empangeni, and our 
leader there, IFP leader Mr. Gwala [as heard], was asked to come 
and see the boxes, and nobody has collected those now because 
they have been revealed. Now it was not IFP and we can know who 
brought them there. Also children, throughout the night 
yesterday in KwaMashu, were hired to make Xs on ANC name on the 
ballot papers. Those are the missing ballot papers which the 
ANC is using, which it also uses its own cars to steal away 
ballot boxes. 
  [Venter] Dr. Jiyane, in the one minute left to us, let me 
put another accusation that is made just so that we for the 
purposes of our viewers can strike some sort of a balance. Mr. 
Naidoo talks about the display of weapons, party political 
propaganda which presumably is inside the perimeter of the 
voting stations, amounting I imagine here saying to 
intimidation. Is that happening, isn't it? Well, that is all 
red herring to try and shift the focus from where the problem 
is. There is nothing of the sort. The fact is our people, from 
the old people, they were threatened by youngsters with guns, 
not just knobkerries, throughout this vote, and the police have 
intervened. In fact, they have arrested some of the ANC people 
who have been doing this. This is all red herring. They are 
panicking because IFP is about to deliver a resounding victory. 
  [Venter] Dr. Jiyane, thank you very much for joining us and 
taking the trouble to come to our remote unit in Umlazi.

<F P=106> [Address by State President F.W. de Klerk from National </F>
Party headquarters in Johannesburg -- live; italicized passages 
in Afrikaans] 
  [Text] [De Klerk] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. 
  I would like to start out not by dealing with the specific 
issue of the extension of voting time for certain areas, I will 
come to that. But I would firstly like to thank all the voters 
who have already voted, all those who have taken the rough with 
the smooth which went with this election, those who stood 
patiently in long queues, those who in some instances went away 
because of a failure in the system at certain points, and then 
came back again. Thank you for your support, for my party, to 
all those who voted for me, and to those who voted for other 
parties, thank you for your participation. South Africa needs an 
election which is legitimate. South Africa needs an election 
which gives a result which will prove that the Government of 
National Unity which will come into being as a result of that 
election will be a government representing the overwhelming 
majority of all South Africans. 
  This election is an historic occasion, maybe the most 
important ever in our history now and in the future. We are 
launching our country into a new era. We must ensure that it 
succeeds. It is this consideration which motivated the 
government to in principle acceed to the request of the IEC 
[Independent Electoral Commission] that in certain areas the 
opportunity to vote be extended for another day. I would like 
to say that the Independent Electoral Commission, on information 
available that in some parts of our country there are places 
where people haven't been able to vote as yet, and in other 
parts of our country, the same areas, the opportunity has only 
been opened really because of the delivery of ballot papers at a 
very, very late stage. It is, on the basis of their 
information, that they recommended that in the following areas 
there will tomorrow also be the opportunity for voters to vote. 
In the northern Transvaal it will be Venda, Gazankulu and 
Lebowa. In the eastern province it will be Ciskei and Transkei, 
and in Natal/KwaZulu it will be the area hitherto under 
administration of the KwaZulu government known as KwaZulu. 
  In some instances the information of the National Party is 
somewhat in conflict with the finding of the IEC, that they 
cannot at this point in time take a decision if we were to close 
the voting tonight, that the election in those parts will be 
free and fair. However, the law gives the authority to the IEC 
to make that finding and we are committed to have a result which 
will be and can be declared free and fair. We accept therefore 
their authority in this regard, their finding, and we will 
cooperate as a party to ensure that also in these areas which I 
have mentioned, the further opportunity to voters will be given. 
  There are, however, two provisos which have been agreed 
upon which are important provisos. Firstly, international 
monitors which monitored in the rest of the country where the 
election will come to an end tonight, will be added to the 
monitoring teams throughout these six areas, and therefore, the 
level of monitoring will be substantially increased and there 
will be more objective monitoring. 
  Secondly, we have insisted and it has been agreed, that all 
the votes cast tomorrow will and should be kept separate so that 
in the event of disputes arising it will not become integrated 
with the votes cast during the actual period of the election 
which was envisaged right from the beginning. In the event of 
disputes, therefore, there will be the possibility to evaluate 
what happens tomorrow in these areas on a proper and a 
scientific basis. I would also like to dispel a rumor which I 
hear is still going about and that is that there will be another 
public holiday tomorrow. [laughter] I, with great reluctance, 
because I knew of the disruption it would have because of the 
short notice, acceded to the request of the IEC to declare today 
a public holiday. The President's Council, a few years back, 
already calculated that a public holiday costs the country 400 
million rand. We need to get back to work as a nation. We 
cannot lose another day of productivity. We need to create new 
wealth to address the problems of our people and we cannot pour 
400 million, or whatever, if you take inflation into account 
since that calculation was made, down the drain, and therefore, 
tomorrow will be a working day. I haven't received any formal 
request with regard to it being declared a public holiday, and I 
want to be very firm, I'm not prepared to consider -- should I 
receive such a request, a declaration of tomorrow as a public 
holiday. 
  I know that this decision, that the election doesn't fully 
come to an end at the prescribed time, will come as a shock to 
many. I know it is coming as a shock to the organizers and the 
workers of many, many parties which have geared themselves, 
which have planned all their programs on the basis that the 
election would end tonight. I would like to call upon them to 
accept this, to be calm, because what is of the greatest 
importance is that in the final analysis we must be able to say 
that all South Africans who wished to vote and who were prepared 
to take trouble to vote, were given the opportunity to vote. If 
we don't achieve that, the election result will right from the 
beginning be in total jeopardy. The election result will not be 
the beginning of real reconciliation. It will be the beginning 
of conflict and strife. 
  However, the National Party is deeply concerned. In many 
cases we have received substantiated complaints of malpractices, 
of irregularities inside specifically many polling booths, of 
the polling boxes not being sealed off properly when they are 
full, of ink not being applied properly, on voter's assistance 
being rendered not on an impartial basis, but almost in an 
intimidatory, in a way in which it amounted to intimidation, or 
to partisanship. We have lodged a number of complaints. All 
the complaints that we have received at our head office. And I 
have just spoken to Judge Kriegler on the telephone and he 
assured me that where complaints have been lodged with regard to 
irregularities at specific polling booths, the votes at those 
polling booths will be kept separate, also during the process of 
balancing all the ballot papers until a decision has been taken 
whether the complaints are justified or not. 
  This must be done because the IEC has the authority to 
declare where irregularities occurred of a serious nature at a 
particular polling booth, to make a decision that that polling 
booth's votes won't be part of the final result. That was 
inserted in the original legislation to ensure that the whole 
electoral process, which has gone so well in most of the places, 
won't be put in jeopardy because of irregularities just at, 
relatively speaking, a few places. And I have the assurance 
that this procedure will be applied so that where complaints 
have been lodged, the IEC will be in a position to exercise its 
right in that regard, and so that those who made themselves 
guilty of irregularities will be punished. 
  There were also the other negative aspects of administrative 
failure, of logistic problems. We even heard of, at lower 
levels, IEC appointed representatives showing clear bias. That 
is part of the complaints that we received. But the National 
Party is not approaching this in a negative sense. Let's deal 
with those negative aspects within the framework of the law. 
The law provides for certain procedures, we will follow the 
procedures, but we want the election to succeed. We want the 
overall legitimacy of the election to be established, and we 
have constantly, in the days before the election, during the 
election, and we will do the same tomorrow, we have constantly 
taken a stand of being cooperative, of being constructive in 
ensuring that the election succeeds, and that we remain 
committed to it. That is what South Africa now needs, and I 
call upon all South Africans who feel somewhat disillusioned, 
because what they believed to be, or what in actual fact is 
irregularities which occurred here and there, to not 
withstanding also support me in this stance. We've got to make 
this election work for all the people. If we don't get a 100 
percent perfect election, let us strive to achieve a 95 percent 
one, and let us live with it, because South Africa needs this 
election to bring us to the point where we can start working 
together in a Government of National Unity in the best interest 
of all the people. 
  Already the election itself has brought a few very positive 
trends to the fore. Violence has abated. We almost had no 
violence. We had, outside polling booths, no overt 
intimidation, whatsoever. I've been to many polling stations, 
and everywhere there was an atmosphere so much different from 
the atmosphere even a week before, when rallies were still 
broken up by opposing parties, when there was a lot of 
intimidation, a lot of aggression. It is almost as if, at all 
the places I've been, the election breathed an air of 
reconciliation and that is what the country needs. Now, 
everybody had the right and will continue to have the right to 
participate in a full multiparty democracy. Nobody is denied 
that right in any way whatsoever, and on that basis, on that 
basis that there is no longer a basis for continued conflict, 
for continued tension, for keeping alive old hatreds and old 
conflicts -- let us unite as a nation, irrespective of our 
political differences, around this new transitional constitution 
which holds so much security for the individual, which offers 
full participation, which is a balanced constitution. Let us 
make it work for our people, for our youth, and for future 
generations. Thank you very much. 
  [Unidentified official] Thank you Mr. President. We would 
also like to recognize Mrs. Marike de Klerk here tonight. 
Welcome here. Questions, ladies and gentlemen. Questions? 
Karen Rijnaardt, RAPPORT. Can you just use the microphone 
please? 
  [Rijnaardt] Many fingers are pointing at the 
Independent Electoral Commission, over the handling of the 
election thus far. What is your comment as party leader? 
  [De Klerk] I am very critical on many aspects. I think 
we must differentiate between the commission itself, and how 
some of their decisions were carried out. I think the 
commission itself also took certain decisions which they could 
have handled differently. I think they could have depended more 
on the good experience in the Department of Home affairs. I 
think too many inexperienced people were placed in positions 
where they had to make decisions without guidance. I have a lot 
of criticism for that, but I sympathize also with these people. 
I think that the lessons we have learned, now that the 
legitimacy of the system has been taken out of the arena and is 
no more in dispute, that we take the tasks which should be 
undertaken by a government, to be handled by a government. 
Independent agents do not have the foundation, the ability, or 
the experience, and have a tendency to neglect certain things. 
Another example, and I say this without aggression, if we look 
at independent agencies, is the new tendency at the SABC 
[South African Broadcasting Corporation]. I am deeply 
concerned where a public broadcaster, a public broadcaster 
actually has ... the chief source of income is through license 
fees and where there is a political dispute almost, or a 
political struggle, concerning the political role of the SABC -- 
in which there is so lightly veered away from constitutional 
principles as it were, in respect of, for example, languages. I 
am concerned and I think we should guard against situations 
where people who are not fully accountable, receive too much 
public power, if I can put it that way, which makes an impact on 
the entire public. 
  [Official] Second question, yes sir? 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Won't you [words indistinct] 
president if the ANC [words indistinct] first part of the 
election and National Party the second [words indistinct] accept 
the position of second vice president of your country? 
  [De Klerk] Well, I'm perfectly willing, and I've said it so 
regularly. It is a constitution which I worked for, and I'm 
perfectly willing to accept a free and fair election result and 
accept whatever position that election result places me in. If 
it is to be president, yes. If it is to be executive deputy 
president, yes. 
  [Official] A third question at the back there? 
  [Correspondent Francis Ndlonga] Yes, Mr. President, I'm 
sorry, I'm just [words indistinct]. My name is Francis Ndlonga 
from REUTERS News Agency. I just wanted to check with you 
whether you have given the approval for extension by one day of 
voting in the former homelands? 
  [De Klerk] I've been consulted but the legislation yet has 
to 
be submitted to me, because we have to change the law by 
proclamation. The legislation I'm still awaiting, the principle 
I have accepted with regard to the specific former homelands 
that I've mentioned. It does not include all the former 
homelands, because in others it went better. It is interesting, 
if you analyze, that it is in the homelands where we have the 
biggest breakdown of their civil service in the past month and 
two, that the problem now is the greatest. But in principle I 
have said yes, and I will approve the legislation if I'm happy 
with the way in which it is formulated. If I'm not happy I will 
go back and we will talk about how it should be formulated. But 
you can accept the fact that there will be voting in those six 
areas tomorrow as a fact. 
  [Official] The next question finishes the [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent Michael Penbritten] Now that the election is 
virtually over, two questions: One, do you feel a sense of 
relief at passing the baton to another politician; two, how well 
has the National Party done, do you think? 
  [De Klerk] I think I must answer the last question first. 
Passing the baton for the National Party would mean that we 
have, we would have to get less than five percent of the vote, 
if you start from that end, which means that we would just be a 
party in parliament without representation in the government of 
national unity. I'm definitely sure we won't get less than five 
percent. To have our leader serve as executive deputy 
president, I'm absolutely sure that also that will not be the 
case. We will either be the biggest party or the second biggest 
party.

  [Text] The National Party has expressed dissatisfaction 
with the voting in some parts of Northern Transvaal. We spoke 
to Regional and Land Affairs Minister Andre Fourie this morning 
on the issue. 
  [Begin recording] [Fourie] Corruption is an ugly word, but I 
have no doubt that there are irregularities at voting stations. 
We have sufficient evidence. Our election agents will be 
prepared to make sworn statements if necessary to prove this. 
At some of the polling stations things are just not right. 
  [Correspondent Danie Hefers] What are these irregularities? 
  [Foure] Well, at some places there is no ink. At others with 
no electricity the batteries have run down and cannot provide 
lighting. Voting cards are being issued to youths arriving to 
vote, youths who one can see are clearly not yet 18 years old.

  [Text] Cape Town April 28 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist 
Congress [PAC] would not accept the Western Cape election result 
until a range of poll-related irregularities were addressed by 
the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC], the party said on 
Thursday [28 April]. Alleging electoral sabotage by the African 
National Congress and IEC in the region, PAC Western Cape 
premier-elect Patricia de Lille said 90 per cent of local IEC 
personnel were aligned to the ANC. 
  At a news conference in the PAC's Salt River offices, she 
said PAC complaints to provincial IEC officer Mary Burton, the 
IEC Investigations Department and the National Operations Crisis 
Centre had not been handled decisively. 
  "The PAC wishes to put on record that voting in the 
Mitchell's Plain district...has been rigged. We suspect this was 
done in conspiracy with IEC officials," the PAC said in an 
official complaint to Mr Piet Colyn at the IEC's National 
Operation Centre on Tuesday. 
  Claimed irregularities between April 26 and 28 included: 

  -  IEC officials at Hanover Park telling people which party 
to vote for; 
  -  ANC party agents inside voting stations telling people which 
party to vote for; 
  -  ANC supporters intimidating voters inside the Khayelithsa 
resource centre; 
  -  The Marconi Beam polling station at Milnerton being shifted 
to 
a police station; 
  -  Party posters inside demarcated areas at three Gugulethu 
polling stations; 
  -  Ballot boxes at the Nomsa Mpongwana school, site B hall and 
Chumisa school in Khayelitsha, and the Westridge civic centre in 
Mitchell's Plain, being opened for transfer to postal bags; 
  -  Two ballot boxes and a plastic bag being removed in a private 
vehicle from the Linge lower primary school; 
  -  Three PAC party agents being refused access to the Somerset 
West town hall; 
  -  Shots fired at a PAC canvassing table by "known ANC members" 
at 
Unathi, Crossroads; 
  -  PAC branch secretary Andile Makhala being stabbed by five 
"ANC 
people" for wearing a PAC t-shirt; and 
  -  IEC officials voting twice at the Ebutsheni school, 
Khayelitsha.

  [Text] The Freedom Front has said in a statement issued in 
Pretoria the fact that ballot papers were not available in white 
areas of Alberton early this morning calls into serious question 
the freedom and fairness of the election. The front said it 
suspects that the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] is 
being deliberately unhelpful. A complaint in this regard is to 
be handed to the IEC today.

  [Text] Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen said, as he 
put it, the chaotic state of the election has upset many people. 
General Viljoen said in Lydenburg that he was not criticizing 
the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] because this 
commission had been entrusted with an impossible task stemming 
from wrong decisions. 
  [Begin recording] [Viljoen] I am not sure what was going on 
here, but the number of votes, the additional ballot papers that 
had to be printed has been Greek to me. I cannot understand why 
such a situation prevails, and to me this does not make sense. I 
think the situation has to be looked into very seriously. 
  [Correspondent Pieter Theron] Gen. Viljoen visited several 
polling stations in the eastern and northern Transvaal. It was 
clear that most people in these regions had already voted 
yesterday. The voting in some places took place very 
peacefully; no problems were experienced, although ballot papers 
at some voting stations were lacking. The Freedom Front 
contends that in view of numerous logistic and administrative 
problems which cropped up during the election period, a leaders' 
summit should be held immediately after the elections were 
completed. It will determine whether the election had been free 
and fair. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with ANC President Nelson Mandela at the ANC </F>
media center in Johannesburg by SABC correspondents Lester 
Venter and Safako Nyako and REUTER correspondent (Rodney Pinda) 
-- live] 
  [Text] [Venter] Well, good morning from downtown 
Johannesburg. The election, of course, is still on in several 
parts of the country, but there is a mood abroad that South 
Africa's historic moment is nearly completed. We are here, of 
course, as you've just been told, talking now to the leader of 
the African National Congress, Mr. Nelson Mandela. Good 
morning, Mr. Mandela. Thank you for joining us. I am joined, of 
course, by SABC colleague Safako Nyako and (Rodney Pinda) of 
REUTER INTERNATIONAL NEWS AGENCY. Safako? 
  [Nyako] Good morning, Mr. Mandela. 
  [Mandela] Good morning. 
  [Nyako] Now that you are at the tail end of the elections, 
can you just tell us what are your impressions about the 
elections? 
  [Mandela] Well, my impressions are mixed. One of joy that 
our struggle, our dreams, are about to be realized. The dream 
of building a greater South Africa, in which South Africans of 
all racial groups can work together to promote a spirit of 
reconciliation and of nation-building. Sadness that some of the 
men and women who have made this day possible are no longer with 
us. I wish, as I have said before, I could arouse them and get 
them to rise from their graves to join us on this occasion. It 
is a momentous occasion, and I approach it with a feeling of 
satisfaction, of hope, of strength, because an opportunity has 
now been provided for all South Africans to roll up their 
sleeves, to take responsibility, and to ensure that this great 
country becomes really great. And I have no doubt that if we 
work together we will be able to build a very great country 
indeed. 
  [Venter] Mr. Mandela, you talk about the realization of the 
dream, and if I may, I'd like to narrow it down to one specific 
moment. Now, yesterday most of South Africa saw Archbishop 
Desmond Tutu casting his vote, and very solemnly he put his 
ballot into the ballot box, and once he had done so he was 
unable to restrain himself from bursting into a jig, dancing a 
jig of joy. Now perhaps people would have been surprised to see 
you do the same. However, it must have been an extraordinary 
moment for you, and people could only have imagined the thoughts 
and the emotions that must have been alive in you at that very 
moment. Would you tell us something about your feelings at that 
moment? 
  [Mandela] Well, as I say, they were mixed feelings. They 
were feelings of joy, of happiness, a sense of accomplishment. 
We have fought throughout for a South Africa where the merit of 
a person is the determining factor. I think that by casting 
this vote we were laying down the foundation for this spirit, as 
I say again, of working for reconciliation, healing the wounds 
of the past, giving security to all South Africans that they 
have nothing to fear from a government of national unity, which 
is a guarantee that we will be working for the interests of all 
South Africans, not just the majority, and it was a momentous 
occasion, and perhaps my feelings are beyond words. 
  [Venter] Mr. Mandela if I may just follow up on that issue 
of reconciliation. You know you chose as a title for the 
description of the part of your life up until now no easy walk 
to freedom. Looking at reconciliation, do you think that the 
next chapter might be entitled no easy walk to reconciliation? 
  [Mandela] Well, I do not think so. Every human being wants 
peace, wants security for himself, for his family, for his 
grandchildren. People love peace, and I believe that those who 
fear democracy in this country, who would like to derail the 
constructive purpose which many South Africans have made, are in 
a tiny minority. I don't think it's going go be so difficult to 
promote the spirit of reconciliation. 
  We, for example, have already said that those members of the 
security forces who committed political and related offenses 
before the 8th of October are entitled to indemnity, just as the 
freedom fighters who fought against apartheid were given an 
indemnity. The only issue which we have emphasized is that the 
freedom fighters were asked to disclose what offenses they have 
committed, we would like also the defenders of apartheid to 
disclose what offenses they have committed. Not because we want 
to punish them for those offenses, but because the indemnity is 
going to [word indistinct] on an individual basis. We are doing 
this because we are keen that the South African Police, the 
South African Defense Force, must be part of this 
transformation. Without their cooperation it will be difficult 
for us to get that stability whereby we can promote the spirit 
of reconciliation and nation-building. 
  [(Pinda)] Mr. Mandela, if we could look ahead now to the 
next 
steps, the world is watching South Africa's election and 
millions of black South Africans who have never before voted, 
are eagerly awaiting the result, and we must look, I think, at 
the validity of that result. You had some harsh words 
yesterday. You talked of sabotage of the process. Can you 
perhaps explain a little bit more about that, and whether you 
think that indeed the result will be valid, will be legitimate, 
whether we have had a free and fair election? 
  [Mandela] Well, firstly it must be clear that when I spoke 
about a massive sabotage, I was not at all referring to the 
Independent Elections Commission. That commission is composed 
of men and women of the highest integrity. Almost all of them 
are known to me personally, and I worked with them in other 
capacities, and I am convinced about their impartiality, their 
integrity in this exercise. But way down there something wrong 
has happened. You will have noticed that in white areas, 
Indian, and colored, there was no problem about ballot papers 
arriving in time, no problem about the elections taking place 
smoothly. It is only in African areas, especially areas which 
are the strongholds of the ANC that these problems have arisen. 
  I spoke yesterday to General Holomisa. He said to me that 
they were allocated 2 million ballot papers, they only received 
yesterday only 250.000. He said they had been promised that 
more ballot papers would come at 1 o'clock yesterday. They were 
told later that they will come at 6 o'clock. 
  We are having the same thing in the northern Transvaal. 
Later during the day we were told that these ballot papers had 
arrived in Pietersburg and in Thohoyandou. But in a big area 
like that, country areas where there are no communications, the 
arrival of ballot papers in Pietersburg means nothing, it's just 
the start of the process. The crunch is going to lie in 
distributing those ballot papers, it may take a day, and even 
two days before they reach some of these polling stations. So 
there is this unaccountable discrepancy between white, Indian, 
and colored areas and African areas. 
  Nevertheless, in spite of that, I think that this is a 
problem which is being addressed. I'm meeting Mr. de Klerk 
today at 2 o'clock to address these questions. The will is 
there to address these irregularities, and I think that is more 
important that concentrating on the mistakes that have been 
made. And I'm, therefore, confident that we'll be able to 
pronounce this elections has having being free and fair. 
  [Nyako] Mr. Mandela, I'd like to take you back a little. 
You spoke here about the willingness for reconciliation and 
prospects of a bright future, but only yesterday the right wing 
said it is declaring war; as from next week, everybody in the 
country must know that there is a war. What are your comments 
to the comments by the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement]? 
  [Mandela] Well, we can't stop people from making any 
statement which pleases them. I don't think the AWB is in a 
position to conduct any war. The ease with which the police 
have made a breakthrough, arresting everyone of these bombers, I 
think already we have defused the situation in a matter of 
hours, and I don't regard the threats by the AWB as something we 
should worry about. We are building the country. We are 
promoting this spirit of national reconciliation. 
  Our slogan is -- and I have carried this to almost every 
meeting I've addressed -- let the past be the past, let bygones 
be bygones, let us promote this spirit of reconciliation, let 
every South African, irrespective of his color, know that this 
is his country, and be involved in the process of transformation. 
  I regard it as significant that a person like General 
Constand Viljoen should have made a statement more than once to 
say they have found more sincerity and made greater progress 
with the ANC than with the National Party. He is doing that 
because of the correctness of our policy. The impact it is 
making in the country -- and in saying so, I do not minimize the 
role that has been played by other political organizations 
generally, and the NP in particular -- what was originally the 
initiative of a particular organization, the result is that it 
is a collective one, that all of us have contributed to this 
outstanding breakthrough that we have achieved in this country. 
That is what is important, not the threats by the AWB. 
  [Venter] Mr. Mandela, you speak about the 31 arrests and 
that, of course, is an illustration of what is being done to 
deal with and tackle that particular problem that Safako raises 
right now. You also say that the belligerent statements are 
something that shouldn't necessarily be worried about. However, 
it is a matter that does worry South Africans -- what is the 
prospect, what lies down the road? Now, if you look down the 
road, particularly from the perspective that there's at least an 
excellent chance that you will be in the president's office in a 
matter of days, how do you weight this up, and when you look 
down the road, what do you see as the future of this problem of 
white resistance? 
  [Mandela] We must remember that the NP was once in exactly 
the same position today as the right wing, as the AWB. They 
used everything in their power to destroy the liberation 
movement. They shot and killed freedom fighters, right from 
1960. Before we ever thought of the conflict between Inkatha 
Freedom Party and the ANC, freedom fighters died in the hands of 
the South African Police. But through discussions we have been 
able to move the NP from that position to a position where now 
they are our friends, and with whom we are trying to promote the 
spirit of national reconciliation, and to build a greater 
country. 
  It is partly as a result of the discussions which we've had 
with the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] -- Gen. Constand 
Viljoen, Ferdi Hartzenberg, Dries Bruwer -- that Gen. Constand 
Viljoen has joined this process. We are going to continue with 
that process. I have had discussions with Ferdi Hartzenberg, 
formal and informal, on a one-on-one basis. I propose to 
continue with that. 
  Let me indicate to you that there is not a single 
organization, not a single opinion-maker, as an organization 
among the Afrikaners, that I have not seen. I have seen a wide 
range of such organizations -- the generals, all the generals 
that are responsible for policy in the South African Police, the 
full general staff of the SADF. I have seen twice the full 
leadership of the Dutch Reformed Church. I have seen the 
leadership of the Broederbond [secret Afrikaner brotherhood], 
the Vryheidstigting [Freedom Foundation] of Professor Carel 
Boshoff. I have traveled all the way to Bothaville to see the 
National Maize Producers' Organization, and all the various 
agricultural unions in this country. I have done so because it 
is absolutely necessary for us to speak with one voice on all 
the major national questions in this country, and we're 
succeeding. 
  The AWB has become a small, isolated organization, even 
among 
the Afrikaners. They are not in a position to carry out any 
threats. It can never be more than a simple police act, in which 
the government is not even involved. That is the extent to 
which we have neutralized that fringe of people who think 
through their blood instead of thinking through their brains. I 
think that we have succeeded in isolating them. I don't think 
it's an issue over which to worry, and if they are ready to 
speak to me, I will sit down and discuss with them. I have 
already had discussions with some of them, and those discussions 
have been fairly interesting and fruitful. If their leader 
wants to sit down and discuss with me, I'm available. I will 
discuss with him. But I think that the police will be quite 
sufficient in dealing with them. We don't even need the SADF to 
deal with the AWB. 
  [(Pinda)] Mr. Mandela, probably more important than even 
the problem of the white minority in that respect is the 
relationship, obviously, between the African National Congress 
and the Inkatha Freedom Party and the followers on the ground 
and the trouble that has arisen from that. Can you give us some 
idea how you will address that issue. Will the view, as 
everybody seems to expect from Pretoria, give you a fresh 
perspective or any fresh thinking on that issue? 
  [Mandela] Well, you will have noticed that there has been 
ongoing discussions between the African National Congress and 
the Inkatha Freedom Party. We proposed to continue with 
dialogue with everybody including the Inkatha Freedom Party. We 
proposed to continue that even after a government of national 
unity has been established. Dialogue is the most important 
weapon, and it is because we have used that weapon that we have 
made this progress. 
  You must remember that at one time we had no less than 26 
political parties pulling in different directions. Nevertheless 
we have made breakthroughs. We have established a Transitional 
Executive Council, we have adopted a nonracial constitution 
which however flawed because of the compromises which we had to 
make to accommodate the views of different political parties. 
It is flawed but nevertheless it reflects the hopes and 
aspirations of all South Africans. 
  Then we had today, a day of liberation, that was what is 
important, and we have made enormous progress, and I don't think 
we are going to have any difficulties in entrenching this spirit 
of reconciliation and nation-building in which all South 
Africans are working together. 
  [Venter] Mr. Mandela, if I can just follow up on that 
because 
the election has been remarkable for many things, but this [word 
indistinct] is sort of a subsidiary miracle -- namely, that 
there is, contrary to all expectations, an almost total absence 
of violence. 
  I was sitting on the news desk for the last two days and 
being inundated with reports saying there is no news, there's no 
violence here, the minor incidents of intimidation, reports 
saying that farmers are involved in right-wing activities, for 
example in the town of Viljoenskroon, assisting their workers to 
come to the polls to vote, ANC and IFP supporter standing in the 
same queues in East Rand townships. Now South Africans are 
almost all afraid to ask the question, is this the seed of that 
reconciliation, a permanent plant of that reconciliation that 
you're talking of? 
  [Mandela] I think the message has gone across, of 
reconciliation. Men and women in every country, they want 
peace, they want security, they want economic and political 
stability, they want to predict what is going to happen in the 
future. Unless you have peace, it is impossible for us to carry 
out our best programs of action, and I think the spirit has gone 
across, of reconciliation. That message has been corroding the 
support of those who fear democracy, who wanted to block this 
process. Some of them have come in because they realize that if 
they continue to stand out, they will be written out of history. 
  That message of reconciliation is already responsible for 
what is happening yesterday, the day before yesterday, in these 
elections. It is because the people can see that the major 
political organizations are committed to peace. 
  We have made it clear -- I made it clear in the Rivonia 
trial 
-- that I have fought against white domination, just as much as 
I have fought against black domination. I have stood for that 
idea. I have been firm in the belief that South Africa is one 
country, one nation, whether you're colored, white, Indian, or 
African. I think that message has gone across, and therefore 
what we see in these elections is already the result of this 
environment of reconciliation that we are promoting. 
  [Venter] Mr. Mandela, I'd just like to apologize to our 
viewers for the difficulties we are experiencing with lighting, 
and I hope the contents of our discussion doesn't leave our 
viewers in the dark. 
  [Nyako] Mr. Mandela, we have heard many stories of, you 
know, 
touching moments that people went through during the elections. 
I remember interviewing somebody just to find out how she felt 
by casting her vote. She was speechless, she couldn't say a 
word. You've heard how maid and madam embraced, crying, saying 
now you're part of one family. Can you just maybe tell us what 
has been the most touching moment in the whole election? 
  [Mandela] Well, I think it is very difficult to identify any 
single moment which I can regard as touching, but the very fact 
that our people, the injured, the disabled, have had the 
opportunity to exercise one of the most important rights which a 
citizen has, has been most touching, and the fact that, as you 
have said, this election proceeded without violence. All these 
have been touching moments, but within that context I don't 
think it is possible to say this single issue has touched me 
most. The whole development that has taken place has been very 
touching indeed. 
  [(Pinda)] Mr. Mandela, can I just ask you, how do you think 
you've done? You've spent your life fighting for this election. 
Have you won it? 
  [Mandela] Well, what is important is not the victory of any 
particular individual or organization. It is the victory by the 
people of South Africa. That is what should dominate all of us, 
and I think that everyone of us will agree that the people of 
South Africa have been victorious. They have won. 
  [Venter] Mr. Mandela, within a number of days the first 
cabinet meeting of the new government will take place, and 
you'll certainly be occupying one of the chairs at that table. 
What would you like to be the primary agenda points at that 
first, decisive executive meeting of the new government? 
  [Mandela] Well, first, every leader should take 
responsibility for building the mutual trust that should exist 
if we're going to be in a position to address the major national 
issues facing this country. During this election, when dealing 
with the disruption of political meetings of our opponents, I 
have urged my comrades that we must not open up wounds now which 
will be difficult for us to heal when we work as a government of 
national unity; that these same opponents are going to be our 
partners. 
  Whatever we do, we should be influenced by that 
consideration. So the task of building this mutual trust among 
ourselves is going to be one of the most important priorities, 
because unless we are able to speak with one voice, even though 
we may differ on specific issues -- which happens in any 
organization, in any family -- unless we promote this spirit of 
mutual trust, it is going to be difficult for us to face the 
problems of the country. I think that this will be one of our 
tasks. 
  But we have this Reconstruction and Development Program. We 
have been very careful in ensuring that it is circulated very 
widely among business, academics, state departments, state 
corporations, for comment. We have had no less than five 
different drafts in order to accommodate the views of all these 
interested groups. Our task is going to be ensuring that that 
plan is able to address the basic needs of our people. 
  Not only that. We are also concerned with addressing the 
concerns of the minorities in this country. One of the issues 
which we regard as a priority is to get the white community in 
this country, which has enjoyed better opportunities, acquired 
knowledge, skills, and expertise, they must be part of this 
transformation because they can play a vital, if not decisive, 
role in the promotion of this spirit of reconciliation, in the 
implementation of this program to address the basic needs of the 
masses of the people. This can be done without bringing down the 
standard of the whites in this country. 
  [Venter] Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid we must return to the 
Good Morning South Africa studio at Auckland Park. Mr. Mandela, 
thank you very much for joining us. 
  [Mandela] You're welcome.

<F P=106> [Interview with ANC President Nelson Mandela by announcer </F>
Jon Snow in Johannesburg on 28 April--recorded] 
  [Text] [Snow] I asked him [Mandela] to detail his 
allegations. 
  [Mandela] There is a view that there has been massive 
sabotage, not by the independent election commission, but in the 
process of distribution. Because the striking feature is that 
in all white, (?Indian), and colored areas there has been no 
problems. But the failure to deliver the ballot papers only 
took place in the [word indistinct) to African areas. Some of 
the ballot papers were found locked up in certain townships, in 
warehouses in certain townships. And the briefing I'm getting is 
that there has been some massive sabotage. Nevertheless we are 
now dealing with that question. Our command center, acting in 
collaboration with the independent elections commission, is 
addressing this matter. I am confident that we are going to 
resolve them. I have been in touch with President De Klerk 
yesterday and by telephone, and at half past two we met and 
discussed this matter. I'm convinced that we are going to 
resolve this matter. 
  [Snow] He has apparently been putting planes and helicopters 
at your disposal, or at the disposal of the election commission 
to try and get the ballots out, and they've printed another 10 
million, but you called it massive sabotage. By whom? 
  [Mandela] No, he is responding to what we have discovered. 
At the present moment the matter is under investigation, and it 
would be improper for us to attach blame to any particular 
individual organization without a proper investigation. What is 
clear is that ballot papers have reached the areas where whites, 
coloreds, and Indians are to vote. And the problem has happened 
almost exclusively at the African areas. 
  [Snow] Are we in time then to have a free and fair election 
in which everybody in the country has equal chance to vote? 
  [Mandela] Well, the way in which these problems have been 
addressed will ensure that the end of the day, free and fair 
elections have been conducted. I am not alarmed by the problems 
which have arisen. And the point is that when these problems 
arise, there are men and women from both sides of the color 
line, who are prepared to address them honestly, frankly, and 
effectively. And that is the machinery that we've now put into 
operation. 
  [Snow] Could I then look beyond the electoral process, to 
the 
building of a government of national unity, which is after all 
what all this is about. Can you have a full government of 
national unity which does not include Chief Buthelezi and 
Inkatha -- whether they get five percent or not? 
  [Mandela] We are not thinking in terms of individuals. We 
think in terms of the process. We would like an inclusive 
process where all parties, political parties are involved. But 
whether we are going to have a government of national unity or 
not, depends on whether a political party gets five percent or 
more of the total votes cast in an election. If it does he [as 
heard] will be in the government of national unity. If he does 
not, he does not, he will not be. What is important is that we 
have made astounding progress in his absence already, we have 
had the political organizations [word indistinct], the state of 
emergency which had lasted for several years -- lifted, an 
environment of free political activity introduced, hundreds of 
political prisoners, some of whom were serving long sentences, 
were released, and more than 15,000 political exiles have 
returned to the country. But on top of that, we have had a 
breakthrough which have been sensational: We have established 
the Transitional Executive Council, which has assumed certain 
powers of government. We have adopted a constitution, which 
although it is fraught, because it is a compromise constitution, 
meeting the demands and expectations of no less than 26 
different political parties, and pulling in different 
directions, we have been able nevertheless, to agree on a 
constitution which does mirror the hopes and aspirations of the 
majority of the people of South Africa. And what is more, we 
have now this day, yesterday, and the day before yesterday. 
[sentence as heard] That's a terrific achievement. And as many 
of these achievements have been made in spite of the 
obstructionist attitude of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. And 
therefore I have not the slightest hesitation that the 
government of national unity will be established. It will work 
very effectively and the plans to better the life of our people 
that were developed will be put into practice. 
  [Snow] Now a lot of this achievement has been dependent upon 
the relationship between you and Mr. De Klerk. When we spoke to 
him the other day he said: Well, I have a very good formal 
relationship with Mr. Mandela. I call him Mr. Mandela, and he 
calls me Mr. State President. If you're going to go forward 
from that point, will that relationship have to sustain -- and 
if anything, even get closer -- or do you see the work already 
done? 
  [Mandela] Well, my relations firstly. I don't think it is 
correct to think of the future in terms of the contribution of 
just two individuals. Although individuals are important, the 
changes in this country have not been brought by a single 
individual. It is the men and women of South Africa, from all 
population groups, who have exerted tremendous pressure, who 
came out into the streets, held strikes, boycotts, who were 
harassed and persecuted by the racist police of the apartheid 
regime, who were thrown into jail, who were shot and killed -- 
with the support of the international community, which has been 
absolutely massive, and tremendous. It is that pressure that 
has made the apostles of apartheid to collapse, to go down on 
their knees, and to bring about changes. But within that 
background, individuals have played a role. You must put, 
therefore, the contribution of any individual against that 
background. 
  [Snow] That's what I wanted to pick you up on, this question 
of the pressure that everybody has exerted, but also the fact 
that apartheid committed so many crimes, or so many crimes were 
committed in the name of apartheid. What should happen to 
people who committed those crimes? 
  [Mandela] I have been saying throughout: Let bygones by 
bygones. Let what has happened pass as something unfortunate 
but which we must forget. Insofar as people who committed 
political and related offenses before the 8th of October 1990, 
we are saying that each and everyone of them should make a full 
disclosure of the crime that he committed -- not because we want 
to put them on trial, but because an indemnity should be an 
individual act. We wanted to indemnify a particular individual 
for a specific offense that he has committed. This is what was 
done to the opponents of apartheid. We now feel this should be 
done to those people who committed those offenses in defense of 
apartheid. Where there will certainly be no indemnity is in 
regard to people who are committing offenses now. Those will not 
be covered by indemnity. We are taking this line because these 
offenses were committed mainly by the security forces. We depend 
on the loyalty of the security forces in this transformation, 
and in the government of national unity. It is therefore 
necessary that we move to this new dispensation. The South 
African Defense Force, and the South African police, the civil 
service must be free to serve the new government. They cannot 
do so if there is a spirit of insecurity, if their morale is 
low, and it is for this reason that I have repeatedly said let 
bygones be bygones. And if, during this election, I have warned 
both my own members of the organization, as well as other 
political organizations, I've said: You must remember that your 
opponents now are going to be your partners in future. We are 
going to work together, let us not open now wounds which will be 
difficult to heal, when we now try to work together in the 
government of national unity. 
  [Snow] Now, when you were young, you led the ANC Youth 
League. And you were to some extent frustrated by the lack of 
punch at the top -- you didn't feel that the leadership of the 
ANC was radical enough. Do you think there's a danger that the 
young generation now is more impatient for more radical change 
than you can deliver. Do you feel almost, perhaps, things are 
being repeated? 
  [Mandela] No. I have great confidence in our youth. If you 
consider that they are living at a stage, at an age, in an 
(?era) where they see their white counterparts enjoying rights, 
opportunities, privileges, which are denied to them, and when 
they see their counterparts, black counterparts in the 
neighboring states enjoying the same rights that are enjoyed by 
whites here, their impatience is perfectly understandable. But 
when we feel that they're too radical as to frighten the 
minorities in this country, we speak to them. And in every case 
they have been loyal, they have followed orders. That is the 
most encouraging issue. This is the striking characteristics of 
the loyalty of our youth. 
  [Snow] One last question: When you were in prison, did you 
know you would become president? Did you believe you would 
become president? And did you, in a way, plot out within your 
mind many of the thoughts you would want to express given that 
chance? 
  [Mandela] No. I never thought so. Not that I excluded the 
possibility, but I never thought in terms of the role of an 
individual. We had a very capable leadership and [word 
indistinct] Oliver Tambo, who was my colleague at the 
university, when we formed the youth league together. We then 
formed a league of partnership together and then when we were 
forced to dissolve our league of partnership he went abroad. He 
brought the organization into a level which it had never 
occupied before, and he earned the respect of the entire world. 
Now I thought of a leadership like that, not from the point of 
view of an individual, and least of all of myself. I thought 
that we would fight, would continue the struggle for liberation 
under his leadership and acting as part of a collective, as part 
of a team, and that is what we focus upon. The team is more 
important than the individual. Therefore, there was little room 
for thinking of the role that an individual could play. And I 
had complete confidence in Oliver Tambo that he would be able to 
lead the country and the organization to liberation.

  [Text] Mmabatho April 28 SAPA -- A white gunman who opened 
fire on voters at a polling station at Taung in Bophuthatswana 
was under police guard in hospital, SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] radio reported on Thursday [28 April] 
night. Police spokesman Col Dave George said the suspect was 
severely burnt when angry voters set his vehicle alight after 
the shooting. 
  The incident was one of several rumoured developments in the 
Western Transvaal which the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [AWB, 
Afrikaner Resistance Movement] has earmarked as the base for the 
Afrikaner "volkstaat" [homeland]. 
  South African Police said they could not comment on the 
incident because it occurred in an area under the control of the 
Bophuthatswana police. 
  Information filtering from the region said right-wingers 
were 
involved in the incident. 
  There were also reports that AWB members and security forces 
levelled their weapons at each other in the Rustenburg area on 
Thursday, but police could not confirm any such incident. 
  Defence force Ratel armoured vehicles and black defence 
force 
troops lined the streets of Rustenburg on Thursday when an AWB 
convoy of about 100 cars moved through the town for an AWB rally. 
  Whites in Rustenburg were seen to give the white 
right-wingers thumbs-down signs. 
  Observers said the ranks of the AWB appear to be dwindling, 
with 200 people attending Thursday's rally. Few attended a rally 
addressed by AWB leader Eugene Terreblanche in Brits last 
weekend. 
  Police on thursday continued their investigations into 
bombings on the reef. Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe 
earlier said some of the suspects arrested were AWB members. 
  A number of right-wingers' farms had been searched for 
weapons and explosives in the past few days, according to 
Western Transvaal police sources.

  [Text] Cape Town April 28 SAPA -- Police and peace monitors 
had to intervene when stone-throwing occurred between African 
National Congress and National Party [NP] supporters in 
Mitchell's Plain on Thursday [28 April]. An ANC spokesman 
alleged the election information desk near the polling station 
in the Eastridge Community Centre was stoned by NP supporters 
after they demanded that the desk be moved, SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reported. An NP spokesman 
alleged members picked up stones in self defence after ANC 
members pointed guns at them. Police and peace monitors kept 
the two angry groups apart while they traded insults across the 
road.

<F P=106> [By Kofi Opare-Addo] </F>
  [Text] Amid the president clamour by the leadership of the 
National Democratic Congress for the scalp of the independent 
private press, three strong political actors in the country 
yesterday [20 April] tensed their muscles for a punch-up with 
the government which may break up the country in the coming 
months. The three, Kwesi Pratt of the PPDD [People's Party for 
Democracy and Development], Johnny Hansen and B.B.D. Asamoah, 
who individually spew controversy wherever they go, collectively 
intend to sponsor and lead countrywide demonstrations from May 3 
if the government fails to meet a litany of demands. 
  Twitching with the magnitude of their frustrations with the 
government and perhaps their mission too, they told newsmen at a 
press conference that their demands include electoral reforms, 
enquiry into PNDC [Provisional National Defense Council] 
sponsored extra-judicial killings and the end to present 
attempts to muzzle the press. 
  Also close to the hearts of the three are the abolishing of 
the Serious Fraud Office, and the departure from public service 
of ex- PNDC officials who have collected their end-of-service 
benefits. But the punch-line of the warning was reserved for 
Parliament. "We promise that we will advocate a break up of the 
country...if Parliament amends the Constitution to suit the 
government" "In spite of its limitations, it is the only check 
we have on the unholy plots of the ruling clique on our lives 
and liberties". 
  The message to the President who has constantly shown his 
irritation with the people's will (the Constitution) was simple; 
"He must pack and go." 
  For the first lady who has recently stoked a public backlash 
against her, the group wondered whether she has the same 
political and constitutional powers as the president. "We are 
unsure whether the first lady...is equal to the President and 
therefore a parallel president". They said rather than the 
first couple resorting to intimidations in reaction to press 
revelations, investigations should be conducted into such finger 
pointing. 
  Interestingly, the statement from the three men makes a firm 
demand for a "full statement on Ghana's foreign and local debt 
burden". Considering their rabble-rousing nature the threat 
from the three could be treated with some raising of the brow at 
the Castle. But the threat is belied with the raggle-taggle 
credentials of the membership of the new front. All three have 
a history of several political detentions "under their belt". 
But that is as far as it goes. While Kwesi Pratt displays a 
solid background of never capitulating to Jerry Rawlings, both 
Johnny Hansen and B.B.D. Asamoah have once flirted with the 
President and were cashiered for some unexplained reasons 
though, Johnny Hansen was PNDC secretary for interior in its 
early years while B.B.D. Asamoah served as secretary to the 
PNDC. However, with tension banking across the political divide 
the latest threat by Pratt and friends could torch some 
confusion in the country.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by IEC Chairman Johann Kriegler </F>
at IEC headquarters in Midrand on 29 April] 
  [Text] IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] chairman, 
Justice Johann Kriegler, has described the election as an 
outstanding success despite the hitches that occurred in some 
areas. He outlined the next process in the election -- namely, 
the counting of votes -- an a news conference at the IEC 
headquarters in Midrand a short while ago. 
  [Begin Kriegler recording] We can't actually commence 
counting in areas where the voting has been completed before 
voting has ended in the other six areas. It is not proper to 
have counting while there is still voting on the go, because it 
may affect the view of voters. In the second instance, the 
addition of an extra day in those six areas has required a 
change in our counting procedures. The third-day votes have to 
be kept separate; they will be counted but they have to be kept 
separate. That infers a fairly complex change in instructions 
to some 700 voting stations around the country. And then 
thirdly of course, many of the people engaged in the voting 
process, the voting officers, are also to be involved in the 
counting process, and because they're still engaged in the first 
phase they're simply not available yet for the second phase. 
What this means, further, is that in the counting procedure we 
have to be especially careful and meticulous. That will be time 
consuming. Moreover, the administrative shortcomings which 
resulted in last minute urgent adjustments by the IEC, will 
undoubtedly result, and has to some extent already resulted in 
political parties raising objections -- to a greater extent 
which otherwise has been the case. The determination of those 
objections which are relevant to the counting or the ultimate 
allocation phase is also time consuming. This means in a 
nutshell, that we must be patient. We have come a tremendously 
long way; it's gone astoundingly well around the country. [end

  [Text] Taipei, March 31 (CNA) -- A 45-member Japanese 
delegation will visit Taiwan April 26 to attend a trade seminar 
and discuss the purchase of semiconductor products, a China 
External Trade Development Council (Cetra) spokesman announced 
Thursday. 
  The April 26-28 seminar will be sponsored by Cetra, the 
Electronic Industry Association of Japan (EIAJ), and the 
Coordination Council of ROC-Japan Business Affairs. 
  During the seminar, 19 noted Japanese business groups will 
meet with 16 Taiwan electronic manufacturers and suppliers at 
the Taipei International Convention Center. 
  The Japanese delegation will include representatives from 
Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Toshiba, and Sanyo, 
the spokesman noted. 
  The visit comes after eight Taiwan semiconductor producers, 
led by the United Electronic Corp., visited Japan last December. 
During the tour, Taiwan producers reaped more than U.S.$40 
million in integrated circuit (IC) and other computer peripheral 
products trade. 
  Semiconductors are widely used in electronic products such 
as 
computers and televisions. Taiwan exported some U.S.$2.5 
billion worth of semiconductor products to Japan in 1993, 
topping all other electronic products exported to Japan and 
registering an annual growth rate of 35 percent. 
  The Cetra spokesman said the forthcoming visit not only 
signifies Japanese affirmation of Taiwan's semiconductor 
industry, but will also help in correcting Taiwan's trade 
deficit with Japan. 
  The meeting will be a good opportunity for Taiwan 
manufacturers to expand trade in the closed Japanese market, the 
Cetra spokesman added. 
  After the talks, the Japanese traders will visit factories 
in 
the Hsinchu science-based industrial park before returning to 
Japan.

<F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, March 26 (CNA) -- Manufacturing industry 
investment is expected to increase 17.4 percent in 1994, the 
greatest increase in five years, the government reported 
Saturday [26 March]. 
  According to a report released by the Directorate General of 
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), key projects, those 
worth at least NT$200 million (US$7.58 million), will be the 
primary contributors to the expected boost in investment 
willingness. The report was based on a survey of 1,800 private 
enterprises. 
  Investments by large enterprises are predicted to surge by 
[figure indistinct] percent, but those by small- and 
medium-sized enterprises will fall by 7.5 percent and 14.4 
percent respectively, according to survey results. 
  "The anticipated drop in investment willingness among small 
businesses is the result of a combination of negative factors 
such as the lingering business slowdown, stringent pollution 
control requirements and a dearth of capital," a DGBAS official 
explained. 
  Nearly all sectors of the manufacturing industry indicated a 
strong desire to invest, the survey found. Machinery equipment 
investment, an index often used to gauge investment willingness, 
was predicted to increase to a record high of 20.3 percent over 
1993 levels. 
  The metal industry is projected to lead the investment 
spree, 
surging 64.3 percent over 1993. Just as dynamic will be 
electrical accessories and appliances, which are predicted to 
jump 53.9 percent. 
  The report also forecast a 9.3 percent growth in revenues 
for 
the manufacturing industry as compared with the 6.9 percent 
growth rate registered in 1993.

  [Text] Taipei, March 26 (CNA) -- Taiwan topped the world 
in per capita gold consumption last year, according to 
statistics compiled by the World Gold Council. 
  "Each Taiwan resident consumed an average of eight grams of 
gold in 1993, the highest among all countries around the world," 
a spokesman for the world council's representative office in 
Taipei said Saturday [26 March]. 
  Hong Kong trailed behind, with each resident consuming six 
grams of gold on average, the spokesman said. 
  Mainland China, however, took the lead in total gold 
consumption at 223 metric tons, the spokesman noted. Per capita 
gold consumption on the mainland stood at 0.2 grams last year. 
  According to the council's tallies, Taiwan consumed 160.6 
tons of gold in 1993, while Hong Kong's consumption totaled 36.4 
tons. 
  Altogether, the spokesman said, the three Chinese societies 
consumed 420 tons of gold in 1993 alone, accounting for 65 
percent of Asia's total consumption. 
  A recent survey conducted by the World Gold Trade Promotion 
Council found that more than 80 percent of Taiwan, Hong Kong and 
mainland consumers like pure gold jewelry, particularly those 
fashionably designed and reasonably priced. It also found that 
women between 16 and 34 were the mainstay of the clientele. 
  The spokesman said he believes the burgeoning "greater China 
economic sphere" will be the world's most important gold market 
in the years ahead. 
  A seminar on the latest gold jewelry design trends and a 
gold 
jewelry design contest are being held in Taipei under the 
auspices of the gold council. "The events are aimed at helping 
Taiwan goldsmiths and designers expand their market shares," the 
spokesman noted.

  [Text] Geneva, March 26 (CNA) -- Australia Friday [25 
March] asked Taiwan to allow imports of Australian rice in 
compliance with fair trade regulations laid down by the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  With unexpectedly friendly rapport, negotiators from 
Australia and Taiwan exchanged views on Taiwan's economic and 
industrial structures and possible tariff concessions during a 
series of ongoing bilateral tariff talks here. 
  Chen Wu-hsiung, a Council of Agriculture official, told 
chief 
Australian negotiator Donald Kenyon and his party that Taiwan's 
rice market would be opened slowly to allow rice farmers time to 
adjust to foreign competition. 
  Chen proposed that Taiwan adopt the "Korean formula" of 
allowing rice imports of one to two percent of domestic 
consumption in the first six years of Taiwan's GATT membership. 
  Foreign rice imports would gradually increase to four 
percent 
by the 10th year, Huang said. 
  Kenyon, however, suggested that the "Japanese formula" would 
be in Taiwan's best interests. Japan, at the end of last year, 
agreed to rice imports of between four and eight percent of 
domestic consumption for six years before moving to 
tariffication. 
  The "Korean formula," according to Kenyon, will not 
necessarily be a better policy for Taiwan, as Korea, while 
winning key concessions on rice, was forced to give ground on 
other farm product markets. 
  "Which may beget heavier losses for Taiwan," Kenyon said. 
  Taiwan has held a series of bilateral tariff negotiations 
with Hungary, South Africa, Chile, New Zealand, Turkey and 
Australia during the past week here. 
  A total of 21 countries have requested tariff-reduction 
negotiations with Taiwan. Results of these talks will be key to 
Taiwan's accession to the Geneva-based world trade body before 
the end of this year, according to chief Taiwan negotiator Huang 
Yen-chao.

  [Text] Beijing, March 26 (CNS) -- Early spring drought in 
Beijing is seriously threatening agriculture and dwellers living 
in mountainous areas there. The municipal government has called 
for the entire city to take urgent measures to combat the 
drought. 
  According to the municipal meteorological bureau, Beijing 
has 
had no soaking rain for fifteen months with an average rainfall 
of only 2.1 millimetres between last December until now, less 
than one- quarter of average rainfall in the same period in past 
years, making this fourth most serious drought year for the city 
this century. 
  The two biggest reservoirs in Beijing, the Guangting and 
Miyun reservoirs have seen their water storage falling by 600 
million cubic metres from that of the same period last year. 
Water storage in another 12 medium-scale reservoirs has also 
fallen by 45 million cubic metres. The city's underground water 
level has also dropped to a large extent. 
  The drought is seriously threatening agriculture and the 
people's lives there with 2.42 million mu wheat and over 800,000 
mu land area under spring sowing in urgent need of irrigation. 
The city's mountainous areas are now suffering insufficient 
water supply. 
  The municipal government has called for the whole city to 
combat the drought.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, 16 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- 
Cheng Weigao, secretary of the Hebei Provincial CPC Committee, 
recently stated that 10 different work styles among leading 
cadres were quite worthy of attention. They were: 
  --Vague leadership. Being contented with the current 
situation, not using their brains, being slack at work, having 
no distinguishing features, not making breakthroughs, and having 
no creativity in work. 
  --"Principle" leadership. Being accustomed to talking about 
great truths, general principles, and general concepts, but 
lacking deep and thorough analyses of problems, and not showing 
real knowledge and deep insight in light of reality when giving 
guidance to work. 
  --Wait-for-instruction leadership. Waiting for instructions 
from higher levels in handling any matter, acting according to 
what people at higher levels say, making no investigation, no 
studies, no personal stands, and taking no initiative for solid 
work in solving problems. 
  --Leadership of shirking responsibility. Shirking one's 
duties to higher or lower levels or to lateral organizations, 
making no progress in work, and blaming others for any mistakes 
made. 
  --Weak leadership. Trying hard to play the part of a good 
person, being afraid of confronting tough issues, of undertaking 
responsibility, of facing contradictions squarely, or of 
tackling difficult problems. 
  --Nonprofessional leadership. Not acquiring new knowledge 
and new skills on one's initiative despite changes in the 
situation, depending only on old experience and old ideas, 
looking triumphant and considering oneself right despite one's 
incompetence in work. 
  --Formalist leadership. Doing superficial work, seeking 
sensational effects, blowing one's own trumpet in writing 
articles and summing experience while paying no attention to 
actual results. 
  --Routine work leadership. Being busy with welcoming people 
and seeing people off, accompanying people to meetings and 
dinners, attending ceremonies for laying foundation stones and 
cutting ribbons, wasting energy on reading speeches, and failing 
to grasp essential work. 
  --Reckless leadership. Paying empty lip service, telling 
lies, forging accounts, reporting false achievements to put up 
an outward show and to please people at higher levels, striking 
one's chest and promising to do something which one never 
intends to do. 
  --Favor-currying leadership. Being enthusiastic in 
establishing relationships and visiting people, seeking fame and 
personal gain, and even openly demanding official posts and 
power. 
  A few days ago, Cheng Weigao, together with cadres of some 
provincial departments, went to Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and 
Cangzhou to carry out investigations. They discovered that an 
important reason why some localities had long been unable to 
open up a new situation and why work had not been properly done 
was that there were problems in the ideology and work styles of 
some leading cadres. Cheng Weigao pointed out that, although 
the number of cadres with the ideology and work styles mentioned 
above was small, their influence was bad. In some localities, 
many things had been delayed; reform, opening up, and economic 
construction had been prevented from developing better and 
faster; and the image of the party and the government among the 
people had been damaged, causing resentment among the people. 
  In view of problems in the ideology and work styles of 
leading cadres, Hebei Province has adopted corresponding 
measures for assessing and using cadres and for further 
establishing necessary rules and regulations.

  [Text] Conducting a conscientious investigation and study 
by delving deep into the nine unprofitable and difficult 
enterprises of Shijiazhuang city, Cheng Weigao, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, pointed out: To resolve 
enterprises' difficulties, we cannot be lazy, but should use the 
spirit of reform to make explorations and use reform methods to 
resolve difficulties. 
  Cheng Weigao said: Many reasons contribute to enterprises' 
deficits. We should wait, depend on nothing, and adopt 
different methods for them. As for enterprises that have been 
running in debt and have suffered serious losses for a long 
time, Cheng Weigao maintained: We should help them upgrade and 
update their products, accelerate technological transformation, 
and develop new products. Or we should help them use existing 
resources to carry out some other production. In the course of 
transforming mechanisms of enterprises and readjusting their 
production and operational structures, we should help 
unprofitable enterprises accelerate the readjustment of their 
organizational structures by encouraging them to incorporate or 
integrate themselves with others, to narrow their accounting 
units, to carry out the system of being run by the people but 
owned by the state, and to bring in foreign funds. For 
enterprises whose products are readily marketable, whose market 
prospects are relatively bright, but nonetheless suffer losses 
and are forced to stop production owing to a temporary lack of 
circulating funds, Cheng Weigao demanded: Such enterprises 
themselves should mete out plans for reducing losses, and 
governments and banks at all levels should help them tide over 
difficulties. In particular, for unprofitable enterprises which 
engage in production throughout the year and continue to sell 
their products, the unprofitable enterprises which engage in 
production on a season basis and sell their products throughout 
the year, and the enterprises whose products are related to the 
national economy and people's lives, the financial, tax, 
banking, industrial, commercial, and other related functional 
departments in all localities but suffer losses should give 
appropriate treatment to them within the scope of their powers. 
  Cheng Weigao stressed: This year, most reform measures will 
be set forth. Party committees and governments at all levels 
should become even more liberated in their ideas, even more 
dynamic in reform, and better in mental state in order to help 
unprofitable enterprises surmount difficulties and get out of 
difficult state on the basis of conducting in-depth 
investigation and study.

  [Text] On the afternoon of 6 March, Cheng Weigao, 
secretary of the provincial party committee, and Governor Ye 
Liansong respectively gave important speeches at the end of the 
provincial conference on building well-off rural areas. 
  Cheng Weigao said: In rural work, we have many tasks to 
perform. We must persist in giving overall consideration to 
building well-off rural areas. Most of Hebei's population is in 
the rural areas. Only by making peasants well-off on schedule 
can we have hopes and guarantee for making the people across the 
province become well-off. Building well-off rural areas is a 
complete system of targets and tasks. If we do a good job in 
grasping the building of well-off rural areas, we will be able 
to grasp the key point of the entire rural work and to fully 
boost the enthusiasm of the masses of peasants. 
  Cheng Weigao said: The building of well-off rural areas is a 
huge project. We must give prominence to the key points and 
carry it out in an all-round manner. The key points are: 
First, we should actively develop the high-yield, fine-quality, 
and highly efficient farming; second, actively develop township 
enterprises; and third, do a good job in family planning work. 
Only by grasping these three tasks well can we have guarantee 
for realizing the objective of making the rural areas well-off. 
To accelerate the building of well-off rural areas across the 
province, we must strive to make places with favorable 
conditions to become well-off ahead of other places. This is an 
issue stressed in Cheng Weigao's speech. He said: Things 
usually develop unevenly. It is impossible to make all the 
rural areas well-off simultaneously. We should help those 
places with good conditions accelerate development so that they 
can take the lead in making breakthroughs in this aspect and use 
their experience to guide the work of the entire area in an 
effort to attain the final goal of common prosperity. 
  Cheng Weigao stressed: To realize the goal of becoming 
well-off, we must establish incentive mechanism among county, 
township, and village cadres. County-level leading members must 
not be arbitrarily transferred in principle so as to keep them 
relatively stable. In the course of building well-off rural 
areas, those who make outstanding achievements should be 
awarded, those who basically fulfill the target should be 
retained for continued use, and those who fail to fulfill the 
target should be demoted. All localities may study and decide 
the incentive and restraint mechanisms of the township and 
village levels on their own. In short, through the 
establishment of incentive mechanism at all levels, we may form 
a strong motivation of making leading cadres work hard and 
enabling them to realistically concentrate their energy on 
making the rural areas well-off. 
  Ye Liansong also offered ideas at the conference on 
regarding 
the work of making the rural areas well-off as the overall task 
of the rural work and on striving to create a new situation in 
making the rural areas well-off. He called on all localities to 
realize the objective of making the rural areas well-off as an 
overall task in building an economically strong province and to 
work out plans carefully. Ye Liansong said: Building well-off 
rural areas is very important in the course of effecting a 
sustained, rapid, and sound development in the national economy. 
Party committees and governments at all levels must fully 
understand this point. In making the rural areas well-off, we 
should consider increasing the income of peasants as the 
nucleus, accelerating the development of commodity economy in 
the rural areas, and in doing specific work, improving thinking, 
giving different guidance according to the merit of each case, 
carrying out the work in an all-round manner, acting in line 
with the outlines of the Hebei Provincial plan on building 
well-off rural areas, and formulating development strategy in 
line with local advantages. Places along Bohai Bay, railway 
lines, and Beijing and Tianjin Municipalities should expand 
opening up and the development strength in the rural areas and 
actively develop suburban town economy and export-oriented 
economy; flatlands should strengthen the development and use of 
agricultural resources and actively develop high-yield, 
fine-quality, and highly efficient farming; the mountainous 
areas and upland areas have comparatively poor natural 
conditions, therefore, they should place the emphasis on 
forestry, fruit industry, animal husbandry, mining industry, and 
processing industry. 
  Ye Liansong stressed at the end of his speech: To strengthen 
leadership and to do a good job in building well-off rural 
areas, we must first attend to planning; second, progress; 
third, work evaluation; and fourth, consolidation of work 
achievements. If we grasp these four aspects of work well, we 
will have a guarantee for realizing the objective of becoming 
well-off throughout the province by 2000.

<F P=106> [Report by Han Zhi (7281 2535), Liu Hongxing (0491 4767 </F>
2502), and Chen Yongping (7115 3057 1627): "Further Emancipate 
the Mind, and Further Accelerate Agricultural and Animal 
Husbandry Development"] 
  [Excerpt] The regional agricultural and animal husbandry 
work conference successfully concluded at the auditorium of the 
regional government on the afternoon of 21 February after a 
four-day session. 
  Wu Liji presided over the closing session. Present were 
regional leaders Wang Qun, Bai Enpei, Liu Zuohui, Zhang Tingwu, 
Zhou Weide, Bao Wenfa, and Zhang Zuocai. Alatanaoqier, member 
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, was also present. Wang Qun and Wu Liji 
gave important speeches. 
  The theme of Wang Qun's speech was further emancipating the 
mind and further accelerating Inner Mongolia's agricultural and 
animal husbandry development. 
  He said: The year 1993 was an unusual year, when Inner 
Mongolia was hit by frequent disasters and had great 
difficulties. Despite such a condition, we still won unusual 
achievements. This was very encouraging. The series of figures 
provide us extremely rich content which merits our great 
attention and deep thought. The per capita net income of 
peasants and herdsmen totaled 829 yuan, the per capita net 
income of herdsmen totaled 1,164 yuan, and, in particular, the 
per capita net income of the herdsmen in Xilin Gol League 
totaled 1,759 yuan. What kind of an idea these figures have 
given us? They proved that we were approaching the targets of 
the two stages and the strategic plan to "rank among the best." 
They also showed that we had bravely emancipated the mind, 
seized the favorable opportunity, and raised our growth rate. 
At this conference, good news has kept pouring in from all 
localities. Our agriculture and animal husbandry are marching 
toward high yields, good quality, and high efficiency, and the 
scattered small-scale production is marching toward intensive 
management, efficiency of scale, and modernization. This has 
resulted from our comprehensive implementation of the party's 
line, principles, and policies since the third plenary session 
of the 11th party Central Committee, and it represents a leap 
from quantitative accumulation to qualitative transformation. 
At this moment, it is very important for us to call for further 
emancipation of the mind and further acceleration of 
agricultural and animal husbandry development when doing the 
economic work in rural and pastoral areas in 1994. Why is it 
that we call for "further" work in two aspects after winning 
such great achievements? 
  First, it is because of the guidelines of the third plenary 
session of the 14th party Central Committee and communists' 
strong sense of responsibility to the people. All localities in 
the country are trying to catch up with each other. How will we 
catch up with others? We should develop agriculture and animal 
husbandry, the foundation, to catch up with others. We have 
abundant resources and vast territory. When our 14 million 
agricultural and animal husbandry population become affluent, we 
will have caught up with the steps of the country. 
  Second, it is because of demand of the masses. Peasants and 
herdsmen long for accelerating development and achieving 
affluence as soon as possible. The eighth (enlarged) plenary 
session of the fifth autonomous regional party committee put 
forward the subject of steadily increasing the per capita income 
of peasants and herdsmen for discussion. The endeavor of 
steadily increasing the per capita income of peasants and 
herdsmen has become the core of future rural and pastoral work. 
In this regard, we should adhere to the principle of achieving 
the fastest development, the highest growth rate, and the 
largest increase we possibly can. We should make sure that the 
per capita net income of Inner Mongolia's peasants and herdsmen 
increases by 100 yuan over the past year after allowing for 
price rises. 
  Third, it is because of the need in our strategic 
development. In Inner Mongolia's strategy to transform 
resources, the greatest transformation is the resources of 
agriculture and animal husbandry. Only when agriculture and 
animal husbandry are stabilized and developed, can the secondary 
and tertiary industries and other undertakings be developed 
steadily. 
  Therefore, we can say that accelerating the emancipation of 
the mind and development of agriculture and animal husbandry is 
the guiding thought for the 1994 economic work of rural and 
pastoral areas. How can we accelerate? The establishment and 
improvement of the socialist market economy system after the 
third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee has 
provided us the best opportunity. This is the best external 
condition. Adjustments of the prices of farm, animal, and 
sideline products will bring tremendous benefits to peasants and 
herdsmen. However, we should also note that our internal 
factors have tremendous potential. In further accelerating 
agricultural and animal husbandry development, the most 
important work is adjusting the production structure and 
accelerating the integration of agriculture and animal 
husbandry. We have many good examples and very encouraging 
achievements in this work. For example, Hinggan League's "cow 
and milk project," Jirem League's Yuliangbao cattle and sheep 
breeding base, Ih Ju League's short-term sheep breeding base, 
Xilin Gol League's cattle and sheep breeding and male lamb 
breeding base, and the pig farming of Chifeng city and Jirem 
League. We also have a number of typical examples in the 
integration of farming and livestock breeding, such as the Ar 
Horqin and Bairin Right Banners of Chifeng city. Achievements 
in developing agriculture through the application of science and 
technology are even greater. Bayannur League's "construction of 
three types of farmland" and Hinggan League's export-oriented 
agriculture have provided us beneficial experiences, which we 
should value and attach importance to. As long as we work 
according to the law of the market, we will achieve the "two 
accelerations" and satisfy the masses. 
  In conclusion, Wang Qun said: Accelerating the emancipation 
of the mind and the development of agriculture and animal 
husbandry is a task for the entire party. We should embrace the 
idea of fighting a general war, win a victory in this war in 
1994, and create a new situation characterized by the 
large-scale increase of income and large-scale development of 
agriculture and animal husbandry. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The five-day study session for leading cadres of 
Tianjin Municipal discipline inspection and supervision organs 
successfully ended yesterday. Gao Dezhan travelled to the Party 
School of the municipal party committee to visit all attendees 
yesterday afternoon. He hoped that cadres of the municipal 
discipline inspection and supervision organs across the 
municipality will conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
submit themselves to and serve the overall situation of the 
whole party's work, further strengthen party style and 
administrative honesty, and make new contributions to reform, 
opening up, and modernization. 
  While holding cordial talks with attendees of the study 
session for discipline inspection and supervision organs, Gao 
Dezhan first extended regards to comrades of the discipline 
inspection and supervision departments at all levels across the 
municipality. He said: In 1993, with the common efforts of the 
broad masses of cadres of the discipline inspection and 
supervision departments and all sectors, effective results were 
achieved in Tianjin's discipline inspection and supervision 
work. This contributed greatly to Tianjin's reform, opening up, 
and economic construction and to the strengthening of party 
style and administrative honesty. The second plenary session of 
the sixth municipal party committee has worked out plans for 
carrying out all fields of work of the municipality this year. 
We must strengthen party style and administrative honesty, 
deeply conduct anticorruption struggle, and further deepen and 
develop this struggle on the basis of the expected results we 
made. We must submit our discipline inspection and supervision 
work to and serve the overall situation of the whole party's 
work of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, expanding 
opening up, promoting development and maintaining stability, 
further attend to party style and administrative honesty, and 
create good conditions for promoting reform, opening up, 
development, and stability in Tianjin. 
  Gao Dezhan said: It is good to hold this study session for 
discipline inspection and supervision cadres. The attendees 
have conscientiously studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and laid an 
ideological foundation for this year's discipline inspection and 
supervision work across the municipality. This work has been 
grasped early and successfully, and the fundamental points have 
been grasped. It is hoped that comrades on the discipline 
inspection and supervision front will work hard to create a new 
situation in discipline inspection and supervision work at their 
own work posts, realistically strengthen self-development, and 
make unceasing efforts to achieve new progress. 
  This study session organized 130 discipline inspection and 
supervision leading cadres to devote a period of time to further 
studying the guidelines of Volume No.3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping, the party Central Committee's 
"decision on several issues concerning the establishment of the 
socialist market economic structure," and Comrade Jiang Zemin's 
speech at the Spring Festival tea party for nonparty personages 
on 4 February, and the guidelines of the second enlarged plenary 
session of the sixth municipal party committee and of the 
municipal economic work conference, use these guidelines to arm 
their mind, unify thinking, and lay a good ideological 
foundation for pushing this year's discipline inspection and 
supervision work to a new height. 
  Liu Jinfeng, member of the standing committee of the 
municipal party committee and secretary of the municipal 
discipline inspection commission, gave a summing-up speech at 
the end of yesterday's study session. He said: This study 
session has some characteristics: The attendees have paid great 
attention to this session, given prominence to the major points 
of study, created a good study atmosphere, paid attention to 
establishing ties with the reality, and achieved great results 
in the study. In referring to the next step of study of the 
discipline inspection and supervision departments, he said: This 
study session is the beginning of theoretical study for the 
discipline inspection and supervision departments at all levels. 
Discipline inspection and supervision departments at all levels 
should regard theoretical study as a major matter and grasp it 
conscientiously. We must persist in studying theories with 
unremitting efforts. Leading cadres should take the lead in 
this aspect, pay attention to combining theory with practice and 
with all fields of work, promote discipline inspection work 
through study, raise this work to a new level, and make new 
contributions to promoting reform, opening up, development, and 
stability.

  [Text] Tianjin, March 26 (XINHUA) -- North China's port 
city of Tianjin is experiencing sustained growth in exports with 
a gross export value reaching 360 million U.S. dollars in the 
first two months of this year, a sizzling 20.4 percent rise from 
the same period in 1993. 
  And according to local economists, the surge will continue 
in 
the coming months. Total exports this year are expected to 
reach 2.3 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of more than 20 
percent over last year. 
  Figures from the municipal foreign trade and export 
department show that the city's export growth has paralleled its 
economic gains over the past three years. 
  The city has achieved a record export growth rate of 10 
percent in the past three years from 1991. The gross export 
volume in 1993 topped 1.94 billion U.S. dollars, more than 
doubling the amount in 1978. 
  Of the goods exported, about 82 percent were industrial end- 
products and 18 percent primary products; the products exported 
by foreign-funded firms and private businesses also rose sharply. 
  And many of these products have already entered the world 
market, spreading over 153 countries and regions throughout the 
world. 
  About 55 percent of the city's exports last year went to 
Hong 
Kong, Japan and the United States, and exports to East European 
countries and Russia have also been expanded over the past few 
years.

  [Text] Tianjin, March 25 (XINHUA) -- The real estate 
industry has become a prime investment field in north China's 
Tianjin city. 
  Statistics show that foreign investment in the real estate 
sector amounted to 233 million U.S. dollars in contractual 
volume in the first two months of the year. 
  Overseas investment concentrated on such fields as 
renovation 
or removal of dilapidated housing and building of hotels, 
villas, entertainment facilities and commercial buildings. 
  Experts here observed that the real estate investment trend 
started last year. They say that cheaper land prices than in 
Beijing and Shanghai, a lack of high-level hotels and a 
convenient transportation system are contributing to this 
investment fever. 
  According to officials, a large number of old houses within 
the city proper are still waiting to be razed to make way for 
construction of a five-star Shangri-La Hotel. 
  A heavy industrial center in northern China, Tianjin is 
about 
two hours from Beijing. It is also an important seaport in 
northern China. The city's population totals over nine million.

  [Text] On the afternoon of 30 March, at the anticorruption 
work conference held by the provincial government, Zhao Zhihao, 
deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor 
of the province, mobilized all government organs in the province 
to oppose corruption and advocate administrative honesty in a 
profound, sustained, and even more effective way, with a focus 
on the three tasks. 
  After fully affirming the achievements scored by the 
province 
in opposing corruption, Zhao Zhihao pointed out: This year, the 
task on maintaining stability is extremely arduous, and 
corruption is one of the major factors affecting stability. 
Failing to effectively punish and check corruption will cause 
complaints among the masses, is liable to provoke disturbances, 
and will affect overall stability. For this reason, all 
departments at all levels, principal leading comrades in 
particular, must have a full understanding of anticorruption 
work, keep sober-minded, and guard against negligence and 
slackness. 
  Zhao Zhihao stressed: The priorities for this year's 
anticorruption work are to make leading cadres administratively 
honest and self-disciplined, to investigate and deal with 
related cases, and to correct unhealthy trends. All departments 
at all levels should strengthen the supervision by the masses, 
by the press, and by special organs, and should consciously 
subject themselves to supervision by people's deputies and 
members of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, 
with a focus on resolving the prominent problems of their own 
units, in accordance with the new contents and new demands set 
by the three tasks and in line with their respective realities. 
Governments at all levels and all leading cadres should not 
only take the lead in being self- disciplined but also pay 
attention to opposing corruption and support functional 
departments perform duties and do their work well. 
  The conference was presided over by Zhang Ruifeng, vice 
governor of the province. Attending the conference were Tan 
Fude, standing committee member of the provincial party 
committee and secretary of the provincial discipline inspection 
commission; Wang Jiangong, vice governor of the province; and 
Han Bangju and Ma Changgui, special advisers to the provincial 
government.

  [Text] Lunan Cement Plant, China's first modernized large 
cement enterprise to use domestically produced equipment 
designed in China, and to be furnished with two new production 
lines, formally passed the state acceptance test on 30 March. 
This is a breakthrough in China's large cement industry as well 
as a milestone in the history of developments in the building 
materials industry. This has also put an end to China's long 
history of importing modernized cement production lines from 
abroad. The construction of the Lunan Cement Plant is a key 
project of the state during the Seventh Five-Year Plan period. 
All the major equipment of this plant was produced by China 
itself. The two new production lines with a daily production 
capacity of 2,000 tonnes of clinker [words indistinct] are 
designed to produce 1.3 million tonnes of cement annually. 
  Zou Jiahua, vice premier of the State Council; and Wang 
Guangying, Lei Jieqiong, and Lu Jiaxi, vice chairmen of the 
National People's Congress Standing Committee, wrote 
inscriptions for and congratulated Lunan Cement Plant on its 
receipt of state approval. Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, sent a congratulatory message to the 
plant. (Zhang Renwei), director of the State Building Materials 
Bureau, and Li Wenquan, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, attended the completion ceremony.

  [Text] Ningbo, March 31 (XINHUA) -- The Beilun Port of 
this coastal city in Zhejiang Province, one of China's four 
major deepwater harbors, has become a key transit port for 
imported iron ore. 
  So far, 14 large and medium-sized iron and steel complexes 
along the Chang Jiang river and interior parts of the country 
have imported iron ore via the port. 
  The special wharf of the port began to serve the Shanghai 
Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex, a large modern enterprise, in 
1982 and later the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex. 
  To meet the needs of different iron and steel plants, the 
Beilun Port has expanded its stockyards three times to raise its 
storage capacity from the original 500,000 tons to one million 
tons at present. 
  A survey shows that the port has handled 40 million tons of 
imported iron ore in 20 varieties so far. 
  At present, construction of another iron ore wharf able to 
accommodate 300,000-dwt [deadweight ton] ships is proceeding 
well. 
  It will be able to handle between 28 million tons and 30 
million tons of iron ore a year upon completion.

  [Text] Starting in April, China will institute a new 
system of supplying grain to troops -- this was decided by the 
Eighth National Meeting on Troops' Grain Work, which just ended. 
Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, pointed out at the 
meeting: The supply of grain to the troops is a serious 
political task, and ensuring this supply has great significance 
for maintaining stability, promoting economic construction, and 
ensuring national security. Bai Meiqing, vice minister of 
internal trade and director of the State Grain Storage Bureau, 
explained details of the troops' grain supply system reform. The 
main changes are: Grain for the troops will be purchased on a 
negotiated-price basis instead of being purchased at contract 
prices set by the state, and grain will be supplied to troops at 
set prices; differences in the prices of grain, oil, and 
soybeans for this winter will be made up for by central and 
provincial financial departments; financial matters concerning 
the purchase of grain for the troops are to be managed 
separately and [words indistinct]; and all these financial 
matters are to be referred to a provincial-level financial 
department. After the reform is instituted, the supply of grain 
and oil for this winter will continue to be managed by grain 
departments, and supplies must be ensured.

Jia Yong (6328 3057)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 29 Mar (XINHUA) -- An All-Army Center for 
the Study of the Theory of Building Socialism with Chinese 
Characteristics was founded today at the PLA [People's 
Liberation Army] National Defense University. On behalf of the 
Central Military Commission (CMC), Yu Yongbo, member of the CMC 
and director of the General Political Department, attended a 
ceremonial meeting to express his congratulations. He urged 
all-army theoretical workers to shoulder their historical 
mission and provide better services to army building and reform; 
to the strategic mission of arming the whole army with the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; the 
improvement of the army's Marxist theoretical level; and to the 
self-awareness and resolution of the broad masses of officers 
and soldiers in carrying out the party's basic line. 
  The center, which is located in the PLA National Defense 
University, is one of five devoted to the study of the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Establishing 
these centers is a strategic move by the CPC Central Committee, 
aimed at strengthening the whole party's ideological 
construction and pushing forward China's reform, opening up, and 
modernization drive. The center's fundamental tasks are to 
deepen the whole army's theoretical studies, continuously 
enhance the quality and effectiveness of such studies, and to 
guide cadres and soldiers to accurately assess, based on the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
various new experiences and problems cropping up in today's 
society; and to help them sum up new experiences and conduct new 
theoretical explorations by closely integrating the realities of 
reform and opening up to further enrich and develop the theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  During his speech, Yu Yongbo pointed out: Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics represents an energetic Marxism for contemporary 
China, a strong ideological weapon for pushing forward China's 
cause of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, and a 
fundamental guiding principle for all our work. The fundamental 
task for the ideological and theoretical front lies in arming 
the thinking of the whole party, whole army, and people across 
the country with the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. At present, China's economic restructuring has 
developed to a critical stage where major breakthroughs are 
integrated with overall progress. Only when we strengthen the 
study and publicity of the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and turn it into a genuinely strong 
spiritual pillar for the whole party, whole army, and all 
nationalities across the country, and enable them to 
conscientiously apply it in answering and solving various 
important issues encountered during the course of reform, 
opening up, and the modernization drive, can we make new 
contributions to reform, development, and stability; and ensure 
the success of the great cause of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. 
  Yu Yongbo said: The center's tasks include the following 
points: First, by summing up our party's past experiences, it 
should comprehensively and accurately master the scientific 
system of the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. It should unswervingly uphold and carry out 
the party's basic line, and play an exemplary role in studying 
and mastering the guiding spirit of this theory. Second, by 
closely combining the realities of reform and opening up and 
with the help of the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, it should explore and answer various important 
theoretical and practical issues in our society; and play a 
leading role in explaining and giving publicity to the party's 
various principled policies. Third, while giving prominence to 
the army's own characteristics, it should strive to implement 
Comrade's Deng Xiaoping's ideological thinking concerning army 
building in the actual work of troops during the new period. It 
should provide theoretical explanations for some important 
issues in army building, and play a consultative role for the 
CMC and the three headquarters in making scientific decisions. 
Fourth, it should pay attention to the situation of the army's 
ideological construction at all times and guide the troops to do 
a good job in instilling this theory. It should make great 
efforts to encourage healthy trends, and play a guiding role in 
improving spiritual civilization construction. Fifth, guided by 
the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, it 
should continuously strengthen contacts and cooperation with 
research centers of the Central Party School, Chinese Academy of 
Social Sciences, and State Education Commission as well as other 
research institutes. It should play a linking role in 
facilitating the flow of exchanges and results of civil-military 
research activities. It should shoulder the great 
responsibility of "arming the people with scientific theories" 
and provide better services to the state's reform, opening up, 
and modernization drive as well as to the enhancement of the 
troops' combat effectiveness. 
  Attending the meeting were responsible comrades of the 
General Political Department, PLA National Defense University, 
Propaganda Department, Central Party School, State Education 
Commission, and Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

Zhang Dongbo (1728 2639 3134)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 30 Mar (XINHUA) -- The General Staff 
Department, General Political Department, and General Logistics 
Department of the People's Liberation Army today jointly issued 
a "Circular on Tightening Control Over the Budget," calling on 
all army units to practically strengthen leadership over budget 
control; tighten control; manage money matters according to the 
law; and ensure an overall balance between receipts and payments 
in the annual budget. 
  The "Circular" requires that units at and above regimental 
level in the whole army must incorporate all receipts and 
payments of outlays in the annual budget according to 
regulations, and must not practice "external circulation." When 
compiling an annual budget, they should draw up an annual budget 
plan for outlays on the basis of actual needs and financial 
capacity, and through earnest study and adequate proof. The 
compilation of a budget for different outlay items for the same 
unit or within a department shall be under the direct 
administration of financial departments. After the budget is 
examined by the party committee, it shall be reported to the 
higher authorities for approval. The compilation of a budget 
must not include a multitude of outlay items. Once a budget is 
approved, it shall have legal effect and no unit or department 
is permitted to alter it without authorization. After an annual 
budget is issued to the lower levels, there will be no more 
examination or approval of fragmentary outlay items. It is 
necessary to strictly implement a budget control responsibility 
system; all outlays earmarked for the budget control contractual 
responsibility system must be channeled to their recipients. It 
is necessary to bring expenditures on capital construction 
outlays under control; all capital construction projects must be 
incorporated into the plan and placed under centralized control. 
No unit or department is permitted to alter a construction 
project without authorization or carry out construction of a 
project in excess of approved standards or area. If the source 
of funds for a construction project to be financed by a unit or 
department from funds raised by itself is improper, it must not 
be reported to the higher authorities and must not be treated as 
a project; in such a case, even though a capital construction 
plan has been issued to the lower levels, construction of the 
project is not permitted to start. 
  The "Circular" stipulates that extra outlays kept by units 
and departments at all levels in reserve for emergency use shall 
be placed under centralized control by party committees and 
under the direct administration of logistic financial 
departments. The use of such extra outlays shall be under a 
complete rationing system; their use shall be proposed by 
relevant departments and, after examination and approval by 
financial departments, shall be reported to chiefs in charge for 
approval, provided the amount of such extra outlays do not 
exceed their prescribed standards (norms). 
  The "Circular" stresses: It is necessary for organs and, in 
particular, leading cadres at all levels to take the lead in 
handling jobs according to budget. They are not permitted to 
approve, earmark, or answer questions on outlays as they please. 
Auditing departments must audit and supervise budgets for all 
departments at all levels and their implementation, and must 
sternly deal with those who violate the regulations on budget 
control.

  [Text] Beijing, March 31 (AFP)--China denied Thursday that 
it was blocking UN efforts to solve the North Korean nuclear 
standoff, while reiterating its firm opposition to a binding 
Security Council resolution on the issue. "There is no question 
of being uncooperative," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu 
Jianmin, who touted China's preference for a "moderately-worded" 
presidential council statement as the best step towards a 
peaceful resolution of the Korean crisis. "We stand for a 
moderately worded, constructive presidential Security Council 
statement that is designed to facilitate the parties concerned 
... to resume dialogue on this question," Wu said. "This is a 
well-considered position," he added. 
  His remarks came after China split with the rest of the 
council members Wednesday over the form and substance of a 
warning to North Korea over its suspected nuclear bomb 
programme. Western powers, especially the United States, have 
pushed hard for a binding resolution that would promise further 
action--a thinly veiled reference to possible economic 
sanctions--against North Korea over its failure to give 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors access to 
all its nuclear facilities. 
  Exerting pressure on Pyongyang "can only deteriorate the 
atmosphere and aggravate the problem," Wu stressed. "Therefore 
we do not accept a Security Council resolution," he said, adding 
that China's insistence on a presidential statement "represents 
an effort to facilitate the resumption of dialogue." Wu, who 
declined to specify whether China would veto any UN resolution, 
called on the parties concerned "to demonstrate patience and 
cool-headedness" given the potential threat to regional 
stability posed by the volatile situation on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  China's rejection of a binding resolution effectively 
scotched plans for a Security Council warning to be issued to 
North Korea late Thursday, as non-aligned council member states 
called for more time to reach a consensus on a message that 
could receive unanimous support.

  [Text] Beijing, March 31 (XINHUA) -- The European 
Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) has cooperated 
successfully with China, Professor C.H. Llewellyn Smith, 
director general of Cern, said in an interview with XINHUA here 
today. 
  CERN, set up in 1954, is the world's biggest organization 
for 
basic research on particle physics. 
  Nineteen countries participate in CERN, with 5,000 staff 
members and 500 scientists from outside the participant 
countries. 
  Prof. Smith said CERN has attracted scientists from around 
the globe, and its research is of great significance. At 
present, half of the world's high-energy physicists are listed 
in CERN. 
  He said CERN has cooperated with China for more than 10 
years, and about 80 Chinese scientists are doing research in 
CERN today. 
  Smith said, "We very much welcome Chinese scientists to join 
CERN. They bring with them wisdom and products. We are looking 
forward to further cooperation with China, including cooperation 
in new experiments and construction of new accelerators." 
  He said CERN's success is the result of close cooperation 
between scientists from different countries. 
  Chinese scientists have contributed a lot to the L3 
[expansion unknown] experiment chaired by famous physicist Prof. 
Samuel C.C. Ting, Smith added. 
  Prof. Ting, a Nobel laureate in physics, told XINHUA that 
his 
joint work with Chinese scientists dates back to 1977, after 
which time 10 to 20 Chinese scientists were sent to work with 
him annually. 
  He said that the Chinese scientists had made important 
contributions in the fields of theory and digital analysis. 
  He said Chinese scientists collaborated in the design and 
construction of Laboratory L3 in 1982. They undertook the 
building and experiments on the BGO crystal, a time- and 
energy-consuming task. 
  Due to their efforts, the first mass quantity of BGO 
crystal, 
12 tons, was reaped. 
  As for CERN-China cooperation promoting China's research in 
high energy physics, Smith said that the cooperation provided 
Chinese scientists with opportunities to explore physical 
origins on the front line of physical structure research while 
exposing them to a lot of high technologies, concerning 
superconduction, high frequencies, high vacuums and computer 
networking, thus training them well in these aspects.

  [Text] Washington, March 30 (CNA) -- The ROC [Republic of 
China] Government has reaffirmed its commitment to eradicating 
the trade in endangered species. The ROC representative's 
office in Washington said Wednesday [30 March] that the ROC 
Government shares the U.S. Government's commitment to 
eradicating the illegal wildlife trade, but believes dialogue 
and cooperation, rather than sanctions, are the best means of 
achieving progress toward this goal. 
  The office issued the statement in response to a news 
release 
sent out by Senator Jim Jeffords (R-VT.) in which the senator 
said that 25 senators and 13 representatives have joined him in 
forwarding a letter to President Bill Clinton asking him to 
consider taking limited trade sanctions against Taiwan and 
Mainland China for their continued illegal trade in rhino horn 
and tiger parts. 
  The office pointed out that the ROC Executive Yuan recently 
approved amendments to the Wildlife Conservation Law that would 
make trade in endangered species a crime punishable by prison 
terms up to five years and/or fines up to U.S.$60,000. 
  In addition, it added, prison terms for repeat offenders 
would be lengthened to as much as seven years, and the maximum 
fine would increase to approximately U.S.$100,000 under the 
amendments expected to be passed by the Legislative Yuan soon. 
  It said that the government has also been conducting 
island-wide crackdowns in Taiwan, involving undercover 
investigations on establishments selling traditional medicine. 
  It said that the efforts of the ROC Government were 
acknowledged at the meeting last week of the Standing Committee 
of the United Nations Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species (CITES). During the meeting, CITES decided 
that Taiwan should be given more time to implement wildlife 
conservation measures and postpone any decisions on sanctions to 
November. 
  Sen. Jeffords also introduced legislation in the Senate 
calling for the setup of a fund to support conservation programs 
of nations whose activities affect rhino and tiger populations 
as well as automatic sanctions against nations violating 
endangered species laws.

"We Should Conscientiously Study, Publicize, and Implement the 
State Council's Important Written Reply and `Beijing's Overall 
Urban Plan'"] 
  [Excerpt] At a standing committee meeting of the municipal 
party committee held on the morning of 23 February, Chen Xitong, 
secretary of the municipal party committee, emphasized that the 
entire municipality should conscientiously study, publicize, and 
implement State Council's important written reply and "Beijing's 
overall urban plan," make concerted efforts, and strive to build 
Beijing into a fairly modern international city by 2010. 
  Participants at the meeting heard a speech given by a 
responsible person from the committee for planning and 
construction in the capital on opinions concerning the study, 
publicity, and implementation of the State Council's important 
written reply and the arrangements for "Beijing's overall urban 
plan." 
  Chen Xitong gave a speech. He said: Beijing's former 
leaders formulated the "initial program for Beijing's overall 
urban construction plan" as early as the 1950's, enabling 
Beijing to score great achievements in construction and 
development. After the "Great Cultural Revolution" started, 
Beijing was forced to stop implementing the "overall plan," and 
urban construction was bogged down in chaos. After the 10-year 
turmoil, we reformulated "Beijing's overall urban construction 
plan" based on the original plan and new conditions, which was 
approved in principle, with an important written reply attached, 
by the CPC Central Committee and State Council in 1983. 
Practice in the past 10 years proved that this plan is correct 
and has yielded great results and brought about great changes in 
Beijing's urban and rural outlook. However, this plan was drawn 
up under the condition of the planned economy, and some aspects 
have failed to suit the new situation and need to be revised and 
developed due to the political, economic, and social development 
of the capital and the growth of its population. 
  Chen Xitong pointed out: A prominent characteristic of the 
new overall plan is the strengthening of tertiary industry to 
meet the needs of the socialist market economy. In the past, 
Beijing's lack of markets brought many inconveniences. Tertiary 
industry has been expanded over the past years, but this is 
still not sufficient and helpful to the development of the city, 
and people still have inconveniences in living. We should 
attach great importance to the development of tertiary industry. 
The new overall plan also gives prominence to the strategic 
gradual transfer from downtown areas to outer suburbs in urban 
construction and the strategic shift from expansion by building 
new projects to adjustment and renovation in the construction of 
the downtown areas. This conforms with Beijing's reality. Party 
and government leaders, people's congress standing committees, 
committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, and people across the municipality should all 
conscientiously study, publicize, and implement State Council's 
important written reply and "Beijing's overall urban plan," make 
concerted efforts, and strive to build Beijing into a fairly 
modern international city by 2010. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In his speech given to the second enlarged plenary 
session of the provincial discipline inspection commission on 
the morning of 29 March, Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, pointed out: Party and government 
leading cadres at all levels should be aware of hardships, 
approach the problem of corruption from the perspective of the 
rise and fall and life and death of the major socialist causes, 
enhance the sense of responsibility and urgency toward the 
endeavor to oppose corruption and advocate honesty, truly regard 
the anticorruption struggle as a long-term task and carry it out 
persistently. 
  After fully affirming Shandong's achievements in the 
anticorruption struggle carried out previously, Jiang Chunyun 
said: This year is a very important year for restructuring the 
economy, in which the following new characteristics will emerge 
in the anticorruption struggle. First, extended reform will set 
new and still higher demands on the anticorruption struggle. 
Second, the tasks of the anticorruption struggle will become 
heavier. Third, people will have higher requirements and 
expectations. Leading cadres at all levels should clearly 
understand these new conditions and new characteristics. They 
must note that both the tasks of the current reform and 
development and the tasks of the endeavor to oppose corruption 
and advocate honesty are heavy and arduous. They must pay close 
attention to and achieve success in these two fields of tasks 
and never slacken efforts. They should let the anticorruption 
struggle be manifest in the entire process of reform, opening 
up, and the socialist modernization drive. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: We should have a good command of 
the guiding thoughts, oppose corruption to meet the overall 
interests of the work of the entire party and entire country, 
and combine the endeavor to oppose corruption with the endeavors 
to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote 
development, and maintain stability. We should emphasize the 
following points. We should include the anticorruption work in 
the overall situation, merge it into economic construction, 
reform, and opening up as a whole, take them into consideration, 
and make all-around arrangements for them. In coordination with 
the execution of major policy decisions on reform and opening 
up, we should study and draw up supporting measures to counter 
the problems that might arise in the efforts to improve party 
style and administrative honesty. We should regard the negative 
and corrupt phenomena that affect reform, development, and 
stability as conspicuous problems and make efforts to address 
them. In particular, we should strictly deal with the abuse of 
power for selfish gains and the trade between money and power, 
which are done under the banner of developing the market 
economy, reform, and opening up, and the law and discipline 
breaches characterized by refusals to implement orders and 
prohibitions in defiance of the overall situation and 
instructions for the purpose of protecting the interests of a 
locality or a department. Through reform, we should solve 
step-by-step the deep-seated problems that lead to corruption 
and, instead of waiting for and relying on help, take the 
initiative in exploration and effectively check the emergence 
and spreading of negative and corrupt phenomena by improving and 
strengthening laws, regulations, and systems. 
  Jiang Chunyun emphasized: We should give prominence to 
priorities of work and accomplish all the anticorruption tasks. 
According to the arrangements of the central authorities, the 
focuses of this year's anticorruption work are on leading 
cadres' honesty and self-discipline, the investigation and 
handling of law and discipline breaches, and the correction of 
the unhealthy trends in some trades. These three aspects of 
work constitute a whole, which are related to and promote each 
other, and we should carry them out in an all-around manner. To 
whether we can resolutely punish corrupt elements, effectively 
eliminate the numerous negative and corrupt phenomena, and 
correct the unhealthy trends in some trades, the key lies in 
party and government leading cadres' effort to take the lead in 
maintaining honesty and self-discipline. In opposing corruption 
and advocating honesty, party organizations at all levels should 
make the best use of both positive and negative examples to 
educate leading cadres on the outlook on life, outlook on the 
world, and the party's purpose. All leading cadres should 
exercise strict self-discipline, often examine and remold 
themselves; take the initiative in resisting the erosion of 
various corrupt ideas; stand the tests of money, sex, and power; 
and always subject themselves to the supervision of the party 
and the masses. 
  Jiang Chunyun urged: To make this year's anticorruption work 
successful, we should strengthen leadership and have realistic 
and feasible guaranteeing measures. We should pay particular 
attention to the following work. First, principal leading 
cadres of party and government organs should hold the overall 
responsibility and attend to the work personally. Second, 
central principles and policies on the anticorruption struggle 
should be conscientiously implemented, and the work focus should 
be placed on party and government leading organs, judicial 
departments, law-enforcing administrative departments, economic 
management departments, and, in particular, leading cadres at 
and above the county or section level. Third, supervision and 
examination should be a success. Fourth, we should step up 
efforts to establish policies, laws, regulations, and systems. 
Fifth, we should make conscientious efforts to handle cases 
well. Sixth, we should attach importance to propaganda by the 
media. We should publicize some selected typical cases to 
educate cadres and masses and to form a necessary deterrent 
force. We should also attach importance to publicizing positive 
examples and the party's fine traditions and work styles to 
establish in and outside the party the positive and healthy 
practice of feeling honored to be honest and ashamed to be 
corrupt and going all out to make progress so that we can 
provide a good media environment for the anticorruption work. 
  Tan Fude, standing committee member of the provincial party 
committee and secretary of the provincial discipline inspection 
commission, chaired the session. Attending were Zhao Zhihao, 
deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor 
of the province; Lu Maozeng, chairman of the provincial 
committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference; Ma Zhongcai, vice chairman of the provincial 
people's congress standing committee; and Zhang Ruifeng, vice 
governor.

<F P=106> ["Notes on Northern Journey" by staff reporter Lo Ping (5012 </F>
0393): "Deng Xiaoping Directs Six Old Men To Take Over the 
Reins After His Death"] 
  [Text] A break in tradition produced great repercussions 
like thunder shaking the valley. The CPC top leaders strongly 
and continuously criticized the television broadcasting of 
footage of Deng Xiaoping's sickly appearance on 8 February. In 
society, when people saw another face of the paramount leader, 
who used to glow with vigor, they could not help but sigh: Deng 
Xiaoping's days are numbered! A great question then arose in 
their minds: What will happen after Deng's death??? 
  The CPC Central Secretariat has now given out the following 
message: Deng Xiaoping has made a five-point verbal 
"injunction," and the most important point was that he directed 
that: "After I pass away, you should consult Wan Li, Bo Yibo, 
Li Desheng, Yang Dezhi, Gu Mu, and Jiwei when dealing with 
important affairs." 
  It was noteworthy that Wan Li ranked first among the six, 
causing people to recall a popular saying from the late 1970's: 
"Go and see Wan Li if you want to have something to eat." In 
those days, Wan Li was a provincial leader of Anhui and the 
province took the lead throughout the country in adopting the 
farmland contract system and breaking the people's-commune 
structure. This was a very popular move and Wan Li also won 
Deng Xiaoping's trust. It has yet to be verified whether Deng 
now actually entrusts Wan Li with holding the reins as Mao 
Zedong entrusted Hua Guofeng before his death by saying: "With 
you in charge, I can set my mind at rest." We can believe this 
is true for the time being. 
  What is mentioned above was the first point of Deng's 
injunction. Before the remark "after I pass away," there was 
another remark: "In recent years, the Central Political Bureau 
and the State Council have been doing well-organized work and I 
am glad to see this and also feel relieved." An interesting 
fact is that on 7 March, when Jiang Zemin and Ding Guangen 
relayed Deng Xiaoping's "five-point hopes" to the Political 
Bureau, the Secretariat, and the State Council leading body 
through Wang Ruilin (director of Deng Xiaoping's office), the 
first point was as mentioned above; however, on the same day, 
when Hu Jintao relayed this at a Central Secretariat meeting 
attended by leaders of the provincial and municipal party 
committees, some deletions were made. There was no remark about 
"after I pass away" and only two of the six people were named: 
Wan Li and Bo Yibo. The first point relayed by Hu Jintao read: 
"Henceforth, you may consult such comrades as Wan Li and Yibo 
whenever you find this is necessary." 
  By comparing the two versions relayed by Jiang Zemin and Hu 
Jintao, one can easily see that first, the CPC leading body did 
not want to make people think that Deng was going to "pass 
away"; second, they tried to prevent people from taking Deng's 
"instruction" as his "death-bed injunction"; and third, the 
Political Bureau holds a consensus of opinion on Wan Li and Bo 
Yibo, two of Deng's "bosom friends." 
  Anyway, CPC leaders at all levels are well aware that after 
Deng's death, while Jiang Zemin and Li Peng are in charge of the 
government, Wan Li and Bo Yibo will oversee them and play the 
part that Deng Xiaoping is now playing. 
  In the not too distant future, if there are no changes like 
those in East Europe and the former Soviet Union and no major 
changes with "Chinese characteristics" in mainland China, after 
Deng Xiaoping departs the human world, Wan Li and Bo Yibo will 
take over Deng Xiaoping's political status. Wan Li may not have 
the same authority as Deng Xiaoping has now but his hands are 
not stained with the blood of the victims in the 4 June incident 
and he is also more popular with intellectuals and ordinary 
people than Deng in terms of being open-minded. Many people 
have regarded Wan Li as a firm reform-minded leader for a long 
time. Therefore, if Jiang Zemin and Li Peng actually follow 
Deng's "injunction," the CPC will probably fare better than it 
does now. Maybe, this is the reason why Deng Xiaoping selected 
Wan Li and Bo Yibo as his "successors." Of course, the only way 
out for the Communist Party is to terminate the rule-of-man and 
one-party dictatorship and take the path of peaceful changes. 
  Apart from the abovementioned point, which was also the most 
important point, Jiang Zemin and other leaders also relayed four 
other points: 
  Exchange opinions and unify thinking inside the leading 
body, 
when handling major affairs and encountering major problems, and 
make decisions and take actions resolutely and firmly. 
  Continue to consolidate and develop the system of democratic 
centralism inside the party and take this as a major principle; 
do not allow the existence of small "coteries" inside the 
leading body. 
  Leading bodies at the central level and at the ministerial 
and provincial level should consistently inspect things in 
society and, thus, personally collect first-hand information. 
They must not be divorced from the masses while handling a 
multitude of affairs. 
  Continue to maintain the independent and peace-oriented 
foreign policy as in the past, at present, and in the future; 
resolutely oppose and resist hegemonism and power politics; 
develop friendly relations with countries which are friendly 
toward us and respect our sovereignty and internal affairs on 
the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; and 
give priority to establishing and developing friendly, mutually 
trusting, cooperative, and understanding relations with 
neighboring countries. This should be our country's long-term 
strategy. 
  Apart from the five points, Deng Xiaoping also mentioned 
the issue of national reunification in his "injunction" about 
what should be done after he "passes away." According to what 
was relayed, Deng said: China will not be really prosperous and 
powerful as long as the nation is still not reunified and 
Taiwan's peaceful return is still unrealized. Every one of our 
party members and cadres with the aspiration must not be 
arrogant and must not relax their efforts as long as this 
important mission is unfulfilled. 
  What is noteworthy in the remarks is the term "peaceful 
return." Deng did not mention "peaceful liberation" or 
"liberation through armed force." It was sensible of him not to 
mention "liberation" but "return" because the people in Taiwan 
are living in better conditions than ordinary people in the 
mainland (both in their material and cultural lives) and they do 
not need the Communist Party's "liberation." It is sensible and 
realistic to mention "peaceful return" rather than "armed 
liberation" because, once force is used, the Communist Party 
will certainly become the accused in the court of morals. 
People who are keen to launch a war and to kill their own 
countrymen will certainly be punished by the 1.2 billion Chinese 
people and the people all over the world. The four characters 
of "peaceful return" [he ping hui gui 0735 1627 0932 2981] were 
rather noticeable, because this showed that Deng Xiaoping 
remained sober-headed, perhaps more sober-headed than before. 
This is an extremely important message for the Taiwan 
authorities and the people of Taiwan. 
  In order to strengthen the Deng Xiaoping Office and to keep 
close ties between Deng and the Political Bureau, according to a 
proposal by Wang Ruilin, director of the Deng Xiaoping office, 
the Political Bureau appointed Deng Rong as deputy director of 
the Deng Xiaoping Office, because Wang Ruilin had participated 
in the actual leading body of the Central Military Commission 
since January this year and was responsible for the political 
and ideological work in the armed forces and the organization of 
the leading bodies at units at and above the division level. 
However, on learning that Deng Rong had been appointed deputy 
director of his office, Deng Xiaoping deleted the relevant words 
in the proposal and told Wang Ruilin: I object to this. This 
is improper. Comrade Ruilin is able to properly handle many 
things. Deng Rong often accompanies me, so she can be a 
part-time assistant in the office but no official title should 
be given to her. Please consider my opinion. Deng Rong's 
official title caused people to recall that Mao Zedong made his 
nephew Mao Yuanxin play the role of a liaison officer between 
him and the Political Bureau in his later years. Deng Rong is 
not equal to Mao Yuanxin but the traditional working mode of the 
Political Bureau obviously remains the same. On this point, 
Deng Xiaoping also has to follow Mao Zedong's example. 
  Undoubtedly, Deng Xiaoping has entered the last stage of his 
life and is not far from the end. The CPC top leaders are aware 
of this but they still try to extend Deng's life. The following 
episode occurred in recent months: 
  In mid-February, 12 senior retired leaders, including Song 
Renqiong, Song Ping, Yao Yilin, and Chen Zuolin, jointly wrote a 
letter to the CPC Central Political Bureau and Jiang Zemin, 
requiring that the Political Bureau properly take care of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's health and take this as an important 
matter entrusted by the whole party, the whole Army, and the 
entire people of the whole country. The letter said: On 8 
February, Comrade Xiaoping met with Shanghai CPC and Government 
leaders when he was rather tired and the unfavorable impression 
left with the whole nation, the whole party, and overseas 
communities should not be underestimated. The central leading 
body was wrong in making such an arrangement. They proposed 
that the Central Political Bureau hold a meeting to discuss 
arrangements to ensure Comrade Xiaoping's rest and recuperation 
and to see that he was not bothered about any ordinary and 
routine affairs which were not urgent nor critically important. 
His rest must not be affected and disrupted. Reportedly, after 
listening to opinions from Wan Li, Peng Zhen, Bo Yibo, Yang 
Shangkun, and Wang Ruilin, Jiang Zemin made the following reply: 
First, the Political Bureau will do its utmost to properly take 
care of Comrade Xiaoping's health and ensure his longevity and 
will bear the greatest responsibility to the whole party, the 
whole Army, and the entire people throughout the country; 
second, there is no need to change the resolutions adopted by 
the First and Third Plenary Sessions of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee. 
  At a party meeting in late February, Wan Li said: Comrade 
Xiaoping's devotion to the party's cause and his strong will 
power determine that he will not stay idle and will not just 
rest without doing anything. Old comrades inside the party 
should be well aware of this, so their criticism about that was 
not serious. 
  Outside the Political Bureau, the CPC leadership continued 
to 
stress three points: First, Deng remains in good health; 
second, he may sometimes have some minor illnesses; third, there 
will be no trouble after he passes away. During the "two 
sessions," Wan Li also answered questions about Deng's health 
when receiving National People's Congress deputies and Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference members. He said: 
Comrade Xiaoping remains in good health. We play bridge twice 
a week. Comrade Xiaoping's reaction is no worse than some 
people in their 50's or 60's. However, he sometimes takes his 
time in playing. He has no serious or fatal disease. As an old 
man, he may be ill from time to time, and he has always been 
receiving medical care. The central leadership has made careful 
and concrete arrangements. After Comrade Xiaoping passes away, 
there will be absolutely no change in our country's economy, 
principles, and policies. 
  It is obvious that the CPC authorities are trying hard to 
stabilize the situation and reduce the shocks once Deng passes 
away. This is a strange phenomenon when a country is under the 
rule of one person. Such "antishock therapy" is unimaginable in 
the democratic world and such a thing is unprecedented and 
unrepeatable there.

Theory on Socialist Literature and Art With Chinese 
Characteristics, Use it To Guide Our Brand-New Practice of 
Promoting the Cause of Chinese Socialist Literature and Art"] 
  [Text] Theory is the product of an era. An extraordinary 
era creates extraordinary theory. If we say that Marxism is the 
proletarian scientific theory of the era of free capitalism, 
Leninism is the proletarian revolutionary theory of the era of 
monopoly capitalism, and Mao Zedong Thought is the 
crystallization of collective wisdom of the CPC during the era 
of China's new democratic revolution and socialist revolution, 
then Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is present-day Chinese Marxism with which our 
party leads the people of all nationalities in our country in 
bringing order out of chaos and entering the new period of 
socialist modernization. Therefore, as part and parcel of the 
whole theory, Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialist literature and 
art surely has the distinctive spirit of our times. 
  Comrade Jiang Zemin said: "Combining the basic tenets of 
Marxism with the realities in China and the characteristics of 
our times, by inheriting and developing Mao Zedong Thought, 
concentrating the wisdom of the whole party and people 
throughout the nation with the great courage to chart a path to 
socialist construction and open a new realm of Marxism, Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping creatively put forth the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics." Just as Comrade Jiang 
Zemin said, after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee, while dialectically inheriting and developing 
Mao Zedong's thinking on literature and art, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping opened new ground on various aspects of endeavor in the 
light of the many new developments and problems facing writers 
and artists in the new period and achieved major 
accomplishments, thus forming his own theory on literature and 
art with Chinese characteristics. A careful and systematic 
study of the achievements will enable us to clearly see that 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on literature and art with Chinese 
characteristics has a clear-cut characteristic of our times and 
a vigorous creative spirit. 
  1. The theory has provided a new method of leading 
literature and art. After the proletariat has seized 
political power, as a ruling party, how should the Communist 
Party exercise leadership over the ideological realm as a whole, 
including literature and art? This is a problem facing not only 
our socialist country. In this regard, we have both positive 
and negative examples. Naturally, it was necessary to impose 
strict control over the ideological realm when China's newly 
born people's regime was not yet consolidated, and even to 
exercise necessary control under certain historical conditions. 
However, when class struggle ceased to be the principal 
contradiction of the Chinese society and socialist modernization 
has increasingly become its central task, what method should the 
party adopt in leading literature and art work? 
  After correctly analyzing numerous theoretical and practical 
issues, such as the nature of socialism in China, the current 
stage of socialism in China, and its main contradiction and 
fundamental task, and basing himself on the laws governing 
literature and art, Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forth the correct 
idea that the party should adopt in leading literature and art 
work and gave a practical Marxist reply. He said: "Leadership 
does not mean handing out administrative orders and demanding 
literature and art serve immediate, short-range political goals. 
It means understanding the special characteristics of 
literature and art and the laws of their development and 
creating conditions for them to flourish. That is, it means 
creating conditions that help writers and artists improve their 
skills." Proceeding from acquiring a correct understanding of 
the speciality of literature and art creation, he stressed that 
party leadership over literature and art did not mean wanton 
imposition of administrative interference. He said: "In the 
production of literature and art, which involves complex mental 
labor, it is essential that writers and artists follow their own 
creative spirit. What subjects they should choose for their 
creative work and how they should deal with those subjects are 
questions that writers and artists themselves must examine and 
gradually solve through practice. There should be no arbitrary 
meddling in this process." Therefore, he pointed out 
particularly sharply: "The bureaucratic style of work must be 
dropped. There must be no more issuing of administrative orders 
regarding the creation and criticism of literature and art. To 
think such a practice upholds party leadership can only produce 
results opposite those intended." 
  Here we must clearly point out: These methods advocated by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping do not mean weakening party leadership 
over literature and art work. On the contrary, they mean 
further strengthening party leadership by improving the way the 
party leads literature and art work. Particularly in view of 
the errors made in ideological education and the unchecked 
spread of bourgeois liberalization during the first decade of 
reform and opening up to the outside world, he emphatically 
pointed out: "Vigorous efforts should be made to strengthen 
party leadership over the ideological front." "Principal 
leaders of the party committees at all levels must attach 
importance to the developments, problems, and work of the whole 
ideological front, including theoretical and literature and art 
circles." He firmly believed: "So long as our party really 
strengthens Marxist leadership, firmly overcomes weakness and 
laxity as well as liberalism, and conscientiously conducts 
active ideological struggle, the abovementioned problems on the 
ideological front can be solved, and it will not be difficult to 
solve them." 
  In this new situation and in accordance with the numerous 
correct methods put forth by Comrade Deng Xiaoping for the party 
to lead literature and art work, to better and more effectively 
uphold party leadership over literature and art in political 
principle and orientation and necessary organization, party 
leading organs must earnestly change the way they operate, pay 
keen attention to orientation, total quantity, structure, and 
efficiency, and further realize the party's macroregulation and 
control, as well as correct guidance of literature and art work. 
  2. The theory has expounded the new connotations of 
the literature and art standards. Practice is the sole 
criterion for testing the truth, and also the sole criterion for 
judging the literature and art works as one of social 
ideologies. As far as literature and art works are concerned, 
the practice with which to judge them is generally manifested in 
a prominent way in two aspects: The society's political 
practice and literature and art practice. As such, Comrade Mao 
Zedong summarized the criterion for judging whether literature 
and art works are right or wrong and whether they are good or 
bad into "the political criterion and the artistic criterion." 
Meanwhile, the Marxist viewpoint on practice maintains that, as 
social practice undergoes a constant change, the political and 
artistic criteria with which to judge the right and wrong -- as 
well as the superiority and inferiority -- of literature and art 
works are also bound to change accordingly. 
  In terms of the political criterion, when socialist 
modernization has become the main tide of China's present-day 
social life, Comrade Deng Xiaoping expounded scientifically: 
"Socialist modernization is our biggest political issue at 
present, because it represents the people's biggest and most 
fundamental interests." Therefore, the practice of socialist 
modernization has naturally become the biggest and most 
fundamental political practice of the people of all 
nationalities of present-day China and has correspondingly 
become the biggest and most fundamental political criterion for 
judging the right and wrong of present-day China's literature 
and art works. Just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "The basic 
standard for judging all our work is whether it helps or hinders 
our effort to modernize." 
  In terms of artistic criterion, according to the objective 
laws of literature and art creation, Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
unified the profound artistic contents and the perfect artistic 
form. This highest realm, which literature and art creation 
seeks, is the artistic criterion for weighing the superiority 
and inferiority of the literature and art works in the new 
period. First of all, in terms of artistic contents, Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Our socialist writers and artists 
should create vivid, inspiring flesh- and-blood characters. 
Through them, they should truthfully depict our rich social 
life and the inner qualities of our people as shown in their 
social relations, and give expression to the trend of historical 
development and to the demands of our progressive era. They 
should endeavor to educate the people in socialist ideology and 
imbue them with the drive and spirit necessary to build national 
strength and prosperity." Second, in terms of art forms, 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping went on to point out: "All writers and 
artists should earnestly study, assimilate, and expand on all 
that is best in the literary and artistic techniques of every 
land and every age and perfect art forms with the distinctive 
features of our nation and our own time." The practice of 
literature and art development in the new period has proven: So 
long as we judge the superiority and inferiority of literature 
and art works using the artistic criterion which perfectly 
combines contents and forms as expounded by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping, we can help raise the level of China's literature and 
art creation in accordance with objective laws. 
  3. The theory has entrusted a new task to 
literature and art creation. In the final analysis, with 
what works should our writers and artists serve the drive to 
build socialism with Chinese characteristics? This is a major 
topic of discussion which has a bearing on the question of what 
mission writers and artists should undertake. On this issue, 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Our writers and artists 
should try harder to portray and help foster the new socialist 
man and achieve greater success in doing so. We must portray 
the new features of the pioneers in the modernization drive, 
their revolutionary ideals and scientific approach, their lofty 
sentiments and creative ability, and their broad and realistic 
vision. Through images of this new man, we must stimulate the 
enthusiasm of the masses for socialism and inspire their 
creative activities, which are of historic significance in the 
pursuit of the four modernizations." Here, proceeding from the 
overall situation of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, in fact, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly 
entrusted to writers and artists the great mission of developing 
the theme of the spirit of our times. 
  Every era and society have their own main tide of historical 
development and the spirit which occupies a leading position in 
the entire development of ideology and culture. As the dynamic 
aesthetic reflection of social life, every state must have its 
own main theme [zhu xuan lu 0031 2467 1774] in the literature 
and art creation of every era. In discussing the mission of 
this era in building socialist spiritual civilization, including 
literature and art, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "It is 
fundamental to enable the broad masses of people to have 
communist ideals, moral integrity, education, and a sense of 
discipline. Internationalism and patriotism both belong to the 
category of spiritual civilization." Correctly applying the 
stand, viewpoint, and method of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, Comrade 
Jiang Zemin more concretely expounded on this issue. He pointed 
out: "Patriotism, socialism, and collectivism must become the 
main theme of our society." 
  The real social life is rich and colorful. The spiritual and 
cultural demands of the masses of people are multifaceted and 
multileveled. In the light of this reality, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping advocated: "The road before literature and art should 
become broader and broader. Guided by the correct principles 
for creative work, writers and artists should deal with an even 
wider range of themes, increasingly vary their means of 
expression, and dare to blaze new trails. We must guard against 
or overcome the tendency to be formalistic and abstract, which 
produces monotonous, stiff, mechanical, and stereotyped works." 
Therefore, in our literature and art creation, including 
mainstream works, theme, form, style, and means of expression 
must also be diversified, rich, and colorful. To put it another 
way, the diversification of theme, form, style, and means of 
expression should be encouraged. Only when this dialectical 
unity is achieved in both theory and practice can fine works and 
performances truly worthy of our great people and era be 
produced. What needs pointing out here is that while developing 
the main theme, all spiritual products which educate and 
enlighten the people and give them entertainment and aesthetic 
treats should be welcomed and encouraged. 
  In a word, developing the main theme, encouraging 
diversification, and upholding the unity of the two are the 
demands of the era and also the demands of the development laws 
of literature and art. The more resounding and clear-cut this 
theme of our literature and art, the more able it will become to 
effectively embody the "two serves" orientation and the "double 
hundred" policy and resist the interference of various 
distractions. Through literature and art works "which have 
healthy and encouraging contents, particularly eulogizing reform 
and opening up and modernization as well and artistic magic," 
writers and artists should fulfill the great mission entrusted 
to them by history to develop the theme of the spirit of our 
times and promote the flowering of socialist literature and art 
creation. 
  4. The theory has expounded the new standards for 
literature and art efficiency. Literature and art, from 
the formation to distillation of artistic conception and from 
the process of creation to aesthetic enjoyment, show that 
ideology is the most fundamental and clear-cut speciality of 
literature and art. Of course, after entering circulation, some 
literature and art works have the specific characteristics of 
both ideology and commercial formation. In the last 10 years, 
the socialist cultural market has emerged forcefully and 
developed rapidly. Hence, how to correctly understand the 
commercial attributes and speciality of most literature and art 
products and how to correctly handle the relationship between 
the social benefit and economic results of literature and art 
products has become a new important question promoting the 
flowering of China's literature and art. 
  In 1983, sternly criticizing the unhealthy phenomenon of 
"putting money above everything else," which emerged in the 
literature and art circles, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "The 
unhealthy trend of `putting money before everything else'" has 
also spread in the literature and art circles. From grass-roots 
to central performing groups, there are performers giving 
performances everywhere without authorization. Quite a few 
people made money by publishing works and giving performances 
with lowbrow contents and vulgar forms. It is a pity that some 
performers and literature and art fighters of the People's 
Liberation Army were also involved in such activity." Quite 
indignantly, he pointed out: "The tendency of commercializing 
spiritual products is also manifested in the other aspects of 
spiritual production. Some people who unworthily occupy a place 
in literature and art, publishing, and historical relic circles 
have simply become merchants, intent on nothing but profit." 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's firm opposition to the erroneous trend 
of commercializing spiritual products is in line with the 
Marxist basic principle of differentiating spiritual products 
from material commodities. 
  In 1985, in regard to the emergence of bourgeois 
liberalization and the tendency of money worship on the 
ideological and cultural front, Comrade Deng Xiaoping once again 
clearly stated: "Ideological, cultural, educational, and health 
departments must take social benefit as the sole standard for 
all activities. The enterprises under their jurisdiction must 
also take social benefit as the supreme standard." This 
standard not only deals with what is of basic importance in the 
production of literature and art products, but also has great 
significance in guiding the construction of China's socialist 
cultural market. In other words, as part and parcel of the 
socialist market economy, China's cultural market naturally must 
abide by the general laws of the market rule in its development. 
However, because the creation of cultural products is a complex 
mental exercise, we should not let the market completely decide 
their rise or decline or their success or failure; because the 
relationship between the long-term development of the cultural 
cause and short-term consumption of literature and art products 
should be correctly handled, we should not let the utilitarian 
[gong li 0501 0448] behavior of the market completely decide 
their proportional readjustments; and because the cultural 
products entering the cultural markets have the attributes as 
both commodity and ideology, we should all the more not let the 
commercial gains and loses of the market completely decide which 
to choose. These special features of our socialist cultural 
market require us to regulate and control the market more 
directly and powerfully by using policy, legal, economic, and 
administrative means and, in the complicated practice, ensure in 
terms of mechanism that "social benefit is put in the first 
place and the relationship between the social benefit and 
economic results of spiritual products is correctly handled." 
  5. Theory has charted a new way of building literature 
and art. In the great practice of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, continuously probing the new way of 
promoting China's socialist literature and art cause is one of 
the important tasks facing the drive to strengthening the 
building of material and spiritual civilization and also one of 
the important contents of Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialist 
literature and art with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's major achievements in this regard are as follows: 
  1. Literature and art structural reform is clearly defined. 
In 1979, when dealing with the need for qualified people in 
large quantities in prospering China's literature and art, 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Through improved 
ideological and administrative work we should create the 
necessary conditions for persons of outstanding talent to emerge 
and mature." Later on, from the angle of reform being the 
fundamental way out of China's various socialist undertakings, 
he emphatically stressed: "I stand for reform. Without reform, 
there would be no way out. Decades of experiments have proved 
that the old ways were unsuccessful." He went on to say: 
"Reform is all-embracing. It includes economic structural 
reform, political structural reform, and resulting reforms in 
the other aspects of endeavor." With these expositions, in 
fact, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly defined: China must carry 
out reforms including literature and art structural reform. 
Moreover, literature and art structural reform is the effective 
way of promoting the development of China's literature and art 
cause. In this aspect, on the basis of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the 
CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core has provided 
correct leadership in light of the development of China's 
literature and art cause. The report to the 14th CPC National 
Congress clearly stated: "We should actively carry out cultural 
structural reform, improve our cultural and economic policies, 
and promote the flowering of our socialist culture." In the 
"Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Several Questions 
Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic 
Structure" which was promulgated not long ago, the party once 
again put forth the task of "deepening cultural structural 
reform, improving our cultural and economic policies, and 
strengthening the management of the cultural market according to 
law." 
  In the new situation of building the socialist market 
economic structure, we must acknowledge that to drop old habits 
and reform the literature and art structure is inevitable. 
However, the change must not be arbitrary, spontaneous, and 
unregulated. It must conform to development laws. Therefore, 
we must note the internal relationship between literature and 
art structural reform and economic structural reform and their 
generality in some aspects and fully understand the former's own 
laws and speciality. Only when we have a good grasp of this 
point can we ensure the sound and smooth progress of literature 
and art structural reform. Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forth a 
scientific standard for judging the nature and the success or 
failure of reform, thus providing a theoretical basis for us to 
test the success or failure of literature and art structural 
reform. To be specific, we must see if the reform helps bring 
the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of writers and 
artists into full play, if it helps turn out works and talents, 
promotes the flowering of socialist culture, and meet people's 
increasing demands for cultural life, and if it helps promote 
economic growth and overall social progress. 
  2. The training of writers and artists is clearly defined. 
According to the Marxist viewpoint, man is the most active of 
the productive forces. Developing culture, literature, and art 
production and prospering China's socialist literature and art 
is no exception. This requires training and fostering large 
numbers of outstanding socialist writers and artists. 
Meanwhile, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always favored "respecting 
knowledge and talents." He maintained: "Only when outstanding, 
talented writers and artists have come to the fore group by 
group can the scientific and cultural levels of the Chinese 
nation be raised as a whole." When specifically discussing 
literature and art work, he urgently pointed out: "Special 
stress must be laid on the training of talented writers and 
artists. For a country as big as ours, with a population of 
over 900 million, we really have too few who are outstanding. 
This is quite out of keeping with the demands of our times." 
  On the question of improving the political quality of 
talented writers and artists, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "We 
are now building socialism with Chinese characteristics. As the 
times and task are different, there is indeed a lot of new 
knowledge for us to learn. Therefore, we should strive to 
master the basic Marxist theories in the light of new 
realities." He also urged "writers and artists to 
conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought so as 
to enhance their own ability to understand and analyze life and 
see through appearances to the essence." He reminded writers 
and artists to attach importance to changing their world 
outlook. With skill and patience, he said: "In our socialist 
society, everyone must remold themselves. Not only must those 
whose basic stand has not changed remold themselves, all people 
must study, continuously remold themselves, study new problems, 
accept new things, conscientiously resist the corrosive 
influence of bourgeois ideology, and better shoulder the 
glorious and arduous mission of building a modern and powerful 
socialist country." 
  On the question of enhancing the artistic quality of 
talented 
writers and artists, advocating that writers and artists should 
learn from the people in the practice of life, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping pointed out: "The creative life of all progressive 
writers and artists is rooted in their intimate ties with the 
people. Creativity withers when these ties are forgotten, 
neglected, or severed." On the other hand, also advocating that 
writers and artists should learn from successful artistic 
experience in the practice of art, he pointed out: "We should 
draw on and learn all that is progressive and advanced in the 
literature, art, and performing arts of old China, and of other 
countries as well." From the strategic position that there is 
no lack of successors to carry on China's socialist literature 
and art cause and with his particular concern about the training 
of young writers and artists, he especially pointed out: "Our 
young writers and artists are vigorous in perspective and in 
them lies the future of our literature and art. We should help 
them eagerly and also make strict demands on them, so that they 
will not become divorced from life but will make steady progress 
both ideologically and in their art." 
  Placing particular stress on the unity of the contingent of 
writers and artists, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "We sincerely 
hope that our writers and artists will unite more closely and 
expand their ranks. Whether professional or amateur, all 
socialist and patriotic writers and artists and all those who 
support the reunification of the motherland should try harder to 
help and learn from each other and to concentrate their energies 
on literary and artistic creation, study, and criticism." In a 
word, Comrade Deng Xiaoping eagerly hoped that "more and more 
comrades in the ranks of writers and artists will become real 
engineers of the human soul." 
  "For a tree to grow tall, one must make its roots firm. For 
a river to flow endlessly, one must dredge its fountainhead." 
Past events since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee have proven: The completely new practice of 
prospering China's literature and art is inseparable from Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, in particular, the literature and art 
theoretical guidance contained in it. Therefore, the 
fundamental task of our cultural work is to earnestly study and 
correctly apply the theory's stand, viewpoint, and method in 
unifying our thinking, studying our work, and guiding our 
practice.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Police have detained Shanghai activist Zhu Fuming 
for taking part in the waves of pro-democracy protests that have 
hit the administration this spring. And security officials in 
the east China city are trying to track down the identities of 
the 54 signatories to a petition on political reform that was 
sent to the National People's Congress (NPC) on Friday [25 
March]. Sources in the dissident community said Zhu, who is in 
his early 30s, was detained early this month following a spate 
of run-ins with local security agents. 
  A college graduate and an employee in a company that 
provides 
information for citizens seeking to go abroad, Zhu is loosely 
associated with the Shanghai-based Association for Human Rights. 
Before his detention, he was hauled in for brief questioning at 
least twice this year. The first time was after police found 
Zhu had secretly taped their conversation with him. The second 
was at a Shanghai disco after Zhu shouted on the dance floor 
slogans calling for overturning the verdict on the Tiananmen 
Square crackdown. 
  Zhu's relatives indicated yesterday they had not been told 
by 
local police where he was being held or for what reason. Out of 
fear of the authorities, however, the relatives have not taken 
any action. 
  Meanwhile, Shanghai sources said police were investigating 
the "background" behind last Friday's 19-point petition, which 
called for constitutional amendments to introduce a multi-party 
system. It is understood that, while the petition to the NPC 
stated 54 people had signed it, only seven names appeared on the 
document. "Police are trying to find out who the 47 unnamed 
signatories are," a source said. "They also want to check if an 
`anti-government' organisation is behind it." 
  The source said the local procuratorate yesterday tried to 
get into contact with Dai Xuezhong, an activist who spent two 
years in a reeducation through labour camp after the June 4, 
1989, crackdown. It is understood that Mr Dai, now a private 
entrepreneur, yesterday refused to respond when officers tried 
to contact him through his pager. 
  Dissidents in Shanghai said the authorities were alarmed by 
the petition because it was more radical than similar ones 
organised this month by Beijing-based intellectuals such as Xu 
Liangying, Wang Dan or Liu Nianchun. They said copies of the 
petition had been sent by mail to intellectuals in the big 
cities.

<F P=106> [By reporter Hu Guohua (5170 0948 5478)] </F>
  [Text] Guangzhou, 30 Mar (XINHUA) -- During his recent 
inspection of agricultural work in eastern Guangdong Province, 
Xie Fei, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau 
and secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, 
stressed on several occasions that, to basically achieve its 
modernization goals by the year 2010, Guangdong must ensure good 
agricultural work -- a basic industry of the province -- and, to 
do this, it must first stabilize grain production. 
  Xie Fei spent 11 days inspecting six cities and 10 counties 
in eastern Guangdong, including Huizhou, Shanwei, Shantou, 
Jieyang, Meizhou, and Heyuan. He inspected crop growing bases, 
aquatic cultivation bases, and some development zones and 
village and town enterprises. He also investigated and studied 
the current rural economic situation and future development 
trends in eastern Guangdong. On many occasions, Xie Fei 
repeatedly stressed the importance of the agricultural issue, 
pointing out that Guangdong can quicken the pace of its 
modernization drive only if it can ensure good agricultural work. 
  He said to local cadres: Guangdong's secondary and tertiary 
industries have developed rapidly over the last few years, and 
the trend has been very good. However, we should realize that 
some people in some localities still tend to overlook 
agriculture, especially grain production, and this problem is 
quite serious in some localities. We must not forget China's 
national conditions and the rural areas -- the foundation of the 
country. If the rural areas are not developed, Guangdong's 
development will be impeded, affecting its plan to achieve set 
modernization goals in 20 years. Therefore, this year, while 
continuing to develop the secondary and tertiary industries, we 
should focus on rural work in some key areas. 
  Xie Fei was especially concerned about grain production. He 
pointed out: The core of the agricultural issue is grain. The 
primary issue of Guangdong's agricultural work is to stabilize 
grain production; we should not totally rely on grain supplies 
from other provinces. Our grain output can surely increase 
steadily as long as our guiding thought is clearly set forth and 
the policy is correct; and as long as we practice scientific 
farming and maintain good efficiency in grain growing. He also 
cautioned city, county, township, and town cadres to pay 
attention to protecting cultivated land. In Shanwei and Heyuan 
cities, he inspected a few typical projects using hilly areas to 
develop secondary and tertiary industries, and fully approved 
this method. He highly praised the Shantou City New and 
High-Technology Industrial Development Zone for planning to 
build multi-story factory houses to minimize the use of land. 
  Xie Fei was extremely concerned about how Guangdong's rural 
economy will develop. He inspected several places where both 
farming and aquatic cultivation were quite well developed. He 
said: Modern agriculture should be an open and export-oriented 
one. After Guangdong has stabilized grain production, it should 
feel free to develop a diversified economy. As when developing 
industry, it can introduce funds, technology, fine strains, and 
processing equipment from outside the country to develop new 
production work, exploit marine resources, develop mountainous 
areas, and develop the farming, aquatic cultivation, and 
processing industry on a big scale. Beside grain, for which it 
will still need to rely on other provinces, Guangdong will be 
able to export large amounts of other agricultural products, 
such as vegetables, fruits, poultry, and aquatic products. He 
stressed Guangdong has been very successful in opening up its 
industry, and that it should also open up agriculture. 
  During his investigation and study tour of eastern 
Guangdong, 
Xie Fei also expressed his views on developing village and town 
enterprises on a large scale, and on speeding up the shift of 
the surplus rural work force to secondary and tertiary 
industries.

  [Text] Beijing, March 30 (XINHUA) -- Government 
departments in the capital launched a campaign titled "every 
citizen is a cornerstone of the Hope Project" here today. 
  Chen Xitong, secretary of the Beijing municipal committee of 
the Communist Party of China, Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan and other 
government officials made donations at the newly-established 
Beijing Donation Center for the Hope Project. 
  "The Hope Project will be full of hope when all the people 
are mobilized," Zhang Jianmin, director of the municipal 
people's congress said. 
  When a center worker asked Mayor Li Qiyan whether he would 
like to aid a boy or girl, he answered: "It makes no difference 
as long as it can help an out-of-school child." 
  In poverty-stricken areas of China, only 300 yuan are needed 
to help a child through a year of schooling. 
  Since the Hope Project, a national effort to help send 
children back to school in poor areas, was launched about a 
decade ago, governments at various levels, social bodies and 
common people have donated to it. 
  More than 2,000 people took part in the campaign today and 
donated more than 100,000 yuan.

  [Text] At the group discussion meeting of the National 
People's Congress Session held on 12 March, Gu Jinchi, secretary 
of the Liaoning Provincial CPC Committee, stressed that at the 
time of speeding up the setup of the market economic system, we 
should pay attention to the setup of the socialist legal system 
and use laws to safeguard and guide the setup of the socialist 
market economic system. 
  Gu Jinchi said: Many new reform policies will be worked out 
this year. So, the year 1994 is a key year to accelerate the 
development of the market economy. Due to the influence of the 
centralized planned economic system, Liaoning's ideology, 
managerial system, regulations, and rules have some factors 
unsuitable to the requirements of the socialist market economic 
system. Therefore, we should exert great efforts to renew our 
ideas; speed up the setup of the market economic system; and pay 
particular attention to speeding up the setup of the markets for 
means of production, the markets for production factors, and 
monetary markets. 
  Gu Jinchi said: The market economy is the legalized economy. 
In the course of replacing the high-degree planned economy by 
the market economy, the province should combine the policy 
decisions on reform with the policy decisions on legislation. 
This point is of extreme importance. Without a stronger sense 
of laws, it will be easy to create problems. Some people 
maintain that the market economy means to seek a chance to make 
money. This is wrong. In fact, it is more necessary for us to 
keep our words under the market economic conditions. We should 
use laws to guide and promote the setup of the market economic 
system. We should strengthen the setup of the legal system, set 
up and perfect a complete set of laws and regulations, handle 
well the relationship between the setup of markets and the setup 
of legal system, and make the setup of markets and that of legal 
system supplement each other. Only by so doing will we be able 
to straighten out the confused order cropping up in the course 
of developing the market economy and to set up a healthy and 
orderly market economic system. 
  Gu Jinchi stressed: Now, our province enters a key period of 
doing the second pioneering work. The setup of markets and that 
of legal system are of the same importance. So, we should 
organize the broad masses of cadres to conscientiously study 
various kinds of laws and regulations and strengthen the 
legislation of local laws. 
  He set forth three specific opinions: First, in line with 
the actual conditions of the province, we should vigorously 
conduct the propaganda and education on using laws to protect 
the setup of the market economic system, upgrade the cadres' 
awareness of laws, make the market economy operate itself within 
the framework of laws, and particularly educate the cadres to 
take the lead in enforcing laws and handle affairs according to 
law. Second, in line with the objective reality of the 
province, we should strengthen the legislation of local rules, 
formulate laws and regulations with Liaoning's special features, 
and embark on the orbit of legalizing the economic development. 
Third, we should use legal means to solve the hotly debated 
problems in society cropping up in the course of setting up the 
market economy, strictly deal blows to economic criminal 
activities, restrain the activities of abusing power for private 
gains and trading in power for money, and exert great efforts to 
consolidate social order. It is necessary to strengthen the 
construction of administrative and law enforcement contingents 
and to upgrade the level of administering the province and 
handling administrative affairs according to law.

<F P=106> [By He Xiaoying (0149 1321 3841): "We Must Strive Hard To </F>
Correctly Handle Contradictions Among the People"] 
  [Text] The theory of correctly handling contradictions 
among the people put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong in the 1950's 
has, in the following decades, undergone testing in the practice 
of social and political life. It has increasingly demonstrated 
the radiance of its truth and has made clear that it is a great 
theory for consolidating and developing socialism. 
<H5>  An Epoch-Making Contribution to the History of the </H5>
Development of Socialism 
  Lenin once said: "Our judgment of historical achievements is 
based not on whether the history-makers have provided us with 
the things which we need now, but on whether they have provided 
something new which previous generations had not provided." The 
epoch-making historical achievement of the work "On the Correct 
Handling of Contradictions Among the People" lies precisely in 
the fact that it contributed a new scientific conclusion and 
solved an enormous and pressing problem in the practice of 
socialism. 
  This theory adhered to thoroughgoing Marxist dialectics and 
propelled Marxist doctrine on social contradictions to a new 
stage. It completely refuted the point of view that regarded 
contradictions within socialism as heresy, promulgating the need 
to scientifically recognize contradictions in socialist society 
and illuminating the role of correctly handling these 
contradictions as a motive force driving the advance of 
socialism. Thus it has opened the new line of thought that the 
correct handling of social contradictions will promote social 
progress. Moreover, it has promulgated and expounded on the two 
kinds of contradictions, different in nature, which exist 
objectively in socialist society, and this has charted the 
course to the concrete recognition and handling of all 
contradictions under conditions of socialism. 
  If we say that, due to Stalin's error of denying 
contradictions in theory and mixing up contradictions in 
practice, the great pursuit of socialism initiated by Lenin 
gradually sapped the vigor of socialist development and 
subsequently led the development of socialism to a certain 
crisis, then we can say that Comrade Mao Zedong's theory has 
injected vigor into socialism and given a great impetus to its 
development. 
<H5>  The Overall Theme of Domestic Political Life in the Primary </H5>
Stage of Socialism 
  In 1957 Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Our objective, what we 
wish to build, is a type of political setup which is both 
centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, which has 
both unity of purpose and individual ease of mind, and is lively 
and vigorous. This will be beneficial to socialist revolution 
and socialist construction, help us overcome difficulties, speed 
up the construction of our country with a modernized industry 
and agriculture, promote the consolidation of the party and the 
nation, and help us to withstand trials and tribulations. The 
overall theme of this is the correct handling of contradictions 
among the people and contradictions between the enemy and 
ourselves. We will go about this by seeking truth from facts 
and following the mass line. "Practice in the years following 
1957 showed how correct and far- sighted he was to grasp this 
overall theme. It is no simple feat to grasp clearly and 
without wavering this overall theme from beginning to end, and 
once having grasped it, to do a good job of it. The crucial 
point lies in having a profound and intrinsic understanding of 
China's national conditions. The second-generation leadership 
body which emerged after the Third Plenary Session of the 
Eleventh CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as 
the core, summed up historical experience and lessons, studied 
the new situation and the new problems under the new historical 
conditions, and soberly recognized that our country is at 
present, and will be for a comparatively long historical period 
to come, in the primary stage of socialism. This has made us 
all the more keenly realize the scientific nature of this 
overall theme of correctly handling the contradictions among the 
people, and raised our consciousness of the need to grasp it 
tightly, and consequently, our scientific understanding of the 
special nature of the social contradictions in the primary stage 
of socialism. 
  First: The large-scale and leading nature of 
contradictions among the people. 
  Of all the contradictions in the primary stage of socialism, 
"class struggle is no longer the principal contradiction." None 
of the various social contradictions existing on a large scale 
in our country belongs within the scope of class struggle. Of 
course, class struggle, within certain parameters, will survive 
for a long time, and under certain conditions may even 
intensify. This situation of contradictions demands that we not 
only avoid glossing over still-existing class struggles of an 
antagonistic nature, but that we fully recognize the dominant 
position of widespread social contradictions among the people. 
  Second: Contradictions among the people are diverse 
and complicated. 
  In the primary stage of socialism, due to both historical 
and 
modern factors, uneven development among districts, industries, 
departments, nationalities and groups lead to differences in 
benefits. These differences in benefits lead to contradictions. 
In the conditions of reform and opening, and especially after 
undergoing new adjustments -- and even frictions and collisions 
-- in the course of the changeover from the old to the new 
structure, these contradictions take on an very complex 
character. For instance, the scissors gap between industry and 
agriculture, the widening gap in the development level between 
the coastal and inland regions, the growing gap between managers 
and workers in many economic sectors, and the unfair social 
distribution -- all these have exacerbated the difficulties in 
distinguishing the contradictions and made it more urgent to 
find a new way to handle them. 
  Third: The contradictions in people's thinking and 
understanding are long-term and frequent. 
  Building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a 
creative 
social systems engineering project. In the course of 
exploration and opening up in the face of divided opinions on 
the advantages and disadvantages which crop up, divergence in 
people's understanding is inevitable. This is not only because 
there are different interest bases, but also because there are 
different levels of understanding of the theory of knowledge. 
This divergence in understanding needs to be cleared up by 
means of discussion, comparing notes, and exchanges, but more 
importantly, it should be gradually solved in the deepening of 
the reform. 
  Fourth: The contradictions in the party-masses 
relationship and the cadres-masses relationship have become an 
increasingly important aspect of the contradictions among the 
people. 
  Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "Our people's government is a 
government which genuinely represents the people's interests. 
It is a government which serves the people. However, there are 
also certain contradictions between it and the masses of the 
people. These contradictions include those between the state's 
interest, the collective interest, and the individual interest, 
those between democracy and centralism, those between the 
leaders and the led, and those between the bureaucratic style of 
work of some government functionaries and the masses." The key 
to solving these contradictions is to rectify the party's style 
of work, strengthen the building of clean government, and 
"persist in our efforts to restore the traditional style of work 
of our party characterized by hard work, plain living, and close 
relations with the masses." The problem of work style of a 
party in power is a life-or-death concern of that party. Only 
if our party can correctly solve this contradiction and further 
consolidate and strengthen the flesh-and-blood ties between the 
party and the masses will it be possible to attain the type of 
political situation described by Comrade Mao Zedong and only 
then will our party be able to stand up to any storms and 
stresses. 
  Fifth: The multisphere, multilevel nature of 
contradictions among the people demands a versatile method of 
handling them. 
  As contradictions among the people in a socialist system can 
be alleviated and solved through self-regulation and 
self-improvement, it is imperative for us to give full play to 
the superiority of the socialist system in handling 
contradictions. In resolving the dynamics of contradictions we 
must find the most appropriate plan, effective for a given 
period of time. It is unrealistic to be blindly self-satisfied, 
metaphisically refusing to recognize contradictions or 
mechanically applying one pattern to approach many 
contradictions. There is, and can be, no universal panacea -- 
we must exercise the party's and the government's subjective 
dynamism, starting from reality in everything. 
<H5>  Raising the Ability To Correctly Handle Contradictions Among </H5>
the People Is an Important Duty of a Party in Power 
  A great work is only such if it cleaves to its main theme 
without wandering off the track and solves well the transition 
from paragraph to paragraph. This great piece of writing on the 
correct handling of contradictions among the people not only has 
to adhere closely to its main theme, but has to be seriously 
organized and coordinated. Since the Third Plenary Session of 
the Eleventh CPC Central Committee, not only has our party 
gained a profound understanding of the main theme of 
contradictions among the people, but in the course of practical 
explorations has accumulated rich experience in the handling of 
contradictions among the people. 
  --The objective of getting a firm grasp on the correct 
handling of contradictions among the people is to unite all the 
positive elements, transform all the negative elements and serve 
the construction of a powerful, democratic, and civilized modern 
socialist country. Therefore, when we handle various types 
of contradictions among the people, we must start from this 
overall interest and work to promote the realization of our 
nation's stability and unity, the development of its productive 
forces, and the overall progress of society. We must coordinate 
in an organic way the country's long-term development with the 
actual demands of the masses of the people, and the interests of 
the country as a whole, with the interests of the regions, 
departments, and individuals. However, we must recognize that 
while the multitude of contradictions among the people are all 
rationally clamoring to be solved, they can only be solved step 
by step. Some contradictions cannot be solved all at once, 
while others can only be eased to a certain extent. In all 
this, people must take the overall situation into account. 
  --Gather tightly around "one center" to handle the 
various contradictions among the people. The large number 
of contradictions among the people in the primary stage of 
socialism, whether they are differences of interest or 
divergence of understanding, in the final analysis must be 
solved through development and reform. Many problems can be 
comparatively well solved as the economy develops, the wealth 
for social distribution increases, the reform advances, 
mechanisms are enlivened, and social vigor increases. For this 
reason, in handling any contradiction we must obey and serve 
"one center" and gradually solve them in conjunction. 
  --Synthesizing a variety of methods and applying 
them in a coordinated way is the basic channel for handling 
contradictions among the people. Contradictions among the 
people touch upon the fields of economics, politics, ideology, 
and culture. As such, they all have their individual 
peculiarities, but they also have mutual relationships. 
Therefore, in handling contradictions among the people, not 
only must we provide concrete solutions to concrete questions, 
but we must refrain from judging by appearances. We must combine 
democratic discussion, persuasion and education, legal 
regulations, moral restraints, and administrative and economic 
methods, and apply them in a synthesized and coordinated way. 
Contradictions of different natures call for different handling 
methods, i.e., the method of "unity-criticism-unity" should be 
applied in the case of political and ideological problems; in 
the case of relations between the Communist Party and the 
democratic parties, the method of "long-term coexistence and 
mutual supervision"; and in the case of science and culture, the 
method of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools 
of thought contend." In the case of economic benefits, it is 
necessary to make overall plans and take all factors into 
consideration. In the new circumstances, contradictions have 
taken on a complicated and many- sided character, facing us with 
the necessity of finding even more new methods to solve them. 
In the past few years, in the course of handling the 
contradictions and clashes that have emerged between the 
interests of the masses and the interests of the regions, we 
have gained some good experience, i.e., we should tell the 
people to recognize that, for a certain period of time, 
differences in benefits are unavoidable, and to encourage some 
regions and some people to push ahead with development through 
hard work and scientific management. At the same time, while 
advancing toward common prosperity, we must coordinate benefits 
in a multilateral way and make sure that differences will not be 
so great as to threaten social stability. 
  -- Carefully distinguish between two different types of 
contradictions, and resolutely use dictatorial methods to handle 
the contradictions between the enemy and ourselves. In the 
primary stage of socialism, class struggle still exists to a 
certain extent. The contradictions between the enemy and 
ourselves and the contradictions among the people are so 
intertwined that they are sometimes not immediately 
distinguishable. This calls for the utmost prudence. But in 
cases in which there is conclusive evidence that a contradiction 
is one between the enemy and ourselves we must tackle it 
head-on, for it is only by resolutely battling the enemy that we 
can safeguard the people. 
  --Conscientiously handle contradictions within the 
party. Contradictions within the party fall into the 
category of contradictions among the people. The correct 
handling of contradictions within the party is very important 
for a ruling party in its efforts to build unity, cohesion, 
integrity, self-discipline, and conscientious administration on 
behalf of the people. The correct handling of contradictions 
within the party contributes to solving contradictions among the 
people. At the same time, if contradictions within the party 
are not handled correctly, their negative elements will have an 
adverse effect on solutions to contradictions among the people. 
When leading groups at all levels of the party shoulder the 
important task of handling contradictions among the people, 
their very persons become a unity of contradictions, and the 
correct handling of contradictions among members of the leading 
groups of the party and the proper building of unity and 
cohesion is an important task which must not be neglected. 
  We are now in the course of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. The correct handling of contradictions among 
the people is a great undertaking which must be tackled 
throughout the primary stage of socialism. There is an endless 
series of new conditions and problems. The whole party must 
make more efforts to correctly handle contradictions among the 
people in order to promote the cause of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics.

  [Text] The failure of a Solidarity-like workers' movement 
earlier this month has dampened speculation that growing worker 
discontent alone might threaten China's political stability in 
the near future. Political dissident Liu Nianchun's elaborately 
designed League for the Protection of the Rights of the Working 
People fell apart amid internal bickering almost as soon as it 
was announced on March 9. According to sources in the dissident 
community, few of the 120 activists who signed the original 
petition to protect worker rights knew Liu planned to set up a 
full-blown organisation. 
  Nevertheless, Chinese officials appear concerned that worker 
unrest may still threaten what has been the fundamental 
achievement of Deng Xiaoping's China: sustained rapid economic 
growth. The urgency with which Beijing is dealing with labour 
issues suggests it believes it is in a race against time to 
improve working conditions before strikes, sabotage and a 
breakdown in discipline ruin the economic miracle based on 
foreign investment that has brought considerable wealth to some 
parts of the country. 
  There is evidence from some regions that labour unrest is 
accelerating: Fujian province was hit by 47 work stoppages or 
strikes in 1993, three times more than the previous year. More 
than 40 per cent of these incidents occurred in Taiwan-funded 
enterprises. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences warned of 
"more unemployed workers, strikes and violence against plant 
officials" in a recent report on China's social and economic 
outlook for 1994. 
  New laws being rushed into place include a new national 
labour law which Beijing had been agonising over for more than 
10 years. They are aimed at establishing a legal basis for 
stricter inspections of factory conditions by local labour 
officials. Beijing has also passed laws ostensibly aimed at 
foreign funded factories which rely on cheap labour, covering 
minimum wages and the establishment of official trade unions. 
But whether these measures will stem the rise of worker 
discontent remains to be seen. 
  "There may be a lot of talk at the national level, but it's 
very different on the shop floor," said Wang Wei-ling, a 
research with the Hong Kong-based labour rights group Asian 
Monitor. "Many managers -- especially in foreign-funded 
enterprises -- think that the new regulations do not apply to 
them." 
  The rapid expansion of foreign-funded enterprises, which now 
employ more than 6 million, and the gradual cutting of 17 
million jobs from state enterprises, have given rise to growing 
labour tensions in both sectors. In the foreign-funded sector, 
lax supervision of worker conditions by local officials eager to 
attract foreign investment has left scope for abuse. Poor 
safety conditions and military-style management have caused 
relations with foreign bosses to deteriorate to the point where 
"revenge strikes" are becoming a regular occurrence. 
  Routine reports of factory fires, beatings and abuse of 
workers -- many of whom are girls from the countryside -- as 
well as delays in payment of wages and many other basic problems 
have given foreign funded enterprises a Dickensian reputation. 
  Walk-outs hit two South Korean shoe factories in Tianjin 
last 
year after inefficient workers were forced to kneel in front of 
their South Korean managers, the Beijing Youth News reported. 
An official survey of 11,679 in-patients at medical clinics in 
Shenzhen's Baoan district last year found that 9 percent were 
workers injured in industrial accidents at foreign funded 
enterprises. 
  In the state sector, worker problems revolve around the 
threat of lay-offs as well as the steady withdrawal of fringe 
benefits at the same time as salaries are frozen. Beijing has 
launched ambitious plans to help the long term jobless, but 
admits it will be able to find jobs for only 7 million of the 17 
million expected to be laid off from state firms in the next few 
years. 
  Internal reforms introduced in state enterprises have also 
caused problems, Wang Weiling said. "Because of the emphasis on 
restructuring into private or collective ownership, workers in 
state enterprises are losing the democratic rights they once 
enjoyed," she said. "In addition to the threat of unemployment 
and a lack of social security, the workers' role in 
decision-making has been reduced." 
  Strikes are technically illegal and were once unheard of. 
But now, strikes are often mooted when workers are 
discontented, even over what would once have been considered 
trifling matters. The Taiwan-funded Zhongxing Department Store 
in Shanghai lost an estimated 100,000 renminbi [Rmb] (HK$88,800) 
following a one-day strike by its 100 employees in January. 
Their grievance was that the work code had been amended to make 
anyone late for work liable to losing their Rmb50 monthly bonus. 
  But most workers remain afraid of strikes, which not only 
could cost them their jobs but could even put them in jail. 
"Workers we interviewed in Shenzhen told us the local trade 
unions visited and said: `You came to the free trade zone to 
earn money, not to cause trouble'," Wang Wei-ling said. "They 
were told they could be sent back to the countryside if they 
continued with their strikes and slowdowns," she said. 
  A phone-in show on management-worker relations on Guangdong 
provincial radio last month was abruptly ended after the seventh 
caller said he was puzzled at the lack of impulse among workers 
to stage a strike. "The presenter cut off the caller and 
announced that this was the end of the discussion," according to 
a BBC transcript of the show. 
  It was apparently against this backdrop of silenced worker 
discontent that Liu Nianchun and about 120 other dissident 
intellectuals launched their plan for an autonomous workers' 
league. "Only the corrupt officials and those unscrupulous 
merchants who collude with them to grab super-profits are not 
working people," the league's founding charter said. 
  Although the league soon faltered, the Guangdong Federation 
of Trade Unions (GFIU) was sufficiently scared by the threat of 
an independent, nationwide workers' league to carry out a survey 
in mid-March on the sentiments of workers in the province, 
source at the trade federation said. 
  "We concluded that such a movement would not gain much 
support because it would be viewed as illegal," a GFTU official 
said, making a veiled reference to those who were arrested in 
1989 for joining similar movements. "Our task this year is to 
educate the workers to consider the big picture," he said. 
"They must be taught that the protection of their rights is 
best carried out according to legal mechanisms rather than by a 
person or a group claiming to represent them." 
  But opinions remain divided within the labour movement 
inside 
and outside China over how to improve the situation. Most 
contentious is whether China's official trade union, whose 
constitution says its role is to "advocate the party line and 
help economic growth" can be of real help. 
  The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has vowed to 
organise workers in more than half the country's foreign funded 
enterprises this year after studies found that only a tenth of 
such firms have union representatives. "Many of us feel that 
working through the official unions is the only realistic way," 
a Beijing dissident said. 
  The theory behind this emerging consensus between labour 
officials and labour activists is that demands will only be 
tolerated and effective if they are raised through official 
channels. According to this view, any non-official trade union 
is unlikely to achieve anything tangible for workers: Those set 
up by workers would be quickly shut down, while those set up by 
managers would be mainly interested in boosting efficiency. 
  An official with the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions 
(SFTU) said the idea of forming autonomous trade unions was "not 
correct". "A lot of these ideas are just plans by foreign bosses 
to split the trade union federation," he said. According to the 
union official, Shanghai labour department officials this year 
cracked down on three worker organisations that were set up with 
management backing in foreign-funded enterprises. 
  The unofficial groups went under different names: A welfare 
society in a Taiwan enterprise, a recreation club in an American 
enterprise and a workers' committee in a European enterprise, 
but the SFTU viewed all of them as attempts to replace its role. 
"We will not allow any of these `yellow trade unions' to grow 
up in China," the official said. Only 1,300 of Shanghai's 3,400 
operating foreign-funded enterprises had set up official trade 
unions by December last year, the official said. 
  Another element in the emerging consensus concerns the use 
of 
labour contracts, which would give the necessary legal basis to 
employees seeking arbitration settlements as well as inspectors 
seeking to impose fines on enterprises. More than 
three-quarters of all foreign-funded enterprises in the Xiamen, 
Zhuhai and Shantou special economic zones still have not signed 
employment contracts with their workers, the Beijing backed 
OUTLOOK WEEKLY [LIAOWANG] reported in January. But in the end, 
labour activists say everything will depend on whether China's 
Ministry of Labour as well as provincial and local labour 
inspection departments can carry out their supervisory roles. 
  One-off "mass inspection campaigns", such as the one carried 
out in Guangdong after 84 workers were killed in a Shenzhen 
factory fire in November, are in no way considered to be 
adequate replacement for a strict inspection system immune to 
corruption.

<F P=106> [By Chuan Hsun-che (0278 6061 5074): "Secret Report on </F>
`Disturbances' on Mainland Last Year"] 
  [Text] To the CPC, demonstrations, assemblies, strikes, 
and disturbances are all expressions of people's grievances and 
social unrest. The CPC takes the issue of mass demonstrations 
and assemblies very seriously and is on the alert against the 
flames lest they should spread far and wide. For this reason, 
the State Council transmitted to the party committees of various 
provinces, autonomous regions, and cities, and those of public 
security organs, procuratorial organs, and courts at the same 
level, a secret report under reference number 94016, which is 
entitled, "Summarized Report on the Conditions of Illegal 
Demonstrations, Assemblies, Strikes, Disturbances, and Riots 
Across the Country in 1993." 
<H5>  More Than Over 200 Riot Occurred Across the Country in 1993 </H5>
  The report disclosed that more than 850 illegal parades and 
demonstrations, over 1,210 illegal assemblies (including sit-in 
demonstrations and petitions), over 6,320 illegal strikes 
(including go-slow actions), over 440 disturbances, and over 210 
riots were recorded in the entire country in 1993. 
  The statistics in the above report were made according to 
the 
following standards to be determined as illegal parades 
(demonstrations), illegal assemblies (sit-in protests), illegal 
strikes, and disturbances, as revised by the Ministry of Public 
Security in November 1990. 
  1. Activities of gathering, making propaganda, giving 
lectures, and so on, which are conducted by 10 or more people in 
party and government organs, or public places, without advanced 
examination and approval of the local government. 
  2. Parades staged by 10 or more people with propaganda 
instruments and material in streets, squares, or party and 
government organs without advanced examination and approval of 
the local government. 
  3. Suspension of work or absence from posts effected by 10 
or more people, or by 30 percent or above of staff from 
enterprises, units, or departments without advanced examination 
and approval of the local government, or of the party and 
government departments in enterprises and units. 
  4. Organized and premeditated activities against the 
government, the socialist system, and the leadership of the 
Communist Party, which lead to chaos in society, communications, 
and government work, and which cause confusion in certain 
government departments, regions, enterprises, units, or schools. 
  5. Organized propaganda activities with programs and 
objectives, which are aimed at subverting, shaking, or 
overthrowing the leadership of the communist party and the 
people's government as well as the socialist system. 
  6. Open or semi-open activities conducted by illegal 
organizations and antagonistic elements, by those who have 
contacts or organizational relationships with anti-Chinese 
organizations outside the territory or anti-Chinese and 
anti-communist political forces abroad, and by those who are 
controlled by foreign forces. 
  7. Organized sabotage activities with programs and 
objectives, including assaults on party, government, and 
judicial organs, radio stations, newspapers, barracks, secret 
departments of enterprises and units, and armed forces 
departments. 
  8. Activities of attacking, smashing, and burning state 
property, buildings, means of communications, and so on. 
<H5>  Number of People Going to Beijing To Appeal for Help </H5>
Increased by 12 Percent Over the Previous Year 
  In addition, according to the information released by the 
State Council, more than 73,200 people went to Beijing to appeal 
to the authorities for help last year, an increase of 12 percent 
over 1992, and more than 887,300 people appealed to the 
provincial, autonomous regional, and city party and government 
departments for help, an increase of 14.5 percent over 1992.

  [Text] Beijing, March 31 (XINHUA) -- China will this year 
implement a new policy in some key universities to make no 
differences between state-subsidized students and students 
enrolled at their own expense. 
  The reform plan to be introduced in dozens of universities 
directly under the State Education Commission, will require 
every student to pay an annual tuition fees of 1,000 to 1,500 
yuan, according to a senior education official today. 
  The payment is believed to be equal to about 25 percent of 
the annual income of an ordinary family in China but account for 
less than 20 percent of the total education cost at universities. 
  The government will also set a unified score for all 
students 
taking the national college entrance examination, replacing a 
dual standard that allows some students to gain easier access to 
universities if they pay more money. 
  Wang Zhichang, director of university students department of 
the state commission described the plan as "an important step" 
in reforming the country's education system. "The previous 
practice is violating the principle of fair education," he said. 
  For the past few years, most college students have been 
subsidized by the state, with about 13 percent of the total 
enrolled at their own expense or supported by social entities. 
  However, the proportion increased last year to more than 50 
percent in some universities as more wealthy families became 
eager to send their children to college. 
  To help those having funding problems continue their studies 
at universities, the Education Commission is to introduce both 
the scholarship and education loan systems, the director said. 
Under the loan system, a student can apply for loans on campus 
and pay it back after graduation. 
  China this year will recruit 895,000 new students for its 
more than 1,000 universities and colleges, 25,000 less than last 
year.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Hunan Clarifies Case of Assault on </F>
Christian"] 
  [Text] It was recently reported that a new Christian 
follower named Zheng Musheng died after he was arrested, beaten, 
and denied medical treatment by officers of the Public Security 
Bureau in Hunan recently. This reporter interviewed officers 
with the relevant department and learned that the report was 
inconsistent with the facts and was totally fabricated. 
  Over the past few years, Zheng Musheng, a peasant from 
Dongkou County, Hunan Province, has swindled people, stirred up 
trouble among the masses, and seriously disturbed public order 
by spreading rumors and fallacies such as that "an enormous 
calamity will befall the world in 1999, so it is sensible to eat 
as much as one can and to be idle without bothering about 
construction." In addition, he treated patients in 
superstitious ways and caused one person's death and several 
people's conditions to worsen. 
  On 1 January he was detained by the local public security 
organ according to the law. During the detention, he was beaten 
and seriously injured by 13 prison inmates including Long 
Shunsheng, Huang Mingyong, and others for his "refusal to listen 
to their advice and to make the place clean." When the prison 
guards found him wounded, he was immediately sent to a hospital, 
but died after all rescue measures proved ineffectual. After 
the public security organ fully ascertained that Long Shunsheng, 
Huang Mingyong, and others had beaten Zheng Musheng to death, it 
arrested the assailants according to law and made the proper 
arrangements for Zheng's funeral. The relevant department has 
also taken action against the person responsible for the prison 
and reinforced its personnel.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Maolin, secretary of the Hunan Provincial </F>
CPC Committee: "Attach a High Degree of Importance to the Issue 
of the Party's Ruling Position Under the Conditions of a Market 
Economy"] 
  [Text] Initially establishing a new economic system by the 
end of the century is a great historical mission for the whole 
party and people of all nationalities across the country. The 
key to whether or not we can undertake this important historical 
mission and successfully create a socialist market economic 
system never before seen in the history of mankind lies in our 
party and in upholding and improving its leadership. Historical 
experiences have shown that upholding the party's leadership and 
consolidating its position at the helm of the state are the most 
important political guarantees for reform, opening up, and 
socialist modernization. Meanwhile, historical experiences have 
also shown that it is not very easy for us to unswervingly and 
consistently uphold this political principle. Under the new 
situation of establishing a socialist market economic system, 
some comrades may have a confused idea about the party's ruling 
position and their consciousness of being at the helm of the 
state may be attenuated. As a result, a tendency to undermine 
the party's leadership may appear. This warrants our attention. 
As Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in an important speech he 
delivered at the beginning of 1992: "If we do not watch out for 
signs when they begin to crop up, things will go wrong." 
Especially during the crucial period when our reform, which 
revolves around the establishment of a new system, enters a 
phase of tackling major, difficult tasks, it is all the more 
necessary for us to attach a high degree of importance to the 
issue of the party's ruling position; successfully achieve 
ideological and organizational improvement of the party; 
successfully improve its work style; and strengthen and improve 
leadership over reform, opening up, and economic work. 
<H5>  In the process of Establishing and Improving a Socialist </H5>
Market Economic System, We Must Always Prevent a Tendency To 
Ignore the Party's Leadership 
  Our party proposed establishing a socialist market economic 
system to enable the market to play a basic role in the 
allocation of resources under macroeconomic regulation and 
control by a socialist country. It is integrated with the basic 
socialist system. Upholding the party's leadership is, of 
course, one of the points that should be implied by the 
proposal. The establishment and improvement of a socialist 
market economic system will surely further liberate and develop 
social productive forces, further consolidate our party's ruling 
position, and further consolidate the material base for a 
socialist system. Therefore, the kind of confused idea that the 
party's leadership role under a market economy is unimportant 
should not occur in the first place. However, a small number of 
comrades do have a misunderstanding of the issue. Some people 
say: "Since we are establishing a market economy, anyone can 
become part of the leadership. Why do we still have to stress 
leadership by the Communist Party?" Why does such an erroneous 
concept appear? I think the reasons are found mainly in the 
following two aspects: 
  The first is misconceptions. Because of their failure to 
gain a genuine understanding of the essence and meaning of the 
socialist market economy, as well as the role and significance 
of the party's ruling status, some comrades cannot truly 
understand the compatibility between the socialist market 
economy and maintenance of the party's ruling status, and have 
inevitably acquired some misconceptions. 
  1) The shift by the party and government from direct to 
indirect economic management in a market economy could lead some 
people to think the party's functions in leading the economy 
will be weakened. An important feature of the market economy is 
the independence of various economic entities. This has created 
a wrong impression among some people, who are led to believe 
that a market economy is equivalent to a decentralized and 
laissez-faire economy not subject to leadership and 
interference. Therefore, they deem it unnecessary to stress the 
party's leadership over economic construction. Specifically, we 
need to spend some time exploring the means by which the party 
exercises correct and effective leadership over economic work at 
a time when we have just taken a step forward toward building a 
socialist market economy. We are not very experienced in this 
respect, and this could generate a feeling among some comrades 
that the party's functions in leading the economy will be 
weakened. 
  (2) The pursuit of material benefits in a market economy 
will 
become the primary motive force driving various market 
competitors to participate in economic activities. This could 
generate a feeling among some people that the party's 
ideological leadership will diminish. Some people are of the 
opinion that the market economy encourages the practice of 
making a profit in the market, the pursuit of maximum profits, 
and the use of money to arouse people's initiative. Therefore, 
they think the party's greatest asset -- ideological and 
political work -- need not be put to use any more and that it 
will no longer play much of a role. The party's previously 
effective measures, such as those used to mobilize, guide, 
educate, and restrain its members through ideological means, 
will no longer be useful. The current tendency of some 
localities toward neglecting ideological and political work, as 
well as socialist spiritual civilization, has a great deal to do 
with this misconception. 
  3) Various economic entities will become independent 
corporate bodies in a market economy. This could lead people to 
think that primary party organizations, especially party 
organizations in enterprises, will weaken their functions as 
political cores. Some comrades are of the opinion that the 
pursuit of a market economy entitles various market competitors, 
especially state-owned industrial and commercial enterprises, 
and including state-owned large and medium enterprises, to make 
decisions about their cadres, to hire professionals, and to 
select the workers they need in the labor market. Under such 
circumstances, party organizations will not be able to play 
their role as leadership cores, and they will have to gradually 
diminish or even abandon such a role. Some people have 
proposed: "It is no longer appropriate to discuss the role of 
party organizations in enterprises as political cores at a time 
when a socialist market economy is being developed." These 
misconceptions are precisely the major ideological causes 
leading some comrades to neglect the party's leading role. 
  Next is international influence. Western politicians and 
theorists repeatedly publicize the consistency of having a 
market economy, private ownership, and multi-party system, and 
the inconsistency of a market economy, socialist public 
ownership, and communist party holding office. Some of our 
comrades have been influenced by these erroneous media opinions 
and by the fact the former Soviet Union and some East European 
nations have been practicing the multi-party system during the 
course of promoting the market economy since they disintegrated 
and underwent evolution. In particular, bourgeois liberalists 
and those deeply influenced by them, uphold even more Western 
capitalist theories and the experience of "drastic changes" in 
some former socialist countries. They absurdly believe the 
market economy is inevitably linked to private ownership and the 
capitalist system, and that a long coexistence between plural 
economic sectors and the one-party-rule political system is 
impossible. So, they hope the communist party's ruling status 
will end someday. Some of our comrades have also been more or 
less influenced by some hostile forces abroad and stubborn 
bourgeois liberalists at home who distort China's socialist 
market economic structure. 
  The above analysis shows us two things: First, fundamentally 
speaking, in the new situation in which we are developing a 
socialist market economy, our party has favorable conditions for 
constantly consolidating and strengthening its ruling status; 
however, its ruling status is also facing some new circumstances 
and new challenges created by an existing erroneous tendency of 
overlooking party leadership. If we fail to pay attention to 
the tendency and adopt effective measures to deal with it, our 
party's leadership over political, economic, ideological, and 
organizational affairs will likely be weakened. Second, a great 
deal of arduous and meticulous work indeed remains to be done to 
truly prevent and overcome the erroneous tendency of overlooking 
the party's leadership under market economy conditions. It 
needs a theoretical explanation. We should clearly explain to 
people the accurate definition of a socialist market economy, 
eliminate their misunderstandings caused by the distortion of 
the socialist market economy, and make them understand the 
consistency between developing a market economy and upholding 
party leadership. It needs practical deeds even more. We 
should discover the best and most effective way for the party to 
hold office and to exercise correct leadership over political, 
economic, ideological, and organizational affairs. It is for 
this reason that we should, during the entire course of 
establishing and perfecting a socialist market economic 
structure, always keep firmly in mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
words: "Without leadership by the party a big country like 
China would be torn apart by strife, and incapable of 
accomplishing anything. Whether inside or outside the party, 
all tendencies towards weakening, breaking away from, opposing 
or liquidating leadership by the party must be criticized. The 
individuals involved should be educated or, if necessary, 
struggles should be waged against them." (Volume 2 of 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 317) This is a 
key to accelerating the establishment of the new structure. 
<H5>  To Establish a Socialist Market Economic Structure Is To </H5>
Enhance the Role of the Party Leadership, Not To Weaken It 
  Understanding the party's role of holding office under the 
conditions of socialist market economy is in fact a question of 
understanding the role of party leadership under the conditions 
of a market economy. To develop a socialist market economic 
structure is not to weaken party leadership. On the contrary, 
it has set new tasks and new demands on party leadership, and it 
requires us to take a further step to strengthen and improve it. 
  Then, what kinds of new tasks and demands does promotion of 
the socialist market economy pose on the party's leadership? I 
think there are at least the following tasks and demands: 
  First, developing the socialist market economy is a brand 
new 
subject; more than ever before, this work needs the party's 
scientific guidance, theoretically and in principle and policy. 
Experience shows the planned economy itself cannot effectively 
advance the development of productive forces, and we must 
develop a socialist market economy. But we really do not have a 
solution ready as to how to develop a socialist market economy. 
As Comrade Jiang Zemin said, we have never encountered most of 
the problems cropping up in the process of developing a 
socialist market economic system. Although we may make use of 
some practices of the capitalist market economy outside the 
country, what we are developing, after all, is a socialist 
market economy. And, over the past decades, people have had 
very little knowledge of the market economy. All this greatly 
demands that we provide theoretical and scientific guidance -- 
that the party establish relevant principles and policy 
conforming to market economic reality to guide people's 
practice. History since the founding of the People's Republic 
shows that only the CPC can provide theoretical and scientific 
guidance concerning the line, principle, and policy for 
developing a socialist market economy. This is because our 
party is armed with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. Our party has adhered to the 
ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from 
facts, accumulated rich experience in economic construction over 
the last few decades, and cultivated a large number of backbone 
economic construction cadres. The most important thing is that 
the market economy we want to develop is one that will be 
integrated with the basic socialist system -- it follows the 
general laws of a market economy and demonstrates the 
characteristics of the essence of socialism. In this sense, 
promotion of the development of a socialist market economy is 
absolutely inseparable from the CPC's leadership. The facts 
also prove this -- it is the CPC itself which has realized the 
ills of the old economic system and established the basic theory 
and policy of a socialist market economy. Since the party has 
established the development of a socialist market economic 
system as the objective of reform of the economic system, it is 
completely able to establish a correct principle and policy to 
guide the practice of this task. 
  Second, since the socialist market economy will pluralize 
and decentralize interests, it has become increasingly necessary 
for the party to coordinate the handling of all types of 
contradictions so the overall interests of the state can be 
safeguarded. One important feature of the socialist market 
economy lies in the pluralization and decentralization of 
interests, and this feature will inevitably give rise to more 
contradictions, conflicts, and friction in all sorts of economic 
contacts. This certainly will be the case, especially during 
the initial period following the establishment of the socialist 
market economic system when market-related laws and regulations 
are inadequate. Not only will there be vertical contradictions 
between the state, collectives, and individuals; there will also 
be lateral contradictions between markets and between regions. 
While certain contradictions can be settled through 
administrative or economic laws, some cannot be resolved without 
the party's intervention. In particular, major issues involving 
the long-range and fundamental interests of people in the 
country, and major projects which yield conspicuous social 
results but inconspicuous economic results, they can hardly be 
resolved by counting merely on administrative and economic 
measures. The formulation and implementation of these measures 
must be accomplished through those who will firmly enforce them. 
Representing the fundamental interests of people of all 
nationalities in the country, the party has a uniform program 
and discipline, it can stay aloof of the economic interests of 
various principal market components, and can coordinate and 
settle various contradictions with the objective of safeguarding 
the overall interests of the state as well as the fundamental 
and long-range interests of the people. If the party's leading 
role weakens, the situation will become one in which the main 
market components will scramble for benefits and the state's 
overall interests will suffer losses. This can very well be 
explained by the heavy cost which the former Soviet Union paid 
in pushing the so-called transition toward a market economy. 
The transition not only gave rise to social unrests within its 
republics, but it also gave rise to friction and conflict among 
the republics, and eventually led to the disintegration of the 
state. In China, local authorities and enterprises have had 
fairly substantial autonomy since the adoption of the reform and 
opening up policy, and in spite of the appearance of 
interest-related differences and contradictions during the 
course of economic development, on the whole these differences 
and contradictions can be gradually dealt with, thanks to the 
CPC's ideological, organizational, and political guarantee. 
Besides, the existence of departmentalism, decentralism, and 
small-group mentality in some places also dictates that the 
party must have stronger leadership. We should say, therefore, 
the party's leadership is essential for settling all kinds of 
contradictions, friction, and conflicts emerging during the 
course of economic development; and party leadership is an 
important requirement for safeguarding national stability. 
  Third, the negative and corrupt phenomena generated from the 
establishment of our socialist market economic system must be 
effectively stopped and combated through exercising strong party 
leadership. Comrade Jiang Zemin has pointed out: The 
establishment of our socialist market economic system must go 
through a difficult process of replacing the old system with a 
new one. The loopholes and weak links caused by inadequate and 
defective rules and mechanisms during this process also provides 
opportunities for corrupt phenomena to generate. This is a very 
practical observation. While we cannot assert the market 
economy will certainly generate corruption, we dare say the 
possibilities for corrupt phenomena to generate have noticeably 
increased owing to the above-mentioned objective causes as well 
as the limitations of the market economy itself. While these 
negative and corrupt phenomena can be stopped and corrected 
through administrative and legal measures, these measures also 
have their limitations: They can crack down on misconduct, but 
they cannot eliminate the thought which gives rise to the 
misconduct; they can correct what has gone wrong, but they 
cannot prevent what may go wrong; they can correct corruption 
which violates discipline and the law, they cannot eliminate the 
negative phenomenon characterized by "continuous minor mistakes 
even if the commission of major mistakes has been avoided." 
Ample facts show that even countries with the best and most 
comprehensive legal systems have not yet been able to uproot 
corruption. One important point is that the CPC considers it as 
its objective to eliminate exploitation and corruption and 
uproot bipolerization. This class attribute dictates the CPC 
must commit itself to waging protracted, unremitting struggles 
against all sorts of corruption. The party can effectively 
educate and closely supervise its members and the entire society 
through all kinds of disciplinary rules and regulations, and it 
can also select the most outstanding elements to execute 
discipline and law and wage organized struggles. These roles 
that it plays cannot be substituted by any other organization. 
  Fourth, while the establishment of a socialist market 
economic system needs all sorts of conditions, it needs the 
party even more to create these conditions. Take mental 
conditions, for instance. We need a powerful media to propagate 
knowledge about the market economy, to change people's mind 
sets, clear up people's misunderstandings about the market 
economy, and sum up and propagate all experiences of success. 
In terms of organizational conditions, we need the party to 
train and select economic experts, managers, and specialists in 
various fields; form united and pragmatic leading groups with 
members who perform their duties honestly; and give full scope 
to the roles played by democratic parties and mass organizations 
so people in all quarters will actively throw themselves into 
the great cause of building our market economy. In terms of 
political conditions, we need the party to foster people's 
democracy and exercise dictatorship over enemies, as well as to 
ensure a peaceful international environment so the state can 
enjoy political stability. We cannot possibly materialize these 
"needs" through counting on economic organizations alone. Only 
the organizationally strong CPC armed with the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics can rally the 
forces in all social quarters at home to victoriously expedite 
the process of building our socialist market economy. 
  We can see from what has been discussed above that the party 
must strengthen its leadership as well as its status of being 
the ruling party, instead of a weakening and wavering of its 
ruling status during the course of building our socialist market 
economic system. 
<H5>  The Party Must Constantly Improve Its Leadership Style To </H5>
Keep Pace With Requirements in the Development of the Socialist 
Market Economy 
  The fact the party's ruling status remains unchanged after a 
socialist market economic system has been established does not 
mean it must not change its leadership style. After all, the 
replacement of the traditional planned economy by a socialist 
market economy is a change with far-reaching significance and 
tremendous impact. This being the case, the party can no longer 
apply the conventional methods it used to in leading planned 
economic affairs, and it must seek new leadership styles and 
methods compatible with the development of the socialist market 
economy. 
  The key to improving party leadership and making it 
compatible with the needs of our socialist market economy lies 
in settling the issue about what the party ought and ought not 
to take charge of so that it can do a good job in taking charge 
of what it should and will certainly not involve itself in 
things which are not its business. It must also make sure that 
this principle will remain absolutely unchanged no matter what 
new situations, new contradictions, or new problems may arise. 
In accordance with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines laid 
down by the 14th National Party Congress, the party's basic 
leading roles should be primarily political, ideological, and 
organizational. 
  The party's political leadership rests with its leadership 
over political principles, political orientation, and major 
policy decisions. This is to say that, on the basis of the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the 
objectives and missions set for building a socialist market 
economic system, and China's actual situation, the party should 
formulate practical lines and general and specific policies 
which represent the interests of the overwhelming majority of 
people; and, during different periods of development, come up 
with correct policy decisions in connection with major domestic 
and world issues to make sure the state will develop along a 
socialist course with Chinese characteristics. 
  The party's ideological leadership means it will persist in 
educating and arming the masses with Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong 
Thought and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics; and, through the party's 
propaganda, mobilization, and ideological and political work, 
help party members, cadres, and the people understand and grasp 
the party's basic line and the theory of a socialist market 
economy, and become familiar with the party's general and 
specific policies so that the will of the party will become 
their voluntary actions. 
  In exercising organizational leadership, the party's main 
job 
is to recommend economically proficient cadres, who can also 
effectively uphold the party's basic theory and basic lines and 
follow through with the party's intentions [yi tu 1942 0956], to 
work at state organs, departments making overall economic 
planning, departments in charge of economic affairs, and large 
enterprise groups to take charge of major offices; and, through 
the organization and mobilization launched by party 
organizations, party cadres, and the broad masses of communist 
party members at various levels, guide the people to materialize 
all the party's propositions and accomplish all its missions. 
  Given the aforementioned basic functions of the party's 
leadership, in perceiving and handling the relationship between 
the party and government, we should change the party's past 
leading style in which it directly managed specific economic 
work matters. Instead, from the viewpoint of the overall 
situation, we should focus on providing leadership in strategic 
theory, lines, principles, and policies concerning economic 
work. In addition, we should turn the party's ideas into the 
state's will through a legal process, and, through party 
organizations' activities and members' exemplary vanguard role, 
motivate the broad masses to materialize this will. In 
perceiving and handling the relationship between the party and 
enterprises and institutions, we should change the past practice 
in which party organizations did all administrative work and 
commanded production operations. Instead, we should use our 
energy primarily to ensure and supervise the implementation of 
all party and state guidelines and policies on doing good 
ideological and political work among cadres and workers; and on 
strengthening leadership over trade unions, organizations of 
Communist Youth League, and other mass organizations. Specific 
matters concerning production work and business operations 
should be independently and effectively carried out by factory 
directors, managers, or production and administration organs. 
  Evidently, clearly defining the basic functions of the 
party's leadership is the precondition for improving its leading 
style. With this understanding, it will not be difficult to find 
the principle and way that should be followed in improving the 
party's leading style; we will be able to eliminate the 
uncertainty and confusion in handling the relationship between 
the party and government. Party organizations must truly have a 
good grip of the three aforementioned basic functions and 
endeavor to carry them out. They must not become tied up with 
specific economic matters and must not weaken the three basic 
functions; nor should they use reform as a pretext to 
incorporate the three basic functions, which pertain to party 
organizations, into administration departments. We should 
prevent the two aforementioned situations from happening in 
practical work. Currently, we should particularly guard against 
the tendency of using the need to accommodate the new market 
economic situation to make the party's leadership in enterprises 
a part of enterprises' administrative work. If party 
organizations of enterprises are incorporated into enterprises' 
administration departments, how can they play their political, 
ideological, and organizational leading role? I think internal 
organs of party organizations of industrial and mining 
enterprises may be set up according to the category an 
enterprise is in. Some internal organs of medium and small 
enterprises may be merged and their personnel reduced, but the 
party's organization departments must not be incorporated into 
administration and personnel departments. Organization 
departments of party committees should not only be responsible 
for supervising cadres, but, more importantly, they should 
properly manage party organizations and party members. 
Propaganda departments of party committees should publicize 
Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, use Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics to arm party members and workers, and conduct 
ideological and political work. It will be difficult to 
accomplish the party's tasks if organization and propaganda 
departments of party committees are abrogated and only a party's 
general office is in operation. It is even necessary to 
establish a united front work department in some large 
enterprises; of course the personnel should be kept to a minimum. 
  Currently, China is in the process of developing a socialist 
market economic system; therefore, a leading style in line with 
market economic development remains to be gradually developed 
and summed up in practice. We believe that, with the common 
efforts of comrades of the whole party, the party's new leading 
style will be refined day by day.

Corrosive Influences and Never Be Tainted With Bad Practices -- 
in Commemoration of the 45th Anniversary of the Publication of 
Comrade Mao Zedong's Speech at the Second Plenary Session of the 
Seventh CPC Central Committee"] 
  [Text] Before China won an overall victory in revolution, 
the CPC held the timely Second Plenary Session of the Seventh 
CPC Central Committee, preparing for the shifting of the center 
of gravity of the party's work from the village to city and from 
armed struggle to the development of production. With the 
insight of a Marxist, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered a report of 
great foresight and far-reaching influence to the session. Over 
decades of trials and hardships, we can still feel the shaking 
power of his profound thinking while rereading this report. In 
his report, Comrade Mao Zedong submitted a series of important 
principles and policies, including the central task of 
developing production after taking over the city and relying on 
the working class wholeheartedly. In addition, he also proposed 
an important idea which can be summarized as: Maintain the 
party's fine work style forever to resist corrosive influences 
and guard against peaceful evolution. He clearly brought up the 
issue of guarding against the attack of sugar-coated bullets for 
the first time and noted: "The road after the revolution will 
be longer, the work greater and more arduous" and emphasized 
"comrades must be taught to remain modest, prudent, and free 
from arrogance and rashness in their style of work; comrades 
must be taught to preserve the style of plain living and hard 
struggle." His foresight has been verified by historical facts 
and the two "musts" he stressed still ring like an alarm bell 
that has immediate and practical significance for our current 
efforts to improve the ideological levels and work style of the 
party members and resist the attack of sugar-coated bullets and 
the corrosive influences of various wrong ideas. 
  Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, the CPC has resumed the ideological line of seeking 
truth from facts, upheld the central task of economic 
construction, carried out reform and opening up, stepped up the 
pace of economic construction, and has made world-known 
achievements in the course of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. While leading the country to develop the 
economy in the new period, the CPC has also undergone hard 
struggles and tests; we are clearly aware of the severe 
challenge faced by the CPC in construction under the complicated 
circumstances at home and abroad -- a severe challenge because 
the launching of reform and opening up and the transition to a 
socialist market economy involve tremendous social changes, 
requiring people to make corresponding readjustments and 
transformations in their ideology and concepts. It is not easy 
for a CPC member to orientate himself amid such changes -- to 
adjust one's ideology to the reality of reform, opening up, and 
the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, 
which is much more complicated than before, on the one hand; and 
to uphold the Marxist outlooks on the world, life, and values 
and carry forward the communists' fine work style on the other. 
Many people are still not well-prepared for such changes. 
Moreover, after the country opened up to the outside world and 
begun absorbing capital, advanced science and technology, and 
management experience from capitalist countries, the decadent 
ideas of capitalism have taken advantage of the occasion to 
surface. Hostile forces in the West have not given up their 
attempt to subjugate China, and are inclined to conduct peaceful 
evolution in China. They proceed with their infiltration 
through all means, including publicizing capitalist democracy, 
freedom, human rights, and bourgeois outlooks on the world, 
life, values, and lifestyles via culture, art, and various 
media, and thus intensify the complexity and arduousness in our 
efforts to resist corrosive influences. Under such conditions, 
many people have been shot by sugar-coated bullets -- some are 
enslaved by bourgeois ideology and advocate bourgeois 
liberalization and complete westernization, whereas some abuse 
power for personal gain, commit graft, take bribes, and become 
corrupt and degenerate. The party's work style and social 
values are seriously hit and decadent phenomena are growing and 
spreading among some members of the party. Corruption will 
surely undermine the CPC's image and the relations between the 
CPC and the people, as well as be used by hostile forces. 
Corrupt elements are morally decadent elements. It is a very 
dangerous situation if corrupt phenomena are not firmly checked. 
We are facing a very complicated and severe struggle, between 
those who are corrupt and those who oppose corruption, as well 
as between peaceful evolution and counter-peaceful evolution -- 
the "war without the smoke of gunpowder" the imperialists wanted 
to wage. The struggle is important to the future and destiny of 
the CPC, the state, and socialism as a whole. Drastic changes 
in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and the 1989 
disturbance in China all remind us that it would be a serious 
historical mistake if we overlooked this struggle. 
  Studying again Comrade Mao Zedong's report at the Second 
Plenary Session of the Seventh CPC Central Committee and 
reviewing the revolutionary practice before and after his report 
have given us considerable enlightenment on how we should wage 
this struggle. 
  I. To Conscientiously Strengthen Ideological 
Education, Make Good Preparations for the "Prevention" Work So 
As To Enhance the Self-Awareness of Anti-Corruption 
  Comrade Mao Zedong attached great importance to ideological 
education on anticorruption. The key to anticorruption lies in 
"prevention." As early as 1944, he made arrangements for the 
whole party to study "A Sorrowful Review of Chinese History 
Since 1644" [jia shen san bai nian ji 3946 3947 0005 4102 1628 
4385], written by Guo Moruo. At the Second Plenary Session of 
the Seventh CPC Central Committee, he once again put forward the 
warning that "it is necessary to prevent" attacks with 
sugar-coated bullets. Meanwhile, he urged that "all party 
members should have a clear understanding of the necessity of 
maintaining a fine work style. As a result, the inoculation of 
party members was boosted because the members had been 
inoculated before entering urban areas during the civil war. 
Since the new period, our principles and policies have been 
absolutely correct. As far as prevention work is concerned, 
however, there is much room for improvement in our ideological 
education because there is a tendency to pay more attention to 
the construction of material civilization than to spiritual 
civilization. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out sharply that 
the greatest mistakes made during the 10 years of the Cultural 
Revolution involved education. Improving this work commands our 
immediate attention! 
  In strengthening ideological education, party cadres at all 
levels are required to take the lead. But it is not enough to 
concentrate on this point only. Ideological work in the fields 
of culture, art, and morality should also be strengthened. It 
is necessary to uphold the leadership role of Marxism in the 
entire spectrum of ideology. In carrying out the new task of 
establishing and developing a socialist market economy in a new 
environment, it becomes even more important to persist in the 
Marxist world outlook, outlook on life, and value system. In 
the ideological sphere, such forms of art as literature, film, 
and television exert great influence on the people. But many 
problems exist in these fields. Some works with serious 
drawbacks are not given due criticism. A few works which give 
publicity to pornography, violence, money worship, 
individualism, and hedonism are cropping up time and again, with 
applause coming from some people. A few people at home failed 
to make the necessary analysis in terms of the Marxist position, 
viewpoints, and methods regarding some movies which particularly 
expose our country's backwardness but won movie awards abroad. 
As a result, they followed others to applaud the movies. Some 
movie directors, hoping to win movie awards, try every possible 
way to cater to foreigners' tastes and feel proud while 
following in other people's footsteps. Such a trend should be 
turned around. Can it be effective to use such things to 
"educate" and influence the people? 
  In ideological education, education in necessary alertness 
to the presence of the enemy and in the concept of class 
struggle should also be necessary for all party members. Of 
course, "cultural revolution" mistakes should never be repeated. 
However, if we were not alert to the presence of the enemy and 
the concept of class struggle, we would be disarming ourselves 
ideologically. Comrade Mao Zedong noted: "After the enemies with 
guns have been wiped out, there will still be enemies without 
guns; they are bound to struggle desperately against us; we must 
never regard these enemies lightly. If we do not now raise and 
understand the problem in this way, we shall commit very grave 
mistakes." Historical events after the Second Plenary Session 
of the Seventh CPC Central Committee, particularly the drastic 
changes in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and the 
1989 disturbance in China, have all incontrovertibly proven that 
enemies without guns do exist. They spy out the land, wait for 
the opportune moment to go into action, and think of subverting 
the people's political power all the time. If we believe that 
all is well because an attack by armed enemies is not in sight 
and thus develop a false sense of peace and security, and if we 
fail to understand the gravity of the attack of enemies without 
guns, feel no danger in the face of peaceful evolution, and 
relax our alertness in resisting the corrosive influence of and 
guarding against peaceful evolution, we are bound to meet with 
disaster. 
  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping 
was published recently. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has inherited and 
developed Mao Zedong Thought, and his book has not only pointed 
out the way for us to persist in reform, opening up, and 
stepping up economic development, but also offered very good 
teaching materials for enhancing our ideological education, 
unifying our thinking and action, resisting corrosive 
influences, and guarding against peaceful evolution. We must 
study it in depth and grasp the book's spirit and essence 
comprehensively and accurately. In the meantime, we should 
select and study some works by Marx, Lenin, and Mao Zedong to 
enhance our understanding of the fundamental tenets of Marxism- 
Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and the theory of socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. 
  II. Persistently Launch Anticorruption Struggle and 
Earnestly Wage the War Against Corrosive Influence and Peaceful 
Evolution 
  After the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh CPC Central 
Committee, Comrade Mao Zedong had not only repeatedly conducted 
education in resisting corrosive influences and guarding against 
peaceful evolution within the party, but had also paid great 
attention to this issue all the time and had taken timely 
measures to deal with developments as they came up. Right after 
the revolution, he initiated the movement against the three 
evils [corruption, waste, and bureaucracy] and the movement 
against the five evils [bribery, tax evasion, theft of state 
property, cheating on government contracts, and stealing 
economic information] as well as personally approved the death 
sentences of major grafters Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan. 
These were all aimed at forestalling and fighting decadent 
phenomena within the party. Therefore, China's political 
practice was fairly clean and honest, social values were 
healthy, and the people were content in the 1950's. People 
still have warm recollections of those days. 
  In view of the fact that decadent phenomena are growing and 
spreading among some party members, the CPC Central Committee 
decided to fight corruption. The decision has enjoyed popular 
support. The key to eliminating decadent phenomena lies in the 
party's determination to fight. If its determination is strong 
enough, it will take powerful and effective measures to carry 
out this struggle. The people have held out fervent hope for 
this struggle. Comrade Deng Xiaoping noted: Why are there not 
many achievements made in punishing and dealing with corruption 
despite our repeated demands? The cause could be within the 
party. Some of our comrades immerse themselves in specific 
affairs and pay no concern and attention to political 
developments and ideological work; their alertness to decadent 
phenomena is scarce and their corrective measures are 
ineffective. If there is any problem in China, it is within the 
Communist Party. Therefore, we must approach and handle this 
problem from the high plane of a strategy to correct the 
phenomena of "scarce alertness" and "ineffective measures;" the 
entire party should pay attention to this issue and take action 
to handle it properly. 
  The most important task in the anticorruption drive is to 
rely on the socialist legal system and fully harness the power 
of the law as a weapon. We should resolutely overcome flagrant 
interference with the way we handle cases by a handful of people 
so judicial organs can handle cases fairly and punish corrupt 
elements in accordance with the law. We should further improve 
the law and establish a stringent legal system during the 
anticorruption drive. We now encounter resistance in handling 
cases. The web of connections and the practice of interceding 
on somebody else's behalf are seriously interfering with the 
fair handling of cases. The majority of people engaged in such 
practices are cadres who have great influence. Depending on the 
specific circumstances of interference, leading organs should 
make severe criticism, conduct education, take disciplinary 
action, or even dismiss the concerned people and refer their 
cases to judicial departments for investigation and prosecution 
in accordance with the law. We should also give full rein to 
the media's supervisory role and boldly expose various serious 
acts of interference through the press, radio, and television. 
  Our party also has a powerful magic weapon in the 
anticorruption drive--the mass line. In a certain sense, 
whether we achieve substantial results in the anticorruption 
drive or achieve a full- scale victory depends on whether we can 
mobilize the masses and rely on the mass line. While we do not 
launch mass movements, we must follow the mass line and fully 
arouse public enthusiasm for battling corruption. We should 
also create some momentum so people who engage in corrupt 
practices will feel the pressure and be aware of the fact that 
they are under effective supervision by the masses, like a rat 
crossing the street with everybody yelling "Kill it!" This will 
prevent them from engaging in corrupt practices. 
III. To Conduct Correct Criticism and Self-Criticism, and 
To Inherit and Carry Forward the Party's Fine Tradition 
  Comrade Mao Zedong said in his report: "We have the Marxist- 
Leninist weapon of criticism and self-criticism. We can get rid 
of bad style and maintain the good." Criticism and 
self-criticism constitute one of the three essential aspects of 
our party's fine workstyle and serve as a powerful weapon for 
guaranteeing that our party's fine workstyle will be inherited 
and carried forward. Regrettably, quite a few people have 
abandoned this weapon in favor of "praise and self-praise." 
Under such circumstances, healthy Marxist practices are 
inhibited while unhealthy trends run rampant. This has led to a 
strange phenomenon in society: An individual is duly criticized 
for his serious mistakes. Instead of being condemned and 
supervised by public opinion, he becomes a celebrity while his 
critics are isolated. In the words of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, 
"criticism, however little, is often branded as `attack' or 
`bludgeoning.' In fact, it is the critic who comes under 
attack, while the one who is criticized often receives sympathy 
and support." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, p 46) Evidently, healthy Marxist practices have 
not yet prevailed. For this reason, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said 
emphatically: "We must thoroughly change this abnormal 
situation so that Marxist, socialist, and communist 
propaganda--especially correct views on all major theoretical 
and principle-related matters--will truly to play their dominant 
roles in the ideological field." (ibid) To achieve this end, 
we must wage a regular and active ideological struggle and carry 
forward the party's fine tradition of criticism and self- 
criticism. 
  The key to carrying forward the party's fine workstyle lies 
in party organizations and cadres at all levels who must take 
the lead in this regard. We must conduct self-criticism with a 
strong sense of responsibility toward the party and the people 
whenever problems occur or mistakes are made in our work. When 
someone criticizes us, we must truly follow the rule "Correct 
mistakes if you have made any, and guard against them if you 
have not." Based on the party's position, we must have the 
courage to sternly criticize erroneous ideas, unhealthy trends, 
evil practices, and liberalism in the party and society. For 
many party cadres, the main obstacle to conducting criticism is 
goody-goodyism--they do not have the courage to uphold 
principles lest they hurt people's feelings and offend them, and 
as a result become themselves the target of retaliation. For 
the criticized, the main problem is retaliation--they regard 
other people's criticism as an attack on themselves, regardless 
whether it is justified or not, and seek to take revenge. Both 
attitudes are contrary to the spirit of building the party for 
the interests of the people. Essentially, both are guilty of 
individualism. True Communist Party members should build the 
party for the interests of the people. However, in some 
people's minds, public interests have weakened while self 
interests have rapidly expanded. No wonder correct criticism 
and self-criticism are difficult to conduct. Obviously, we 
cannot draw impetus from it to make progress. Therefore, today 
it is of special significance to stress the viewpoint of 
"building the party for the interests of the people," "remaining 
selfless," and "serving the people wholeheartedly." We must 
overcome all sorts of selfish ideas and unhealthy trends through 
correct criticism and self-criticism in order to truly carry 
forward the party's fine traditions and style of integrating 
theory with practice, of forging close ties with the masses, and 
of displaying the spirit of plain living and hard struggle. In 
this way our party organizations and vast numbers of party 
cadres will always retain the true characters of proletarian 
vanguards in building socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
becoming a steel wall of fighters with a strong party spirit, 
capable of resisting corrosive influences as well as 
sugar-coated bullets! 
  Today, when we restudy Comrade Mao Zedong's report, the 
world 
situation has undergone tremendous changes, which made the 
report even more extraordinary. In the report, Comrade Mao 
Zedong pointed out with vision: "After several decades and when 
viewed in retrospect, the victory of the Chinese people's 
democratic revolution will seem like only a brief prologue to a 
long drama. A drama begins with a prologue, but the prologue is 
not the climax." After several decades of efforts, particularly 
under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, China's economy is 
developing rapidly. We are marching to the world. We are 
moving toward the climax of a long drama. At this moment, we 
must seize the central task of economic construction and never 
let loose. We must bear in mind Comrade Mao Zedong's teaching 
that comrades must be taught to remain modest, prudent, and free 
from arrogance and rashness in their style of work; they must be 
taught to preserve the style of plain living and hard struggle. 
We must act cautiously as if we were on thin ice, and must make 
great efforts to successfully carry out the task of resisting 
corrosive influences, avoiding degeneration, and building our 
party well. We must promote both material and spiritual 
civilization at the same time. With both wings, we will be able 
to soar to the sky and open a bright future. We can definitely 
stage a socialist drama on the world stage, with climaxes coming 
one after another.

  [Text] Beijing, March 30 (AFP)--China's forestry ministry 
denied Wednesday claims by a British organization that it was 
allowing the illegal trade of tiger bones despite promises to 
stamp it out. 
  "The position of the Chinese government is very clear and 
very firm: since May 29, 1993, the law prohibits the 
possession, trading and use of tiger bones and rhinoceros 
horns," said ministry spokesman Su Yan by telephone. 
  Both substances are used in traditional Asian medicine and 
are often thought to be aphrodisiacs. They sell at prices 
comparable to gold in Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
  The British group Tiger Trust has presented a film it made 
during a four-month investigation of the tiger bone trade, which 
it says shows a flourishing black market in China, threatening 
with extinction the 150 Siberian tigers left in northeastern 
China. 
  "The rumours peddled abroad are false," said Su. "It is 
possible that a small group of criminals is trading in tiger 
bones, but you cannot mix the government up in that. The United 
States has strict narcotics laws and yet drug trafficking and 
consumption there are widespread," he said. 
  Tiger Trust also accused the Chinese authorities of lying in 
January after a widely publicized burning of what it said was 
500 kilograms (1100 pounds) of tiger bones in the northeastern 
city of Harbin. Quoting a "very senior official," Tiger Trust 
said the burning "was a fake." The group said the bones were 
almost entirely from cattle. 
  Su also said the Harbin bone burning consisted of 50 
kilograms, not 500. 
  "There were in fact fake and genuine tiger bones that had 
been seized from the black market, as traffickers also deal in 
fake bones." 
  A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman confirmed that under a 
Chinese law passed last year even fake banned wildlife products 
must be destroyed. 
  Su said "there are actually 624.4 kilograms of tiger bones 
stored at eight locations under the control of the Bureau for 
the Protection of Endangered Species ... all medicine containing 
tiger bone and rhinoceros horn has been withdrawn from the 
market." 
  In January the People's Daily reported the trade in 
endangered species was worth some 2 million yuan (230 million 
dollars) [as received]. 
  The United States has threatened China with economic 
sanctions if it did not put an end to the trade in tiger bones 
and rhinoceros horns. 
  Last week the UN-sponsored Convention on International Trade 
in Endangered Species gave China's policy a clean bill of 
health, saying it had made significant progress in protecting 
endangered animals.

Guiyang Stage a Rebellion] 
  [Text] On the morning of 2 March, prisoners working on a 
construction site on a highway near Huaxi Reservoir, Guiyang, 
staged a rebellion. They disarmed armed policemen with their 
tools and shouted: "Run for your lives!" Over 300 of the 500 
prisoners ran into the hills. 
  Sources said that 12 armed policemen were beaten to death 
and 
over 100 prisoners were placed on the wanted list. Latest 
sources have disclosed that 30 or so prisoners are still at 
large. The cause of the rebellion was that the prisoners could 
not tolerate the heavy workload. Prior to this, they had always 
been slack in work. These prisoners were criminal prisoners for 
terms of 15 years or more, and their age range is between 20 to 
30.

<F P=106> [By Paul Mooney] </F>
  [Text] Mao Zedong, if he were alive, would be appalled; 
Deng Xiaoping, if he is still well enough to know what is going 
on around him, would perhaps be a little more understanding. A 
survey has revealed that only 7.7 per cent of Chinese youths 
have a firm faith in socialism, while another 14.2 per cent say 
they have no faith in it at all. Most young people are in the 
cryptic situation of "having faith, but also puzzled". 
  These were among of the findings -- some surprising, some 
not 
so surprising -- of an investigation into the attitudes of young 
people in China published in a rare show of candour in the 
official China Youth News last month. Graduate students were 
the most suspicious of socialism. More than a quarter said that 
they "have no faith" in socialism, compared with 9.3 per cent 
for scientists and technicians, and 5.4 per cent for 
undergraduates. 
  The survey, carried out between October 1992 and May 1993, 
concentrated on educated people between the ages of 18 and 35, 
including students, scientific and technological personnel, 
teachers, Communist Youth League cadres and people in other 
professions. When asked "What is the major worry in your life?" 
most chose too low an income, followed by lack of housing, poor 
interpersonal relations, not being able to apply what you have 
learned, difficulty in getting married and in love affairs, and 
difficulty in leaving the country. 
  While a 1988 survey showed that "random price increases" was 
the No 1 worry, the latest poll indicated this was less of a 
concern now, with 43.6 per cent of the respondents saying they 
"realise that this is required by the development of a socialist 
market economy", and 31.1 per cent saying their "ability to 
withstand price adjustments has increased". Another 21.2 per 
cent were "unenthusiastic", according to the report, choosing 
the answer that "there is nothing one can do even if one is 
dissatisfied". Four percent said the price increases "bred 
discontent". 
  Of the respondents, 42.5 per cent advocated strengthening 
the 
market economy. Most young people, 57.7 per cent, thought that 
reform of the political system had lagged behind that of the 
economic system. The survey showed that the better educated 
tended to have more liberal views toward student movements. 
  When asked the main reason for student movements in the 
years 
since economic reform was launched in the late 1970s, 41.6 per 
cent said they thought this trend was caused by "social 
problems", while 7.5 per cent pointed to patriotism. Another 
27.4 per cent said the movements were caused by "bourgeois 
liberalisation thoughts". Of those at the graduate level, 94.8 
percent had an "affirmative attitude" about student movements, 
while the number slipped to 65.9 per cent for undergraduates. 
While young people were polled on the causes of the 1985 
student movement, the survey avoided the delicate question of 
the 1989 democracy movement. 
  The survey showed rising dissatisfaction with corruption 
among party and government personnel. When asked their 
assessment of the extent of emerging corruption, 89.3 per cent 
felt it was very serious. Arranged in the order of "degree of 
hatred", young people listed bureaucracy, abuse of power for 
private interest, corruption, bribery and dissolute lifestyles 
as the five kinds of social phenomena hated most by young people. 
  Asked what the crux of the country's reform of the political 
system was, 50 percent chose the answer "eliminating corruption 
and establishing democratic decision-making and democratic 
supervisory mechanisms". A somewhat surprising 28.3 per cent 
said that they thought "China's democratic system is better" 
than that of capitalist countries, with the majority, 57.6 per 
cent, taking a more cautious stance, saying "each has its own 
advantages and disadvantages". The survey was carried out by 
the China Youth Research Centre, the School of Political Studies 
for Young Chinese, and other youth groups around China.

<F P=106> [Work Report of the Supreme People's Court -- given by Jen </F>
Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, at the Second 
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress, NPC, on 15 
March 1994] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Mar (XINHUA) -- Fellow deputies: The 
following is a report on the work of the Supreme People's Court 
in 1993 and tasks for 1994. Please examine the report. 
  1. Persist in Striking "Relentless Blows" against 
Criminals To Maintain Social Stability 
  Stability is an important guarantee for reform and 
development. In 1993, people's courts throughout the country 
continued to adhere to the policy of "doing two types of work at 
the same time, attaching equal importance to both" and launched 
relentless blows against serious criminal activities. During 
1993, various people's courts in the country handled 403,267 
criminal cases of first instance and concluded 403,177 trials of 
such cases. A total of 451,920 criminals were imposed sentences 
with legal binding, of which 173,897 criminals were sentenced to 
five or more years of fixed-term imprisonment, life 
imprisonment, or death (including those sentenced to death with 
a temporary stay of execution for two years), accounting for 
38.48 percent of those being punished or 3.86 percent more than 
the percentage of those being severely punished in the previous 
year; 269,652 people were punished by imprisonment of less than 
five years, detention, or probation; 6,371 people were exempted 
from punishment; and 2,000 people were declared not guilty. 
Various people's courts completed the trial of 95.11 percent of 
those cases within the legal time limit. The various people's 
courts' punishment of criminals played an important role in 
strengthening comprehensive management of public security, 
maintaining social stability, and guaranteeing the smooth 
development of reform, opening up, and economic construction. 
  Take a firm grip on major cases, strike relentless 
blows against criminals. In view of poor public security 
and the constant occurrence of serious and vile criminal cases 
in some localities, people's courts at various levels stressed 
handling cases of murder, robbery, rape, setting off explosives, 
kidnapping, extortion, and hooliganism, especially crimes 
committed by gangs, and severely punished criminals in a prompt 
manner in accordance with the law. During 1993, various people's 
courts sentenced 237,164 criminals who seriously endangered 
state security and public order with legal binding, of which 
141,460 people were sentenced to five or more years of 
fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment, or death (including 
those who were sentenced to death with a temporary stay of 
execution for two years), accounting for 59.62 percent of those 
punished or 2.6 percent more than the percentage of those 
severely punished in the previous year. Various people's courts 
effectively struck blows against serious criminals and had a 
quite good effect on society. 
  Launch struggles against specific crimes in a 
deep-going way to stop the spread of serious crimes. In 
recent years, "highway robbery and railroad banditry" have been 
rampant on some railroads and highways, and criminal activities, 
including robbery, theft, kidnapping women and children for 
sale, and organizing and forcing women to engage in 
prostitution, have been very serious in some locales. Last 
year, people's courts at various levels coordinated with public 
security and people's procuratorates in accordance with 
arrangements made by the Central Committee for Comprehensive 
Management of Public Security and concentrated their efforts on 
launching struggles against specific crimes with significant 
results. Meanwhile, people's courts in various locales 
concentrated their efforts on cracking down on prominent crimes 
in light of the actual situation in those places. For instance, 
Yunnan and Guangdong Provinces cracked down on many cases of 
smuggling and drug trafficking. The people's courts in those 
provinces severely punished criminals according to the law by 
seriously implementing the "Decision on Bannning Drugs" of the 
NPC Standing Committee. In view of the actual requirement of 
dealing relentless blows against drug trafficking, the Supreme 
People's Court in June 1993 authorized the Guangdong Higher 
People's Court to sentence some drug traffickers to death. 
Various people's courts in the country handled 5,020 drug 
related cases, and severely punished a number of serious 
offenders. This has promoted the struggle against narcotics. 
During an earlier period, there were increasing cases of 
secretly crossing the national borders in Fujian, Zhejiang, 
Guangdong, and other coastal areas. The Supreme People's Court 
promptly made arrangements and issued a "Circular on Severely 
Cracking Down on Illegal Crossing the National Borders and 
Related Crimes." People's courts in places where illegal 
crossing of the national borders was frequent closely 
coordinated with local public security and other concerned 
departments and launched a struggle against this specific crime. 
The people's courts have severely punished those criminals who 
organized stowaways, and have in the main stopped the spread of 
such illegal activities. 
  Actively take part in the comprehensive effort to 
improve public security in close conjunction with trial 
work. Last year, while handling down severe punishments to 
criminals in accordance with law, people's courts also seriously 
took part in the comprehensive effort to improve public 
security, especially in areas where public order was in a state 
of chaos. First, through such forms as public trials, public 
sentencing, and explaining laws in connection with criminal 
cases, people's courts promoted education to publicize the legal 
system to enhance citizens' concept of the law, to frighten 
criminals, and to encourage the masses to struggle against 
criminal activities. Second, people's courts improved the work 
of submitting proposals in connection with the administration of 
justice. In the past year, to deal with problems discovered in 
the course of trials, they have submitted to the relevant 
departments and units more than 60,000 judicial proposals aimed 
at improving management, plugging loopholes, and improving the 
trial system, most of which have been adopted. Third, people's 
courts strengthened the work of juvenile courts in order to 
protect the legitimate rights and interests of minors and to 
prevent crime or reduce the number of crimes committed by 
juveniles. Fourth, people's courts continued to implement the 
principle of integrating specialized organs with the mass line, 
and where conditions permit, the majority of the criminal 
elements whose crimes were fairly minor were put on probation 
and public surveillance. Last year a total of 60,992 criminals 
were sentenced to probation and placed under the control of the 
public who helped in educating and transforming them. At the 
same time, in the course of reform through labor, those 
criminals who truly repented or demonstrated meritorious service 
had their sentences reduced or were paroled according to law. 
Last year a total of 230,052 sentence reduction cases and 
33,388 parole cases were processed. Fifth, people's courts 
strengthened work at basic- level units. Fully taking advantage 
of the characteristic that they maintain close ties with the 
masses, who had easy access for filing their own legal 
proceedings, people's courts promptly transferred a large number 
of cases of civil and economic disputes and minor criminal cases 
to people's mediation committees under guidance so as to prevent 
contradictions from getting worse and to reduce crime. 
  2. Resolutely Launch Struggle Against Corruption and 
Severely Crack Down on Serious Economic Crimes 
  In August 1993, especially after the CPC Central Committee 
made the decision and plan to strengthen the struggle against 
corruption, courts throughout the country gave primary 
importance to the struggle to severely crack down, according to 
law, on serious economic crimes such as embezzlement and 
accepting bribes. New progress was made in this work. Last 
year, a total of 27,463 cases of economic crimes of the first 
instance were accepted, and 27,323 of them were handled. Of 
that number, 15,204 cases were accepted and 16,143 cases were 
handled between August and December, the monthly average of 
which increased 73.62 percent and 102.13 percent, respectively, 
over the previous 7 months. Last year, a total of 22,106 
offfenders were given sentences with legal binding, excepting 
lawsuits being processed, the cases dismissed by procuratorates, 
and those being returned to procuratorates for further 
investigations. Of this number, 6,863 offenders were sentenced 
to fixed-term imprisonment of over 5 years, to life 
imprisonment, and to death (including a two-year stay of 
execution), accounting for 31.05 percent, an increase of 7.17 
percentage points over 1992; 14,351 offenders were sentenced to 
fixed-term imprisonment of below 5 years, to criminal detention, 
and to control through public surveillance; 540 offenders were 
exempted from criminal punishment; and 352 people were declared 
not guilty. 
  Vigorously concentrate on the trial of major economic 
criminal bases. In July last year, the Supreme People's 
Court convened a national conference of heads of high courts to 
draw up a special plan for handling economic crime trials, 
especially major cases involving embezzlement and acceptance of 
bribes. At the conference, the Supreme People's Court stressed 
that it was necessary to make this work the criterion for 
judging success or failure in the struggle against corruption. 
To carefully implement the relevant instructions, people's 
courts at all levels adopted a series of measures and 
concentrated on organizing efforts meticulously. The Supreme 
People's Court and the high people's courts strengthened their 
guidance and supervision over the trial of major cases. Last 
year, a total of 7,872 criminal cases involving over 10,000 yuan 
were tried in the country, accounting for 54.75 percent of the 
total number of economic crimes, an increase of 10.66 percentage 
points over the previous year. Of the total number of cases of 
economic crimes, 443 casses involved a sum of over 300,000 yuan. 
Those criminals who received sentences included 69 county-level 
cadres and 7 cadres of departmental and bureau level. People's 
courts tried to promote the deepening of the struggle against 
corruption by holding public trials and public sentencing and 
conducted extensive propaganda activities; the Supreme People's 
Court and some local courts also held many news conferences to 
announce the results of the trials of major economic cases. 
This had strong repercussions throughout the country and 
yielded good social effects. 
  Severely punish those who commit the crimes of 
corruption, bribery, and embezzlement of public money. In 
recent years, some public functionaries, including a small 
handful of leading cadres, have taken advantage of their 
positions to commit crimes of corruption, bribery, and 
embezzlement of public money. The situation was serious, and 
their behavior was hated bitterly by the masses. The people's 
courts stressed punishing some functionaries of party and 
government leading organs, judicial and administrative 
departments, and economic management departments who have taken 
advantage of their position to commit the crimes of corruption, 
bribery, and embezzlement of public money. During 1993, 
people's courts punished 11,388 people who committed such 
crimes. Among those people, Xue Genhe, former accountant of the 
Dongfeng Branch Office of the Haikou City Industry-Commerce 
Bank, collaborated with other people and embezzled 33.44 million 
yuan. The amount embezzled was the largest in any trial since 
the founding of New China. Xue Genhe and three other principal 
offenders were sentenced to death in accordance with the law. 
Li Xiaoshi, former vice minister of the State Science and 
Technology Commission, commited the crimes of taking bribes and 
corruption, and Shen Taifu, former president of the Beijing 
Changcheng Machano-Electrical and Scientific and Technological 
Products Corporation, committed the crimes of corruption and 
bribery. The two cases were followed with much interest by 
people of various circles. Taking advantage of his position, Li 
Xiaoshi supported Shen Taifu's illegal fund-raising activities 
and accepted bribes totalling more than 52,000 yuan from Shen 
Taifu and other people. In addition, he also embezzled 20,000 
yuan of public money. Li Xiaoshi was sentenced to 20 years 
fixed- term imprisonment in first instance by the Beijing 
Municipal Intermediate People's Court on 4 March this year for 
his crimes. Through illegal fund-raising activities, Shen Taifu 
collaborated with his wife to embezzle 1 million yuan, and he 
himself embezzled 2 million yuan and gave bribes totalling 
250,000 yuan. He was sentenced to death in the first instance 
by the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court on 4 March 
this year for his crimes. Li Xiaoshi and Shen Taifu have 
appealed, and the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court is 
hearing the case in the second instance. 
  Firmly crack down on the crime of smuggling. In 
recent years, the crime of smuggling, especially smuggling by 
some units, has been quite serious and the amount involed in 
smuggling has become bigger and bigger. The people's courts in 
various places severely punished those who committed the crime 
of smuggling in line with the arrangements made by the party 
Central Committee and the State Council on cracking down on 
smuggling. The people's courts handled a number of major 
smuggling cases involving some units, and resolutely punished 
some people who were directly responsible for those units and 
people directly involved in smuggling activities in accordance 
with the law. In the last year, 307 people who committed the 
crime of smuggling were punished. Liu Qishan, former director 
of the Commerce Bureau of Rushan city in Shandong Province, and 
others smuggled cigarettes. They collaborated with foreign 
smugglers and their smuggling activities involved a huge amount 
of money, creating a very bad impression in society. On 15 
February this year, the Weihai city Intermediate People's Court 
in Shandong Province sentenced Liu Qishan; Fan Zhanwu, former 
political commissar of the Weihai City Border Defense Subbureau; 
and Liu Ning, former deputy head of operations department of the 
Weihai City Border Defense Subbureau, to death in the first 
instance for their crimes of smuggling and taking bribes. Wang 
Jianzhi, former secretary of the party committee of Rushan city 
was sentenced to death with temporary stay of execution for two 
years for his crimes of taking bribes and self-seeking 
misconduct. The two defendents have appealed to the Shandong 
Provincial Higher People's Court, which is hearing the case in 
the second instance. 
  Harshly cracking down on the crime of manufacturing 
and marketing counterfeit and inferior commodities. This 
is the masses' strong wish and a demand and an urgent need for 
safeguarding the order of the socialist market economy. Last 
year, enforcing the NPC Standing Committee's "Supplementary 
Regulations for Punishing the Crime of Counterfeiting Trade 
Marks" and the "Decision on Punishing the Crime of Producing and 
Marketing Counterfeit and Inferior Commodities," people's courts 
in the country firmly punished the manufacturers and sellers of 
counterfeit and inferior commodities, imposed fines on them, and 
confisticated their property. Verdicts were pronounced on 314 
felons of this category in 1993. 
  Although significant success was achieved in cracking down 
on 
crime in the year, certain problems persisted as can be observed 
from the fact that certain criminal cases were not prosecuted or 
had their criminal liabilities determinated. This problem was 
particularly noticeable for cases relevant to smuggling, the 
manufacturing and marketing of counterfeit and inferior 
commodities, tax evasion, and nonpayment of taxes. Owing to 
local and departmental protectionism, the problem of "paying 
fines in lieu of serving prison terms" remained unresolved. To 
deepen the struggle against economic felons, problems must be 
dealt with according to law otherwise they cannot be resolved. 
  3. Judicial Means Should Be Employed To Regulate 
Relations Between Economic Sectors and Safeguard the Development 
of the Market Economy 
  As the reform of the economic system continues to deepen and 
the socialist market economy continues to develop, the area for 
people's courts to regulate relations between economic sectors 
through court hearings has expanded. The number of economic 
disputes soared substantially in 1993, and the nature of many 
cases was new. In 1993, people's courts accepted 894,410 cases 
of first instance, which was 37.15 percent higher than the 
number of cases accepted in 1992; and they finished handling 
883,681 cases, exceeding the preceding year by 36.08 percent. 
The total money involved in the litigation reached 70.5 billion 
yuan, an increase of 111.38 percent over that of the year before. 
  People's courts have intensified the handling of 
financial disputes and protected the state's macroeconomic 
regulation and control by means of judicial measures. 
After the CPC Central Committee and the State Council decided 
last year to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, 
the Supreme People's Court immediately came up with specific 
plans for ensuring macroeconomic regulation and control through 
court hearings. In view of the shortage of circulating funds in 
some banks and credit departments caused by the chaos of recent 
years concerning interbank loans and delinquent loan payments, 
people's courts at various levels have conducted special 
hearings on screening interbank loans and recovering unpaid 
debts. In 1993, they finished handling 267,853 cases concerning 
contract disputes, exceeding the preceding year by 46.38 
percent. People's courts also accepted the handling a large 
number of new financial disputes generated during the course of 
deepening reform and opening up wider to the outside world. In 
1993, they finished handling 1,838 cases of disputes concerning 
stocks, securities, negotiable instruments, loans, and leases, 
or an increase of 57.09 percent over that of the preceding year. 
Their efforts have helped the development of the financial 
market. 
  People's courts have safeguarded the order of commodity 
production and distribution by intensifying efforts in handling 
disputes over buying-selling contracts. Last year, 
people's courts in the country finished handling 308,240 cases 
concerning disputes over contracts about buying and selling, and 
the number surpassed that of the preceding year by 43.97 
percent. While handling cases of this category, people's courts 
insist on protecting litigants' legitimate rights and interests 
fairly as well as the contracts' validity according to law, 
making sure that obligations are strictly met, risks are borne 
reasonably; that legitimate competition is protected, 
illegitimate competition is outlawed, and cheating is punished; 
and that order in the consolidated and open markets is 
safeguarded. 
  Strengthen hearings of enterprise contract and 
bankruptcy cases to steer enterprises toward markets. Last 
year, people's courts vigorously accepted cases involving such 
economic activities as management contracts, leasing contracts, 
cooperative operation contracts, and merging of enterprises; 
they tried a total of 22,056 such cases, up 54.19 percent over 
the previous year, thus safeguarding enterprises' operation and 
management rights according to law and promoting the 
transformation of the operating mechanisms of state-owned 
enterprises. An increasing number of bankruptcy cases were 
filed as the reform of the economic structure and market 
competition deepened. Last year, a total of 478 enterprise 
bankruptcy cases were tried, up 80.38 percent over the previous 
year. Of the figure, 171 were bankruptcy cases filed by 
state-owned enterprises, and 307 were those filed by 
nonstate-owned enterprises. Practice has proven that handling 
bankruptcy cases according to law played a positive role in 
optimizing the industrial structure, rationalizing the 
allocation of resources, and establishing a modern enterprise 
system. 
  Strengthen hearings of cases involving intellectual 
property rightS disputes and technical contract disputes to 
promote the development of science and technology and the 
technology market. People's courts have attached great 
importance to protecting intellectual property rights through 
the application of judicial means. To meet the needs of trial 
work, some provinces, municipalities under the central 
government, and coastal open cities, including Beijing, 
Guangdong, Shanghai, Hainan, Fujian, and Shenzhen, have set up 
intellectual property rights trial courts. Last year, the 
country's courts tried a total of 2,777 cases of intellectual 
property rights and technological contract disputes involving 
patents, trademarks, and copyrights, up 16.39 percent over the 
previous year. The trials of these cases thus protected the 
legitimate rights and interests of domestic and foreign owners 
of intellectual property rights and accelerated the 
commercialization and industrialization of technological 
research results. 
  Strengthen hearings of cases of disputes over rural 
contracting agreements and cases of economic disputes involving 
town and village enterprises. Proceeding from the 
objective of stabilizing the responsibility system, the main 
form of which is the household contract with remuneration linked 
to output, and of promoting the dual management system 
comprising unified management and independent management, 
people's courts safeguarded, according to law, the stability of 
contract agreements by earnestly trying contract dispute cases 
involving rural areas. Last year, the country's courts tried 
47,452 such cases. At the same time, people's courts also 
promptly heard economic dispute cases which had emerged in the 
production and operation of town and village enterprises, thus 
playing a positive role in improving the contract managerial 
responsibility system for town and village enterprises, 
promoting the cooperative shareholding system, and accelerating 
the healthy development of town and village enterprises. 
  Strengthen hearings of cases involving maritime 
disputes and cases of economic disputes involving foreign, Hong 
Kong, Macao, and Taiwan businesses to render service to the 
country's opening to the outside world. Maritime disputes 
have increased yearly following the vigorous growth of China's 
economic and trade relations with foreign countries and the 
expansion of its ocean transport services. Last year, the 
country's maritime courts accepted 1,830 cases of maritime 
disputes of the first instance, up 10.64 percent over the 
previous year, and tried 1,607 such cases, up 11.91 percent over 
the previous year. People's courts also tried 1,311 cases of 
economic disputes involving foreign, Hong Kong, Macao, and 
Taiwan businesses, up 39.62 over 1922. In hearing cases 
involving foreign businesses, the people's courts upheld the 
principle of safeguarding state sovereignty, exercised fully 
China's right of judicial jurisdiction, and impartially 
protected the rights and interests of domestic and foreign 
litigants in accordance with international treaties in which 
China is a participating member or which China has concluded and 
in observance of international practices. The prompt and proper 
hearing of such cases has helped improve the investment 
environment in China and promote the development of economic and 
trade relations with foreign countries. 
  4. Protect the Legitimate Rights and Interests of 
Citizens and Legal Persons Through Trials 
  In 1993 people's courts attached greater importance to 
employing such judicial means as civil trials and administrative 
trials to protect the legitimate rights and interests of 
citizens and legal persons, and handled, according to law, a 
large number of cases involving individual rights and property 
rights. New progress was made in the judicial protection of 
human rights in China. 
  Effectively protect the civil rights of citizens and 
legal persons according to law. Last year, the country's 
courts accepted 2,089,257 civil cases of the first instance, up 
7.21 percent over the previous year, accounting for 61.18 
percent of the total number of cases of the first instance, and 
tried 2,091,651 cases, up 7.32 percent over the previous year. 
First, the number of divorce cases continued to rise. In 1993 
people's courts accepted 946,682 divorce cases, up 5.57 percent 
over the previous year, and tried 950,835 cases, up 5.91 percent 
over the previous year. In the course of handling divorce 
cases, disputes between spouses over the right to own or use 
property and real estate occurred frequently due to the increase 
of jointly owned property. This made it rather difficult to 
confirm and divide common property. People's courts solved 
these problems in line with the principles of equality for men 
and women, of seeking truth from facts, and of fairness and 
rationality. The people's courts also handled, according to 
law, a large number of cases involving the bringing up of one's 
children or the children of martyrs, and providing for one's own 
parents, thus protecting the legitimate rights and interests of 
women, children, and old people and promoting the socialist 
family relationship of married couples and the development of 
new socialist customs. Second, the number of cases involving 
the rights of reputation, honor, title, name, and personal 
photographs increased considerably. The situation regarding the 
major litigants also changed. They included citizens, legal 
persons, or other organizations in addition to residents of Hong 
Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, and foreigners. Many cases involving 
the right of reputation had a great impact on society because 
they were directly related to production, scienctific and 
technological, and business activities. Last year, the 
country's courts accepted 4,760 cases of this type, up 26.56 
percent over the previous year, and tried 4,650 cases, up 29.09 
percent over the previous year. Third, with the labor market 
becoming more active and the expansion of enterprises' rights to 
make their own decisions, labor contract disputes and other 
labor disputes involving wages, insurance, welfare benefits, and 
labor protection rose markedly. Last year, the country's courts 
accepted 1,092 cases of labor disputes, up 19.89 percent over 
the previous year. In handling these cases, the people's courts 
safeguarded the legitimate rights and interests of staff members 
and workers and protected their enthusiasm for production 
according to law, while at the same time protecting the 
independent right of enterprises in hiring workers in order to 
maintain normal production order. Fourth, in the development of 
the private and individual sectors of the economy, debt cases 
involving nongovernmental organizations or civilians have been 
increasing yearly. Last year, the country's courts accepted a 
total of 639,266 debt cases, up 12.61 percent over the previous 
year, and tried 638,318 cases, up 12.08 percent over the 
previous year. In handling these cases, the people's courts 
upheld the principle of creating favorable conditions for 
production and livelihood, thus protecting the legitimate rights 
and interests of lenders and borrowers. 
  Fifth, due to development of the real estate industry, 
court trial cases of land development, housing sales, and real 
estate mortgages cropped up continuously. They involved a large 
amount of money in lawsuits and complicated legal relationships. 
Last year, courts across the country handled a total of 82,024 
cases of real estate and housing sales disputes among the people 
and wound up 81,366 cases, up 10.8 and 8.07 percent respectively 
over the previous year. Upholding the principle of equality, 
voluntariness, honesty, trustworthiness, and compensation of 
equal value, people's courts properly handled these cases and 
promoted healthy development of the real estate market. 
  Protect the legitimate rights and interests of 
citizens, legal persons, and other organizations from being 
infringed upon according to law; uphold and supervise 
administrative organs' administration according to law. 
People's courts made new progress in exercising their 
administration of justice over the past year. They handled a 
total of 27,911 administration cases at first hearing and wound 
up 27,958 cases [as received] over the whole year. In 23.56 
percent of the cases mentioned above, they upheld the decisions 
made by administrative organs; in 20.39 percent of the above 
cases, they annulled and altered administrative organs' 
decisions; 41.31 percent of the above cases were withdrawn; and 
14.74 percent of the cases were handled by them in a way other 
than legal proceedings. The administration cases handled by 
people's courts involved over 30 fields of endeavor, including 
land, public security, industry and commerce, urban 
construction, environmental protection, and taxation. The 
courts focused attention on hearing administration cases 
concerning enterprises' transformation of operating mechanisms 
and [administrative organs'] adding to peasants' burdens. They 
corrected specific illegal administrative behaviors of 
administrative organs and supported their specific legal 
administrative behaviors. Through court hearings of the 
administration cases that had cropped up in the process of 
enterprises' transformation of operationg mechanisms, they 
corrected and put an end to such illegal behavior as unwarranted 
pooling of funds, arbitrary requisition of donations, and 
exacting fees from enterprises that infringed on their 
management decisionmaking power. Through court hearings of a 
small number of administration cases caused by administrative 
organs' adding to peasants' burdens and illegally demanding that 
peasants bear expenses or provide labor services, they protected 
peasants' interests and aroused their enthusiasm for production. 
Some courts made timely judicial suggestions for solving the 
problems existing in administrative organs' law enforcement 
which had been brought to light during hearings. For example, 
the judicial suggestions made by some courts to local 
governments were directed against the addition of burdens to 
peasants in their respective localities; they suggested that the 
expenses peasants ought to bear and labor services they ought to 
provide according to law and policy be brought into the orbit of 
control by a legal system through the signing of an agreement. 
If adopted, the suggestion shall be followed in the whole 
province. Based on applications submitted by administrative 
organs, courts at all levels enforced the implementation of 
88,147 administrative decisions, thereby effectively supporting 
administrative organs' administration according to law. At 
present, the main problems existing in administration of justice 
are: Some citizens dare not take legal proceedings against 
administrative organs for fear of retaliation; some 
administrative organs are unwilling to appear in court for fear 
of adversely affecting their prestige; and, for fear of 
adversely affecting their relationship with administrative 
organs, some judicial personnel are afraid of difficulty. To 
better carry out administration of justice, we should more 
intensely study and more extensively propagandize the 
administrative procedural law, and conscientiously solve the 
problems of understanding existing in people's minds as well as 
other realistic problems. 
  Strengthening the handling of complaints and 
petitions and protecting citizens' litigation rights. 
Courts in all parts of the country handled 1,838,254 letters 
and received 3,820,477 visits from people last year. Of the 
5,658,731 letters and visits, 785,802 were petitions, 3,508,562 
were complaints, and 1,364,367 were related to other matters. 
People's courts placed the petitions and complaints on file for 
investigation or trial on a timely basis after conducting 
preliminary review and examination of the cases, and they also 
transmitted cases not within court jurisdiction to proper 
authorities for handling. To improve the handling of complaints 
and petitions, some people's courts established special task 
forces, some enacted rules and regulations to facilitate 
litigation by the masses, and some took to the streets and 
villages to offer legal services or established petition 
stations in outlying areas. As a result, difficulties 
encountered by the masses in bringing litigation were further 
ameliorated. 
  5. Strictly Enforcing the Law Without Wavering and 
Strengthen Judicial Ranks 
  Courts across the country adopted a number of measures 
during 
the past year to strictly enforce the law, improve judicial 
standards, and strengthen judicial ranks. Fairly good results 
were achieved in this regard. 
  Holding fair trials in accordance with the law. 
In view of the failure to strictly adhere to the law in trial 
proceedings in some localities, the Supreme People's Court 
stressed that people's courts at all levels must uphold the 
policy of relying on facts as the basis and law as the criteria; 
handle cases strictly in accordance with the substantive and 
procedural laws; handle well every case with a strong sense of 
responsibility toward the people's interests and state laws; 
always exercise their judicial power independently in accordance 
with the law; resolutely oppose and resist local and 
departmental protectionism and various kinds of interference to 
safeguard the unity and authority of the law; and uphold the 
system of trials in public and place trial activities under the 
supervision of the masses through open investigation, debate, 
and sentencing. The results of the general law and discipline 
enforcement inspection conducted by courts across the country 
since late last year show that the quality of case handling was 
essentially good. To ensure strict enforcement of the law in 
trial, the Supreme People's Court strengthened supervision over 
local and special people's courts, and all other people's courts 
strengthened supervision over courts at the lower level. At the 
same time, people's courts at all levels also strengthened the 
mechanism to tighten internal supervision. Some courts 
implemented on a trial basis a system of accountability for 
wrong verdicts. Based on the principle of "seeking truth from 
facts and correcting mistakes whenever they are discovered," 
people's courts resolutely corrected unfair verdicts and 
mistakes in law enforcement in accordance with the law. They 
also subpoenaed, in accordance with the law, cases which could 
not be fairly tried by a lower people's court because of 
interference. Last year, following the trial supervision 
procedures, courts across the country reviewed 73,121 criminal, 
civil, economic, administrative, and maritime cases sentenced 
since the founding of the republic. Of the total, verdicts on 
14,271 cases were found to be wrong and reversed. Courts across 
the country also tried 226 criminal, civil, economic, and 
administrative cases brought by procuratorial organs protesting 
the verdicts. In addition, 1,715 criminal cases were tried in 
accordance with the procedures of trial at second instance. Of 
the 1,941 cases brought by procuratorial organs, 686 had their 
verdicts reversed in accordance with the law after it was found 
that the protest was justified; 792 had their verdicts upheld 
after the protest was found unsustainable; 219 were withdrawn by 
procuratorial organs themselves; and 244 were handled in other 
ways. 
  Further strengthen the work of enforcement. To 
ensure plaintiffs' right of entity recognized by judges, 
people's courts at all levels set up enforcement offices, 
replenished enforcement personnel, and strengthened enforcement 
measures in order to overcome the "difficulty in enforcement." 
The Supreme People's Court urged all local courts to earnestly 
do a good job in commissioned enforcement, and stepped up 
guidance and coordination of enforcement work by courts 
throughout the country. Efforts were made to, according to the 
law, resolutely enforce court orders, which plaintiffs were able 
to, but refused or procrastinated to comply with; to punish 
plaintiffs whose refusal to comply with orders constituted a 
crime; and to suspend or terminate court orders which the 
plaintiffs were indeed unable to comply with. People's courts 
at various levels also stopped and corrected in good time a 
number of irregularities involving coercion in some localities; 
and duly investigated and handled violations of the law by a 
handful of cadres and police in the course of enforcement. Last 
year the people's courts enforced a total of 912,354 civil, 
economic, and administrative judgments and orders, which 
accounted for 80.37 percent of the total accepted cases; and 
which involved a total of 21.2 billion yuan, up 132.16 percent 
from the previous year. Hence, some progress was made in 
enforcement work. 
  Strive to improve the quality of personnel. To 
strictly enforce laws, we must have a contingent of judicial 
personnel who are impartial and honest in performing duties. In 
the past year, we relentlessly promoted the construction of a 
contingent of impartial and honest personnel, while organizing 
all cadres and police to diligently study Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, intensifying the 
building of leading bodies, and conducting professional training 
of various kinds. In accordance with the central authorities' 
plans for the anticorruption drive, the Supreme People's Court 
successively issued the "Circular on Correcting Lax Law 
Enforcement and the Unhealthy Tendency of Arbitrary Exaction of 
Fees" and the "Circular on Launching a General Law Enforcement 
Inspection." People's courts at all levels earestly implemented 
the central authorities' plans, and leading cadres examined and 
corrected themselves in accordance with the "five regulations" 
for honesty and self-discipline. Special task forces were set 
up to investigate and rectify the unhealthy tendence of 
"arbitrary extraction of fees" in some courts. Efforts were 
made to seriously investigate and punish cases of violation of 
the law and discipline by a handful of cadres and police; and a 
total of 850 were puinshed, including 53 receiving criminal 
punishments (of these, 35 were judicial personnel). Among the 
cadres and police punished for violation of the law and 
discipline were those who accepted bribes and bent the law for 
the benefit of relatives or friends; who perverted the law and 
practiced favoritism; who accepted gifts and engaged in other 
unhealthy practices; and who led a dissolute life. Through 
seriously investigating and punishing lawless elements and 
discipline violators and correcting unhealthy practices, courts 
achieved some results in the anticorruption drive. Generally 
speaking, the quality of court personnel is relatively good. 
Last year court cadres and court police throughout the country, 
in spite of relatively poor working and living conditions, 
carried forward the fine tradition of arduous struggle, worked 
hard and conscientiously, and made their share of contributions 
to the work of people's courts. A number of advanced 
collectives and individuals were commended. Throughout the 
year, a total of 1,480 units and 5,606 judges and other state 
members received first, second, or third class merit citations, 
including six judges who received the honorific title of 
national model judge from the Supreme People's Court. 
  Deputies, in 1993, under the party's leadership and the 
people's congress supervision, courts across the country 
emancipated their minds, sought truth from facts, and carried 
out trial work in an all-around way to serve the needs of 
reform, development, and stability. A total of 3,406,467 cases 
of first instance in different categories were concluded during 
the year, a 11.69 percent increase over the previous year. 
Despite their achievements last year, people's courts at all 
levels and special courts also had shortcomings in their work. 
Their primarily shortcomings were: A number of cases were not 
handled on a timely basis; a few criminal cases were given 
sentences that were either too severe or too lenient; some 
courts failed to strictly enforce the law and, particularly in 
handling economic disputes, they were guilty of local 
protectionism and failed to conduct a fair trial; there were 
instances of improper compulsory measures or lack of forceful 
measures in executing court orders; there were increased 
violations of law and discipline by court cadres and police in 
some areas; the Supreme People's Court failed to conduct 
sufficient in-depth investigation and study on new developments 
and problems facing court work under the conditions of building 
a socialist market economy, and it failed to provide adequate 
administrative guidance to the lower people's courts and 
adequate supervision over their trial work to meet the needs of 
the development of the situation. In light of this, we plan to 
adopt effective measures in the new year to earnestly resolve 
these shortcomings. 
  6. The People's Courts' Primary Tasks in 1994 
  The year 1994 is important to the continuous development of 
China's national economy and the overall progress of its 
economic structural reform. The Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee established the basic framework of 
socialist market economic structure, and the National People's 
Congress and its Standing Committee have presented a preliminary 
blueprint for developing a legal system compatible with 
socialist market economy. Seizing the opportunity, deepening 
reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability represent the overall interests of this year's work 
for the entire party and nation. People's courts must recognize 
this and conduct their trial work in subordination of and serve 
these overall interests. In 1994, the guiding ideology for 
judicial work throughout the country is: To use Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line as the guide; 
earnestly implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National 
Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee; adhere to the principle of "grasping two links at the 
same time, attaching equal importance to both;" strictly enforce 
laws; strive to improve judicial standards; and reform and 
perfect the judicial system so as to provide a strong judicial 
safeguard for maintaining social stability, accelerating the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure, and 
maintaining a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
national economy. This year, we will focus on carrying out the 
following work: 
  First, continue to unswervingly and sternly crack down 
on criminal offenses which pose a grave threat to public 
security, and on embezzlement, bribery, and other serious 
economic crimes. Currently, public order in some localities 
is poor, and the masses have a lot of complaints about this. 
Safeguarding stability, therefore, remains an important task 
for people's courts this year. We must uphold the policy of 
seriously cracking down on crimes; sternly punish criminal 
elements who seriously endanger national security and public 
order; resolutely crack down on kidnapping and selling women and 
children, drug trafficking, and other criminal activities known 
as the "six pests;" eradicate social evils; actively take part 
in comprehensively tackling problems of public order; and make 
all-out efforts to safeguard the country's and society's 
stability. 
  Along with the deepening of the current anticorruption 
drive, there will be an increase in economic criminals 
prosecuted by people's courts and serious economic crimes of 
embezzlement and bribery will be further brought to light. 
People's courts should focus the anticorruption drive on 
cracking embezzlement and bribery cases, concentrating efforts 
to meticulously organize trials of major and serious cases, 
firmly eliminating interferences, and severely punishing 
criminal offenders according to the law, thereby enhancing the 
masses' confidence in fighting corruption and continually 
deepening the anticorruption drive. 
  Second, it is necessary to use judicial means to more 
efficiently regulate relations between various economic sectors 
and protect the lawful rights and interests of citizens and 
corporations. This year, China will undertake major 
reforms of the economic structure. Conflicts and disputes of 
interests emerging during the transition from the old to the new 
system will more and more demand settlement through legal 
proceedings; and cases of economic disputes will continue to 
climb and involve an ever widening spectrum. Through 
administering justice, people's courts should standardize market 
activities, maintain market order, and promote the cultivation 
of markets, thereby bringing into play the role of ensuring 
justice. Meanwhile, it is necessary to handle properly, 
promptly, and according to the law a host of civil and 
administrative lawsuits and petitions related to the masses' 
production and everyday life, so as to prevent aggravation of 
contradicions, to protect citizens' personal rights and 
property, to safeguard and supervise the lawful exercise of 
functions by administrative organs, and to promote social 
stability and unity and the building of socialist spiritual 
civilization. 
  Third, it is necessary to go all out to step up 
investigations and study as well as work related to judicial 
interpretation. People's courts at all levels, especially 
the Supreme People's Court and higher people's courts, should 
organize personnel to conduct in- depth investigations and study 
focused on common and typical problems cropping up in judicial 
work under the new situation arising from the establishment of a 
socialist market economic system; and should summarize 
experiences in judicial work and propose suggestions for solving 
problems. Meanwhile, they should put forward legislative 
suggestions to people's congresses and judicial suggestions to 
relevant units concerning problems discovered in judicial 
trials. Along with the continuous promulgation and 
implementation of new laws, the Supreme People's Court should 
strengthen the work related to judicial interpretation and 
supervision and exercise guidance over the judicial work of 
courts throughout the country. 
  Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen reform and 
construction of the courts. The Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee has stressed the needs to reform 
and perfect the judicial system and to improve the quality of 
administering justice, thereby setting an explicit demand to 
reform people's courts. This year courts throughout the country 
must further reform the system of judges, perfect court 
structure and organization, improve judicial patterns, and 
intensify grass-roots construction. In conjunction with these 
tasks, it is necessary to do a good job in drafting or revising 
the "law on judges (draft)," "organic law on people's courts 
(revised draft)," and "organic laws on people's tribunals 
(draft)." These three draft laws have been incorporated into 
the legislative work plan of the current NPC Standing Committee. 
To successfully fulfill the tasks of judicial work and promote 
the reform of courts, people's courts at all levels should 
further improve the quality of personnel with focus on the 
promotion of honest administration of justice and the 
improvement of ideology and work style. They should continue to 
pay strict attention to studying Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping for strengthening and improving 
ideological and political work. They should step up education 
and training of cadres and strive to improve their political 
awareness and professional competence, seeing to it that laws 
are observed and strictly enforced and lawbreakers are punished. 
Essential material conditions are the guarantee for the 
fulfillment of judicial tasks. Last year, thanks to the kind 
concern and support of people's congresses and governments at 
all levels, working conditions of the people's courts were 
further improved. However, quite a few courts in the country 
are short of funds and have antiquated facilities. The lack of 
judicial tribunals in about 20 percent, and of office buildings 
in 31.8 percent of the people's courts has gravely impeded the 
strict enforcement of laws; and this problem must be resolved. 
We sincerely hope to receive the continued concern and support 
of the people's congresses and governments at all levels. 
  Fellow deputies! 
  In the coming year, the vast number of court cadres and 
police across the country, under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the 14th CPC National Congress guidelines, 
and the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade 
Jiang Zemin as the core, will adhere to the party's basic line 
and work hard and with one heart and one mind in bringing into 
full play the judicial functions of people's counts and making 
fresh contributions to accelerating the construction of 
socialist democracy and the legal system and to ensuring the 
smooth progress of reform, opening up, and the modernization 
drive!

  [Text] Beijing, March 30 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
Zhu Rongji today took part in a ten-year birthday celebration of 
the Economic and Management College of Qinghua University in 
Beijing. 
  The vice-premier said that in building socialism with 
Chinese 
characteristics, there was a need for large numbers of talented 
people in economics and management who not only have a good 
command of the general laws of a market economy and its 
operational workings, but also know well the real conditions of 
Chinese enterprises. 
  Zhu, concurrently president of the college, also sent a 
congratulatory message a few days ago, hailing the achievements 
of the college over the past decade. 
  He urged the teachers and students of the college to combine 
various kinds of advanced teaching materials and methods from 
other countries with China's actual conditions, to build a 
first-class economics and management school. 
  Over the past decade, the college has trained 1,367 
graduates 
and postgraduates for government departments and agencies, 
economic bodies and other relevant higher education 
institutions. It has also have offered short-term training 
courses for more than 6,000 students. 
  In addition, it has set up two doctorate and post-doctorate 
training centers in technology, economics and system engineering. 
  Founded in 1984, it has four departments: economics, 
management information, international finance and trade, and 
management engineering. 
  It also has four research institutes: in economic 
management, system engineering, real estate industry, technical 
economics and system analysis for energy resources. 
  The subjects taught at the college also include 
international 
finance, international industry and commerce management, 
economic law and accounting. 
  The college has also undertaken nearly 200 national research 
projects, 150 of which have already been completed. It has 
developed 863 high-tech projects in social sciences, with 40 
winning national awards for technical progress. 
  In 1991, it was authorized as one of the nine that can give 
masters' degrees to students majoring in industry and commerce 
management. 
  The college has always been active in organizing discussions 
and studies on the current economic problems China has met, such 
as macro-control in a socialist market economy, the modern 
Chinese enterprise system, China's financial system, and the 
reform and economic development.

<F P=106> [Speech given by Bo Yibo (5631 0001 3134) before the </F>
National Congress of the Association of Industrial Economics and 
the First Session of the Second Council of the National Congress 
of the Association of Industrial Economics on 3 March: "Promote 
Development With Improvement of Economic Results as the Key 
Link"] 
  [Text]When speeding up development, we must stick to 
seeking truth from facts, and proceed from reality in all 
things. We must not try to blindly compete for higher growth 
rates. In order to realize an organic combination of speed and 
benefit, we must carry out the unified industrial policies of 
the state and improve production structure, product mix, and 
enterprise organizational structure. We must also try hard to 
promote scientific and technological progress, raise the quality 
of workers, strengthen the management of our enterprises, and 
lower production costs. 
  In the past year, under the leadership of Comrade Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, the economy of our 
country has grown rapidly, reform has entered a stage of overall 
progress, and the whole economic situation has been going well. 
Since the beginning of last summer, in light of the conspicuous 
contradictions and problems arising in the course of rapid 
economic development, the party Central Committee and the State 
Council have taken prompt measures to deepen the reform and 
strengthen and improve the macroeconomic regulation and control 
using mainly economic methods. We have achieved positive 
results. While fully affirming our achievements, we should also 
soberly recognize that many deep-level problems have not been 
solved once and for all, and that the macroeconomic regulation 
and control measures already implemented have worked on the 
surface but have not yet solved the underlying problems. Our 
ultimate purpose is a fundamental reform of the economic 
structure and the establishment of a socialist market economy. 
What merits our attention is that, due to the excessive scale 
or unrestricted expansion of investment in fixed assets, 
excessive price increases, and the excessive volume of currency 
put into circulation, the inflationary pressure has not eased 
and the macroenvironment as a whole is still rather tense. 
These are, however, hardly unavoidable in the process of 
establishing a socialist market economy. Practical experience 
tells us that the process of marketization must be coordinated 
with macroeconomic regulation and control capabilities. The 
better the macroeconomic regulation and control, the fewer 
problems there will be and the more easily they can be solved. 
At present, the focus of macroeconomic regulation and control 
is strict control of the scale of investment in fixed assets. 
Our construction scope must correspond to the power of the 
country, and be well within the limit. We cannot "adapt" to the 
continuous expansion of the scale of construction by issuing 
excessive currency. We are determined to carry out to the full 
and put into practice in every aspect and every field of 
endeavor the series of policies and measures of macroeconomic 
regulation and control determined by the party Central Committee 
with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core for a fundamental reform of 
our economic system after long meticulous study. Things like 
"lower-level authorities having their own ways in dealing with 
policies from higher-level authorities" and each unit going its 
own way without listening (to the central government) must be 
totally eliminated. The interests of the whole should be taken 
into account. The authority of the party Central Committee 
should be upheld. This is the first point I want to make. 
  What should we do to correctly handle the relationship 
between speed and benefit? On 2 February, at a symposium on 
"Improving Economic Benefits in China," I gave a lecture 
entitled "Organically Combining Speed of Development With 
Economic Benefit" based on my practical experience. In this 
talk I expressed some of my opinions and quoted Comrade 
Xiaoping's words on his southern journey: "Development is the 
last word." "Do not hinder the development pace if it is 
possible to achieve it. Wherever conditions permit, you should 
develop as fast as possible. So long as attention is given to 
economic returns, quality and export-oriented economy, there is 
not much to worry about." "China's economy should strive to 
mount a new level in several years. Of course, I am not calling 
for high speed beyond our ability. We should work in a 
down-to-earth manner, stess economic returns and develop 
steadily and proportionately." I think this has been Comrade 
Xiaoping's consistent thought. The key to maintaining a 
sustained, rapid and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian 
kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of our 
national economy lies in an accurate and comprehensive 
understanding of this thought, and carrying out an organic 
combination of development speed and economic benefits. 
  It should be pointed out that in our economic work, 
carrying out this guiding thought of Comrade Xiaoping has not 
been entirely voluntary. Given that the rate of development is 
now already sufficiently high, and people are quite 
enthusiastic, I would like to emphasize that we should 
concentrate our attention on increasing economic benefits. 
Compared with advanced countries, our low industrial economic 
benefits have as yet remained relatively unchanged. One-sidedly 
seeking high output value and quantity without regard to quality 
or variety; being concerned only with what one can produce 
without regard to sales or market demand; seeking greater 
production scope without regard to improving the economic 
structure; seeking high investment volume, large production 
scope and new projects without regard to whether they can be 
sustained by national power and financial and material 
resources--all these are in fact influences from the product 
economic thought of the past. In some enterprises and some 
places they have almost become a chronic ailment, bringing about 
serious problems in the development of our cause. 
  Along with the development of the socialist market economy, 
it is now high time to wake up completely. We should have an 
accurate and correct understanding of the central authorities' 
idea of seizing the opportunity and speeding up development. We 
should not one- sidedly take it as allowing us to neglect 
economic laws and blindly seek higher growth rates. I remember 
what Comrade Xiaoping said in 1985 when the Seventh Five-Year 
Plan was being discussed: "A 7 percent growth rate is not low. 
A rate that is too high will bring about many problems and will 
have a negative influence on the reform and social conduct. It 
would be better to be steady. We must control investment in 
fixed assets. The scope of construction should not be too 
large. We must put management and quality first, and strive for 
economic and overall social benefits. Such a growth rate is 
good." The central authorities have set the rate of development 
during the Eighth Five-Year Plan at 8 to 9 percent. I think 
this is both active and safe. We should genuinely shift the 
emphasis of our economic work onto the track of taking 
improvement of economic benefits as the only link. Only such a 
rate of development can be said to be both down-to-earth and 
practical. Since an excessive scale of capital construction is 
beyond the power of the country, we would finally be forced to 
make adjustments and lose the opportunity for development, and 
this would slow down our socialist modernization. When speeding 
up development, we must stick to seeking truth from facts. We 
must not try blindly to compete for higher growth rates. We 
should combine speed with efficiency, quality, and the market in 
light of the specific conditions in different enterprises and 
localities. We must strive to reach achievable faster 
development on the basis of raising efficiency. 
  In order to realize an organic combination of speed and 
efficiency, we must implement the unified industrial policies of 
the state, and improve the industrial structure, product mix, 
and enterprise organizational structure. Imbalance in structure 
has always been the major obstacle to the healthy development of 
China's economy. It is also the major obstacle to raising 
economic efficiency. In terms of industrial development, we 
must concentrate on solving the problem of basic industries, 
especially energy and transportation, lagging behind processing 
industries; the problem of overdeveloped processing industries 
being much too overdeveloped, and the underdeveloped processing 
industries being much too underdeveloped; and the problem of the 
low-level specialization and socialization of enterprises. We 
should strive for a great improvement in economic structures, 
and base the improvement of economic efficiency on continuous 
structural improvement. 
  In order to realize an organic combination of speed and 
efficiency, we must try hard to promote scientific and 
technological progress, and raise the quality of workers. 
Comrade Xiaoping's idea that science and technology are the 
primary productive force is of great strategic significance. 
Science, technology and education are the key to changing the 
low economic efficiency of our industries and to the strategic 
transformation of extensive management into intensive 
management. We should conscientiously do a good job of training 
in-service staff, raise their quality, create a generation of 
new people who have ideals, morals, education and a sense of 
discipline, and raise the quality of workers. While digesting 
and assimilating imported technology, we should carry out a 
strategy of upgrading technology, gradually moving from a policy 
of adopting imported technologies to a policy of independent 
research and development, so that we can shorten the distance 
between China and the world's advanced countries in the field of 
science and technology development. 
  In order to realize an organic combination of speed and 
efficiency, we must strengthen the management of enterprises and 
lower production costs. The end results of the materialized 
labor in factories--products--will finally enter the market in 
the form of merchandise, for which there are no national 
borders. Higher quality products and lower prices will win in 
market competition. Comrade Xiaoping has pointed out: "China 
has many things that can be exported." "The key to sales in 
foreign markets lies in improving quality. If our quality is 
poor there will be no competitive power." To achieve this, it 
will not do not to establish a modern enterprise management 
system and it will not do not to have strict scientific 
management; it will not do not to turn our eyes inward, practice 
strict economy, and put a lot of effort into improving 
productivity. In this sense we can say that management brings 
about benefits. 
  In general, it is an arduous and complicated systems 
engineering task to follow the path of development with an 
improvement in economic benefits as the key link. We have to 
continuously make explorations in practice, promptly summarize 
our experiences and hold on to it persistently.

  [Text] Beijing, March 30 (XINHUA) -- China's government 
aims to take measures to curb illegal coal mining and improve 
safety in small township coal mines, to ensure "the healthy 
development of the industry." 
  Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua, addressing an on-going national 
work 
conference of township coal mines, said that within two years 
the sorting out and rectifying of the township coal mines 
nationwide should be completed. 
  He told officials from local governments and the ministry of 
coal industry that the guidelines to "support, innovate, 
rectify, unite and improve" township coal mines should be 
adhered to in the process, for the promotion of their healthy 
development. 
  China's township coal mines, outstripping state-owned and 
locally-owned large and medium-sized coal mines in the rate of 
development, have been one of the fastest growing sectors over 
the past 15 years. Their annual production stood at 470 million 
tons in 1993, more than three times the figure in 1978 when 
China began its open door policy. 
  With output now making up 41.2 percent of the nation's coal 
production, the township coal mines have become an important 
component of China's coal industry, Zou said. Their rapid 
development has contributed to the improved coal supply and 
continued growth of the national economy, he added. 
  However, he said, appropriate attention should be paid at 
the 
same time to the problems existing in the development of 
township coal mines. 
  Illegal mining has gone rampant. More than half the 80,000 
township coal mines in China are operating without any 
government permission. And some of them don't have basic safety 
conditions, giving rise to more accidents and deaths. 
  Zou made clear that it is the nation that possesses all coal 
reserves and the central government exercises a "centralized" 
administrative role, while the local governments play 
"subordinate" roles. 
  Therefore, every township coal mine will be screened in 
accordance with the set standards, Zou said. "Those in need of 
rectification should be overhauled and those without licence 
should try to get a government permit." 
  Zou said all the mines should be given clear territorial 
boundaries for mining to prevent indiscriminate undercutting and 
eventually waste of resources. The death rate per million tons 
in the mines should be reduced to meet the national standard, he 
stressed. 
  He ordered the coal ministry and local governments to 
strengthen cooperation and enhance administration of the mines 
in a system which unifies power and responsibility. 
  The coal market should also be addressed for the formation 
of 
better standardization of coal transportation and sale, he said. 
"We should raise the level of administrating township coal 
mines, which would contribute to a durable, sustained and 
healthy development of the national economy," he added. 
  The conference, which began on Tuesday [29 March], is 
expected to end tomorrow.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO correspondent Wang Bixue (3769 3024 1331) </F>
and XINHUA correspondent Zhou Lixian (0719 4539 2009)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 29 Mar (XINHUA) -- Relevant departments-- 
including the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's 
Procuratorate, and the Ministry of Public Security--called a 
joint teleconference this afternoon to make special arrangements 
for cracking down on such criminal activities as theft and 
sabotage of railway, oilfield, power, and communications 
equipment and facilities. State Councillor and State Council 
Secretary General Luo Gan attended and spoke at the meeting. 
  Criminal activities such as theft and sabotage of railway, 
oilfield, power, and communications equipment and facilities 
have become rampant in recent years. Incomplete statistics for 
1993 compiled by the Departments of Railways, Power, Posts and 
Telecommunications, and Petroleum show that the number of cases 
involving theft and sabotage of railway, power, communications, 
and petroleum equipment totalled over 19,600; that over 3.67 
million meters of electric wire, cable, power transmission line, 
telecommunications line, electric pump cable, and power-driven 
cable were stolen; and that over 36,000 pieces of materials from 
power transmission towers, as well as 830,000 meters of oil pump 
levers, were stolen, resulting in a direct economic loss of 319 
million yuan. These criminal acts have seriously disrupted the 
social order, have affected the state's economic construction 
and national defense building, and have resulted in a great loss 
in state property and people's lives. 
  Participants in the meeting called on local public security 
organs to increase the work of investigating and cracking such 
cases, to carry out indepth investigation and study to determine 
major regions where crackdowns are to be carried out, and to 
strive to crack a number of major cases with great impact on 
society in a short time. They also called on public security 
organs to enhance coordination with courts and procuratorates; 
to resolutely implement the policy of swiftly and severely 
cracking down on criminal activities according to law; and to 
mete out severe punishments to thieves, to those who receive and 
sell stolen goods, and to key members of theft rings who create 
major losses to industrial and agricultural production as well 
as to national defense building. 
  Participants in the meeting also stressed that those who 
steal and sabotage military communications equipment, railway 
and power facilities, and other important production equipment 
should never be let off lightly in view of the serious 
consequences of their acts and of the great impact they have on 
society. The phenomenon of imposing a fine instead of meting 
out a prison term should be resolutely rectified, and the 
practice of giving verbal admonishment instead of inflicting 
penalties should be strictly forbidden. 
  Luo Gan spoke at the meeting. He said railways, oil, power, 
and communications are the state's basic industries, occupying a 
decisive position in national economic construction. A high 
degree of importance should be attached to the development of, 
and security guarantees should be provided to, these industries 
since they have a bearing on the national economy and the 
people's livelihood as well as on the overall situation of 
reform and opening up. He called on relevant departments to 
make close coordination, to cooperate with each other, and to 
make the utmost efforts to achieve success in the struggle 
against the theft of state property. 
  Departments and units also attending today's joint 
teleconference included the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry 
of Power Industry, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, 
the Ministry of Internal Trade, the State Administration for 
Industry and Commerce, and the China National Petroleum 
Corporation.

<F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "Launch Day Looms for Inter-Bank Exchange"] </F>
  [Text] The country's first unified inter-bank foreign 
exchange market will open in Shanghai tomorrow, a State official 
said yesterday. 
  The China Foreign Exchange Trading Centre will be used 
mainly 
by the head offices of China's foreign-exchange banks. 
  And any of the country's 18 domestic and 100 overseas-funded 
banks that conduct foreign exchange business can become a 
member, said Yang Gonglin of the State Administration of 
Exchange Control. 
  Member banks will offer rates tied closely to the previous 
day's closing price of the US dollar on the inter bank market. 
  This marks a major departure from the practice over the past 
three months, when the central bank published daily foreign 
exchange rates based on average prices among the country's 18 
major swap markets. 
  Exchange banks could then buy or sell hard currency at the 
central bank rate. 
  Analysts say the inter-bank foreign exchange market is a 
major step forward in the country's reforms. 
  It would pave the way for China to make the renminbi freely 
convertible on current accounts within six years. 
  The central bank will be able to influence the renminbi's 
foreign exchange rate by buying and selling hard currency on the 
market. 
  The Shanghai-based market has been in trial operation since 
March 1, but only US and Hong Kong dollars have been traded. 
  Ten major cities are to be added to the network that 
currently includes Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hangzhou and 
Shenzhen. 
  Besides spot trading, the forward and futures trading of 
foreign exchange will also be conducted in the market in the 
future. 
  Yang said the State is considering retaining the existing 
swap markets to serve foreign-funded ventures. 
  Since there is no need for foreign funded companies to sell 
their foreign exchange earnings to banks, they trade their hard 
currency on the swap markets. 
  Yang also said the government will publish more foreign 
exchange regulations in the next few months. 
  They will cover the management of the inter-bank market and 
of foreign exchange accounts. 
  All domestic firms are required to sell their foreign 
exchange earnings to banks. They can buy foreign exchange 
directly from banks by showing valid certificates. 
  Foreign exchange in capital accounts will still be kept 
under 
strict control, Yang said. 
  And although some problems may arise, he added, the 
government will deal with them in time. 
  He called on enterprises and all social sectors to be 
patient 
and co-operate with the government to ensure the reform goes 
smoothly. 
  And he said China has made great strides in its 
foreign-exchange control system since January. 
  These include eliminating the dual track exchange system, 
phasing out foreign exchange certificates (FEC), abolishing 
enterprises' proportional retention of foreign exchange and 
carrying out a bank settlement system.

  [Text] Beijing, 26 Feb (XINHUA) -- The State Economic 
Restructuring Commission and the State Council's Securities 
Commission recently formulated supplementary provisions on 
selling fixed amounts of shares to employees by joint stock 
limited companies which raise funds from society. A relevant 
official in charge of the State Economic Restructuring 
Commission said: The enactment of these provisions was 
necessitated by the absence of unified provisions regarding the 
time when fixed amounts of shares sold to employees by companies 
that raise funds from society can be listed and transferred 
after the companies offer their shares to the public. Most 
provinces and municipalities now have listed companies. The 
formulation of unified national provisions are essential for 
strengthening the management of stock markets according to 
prescribed norms. 
  It has been disclosed that the "Opinions on Standardizing 
Joint Stock Limited Companies" promulgated by the State Economic 
Restructuring Commission in 1992 and the "Interim Regulations on 
the Management of Stock Issuance and Trading" promulgated by the 
State Council in 1993 contain clauses regarding the sale of 
fixed amounts of shares to employees by joint stock limited 
companies that raise funds from society. Because of the 
continuous development and improvement of stock markets, these 
clauses have become incompatible with the new situation. For 
this reason, the two commissions formulated the supplementary 
provisions. According to the provisions, joint stock limited 
companies that raise funds from society may sell less than 10 
percent of their shares to their employees without exceeding the 
stock volume approved by the state for issuance. The prices of 
shares offered to their employees should be the same as those of 
shares offered to the public. They should obtain the consent of 
state securities administrative departments regarding their 
issuance methods. Principal organizations tasked with issuing 
shares should do so within the issuing period in accordance with 
relevant agreements. Shares sold to employees may be listed and 
transferred within six months after the companies have issued 
their shares to the public and listed them on stock exchanges. 
If a company and a stock exchange have entered into an 
agreement that specifies a period longer than six months, the 
shares sold to employees should be listed and transferred 
according to the agreement. 
  During a recent interview by this reporter with regard to 
the 
supplementary provisions, a relevant official in charge of the 
State Economic Restructuring Commission's Production Structure 
Department said emphatically: Companies that raise funds from 
society may issue less than 10 percent of their shares to 
employees without exceeding the stock volume approved by the 
state for issuance. While company employees may buy fixed 
amounts of shares, individuals in society can only buy shares 
through lot-drawing after purchasing subscription forms or 
depositing money. These two types of subscribers are permitted 
to list their shares at different times because their chances 
for buying shares vary. 
  The official said emphatically: Employees allowed to buy 
shares are largely those stipulated in the "Provisions on the 
Management of Share-holdings by Employees in Joint Stock Limited 
Companies That Raise Funds from Specific Sources" promulgated by 
the State Economic Restructuring Commission on 3 July 1993. 
However, we should take account of the fact that only some 
assets held in stock by some long-established, state-owned 
enterprises and some of their employees become part of the joint 
stock limited companies reorganized from those enterprises. To 
inspire the enthusiasm of employees in state-owned enterprises 
and to facilitate smooth progress in reorganization, companies 
may include employees hired by the original enterprises among 
those allowed to buy shares with the approval of departments in 
charge of examining and approving companies. 
  The official said: Prior to the enactment of new provisions 
by the state, a joint stock limited company that shifts from 
funding by specific sources to funding by the public may convert 
its employees' shares into public shares without exceeding 10 
percent of the stock volume approved by the state for issuance. 
These shares may only be listed and transferred three years 
after they were sold to employees. Shares exceeding 10 percent 
of the state-approved volume should be regarded as shares sold 
to employees; they may not be transferred or traded and will 
only allow holders to share in dividends.

  [Text] Beijing, 3 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Ministry of Public 
Security today held a news briefing on the "Regulations for 
Security Protection of Computer information Systems" recently 
promulgated by the State Council for implementation. The person 
in charge of the Ministry's Computer Management and Supervision 
Department said: The promulgation and implementation of these 
regulations indicates that our work in security protection of 
computer information systems is being institutionalized, 
standardized, and modernized. 
  He said: Computerization has been introduced for both 
economic development and social progress in China, as well as in 
other countries. All trades and professions have successively 
established a computer information system in a short time. 
According to an incomplete statistics, more than 500,000 
computer information systems [ji suan ji xin xi xi tong 6060 
4615 2623 0207 1873 4762 4827] of various types have been in use 
in various fields and departments of our country; and the trend 
of sharp increase continues. Computer information systems have 
become an important tool and means of scientific research, 
production, business, and state administration. 
  He said: In the past, since there was no law or regulations 
governing the security protection of computer information 
systems, computer security was a very conspicuous problem. The 
number of criminal cases involving the use of computers or 
targeted at computer assets was rising. The largest amount of 
money involved in a single computer crime was as high as 14 
million yuan. Computer viruses were spreading widely, and they 
were particularly serious in large and medium cities and in 
regions open to the outside world. According to an investigation 
conducted by the public security departments on some 40 
computers across the country, 70 or 80 percent of them have been 
infected by viruses in recent years. In some universities and 
colleges, the computer virus infection rate was 100 percent. As 
the computer virus attack has affected the work of many 
departments and organizations, the security of computer 
information systems is becoming more and more important. 
  He said: After these regulations came into force, the 
Ministry of Public Security will, on the basis of past 
experience, take a further step to raise its job skill level in 
computer management and supervision, prevent violation of 
regulations, and ensure impartiality in enforcing regulations.

  [Text] Beijing, March 30 (XINHUA) -- A series of major 
economic reform measures are expected to greatly boost the 
development of China's fledgling markets, economists said here 
today. 
  Wang Kuicai, economist of the Internal Trade Ministry, said 
in an interview with XINHUA that China's total retail sale 
volume of commodities will continue to increase by a big margin 
this year, adding that 1994 will be another year of fast growth 
for China's economy. 
  The stable economic growth will ensure ample supplies of 
various commodities and the actual demand for commodities will 
remain robust this year, according to the economist. 
  According to official estimates, the country's total 
investment in fixed assets this year will be up 20 percent over 
the 1993 figure. 
  Moreover, the reform of the wage system and particularly the 
measures taken by the government to support the agricultural 
sector will help raise the per capita income by 26 percent for 
urban residents and by nine percent for farmers. 
  The economist expects that in 1994 the total retail sale 
volume of commodities will jump by around 23 to 24 percent to 
hit 1,650 billion yuan to 1,680 billion yuan. 
  The present situation of supply exceeding demand will remain 
unchanged this year, though the supply of some agricultural and 
sideline products may fall short of demand. 
  The State Ministry of Internal Trade made a comprehensive 
analysis of the supply and demand of the country's 726 major 
commodities recently. The results showed that 95.8 percent of 
the 542 major industrial products have struck a balance between 
supply and demand or supply exceeding demand; and 62.5 percent 
of the agricultural and sideline products are also in that state. 
  However, edible oil and cotton will fall short of demand, 
the 
economist said. 
  According to the experts, price rises and insufficient 
supply 
of some agricultural and sideline products will constitute the 
major potential factors fluctuating Chinese domestic markets. 
  Therefore, the experts stressed that all the government 
departments involved must see to a stable growth of domestic 
markets and try their best to maintain overall balance between 
supply and demand. 
  They called on various localities to straighten out in good 
time the structural contradictions and regional imbalances, by 
means of macro economic control and market regulation, so as to 
ensure a prosperous and stable market. 
  Ying Wenhua, another economist of the Internal Trade 
Ministry 
predicted that the markets for capital goods, particularly the 
sale of steel products, will be brisk in the first half of 1994, 
which he believed would in turn invigorate the whole market.

<F P=106> [By Philippe Massonnet] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 31 March (AFP)--China launches Friday its 
latest campaign to control prices and investments in an effort 
to rein in galloping inflation, but experts doubt it will be 
effective and consider the target of 10 percent set for this 
year greatly underestimated. "The rise in prices has reached 
alarming proportions," an Academy of Social Sciences study 
warned, a viewpoint almost certainly shared by Chinese leaders. 
Since the start of the year, official inflation has exceeded 20 
percent, with the rate in major cities surpassing 25 percent. 
  Desperate to halt this threat to stability, the government 
has cranked up the propaganda apparatus and, from Friday, will 
dispatch squads of inspectors across the country in a 
three-month operation to monitor prices and fixed capital 
investments. 
  "The government has resorted to the classic tactic of 
Communist countries but it will not be enough," a Western 
diplomat, who is an economic expert, said. 
  Chinese and foreign analysts believe Beijing's hesitant 
crusade -- cautious economic reforms and semi-austerity -- will 
not be enough to slay the dangerous inflationary beast. "The 
authorities have trouble coordinating their actions and have a 
knee-jerk reaction," said one foreign banker in Beijing. "The 
result is we're approaching hyperinflation, like that of 1988, 
which only a real austerity drive can get rid of," he said. 
  Modest attempts last July to brake property investment when 
inflation was hovering around 20 percent were dropped in 
November after failing to yield results, and under pressure from 
more liberal factions in the Communist Party. 
  "Control of fixed capital investment is already an austerity 
measure but it remains to be seen whether it will lead to a 
tightening of credit," the banker said. 
  Achieving a slowdown in investments, held largely 
responsible 
for last year's overheating and which have soared more than 70 
percent in the first two months of 1994, is above all a problem 
of political authority, observers agree. But it appears that 
the government -- to avoid stoking social problems -- is not 
ready to cut the lifeline to heavily-indebted state enterprises, 
which continue to invest and import materials. Beijing's 
authority is also being increasingly challenged by the provinces. 
  Again the authorities appear to be heading for an 
ineffective 
strategy in the long-term -- slowing liberalisation and delaying 
reforms such as listing of state companies and turning banks 
into commercial entities. This conservative orientation 
prompted Zhu Rongji, vice-minister in charge of the economy and 
an architect of openness, to defend market liberalism, declaring 
"the reforms are not responsible for inflation." 
  But with perceived economic incoherence and political 
friction, most analysts believe inflation will continue to rise. 
They cite three reasons: Higher agricultural prices due to 
falling production and speculation, strong consumer demand in 
the cities, and the irrational behavior of state-owned 
enteprises as far as investment is concerned. 
  Few people in China believe the cost of living will rise by 
less than 10 percent, in spite of Prime Minister Li Peng's 
recent insistence.

<F P=106> [By Liang Chao: "Laws To Put Brakes on Illegal Land Deals"] </F>
  [Text] The government is drafting several laws and 
regulations to regain control of the real-estate market. 
  The process has been stepped up this year to prevent land 
speculation and tax evasion and to ensure rents are collected, 
said the State Land Administration (SLA). 
  Three sets of regulations will be worked out to cover the 
price, registration and taxation of State-owned land, said SLA 
Director Zou Yuchuan. 
  The government hopes the measures will curb rampant 
speculation like that which occurred last year when businessmen 
bought the rights to State land then resold them for huge 
profits. 
  Many institutions also illegally rented out State land they 
had received free. 
  As a result, the government suffered major losses. 
  Furthermore, the illegal sales have resulted in the loss of 
large areas of farmland, causing a grain crisis. 
  To tackle these problems, the SLA is drafting the country's 
first law on real estate trade and rules on the mortgage of 
State land. 
  In addition, preparations are underway for a new land law 
that will streamline management and revise the 1987 Land 
Administration Law. 
  "These laws and rules will play an important role in 
unifying 
State policies on land trade and regulating the real estate 
market," said Zou. They would also prevent the illegal transfer 
of land-use rights between users who evade taxes. 
  The laws and regulations aim to set up a real estate 
framework including: 
  -- A system to distribute State land resources. 
  -- A real estate system listing market prices, SLA-set 
prices 
and the minimum prices. 
  -- Rules on the share of tax revenue central and local 
governments receive through land deals. 
  -- The establishment of consulting,information and land 
evaluation agencies. 
  -- And the development of a legal system that covers taxes 
and the ownership, use, transfer, lease and registration of land. 
  In China, all land belongs to the State and before the 1980s 
it could not be transferred. 
  But the reforms now treat land as a commodity that can be 
sold on the market. 
  "An operational land market system is vital to government 
efforts to build a market economy in China," Zou said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "PICC's Plans To Cover the Nation"] </F>
  [Text] The People's Insurance Company of China (PICC) will 
this year introduce new schedules concerning both their 
administrative management and economic control in order to 
continue the sound development of the insurance industry in the 
country. 
  The new schedules will focus on four areas. 
  Firstly, branch companies of PICC throughout the country 
will 
be more independent both in management and finance, forming a 
mechanism which combines responsibility, right and benefit, 
tying the risk and advantage of the insurance business together. 
  Within the branch companies themselves, there will also 
exist 
three kinds of responsibility system. 
  Firstly, general managers, business departments and 
employees 
of the branches will all be involved in the system. 
  Secondly, the branch companies will direct 20 per cent of 
their domestic business to the PICC, thus allowing the central 
company to share part of the insurance premium of the non-risk 
and the non-life business. 
  Thirdly, the central company is to separate the management 
of 
policy insurance business from the commercial insurance 
business. The former is a favoured status business that the 
insurance company makes available to projects which are part of 
the development plan of the country, such as agricultural 
projects. Part of these premiums are supported by the Ministry 
of Finance. The latter commercial insurance business includes 
life and property insurance . 
  Finally, the company is establishing the management practice 
of tying the responsibility, salary and bonus payments together. 
  Insurance companies expect that in 1994, the expanding 
sectors of their business will be in domestic property, 
enterprises' property, freight, travel/flight, agricultural and 
commercial agricultural insurance. 
  Endowment insurance and cover against malpractice are 
amongst 
current development projects. 
  By the end of 1993, the total income of the PICC was 49.8 
billion ($5.72 billion), a 36 per cent increase on the previous 
year. The popularity of their product range varied 
considerably. Some 700,000 enterprises had their properties 
covered by the company, while more than 100 million families had 
taken out domestic property insurance. 
  Parties compensated by the PICC in 1993 were largely 
satisfied. Total compensation amounted to some 27.13 billion 
($3.12 billion). 
  Among these sums, the domestic kinds were 16.32 billion 
($1.9 
billion), and the life insurance 8.67 billion ($1 billion), 
overseas business, 2.16 billion ($248.2 million ). 
  In 1994, PICC will fortify its management, strengthen its 
macroscopic control on planning, and begin to establish a 
standard system to define the insurance business for the next 
century.

  [Text] China is currently carrying out large-scale 
infrastructure construction as part of its efforts to ensure 
sustained national economic growth. The annual plan for capital 
construction drafted by the State Planning Commission includes 
several hundred large and medium-sized projects which are funded 
by either central or local fiscal authorities. 
<H5>  Projects Under Construction </H5>
  1. Three Gorges Hydropower Project. The massive 
hydropower project, which involves a total investment of 60 
billion yuan, includes the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest 
water conservancy project. The designed capacity of the 
reservoir is 40 billion cubic meters, and the power plant is 
expected to generate 85 billion kwh of electricity annually. 
  2. Pudong Economic Development Zone. The zone, which is 
the size of Singapore, calls for an investment of nearly 100 
billion yuan. 
  3. Yangpu Development Zone. The zone, located on the 
northwest tip of Hainan Island, covers 30 square km. 
  4. Beijing-Kowloon Railway. The 2,370-km railway, which 
passes through nine provinces and municipalities, is scheduled 
for completion at the end of 1995. 
  5. Tumenjiang Development Zone. Infrastructure 
construction is now under way in the US$30 billion zone which is 
located in east Jilin Province. 
  6. South China to north China water diversion project. 
Feasibility studies and designs have been completed for the 
project which will divert the water from the Jiangsu section in 
the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to the North China Plain 
via the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal. A total of 30 billion 
cubic meters of water will be diverted annually to quench the 
thirst of six provinces and municipalities in north China. 
  7. Northwest China trunk railway double-tracking project. 
The project involves double-tracking the 1,600-km 
Lanzhou-Urumqi Railway, a section of the new Eurasian 
Continental Bridge. 
  8. Beijing-Dandong Expressway. The 850-km expressway, a 
section of the Tokyo-Pyongyang-Seoul-Beijing-Moscow-London 
international highway transport network, is scheduled to open to 
traffic at the turn of the century. 
  9. Beijing-Guangzhou Expressway. The 2,300-km 
north-south thoroughfare will pass through major cities in 
Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Hunan and Guangdong provinces. 
  10. Harbin-Ningbo Expressway. The 3,500-km expressway, 
which will link Qinhuangdao, Lianyungang and other important 
port cities in east China's coastal areas, is scheduled for 
completion before the year 2000. 
  11. Ertan Hydropower Station. The station, located in 
Panzhihua City, Sichuan Province, is the largest of its type 
currently under construction in China. Ertan, which features 
China's first 240- meter-high dam, will also have the country's 
largest turbo- generators with a generating capacity of 550,000 
kw each. Its combined installed capacity of 3.3 million kw will 
surpass that of the Gezhouba Hydropower Station, the largest of 
its kind currently in operation in China. The complexity of the 
technology and scale of construction are unprecedented in China. 
The 21 billion yuan project, funded jointly by the central 
government and the Sichuan local government, includes a loan of 
US$740 million from the World Bank. The river was successfully 
dammed at the end of last year. 
  12. Shenfu Dongsheng Coalfield. All-round development at 
Shenfu, which is one of China's major bases of energy reserves, 
is proceeding smoothly. The project is designed to cater to the 
strategic plan calling for a westward shift in the nation's 
energy foundation. The coalfield, located in north Shaanxi 
Province and the southern part of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous 
Region, has verified reserves of over 230 billion tons, or 
one-fourth of the nation's total verified coal reserves. The 
coalfield is also the largest of its kind in China and one of 
the eight largest of its type in the world. At present, 
favorable mining conditions allow the coalfield to produce 10 
million tons of quality coal annually. Construction is well 
under way on a key project with an annual production capacity of 
30 million tons, and preparatory work has been completed for 
another project with an annual capacity of 60 million tons. The 
massive project, which calls for a 20-year construction period, 
is expected to cost 33 billion yuan, based on constant prices 
from 1990. Construction over the last eight years has resulted 
in a large number of ultra-large modern coal pits which operate 
with highly efficient comprehensive mining equipment. Highways 
stretching 300 km radiate to all corners of the coalfield, and 
the amount of coal transported by railway has reached 10 million 
tons annually. Preparations are also being made to begin 
construction of Huanghua Port, a special coal dock with an 
annual handling capacity of 30 million tons. 
<H5>  Major Projects in Operation </H5>
  In 1982, in answer to the massive capital requirements and 
fairly long construction periods needed for infrastructure 
projects, the Chinese government adopted a long-term policy of 
concentrating limited financial resources, materials and 
manpower on rapid completion of projects which have a major 
influence on the national economy. The several hundred key 
state construction projects which have been completed and put 
into operation now function as the backbone of China's effort to 
improve its investment environment, readjust its industrial 
structure, enhance the nation's economic strength and improve 
the people's material and cultural well being. 
  Completion of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Station, which was 
designed and constructed by China alone, marked the end to the 
history of no nuclear energy industry on China's mainland. 
Since it began generating power on December 15, 1991, the 
station, located in Haiyan County, Zhejiang Province, has 
operated smoothly and generated a total of 2.15 billion kwh of 
electricity. Last year alone, the Qinshan station generated 
1.62 billion kwh of electricity, surpassing the annual plan by 
207.7 percent. The load factor hit 64.46 percent. The 
station's success in reaching its designed annual power 
generating capacity two years ahead of schedule has helped 
reduce the burden on the east China power grid. At present, the 
station is operating at full capacity on a trial basis with 
daily output reaching 7.2 million kwh. According to figures 
recently announced by the environmental monitoring department, 
radioactive materials released by the station through waste 
water and inert gas discharged from chimneys stand at 0.015 and 
0.7 curies respectively, much lower than the state-set limits of 
20 and 70,000 curies. 
  The Shanghai ethylene project, another key state 
construction 
project with an annual output of 300,000 tons, required a total 
investment of 9.07 billion yuan. The project comprises the 
fourth set of ethylene production equipment imported by China 
with an annual output of 300,000 tons, three sets of equipment 
with an annual output of 200,000 tons of chloroethylene and 
200,000 tons of polyethylene, and auxiliary processing 
equipment, production facilities and infrastructure. 
Construction of the project began in May 1987, and all 
facilities began trial production in 1989. Since that time the 
project has maintained an excellent safety record and has 
operated smoothly. By June 1993, the project had yielded a 
total of 5.53 billion yuan in industrial output value and 1.49 
billion yuan in profit and tax payment, and had begun repaying 
loans. At the end of last year, the project passed a stringent 
state quality appraisal. Completion of the project has 
significantly enhanced China's ethylene production capacity and 
the output of refined oil, plastics, rubber and other major 
petrochemical products. It also has a major impact on upgrading 
China's backward raw materials industry and expediting the 
development of the nation's petrochemical industry . 
  The Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou optical fiber trunk 
telecommunications line, the longest of its type in the world, 
began operation last October. The 4,700-km line, which passes 
through: eight provinces and municipalities and 22 prefectures 
and cities, links Beijing with Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Hunan and 
Guangdong provinces and extends southward to Haikou and westward 
to Nanning. The 500 million yuan project includes 105,000 
long-distance telephone lines. Areas along the recently 
completed line, which have long been a hub of 
telecommunications, previously relied on intermediate coaxial 
cable analog carrier and microwave telecommunications systems. 
However, owing to the considerable growth of information 
exchanges in recent years, only 10 percent or local 
long-distance telephone calls could reach their final 
destination. Completion of the project has greatly eased 
burdens resulting from the shortage of facilities and provided 
central China with a telecommunications expressway". The line 
is linked to the Beijing-Nanjing-Shanghai-Guangzhou optical 
fiber telecommunications line, with the former providing a 
high-capacity digital telecommunications thoroughfare in central 
China and the latter in east China. 
  Last year, construction of 150 key state projects focused on 
basic industries and infrastructure facilities. The 124 
projects related to energy, transportation, telecommunications 
and strategic raw materials accounted for 83 percent of the 
total number of key projects under construction. Investments in 
these projects amounted to 67.3 billion yuan, or 92 percent of 
total investments in capital construction, indicating that the 
government has already shifted its focus of investment to key 
construction projects. 
<H5>  Increased Production Capacity In 1993 </H5>
  Railways: 116-km new railway lines were completed, 619-km 
old 
lines double-tracked, and 193-km lines electrified. 
  Ports: 15 deep-water berths were built, increasing the 
handling capacity of the nation's harbors by 25.3 million tons. 
  Coal: 14 coal pits subject to the government's unified 
planning entered production, increasing the country's raw coal 
production capacity by 10.9 million tons. 
  Oil: the production capacity for continental oil rose to 
15.36 million tons, while that of natural gas jumped to 820 
million cubic meters. 
  Electricity: 62 large and medium-sized sets or generators 
with a combined installed capacity of 12.1 million kw were put 
into operation, including 14 sets for hydropower with a combined 
installed capacity or 3.1 million kw, and 48 sets for thermal 
power with a total installed capacity of 9 million kw. 
  Petrochemical industry: the production capacity for ethylene 
increased by 300,000 tons.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhu Yuli: "China's Aviation Industry Spreads Its </F>
Wings"] 
  [Text] Prior to the 1980s, China's aviation industry 
mainly engaged in manufacturing military equipment. However, 
last year, civilian products accounted for more than 70 percent 
of total industrial output value. Beginning in 1994, Aviation 
Industries of China (AVIC) will implement a Flying Program over 
the next 10-15 years which calls for the industry to transform 
itself into a mammoth industrial group by the year 2000 with 
annual sales volume expected to reach 60 billion yuan, 
quadrupling the 1993 figure. 
  China's aviation industry witnessed sustained and rapid 
growth in 1993. In accordance with the State Council's general 
plan for structural reform, AVIC has successfully completed its 
organizational transformation, adjusted itself to the demands of 
the socialist market economy and is now operating under the new 
system. 
  Last year, its total industrial output value reached 14.96 
billion yuan, a 35.7 percent increase over the previous year, 
while the sales income hit 15.3 billion yuan, up 32 percent. It 
also earned profits of 540 million yuan, and paid taxes of 490 
million yuan, 17 percent and 25 percent respective increases 
over the previous year. 
  In terms of new aircraft research and development during 
1993, two new models successfully completed test flights and the 
design for a new type aircraft was finalized. Designs of the 
Y7H-500 passenger aircraft and the Y8 carrier aircraft have 
basically been finalized and feasibility studies have been 
completed. Last year, the corporation won 14 national invention 
awards, 13 state awards for scientific and technological 
progress. The corporation also won 307 ministry-level 
scientific and technological achievement awards. In addition, it 
scored breakthroughs in a number of key scientific and 
technological projects. 
  Total output value and sales of civilian products rose to 11 
billion yuan and 11.2 billion yuan, representing 35 percent and 
43 percent respective increases over the previous year. 
  In 1993, the industry's exports jumped to US$870 million, 
with exports of mechanical and electronic products, including 
civilian aircraft, standing at US$550 million. The growth rates 
surpassed the average national level. 
<H5>  Production of Civilian Products </H5>
  AVIC, which was established in June 1993, was based on the 
former Ministry of Aero-Industries which in 1988 joined with the 
former Ministry of Aerospace Industry to form the Ministry of 
Aeronautics and Astronautics Industry. 
  AVIC, a mammoth industrial corporation directly under the 
State Council, is a state-owned enterprise engaged in scientific 
research, production and business operations. It consists of 
more than 200 enterprises and work units, with a total work 
force of over 560,000. 
  The major responsibilities of the corporation include: 
formulating business strategies and development schemes for 
China's aviation industry; governing and supervising the 
operation, management and use of state-owned property belonging 
to the aviation industry; contracting with the state for key 
aviation products and new models, and systematically managing 
projects; constantly supplying new technology and equipment for 
military and civil aviation; designing technological standards 
for the aviation industry and managing and supervising product 
quality; being responsible for state-level test flights for new 
airplane models; and administering foreign affairs for the 
aviation industry in accordance with the rights granted by the 
State Council. 
  Following a sustained 40-year effort, China's aviation 
industry has developed into a solid overall force and now has a 
foundation for developing high and new technology. In early 
1982, Deng Xiaoping, then chairman of the Central Military 
Commission of Central Committee of Communist Party of China, 
pointed out that all departments in the defense industrial 
sector, apart from fulfilling the requirements of research and 
production of arms and military equipment, should spare no 
efforts to research, develop and produce civilian products. 
Under the guidance of the strategy, China's aviation industry 
began to gradually switch to the production of civilian products 
and market operations. After a diligent 10-year effort, the 
output of civilian products rose to occupy 70 percent of the 
total industrial output and a number of competitive products now 
enjoy a brisk market. Tertiary industry also recorded rapid 
progress in recent years. The 1993 total output value for 
tertiary industry hit 1.83 billion yuan, with profits of 150 
million yuan. 
  The newly founded AVIC will adopt even more flexible 
business 
mechanisms, and will extend great effort to develop civilian 
products, establish multifaceted business operations and 
increase the volume of imports and exports. As part of the 
effort to further deepen reform and expand opening, the 
corporation will accelerate the transformation of business 
mechanisms, adjustment to the international market and develop 
aviation science and technology to provide high-quality aviation 
equipment and other products for military and civilian use, 
while at the same time, go all out to expand exports. 
  The Flying Program 
  In consideration of the economic base and technological 
force 
of China's aviation industry, and the demands of the national 
defense, domestic and foreign markets, AVIC has established its 
Flying Program to be carried out over the next 10-15 years. The 
main principle of the program is to place greater emphasis on 
its main function of producing aviation products, strengthening 
the so-called two wings-nonaviation production and tertiary 
industry, and developing AVIC into a super-large industrial 
group corporation. It plans to reach ever higher plateaus in 
terms of the technological level of its aviation products, the 
production scale of non-aviation products and exports, and 
economic efficiency. 
  The detailed goals of the program include: increasing total 
industrial output value by 25 percent annually during the last 
two years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95), hitting 22 
billion yuan in 1995; further increasing the figure by 18 
percent annually during the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1,996-2000), 
achieving 50 billion yuan in output by the year 2000; and 
increasing the business volume of tertiary industry by an 
average annual rate of 25 percent, with sales income rising to 
25 billion yuan by 1995 and further to 60 billion yuan by the 
year 2000. 
  This strategic program includes specific developmental goals 
for the following 10 areas: 
  Military Aircraft. By the year 2000, the 
corporation will have the capacity to carry out research on and 
production of advanced fighters, thereby narrowing the overall 
gap between domestic and advanced world levels, and striving to 
equal or surpass advanced world levels. 
  Civilian Aircraft. By way of international 
cooperation, AVIC will substantially raise design, experimental 
and manufacturing capabilities. Based on international joint 
production, the corporation will strive to reach its target of 
researching, developing and manufacturing primary aircraft, and 
continue to improve and perfect the Y7, Y8 and Y12 series which 
already have attained a good reputation in both domestic and 
world markets. It will also further expand contracted 
production of spare parts for foreign customers. 
  Helicopters. Production will develop on the basis 
of expanded tonnage and size. By the year 2000, a manufacturing 
system will be gradually formed to research and produce 
helicopters. 
  Gas Combustion Engines. By the end of this 
century, the corporation will have the capability to research 
and produce military-use turbine engines. In terms of civilian 
aviation engines, AVIC will accelerate the pace of technology 
accumulation, and will upgrade its technical level through 
cooperative production. 
  Airborne Equipment. The corporation will actively 
import advanced technology. Emphasis will be placed on the 
importation of aviation electronics systems and the coordinated 
development of mechanical and electronic parts, as well as the 
overall upgrading of industrial technology. 
  Experiments and Test Flights. AVIC will ensure 
the successful completion of experiments and test flights 
involving key projects and will accelerate the development of 
related technology. 
  Long-Term Research. Between now and the year 
2000, the corporation will actively develop programs, carry out 
long-term research and enhance technology to produce new types 
of military aircraft and large-scale civilian aircraft. 
  Non-Aviation Products. The corporation will 
greatly expand both the domestic and foreign markets and attract 
increased domestic and foreign capital. It will also attach 
great importance to economic efficiency, and use its 
technological advantages to develop a score of national 
high-quality products, including mini-buses, medium-sized and 
luxury buses, motorcycles, air conditioners, air conditioner 
compressors, compressors for refrigerators, time pieces, liquid 
crystal displays, and computer-controlled equipment. The 
corporation will also actively participate in the development 
and construction of the Shanghai Pudong New Area. By the year 
2000, Pudong will become one of the major export processing 
industrial bases for China's aviation industry. 
  Tertiary Industry. A strategy of all-around 
business will be adopted which will be based on the main goal of 
good economic returns. A comprehensive development plan will be 
drafted and will be implemented one step at a time. Management 
will be liberalized. 
  Imports and Exports. By the year 2000, the 
corporation's annual import and export volume will rise to US$3 
billion. 
  Since China implemented the reform and opening policies in 
1979, and especially since it decided to establish a socialist 
market economy, China's aviation industry has met unprecedented 
development opportunities. Although China's civil aviation 
sector continues to grow at an annual rate of over 30 percent, 
it still fails to meet the demands of economic development and 
international and domestic tourism. With the sharp increase in 
the number of airports and international and domestic air routes 
in the foreseeable future, China's civil aviation sector will 
continue to develop at a rapid rate and will need to purchase a 
large number of trunk and branch line aircraft. 
  At present, many countries have gained an awareness of the 
vast market potential of China's aviation industry, and a number 
of world-famous companies have come to China seeking business 
cooperation. Based on the principle of equality and mutual 
benefit and a sincere desire for cooperation, AVIC hopes to have 
various forms of governmental or non-governmental cooperative 
ventures with counterparts in other countries and regions. On 
the basis of international cooperation and their own efforts, 
China's aviation industry will continue to fly high with wings 
spread wide.

  [Text] The basic subject of the research project 
"Evaluation of the 500 Largest Industrial Enterprises and the 50 
Largest Trades in China," is that large enterprises or 
conglomerates which have been formed in the course of a 
country's economic development are always central to economic 
development. 
  In the development process of modern economies and also in 
future economies, large enterprises or conglomerates will play 
an increasingly important role, both in the domestic and 
international economies. Professor Michael Porter from Harvard 
University Business School has pointed out that most countries 
rely on a few score of concentrated industrial areas and several 
hundred large corporations to provide most of the exported goods 
and raise their productivity and living standards. 
  Based on this proposition, the research project will focus 
on 
the following: 
  1. Mapping out the changes and development trends of 
Chinese enterprises and Chinese industries; 
  2. Conducting an investigation into the external 
environment of the enterprises during their development and its 
influences; 
  3. In a period of high-speed economic growth, determining 
effective ways of readjusting the industrial organizational 
structure to accelerate technical progress in Chinese 
enterprises, to lessen the negative effects brought about by 
cyclical economic fluctuations, and to lead national economic 
development onto the track of a benign cycle as soon as possible; 
  The research project will provide an important foundation. 
  When interviewed recently by a journalist from the Japanese 
weekly DIAMOND, the well-known American scholar Deluk [de lu ke 
1795 7627 0344] pointed out that "the depression in some 
advanced countries is in fact a depression in their large 
enterprises." He added that he thought "such a situation could 
last for 10 to 20 years." 
  If we consider that the Western industrialized nations are 
now in the trough of a long economic cycle, then the way out is 
the arrival of a period of technological innovation. However, 
the Chinese economy is now in a period of growth, the major 
feature of which is the search for a great abundance of goods, 
i.e., a time of mass production in pursuit of economy of scale. 
Therefore, the times require that large Chinese enterprises 
have increasingly greater markets while they are building 
themselves up. 
  Over a relatively long period, it should be a major task for 
our economic policymakers and administrators to bring into full 
play the backbone leading role of the large enterprises in the 
development of the national economy and to create a totally new 
external environment for their development, enabling them to 
increase their economic yields. 
  It should be especially emphasized that it is of great 
significance to the development and reform of our economy that 
we bring into full play the role of large enterprises in 
readjusting the industrial structure, transforming industrial 
organizations, and carrying out state industrial policies. At 
present, the Chinese economy is going through a period of great 
change, during which the large enterprises will play a major 
historic role. 
  This year's research report will mainly analyze the general 
development trend of Chinese large enterprises from 1988 to 
1992, based on their performance over the five year period in 
order to indicate the future. [preceding paragraphs introduction 
by the China Enterprises Assessment Center of GUANLI SHIJIE 
(MANAGEMENT WORLD) and the Industrial and Communications 
Statistical Department of the State Statistical Bureau] 
  China's 500 largest industrial enterprises have achieved 
considerable progress in the past five years and they will make 
signal contributions to the development of China's economy in 
the 1990's. 
  Only by following the principle of regional coordination in 
terms of comparative advantage and the advanced level of product 
mix can the division of labor and coordination among regions be 
rationally organized. 
<H5>  China's Enterprises Have Already Entered an Era of Great </H5>
Development 
  From 1988 to 1992, China's 500 largest industrial 
enterprises 
achieved considerable progress, becoming outstanding symbols of 
great enterprise development. 
  First, their operation scale has doubled or redoubled. The 
total sales value of the 500 largest enterprises has increased 
from 292.467 billion yuan in 1988 to 634.394 billion Yuan in 
1992, an increase of 116.9 percent. The 500 enterprises have 
more than doubled their operation scale. It should be stressed 
that the development of the 500 largest enterprises has not only 
been quicker than that of state-owned enterprises (70.1) and 
collectively-owned enterprises (80.1), but also quicker than 
that of all independent enterprises (84.7). This shows that 
the strength of large enterprises has been further enhanced, 
their degree of concentration has been raised, and their role in 
the national economic development has become more conspicuous. 
  Second, the net value of fixed assets has also been doubled 
or redoubled. In 1992, the net value of the fixed assets of the 
500 largest industrial enterprises reached 389.627 billion yuan, 
or 27.6 percent of the 1411.832 billion yuan of the total net 
value of fixed assets of national independent accounting 
enterprises. Compared with the total assets of 189.967 billion 
yuan in 1988, this is an increase of 105.1 percent. The 
increase of the net value of fixed assets is the in evitable 
outcome of getting rid of the traditional system of a planned 
economy and seeking market share. 
  Third, the rapid development of the Sino-foreign joint 
ventures, foreign cooperative enterprises, and wholly 
foreign-owned enterprises has become an increasingly important 
factor in the development of China's large enterprises. Five 
years ago, only six of the 500 enterprises were foreign-funded 
but now there are more than 30. Though the proportion of 
foreign-funded enterprises is still limited in the national 
economy, they have played an increasingly important role in 
absorbing foreign capital, introducing technology and management 
expertise, increasing exports, and adjusting the industrial 
structure. 
<H5>  The Competitive Rule of Survival of the Fittest Has Become </H5>
an Important Principle for Promoting the Development of 
Enterprises and for Reorganizing the Structure of Enterprises 
  From the results achieved by the 500 largest enterprises 
during the period 1988 to 1992, one can see that they were 
following the rule of the survival of the fittest. Of the 500 
enterprises which had joined the ranks of the 500 largest 
enterprises in 1988, only 342 still remained in 1992. 86 were 
eliminated in 1989, 69 in 1990, and 61 in 1991. This market 
competition will be fiercer in the next few years as the economy 
grows at a high rate. The principle of survival of the fittest 
will further strengthen China's industrial enterprises, enabling 
the economy to enter a period of healthier development. 
  The expansion of the scale of operation in enterprises and 
the competitive mechanism of survival of the fittest will 
inevitably bring changes to the scale structure in enterprises. 
In 1992, 7 enterprises had a sales volume in excess of 10 
billion yuan, 19 exceeded 5 billion yuan, 61 exceeded 2 billion 
yuan, 167 exceeded 1 billion yuan, and 351 exceeded 0.5 billion 
yuan. The rest were between 0.5 and 0.36 billion yuan. In 
1988, however, the corresponding numbers of enterprises were 3, 
2, 53, 163 respectively (there were none exceeding 10 billion 
yuan). The other 337 enterprises were between 0.5 and 0.2 
billion yuan. In the five years between 1988 and 1992, the 
scale of enterprises has obviously changed but most of the 
enterprises are still engaged in unitary production. 
Comprehensive enterprise groups, which combine production, 
operation, managing, marketing, and technological development, 
and have a global strategy, are still in an early stage. 
<H5>  Establishing Rational Production Divisions of the East, </H5>
Central and West Is the Basis for the Coordinated Development of 
Regional Economies 
  The regional distribution of the 500 largest enterprises 
still tend to concentrate on the eastern and coastal areas. Of 
the 500 largest enterprises, the 12 provinces and cities in the 
eastern and coastal areas contained 317 in 1988, accounting for 
63.4 percent of the total, their total sales value accounted for 
66.7 percent, and their total profits and taxes accounted for 
60.1 percent. In 1992, these areas had 328 enterprises, 
accounting for 65.5 percent of the total, their total sales 
value accounted for 65.86 percent, and their total profits and 
handed-in taxes accounted for 57.29 percent. Judging from the 
tendency in current economic development, this basic pattern of 
graded regional division will not greatly change in the short 
term. In the above general tendency, however, the total sales 
value and total profits and taxes of the central and western 
areas did not drop but increased slightly instead. This shows 
that the operation scale and quality of the enterprises in the 
central and western areas are also increasing during the reform 
and opening economic tide. As regards the tendency for change 
in specific provinces and cities in the past five years relative 
to the distribution of the 500 largest industrial enterprises: 
The provinces and cities which saw the greatest increase in the 
number of enterprises in the national 500 were Guangdong (by 
21), Shanghai (8), Shandong (5), and Anhui (5); the provinces 
and cities which registered decreases were Liaoning (by 13), 
Jilin (6) and Tianjin (5). The change in the distribution of 
enterprises in the above areas shows that the regional flow of 
natural resources to the east is very obvious, some new 
industrial bases are forming, and old industrial bases have 
become inferior for various reasons. 
  There are great differences in the scale of industrial 
enterprises in different regions. These differences are 
determined by resources, industrial structure, and the 
industrial development level. Under the same conditions, 
generally speaking, in the region which has heavy industry as 
its main industry, its industry has a higher degree of 
concentration and larger enterprises. In the region which has a 
higher economic development and highly diversified industry, its 
industry has a lower degree of concentration and smaller 
enterprises. Liaoning, Shanghai, and Guangdong are typical of 
the above economic types. It should be pointed out that China's 
old industrial bases like Shanghai and Liaoning are still 
playing important roles in the national economy. In 1988, 
Shanghai and Liaoning had 55 and 58 respectively of the 500 
largest enterprises and, in 1992, they had 63 and 45 
enterprises. Compared with 1988, Shanghai had increased by eight 
and Liaoning had decreased by 13 in 1992. As for the proportion 
of their total sales volume and total value of profits and tax, 
Shanghai increased from 11.8 percent and 11.0 percent in 1988 to 
15.26 percent and 14.68 percent in 1992; but Liaoning decreased 
from 13.3 percent and 13.2 percent in 1988 to 10.67 percent and 
8.59 percent in 1992, the differences being very notable. As a 
new industrial processing base, Guangdong has greatly expanded 
the scale of its industrial enterprises. It had 21 more 
enterprises among the 500 in 1992 as compared with in 1988. To 
compare with the rapid development of the scale of industrial 
enterprises in Shanghai and Guangdong in recent years, Liaoning, 
as China's basic industrial base, has shown some signs of 
declining. This is not in keeping with its position and proper 
role in the development of the national economy. How to reform 
and reinvigorate this old industrial base in Liaoning is one of 
the major issues in the present economic development of China. 
  The regional distribution of the 500 largest industrial 
enterprises continues to move towards the east and natural 
resources are further concentrated in the east and the coastal 
areas. This will certainly widen the differences in economic 
development among the eastern, central, and western regions. At 
the same time, the calculation and analysis of corresponding 
regional industries show no notable advantage for industries 
from one region to another and their industrial structures are 
more or less the same. This shows that the level of cooperation 
on the basis of specialization among different regions is still 
very low and self-circulation in regional industries is fairly 
serious. This will no doubt cause the national economy to lose, 
to a certain extent, the advantage of regional differences and 
the benefit of large scale economies. For many years, most of 
China's industrial policies have been replaced by regional 
policies so that the industries in the east, central, and west 
became further imbalanced, the respective regional advantages 
were difficult to bring into full play, and rational labor 
division and cooperation among different regions were hard to 
organize and implement. Therefore, in order to rationally 
organize division of labor and cooperation among the different

<H5>  Formulation of an Industrial Policy Appropriate to China's </H5>
Conditions 
  --From the shift in industrial distribution among 
China's top- 500 industrial enterprises during the 1988-1992 
period, the current state of China's industrial development and 
the direction of change in the industrial structure can be 
clearly seen. 
  --The main target of the macroeconomic policy is to 
maintain sustained, stable and coordinated development [chi xu 
wen ding xie taio di faz han 2170 4958 4489 1353 0588 6148 4104 
4099 1455] of the national economy. It is essential to proceed 
from China's national conditions in formulating industrial 
policies appropriate to China's fundamental realities. 
  In a developing country it is important to foster and 
develop 
the nation's own industries, and to make them the major props of 
economic modernization. 
  China's industries have been developed for more than 40 
years, and a relatively complete industrial system has been 
established. Especially during the last 10 years or so, the 
Chinese economy has taken off, with an acceleration of the 
industrialization process and a very rapid shift in the 
industrial structure. From the shift in the industrial 
distribution among the top-500 industrial enterprises, the 
current state of China's industrial development and the 
direction of change in the industrial structure can be seen 
clearly. 
  A rough classification of the industrial distribution among 
China's top-500 industrial enterprises in 1988 is as follows: 
The ferrous-metal industry (78 enterprises), the 
tobacco-processing industry (56), the machine industry (45), the 
coal-mining and dressing industry (41), the electronics and 
telecommunications equipment producing industry (38), the 
chemical industry (35), and the transportation equipment 
producing industry (31). Distribution in 1992 was: The 
ferrous-metal industry (85 enterprises), the tobacco-processing 
industry (50), the transportation equipment producing industry 
(47), the machine industry (46), the chemical industry (38), and 
the coalmining and dressing industry (31). From the shift in 
industrial distribution over the five years among the top-500 
enterprises, the following are the industries within which 
industrial giants have increased in number to a greater extent 
than those not listed: The transportation equipment producing 
industry (plus 16), the ferrous-metal industry (7), the 
forage-processing industry (7), the pharmaceutical industry (5), 
the chemical industry (4), and the rubber industry (3). There 
have been great changes in the transportation equipment 
producing industry and in the forage- processing industry. In 
the same period, the industrial giants in the following 
industries decreased in number to a greater extent than those 
not listed: The textile industry (11 less), the coalmining and 
dressing industry (10), and the electronics and 
tlecommunications equipment producing industry (9). Other 
industries worth mentioning are the oil and gas exploration 
industries and the oil refining industry. Although they have 
13 and 30 enterprises respectively, virtually all of them are 
in the top 500. This will certainly be reflected very clearly 
in the overall shift in the scale of operations during the 1988 
to 1992 period among China's top 500 enterprises. Among the top 
500 enterprises, the following industries have more than doubled 
their total sales during the five year period: The 
forage-processing industry (a rise of 622.18), the oil and gas 
extraction industry (471.14), the ferrous-metal mining and 
dressing industry (450.19), the transportation equipment 
producing industry (350.39), the sewing industry (261.30), the 
beverage industry (242.34), the ferrous-metal smelting industry 
(232.26), the pharmaceutical industry (223.13), the oil 
refining industry (209.52), the chemical industry (206.39), 
the construction materials producing industry (202.36), and the 
chemical fiber industry (202.31). 
  The shift in industrial distribution among the top 500 and 
the increase in the scope of business operations strongly 
suggests that in the short term competition is mainly between 
enterprises within the same industry, i.e., a re-adjustment 
among enterprises of their market share. On the other hand, 
enterprise mergers, based on the principal of preserving the 
best and discarding those which are obsolete will be the 
mainstay of enterprise reorganization. Reallottment of market 
shares and enterprise mergers will result in resources flowing 
from obsolete enterprises or industries to new enterprises or 
industries. It will take a relatively long time to complete the 
process of redistributing resources among industries, but this 
will eventually result in an updating of the industrial 
structure (or the productionindustrial structure, including a 
comprehensive reform of the product structure, technology, 
production, and enterprise scale). 
  However, as a developing country, China is in the process of 
violent changes in terms of economic development and the demand 
structure. However, during this process of transition of the 
economic structure, the market system and the market operation 
mechanism are both far from mature or perfected. Under such 
circumstances, it is impossible to achieve a more effective or 
more rational disposition of resources merely by means of free 
competition in the market. While overall social efficiency 
remains low, it is impossible to realize sustained, stable, and 
coordinated development of the national economy. It is 
therefore vital to bring into full play the role of the 
industrial policy, the key to China's macroscopic management, 
and turn it into one of the major policies during the entire 
period of high-speed development. 
  Among China's top 500 industrial enterprises, the textile, 
coalmining and dressing, and the electronics and 
telecommunications equipment production industries lost most 
enterprises. The lot of these three, all important industries 
in the national economy, is not in accordance with their role in 
economic development and is thus worthy of attention. The main 
reason is that in the process of the transition in the economic 
structure, the state industrial policy, particularly that 
related to the industrial structure, has not played its due 
role, resulting in an imbalance in the industrial structure. 
  The reasons for the setbacks in the three industries are 
not exactly the same. The textile industry is a relatively 
mature traditional Chinese industry and accounts for the largest 
portion of China's export trade. However, a relatively high 
proportion of textile exports comprises grey cloth, meaning a 
total loss of high added value. Even in the garment exports, 
both major and auxiliary materials are mostly imports, also 
resulting in the loss of most of the high added value. To 
revitalize China's textile industry, top priority should be 
given to reexamining and rearranging the internal distribution 
of resources, and the situation wherein intermediate products 
are given priority should be changed so that priority is given 
to products most closely related to the market. Such a 
rearrangement will be the basis for reallocating resources. 
Second, the internal structure of the textile industry should 
be adjusted and the "mass spinning and weaving and mass printing 
and dyeing" changed to "mass spinning and weaving and 
small-batch printing and dyeing," to meet the demands of 
individual consumption both at home and abroad. Third, whether 
adopting an export-substitution or import-substitution strategy, 
the textile industry should basically aim to upgrade technology 
and raise the standard of its products. The coalmining and 
dressing industry is one of China's key basic industries, while 
the electronics and telecommunications equipment industry is 
only in its infancy. 
  The problems facing the former are still primarily due to 
the 
price system and the organizational structure of the 
enterprises. If domestic coal prices are gradually brought in 
line with those of the international market, most coal producing 
enterprises should be turned comprehensive transportation and 
sales groups to reduce intermediate costs can be reduced, reduce 
to a minimum the repercussions on the market, and change the 
long-standing situation whereby the coal industry depended on 
financial subsidies. This involves strategic options, i.e., how 
to develop China's newest high technology and the fundamental 
sectors of China's electronics industry. 
  The main target of the macro economic policy is to maintain 
a 
sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national 
economy. It is essential to proceed from China's national 
conditions in formulating industrial policies appropriate to 
China's realities and make them the practical development 
guidelines for Chinese industry. Guided by industrial policy, 
enterprise groups should be established in conjunction with 
industrial reorganization and development, so that the 
enterprise organization and industrial structures are 
rationalized in coordination with the effective allocation of 
resources. As the organizations responsible for realizing 
industrial objectives, enterprise groups will assist the 
adjustment of the industrial structure and the industrial 
technology structure. In some countries, the history of 
economic development reveals that each transformation of the 
industrial structure is achieved through the conglomeration of 
enterprises and the reoptimization of resource allocation. For 
example, during Japan's rise in the post-war years, and South 
Korea's prosperity in the 1970's as one of the "four lttle 
economic tigers," both fostered aid-industry policies which 
resulted in substantial changes in the industrial structure and 
organization. Among the top 500 international industrial 
corporations in 1992, 128 were Japanese firms, accounting for 
25.6 percent of the total. There were also 12 South Korean 
companies included in the top 500. Although 12 is a relatively 
small number, the Samsung Corp., No.1 in South Korea, achieved 
sales of $495.6 billion, making it No. 18 in the top 500. 
  In selecting policies for industrial organization, we should 
not only make use of the spontaneous functions of market 
mechanism but also apply many macroeconomic regulation and 
control methods, to bring into play the state's role in 
optimizing the industrial organizational structure. We should 
not follow in the footsteps of some developed countries wherein 
the optimization process was mainly based on market mechanisms. 
  It is not in accordance with the laws of a commodity economy 
to simply transplant industrial organization formats from 
developed ocountries, or regard a certain scale as a rational 
standard. Developing countries should focus their attention on 
their own realities in selecting industrial-organization formats 
so that, through the entrepreneurs' creative activities, the 
industrial organizations can develop into a series which can 
constantly increase their own value and constantly upgrade and 
improve themselves. 
  The Business Cycle and the Development of Large 
Enterprises 
  --Since the adoption of the policy of reform and 
opening to the outside world, China's economic growth has 
gradually shifted to a stage dominated by a growth cycle. The 
major feature of the business cycle is economic growth. 
  --Adopt active macroeconomic policies and reduce the 
magnitude of fluctuations in the economic cycle and their 
calamitous effects. "Anticycle" should become the main contents 
of macroeconomic regulation and control. 
  --Active adjustment of the business cycle by the state 
is the most effective means of easing the contradictions between 
supply and demand. Enterprises should also take effective 
measures to dampen the repercussions caused by such swings on 
their business activities and development. 
  In any economic society, the operational state and 
developmental tendency of an enterprise, as the subject of a 
market economy, are decided by the following two basic elements: 
The enterprise's business conduct and its operational 
environment. 
  An enterprise's business conduct are not only decided by its 
internal structure (such as the nature of ownership, management 
system, and methods of operation) but are also inevitably 
restricted and influenced by the operational environment, both 
in terms of quantitative stipulations (i.e. the extent of 
realization) or in terms of qualitative stipulations (i.e. 
operational direction). Especially when an enterprise has not 
become an independent legal person, the operational environment 
greatly influences its development. Because of space 
limitations, this article will only present a preliminary 
analysis of the economic environment (market environment), in 
particular the business cycle, which is directly related to 
changes in the operational scale and efficiency of large scale 
enterprises. 
<H5>  The Relationship Between the Business Cycle and the </H5>
Development of Large Enterprises 
  The business cycle is a combination of alternating economic 
contraction and expansion. An investigation of China's current 
economic development reveals that since the implementation of 
the reform policy, China's economic growth has gradually shifted 
into a period dominated by growth. 
  At this stage economic expansion is accrued growth and 
economic recession is accrued recession; economic growth 
dominates and is realized in the business cycle. Due to 
restricted supply of economic resources, the unitary or 
imperfects means of macroeconomic regulation and contreol, and 
the immaturity of macroeconomic regulation and control, economic 
expansion can very easily be achieved in the short term. 
  In order to guarantee the sustained, stable, and coordinated 
development of China's economy, and to guard against greater 
repercussions on economic development brought about by 
overheating, a new cycle of adjustment is unavoidable. 
  During the 1988 to 1992 Period, China's economic development 
passed through the following phases: Rapid growth with 
inflation; economic improvement, rectification and macroscopic 
austerity; and resumption of economic growth and rapid growth. 
It is within such a complete economic cycle that the 
development of China's large enterprises has been realized 
within the five years. 
<H5>  A Review of the Increases in the Domestic Total Output Value </H5>
Shows Obvious Business Fluctuations During This Period 
  The GDP in 1989 was 4.3 percent higher than in 1988; 
corresponding rates of increase in 1990, 1991 and 1992 were 3.9 
percent, 8.0 percent and 13.2 percent, respectively. Because 
secondary industries constitute the bulk of China's economy 
(48.2 percent in 1992), the macroscopic business cycle is caused 
mainly by industrial cycling. The total industrial output value 
in 1989 was 8.5 percent higher than in 1988 and the 
corresponding rates of increase in 1990, 1991 and 1992 were 7.8 
percent, 14.8 percent and 27.5 percent, respectively. 
Fluctuations in the external economic environment inevitably 
lead to fluctuations in enterprise growth and vice versa. 
  Take as an example the trend towards increased in total 
sales 
among China's top 500 enterprises. The sales total in 1989 was 
19.82 percent higher than in the previous year and corresponding 
rates in 1990, 1991 and 1992 were 9.73 percent, 24.70 percent 
and 33.36 percent, respectively. Change in enterprises' 
operational scale has an even greater impact on their economic 
efficiency. For example, the total pre-tax profits of China's 
top 500 enterprises. If the total for 1988 is set at 100, the 
totals for 1989 and 1990 were both under 100 (1989: 95.67; 1990: 
97.93), and it was not until 1991 that the total surpassed 100 
to reach 114.77. 
  This situation demonstrates that the business cycle is 
completely synchronized with the development of China's large 
enterprises and that there is a very close link between their 
development and the macroscopic economic environment. 
  In the new historical situation of further reforms and more 
openness, enterprises which have experienced macroscopic 
austerity will pay more attention to shifts in the development 
of the macroscopic economy, studying the macroeconomic 
regulation and control which the government possibly initiates. 
They can thus take prompt emergency measures in another 
business cycle and their development can more swiftly adapt to 
external changes in the economic environment and be more 
flexible. 
  On the other hand, with the establishment and improvement of 
China's socialist market economy, the influence of the 
government's direct decisionmaking on economic fluctuations may 
be less than ever. However, in order to maintain the stable, 
sustained, and coordinated development of the national economy; 
to deepen reforms; and to adjust the economic structure so that 
the economy can continue to grow, the state should do everything 
possible to reduce the enormous repercussions on the 
enterprises' operation and development when adopting 
macroeconomic regulation and control measures toward economic 
development. 
<H5>  "Anticycle" Should Become the Main Contgents of China's </H5>
Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Policy 
  To ensure a sustained, stable economic development, the 
extent of the economic cycle should be reduced to a minimum and 
the ascending period of each cycle should be prolonged as far as 
possible. 
  Nevertheless, we cannot completely flatten these economic 
fluctuations. We can only adopt positive macroeconomic policies 
to reduce their magnitude and any catastrophic impact. We can 
meet the "anticycle" target by relatively stabilizing the money 
supply and by reducing the violent fluctuations in investment 
demand and consumption demand. 
  The history of economic development in other countries 
illustrates that an "anticycle" policy is of major significance 
in stabilizing economic development. During the period of 
Japan's swift economic development, particularly in the 1950's 
and 1960's, Japan's economy grew too fast, while production 
depended heavily on imported raw materials and energy resources. 
Under such circumstances, increases in production were 
dependent on imports, which in turn resulted in Japan's 
worsening international balance of payments. Consequently, this 
international balance of payments problem constituted the 
critical point in Japan's economic growth. When economic 
development was sufficiently overheated to reach or approach 
this critical point, the Japanese Government began to raise 
interest rates to depress the overheated investment. Once the 
international balance of payments returned to normal, interest 
rates were gradually decreased so that the economy could climb 
from the trough to a peak. The business cycles in 1957, 1962 
and 1964 can all fit such a model. 
  In summary, the international balance of payments, which was 
the critical point, was an important early warning sign in 
Japan's economic development during its period of rapid growth 
and the interest rates policy became an important means for 
macroeconomic regulationa and control and an important aspect of 
the "anticycle." 
  China's current economic cycle is more complicated. 
According to research conducted by the State Statistical Bureau 
Department of Integrated Statistics of the National Economy, 
because of the dual effect of investment in fixed assets on 
China's total supply and demand, the violent fluctuations in 
China's economic growth are always preceded by swings in 
investment in fixed assets. Large increases or large decreases 
in investment in fixed assets both cause violent economic 
fluctuations. 
  Generally speaking, overexpansion of investment demand 
inevitably leads to the oversupply of money, pulling the economy 
into overexpansion and resulting in an expansion of consumer 
demand, a drop in commodity stock, and an upswing in price 
indexes. 
  Conversely, excessive contraction of investment demand 
inevitably leads to a shortage in the supply of money, which 
causes economic recession, reduction in consumer demand, an 
increase in commodity stock, and a downswing in price indexes. 
However, these are only the general conditions of the business 
cycle. 
  Observing the reality of China's economic development 
reveals 
that there are insufficient macroscopic conditions in the 
economy in terms of firm restrictions on the retarded 
development of basic industries. This is characterized by the 
undersupply of key raw materials, shortages in the supply of 
energy resources, grossly inadequate transportation, and 
shortages in hard currencies. Undersupply will hold up China's 
economic development and seriously constrain economic growth 
throughout what should be a period of fast economic growth. 
  Enterprise development orientation in recent years indicates 
that from now on China's industrial development will mainly be 
restricted by the structural contradiction between rapidly 
growing processing industries and the slow growth of basic 
industries. 
  In contrast to the increase over the five year period in 
the per capita equipment-rate in China's top 500 enterprises, 
the equipment-rate fell in most basic industries, with the 
exception of the oil and gas exploration industries which 
enjoyed a significant increase. In most of the processing 
industries there was an increase in the per capita 
equipment-rate. In the coming years, the development of basic 
industries will still be limited, in contrast to the further 
growth of the processing industries. It will be very difficult 
to reconcile the contradiction between the development of the 
two economic sectors, which will in turn restrict the growth of 
the processing industries. The resulting economic repercussions 
can only be eased by the "anticycle" policy. 
  It is therefore necessary to take the "anticycle" policy as 
the main contents of the macroeconomic regulation and control 
policies. If the "early warning" point of "anticycle" is only 
set on fixed assets investment, excellent opportunities for 
economic and industrial development will undoubtedly be lost, 
delaying development of the modernization drive. It is also 
extremely impractical to regard strengthening supply 
capabilities as the major policy. 
  When summarizing the rapid growth of Japan's economy, 
Kanamori Hisakata, a famous Japanese economist, pointed out that 
nongovernmental investment in equipment, which had a 3.5-fold 
increase within a decade, was the primary force behind Japan's 
rapid growth. He believes that heavy investment in equipment 
has played a major role in promoting Japan's economic growth in 
terms of enlarging Japan's production capabilities, expanding 
consumption demand, promoting adjustment of the industrial 
structure (such adjustment would be difficult to carry out 
without added investment), and strengthening global 
competitiveness which, in turn, has resulted in increased 
exports and an improved international balance of payments. The 
increase in equipment investment has led to higher productivity, 
lower payroll costs, and stronger price competitiveness. In 
view of China's practical conditions, and in response to the 
demand to buttress the high-speed economic development by means 
of strengthening supply capabilities, it is necessary to 
maintain a relatively high equipment-investment level for a 
certain period of time to increase industries' supply capability 
and raise global competitiveness. It is also necessary to link 
the domestic market more closely to international markets and 
increase the role of import substitutes. Increased supply 
capability is needed to sustain high growth. 
  Voluntary adjustment of the business cycle by the state is 
the most effective means of easing the supply-demand 
contradiction. Meanwhile, the state should also use the economic 
cycle-adjustment policy as an important means of adjusting the 
organizational structure of enterprises and discarding obsolete 
enterprises, which are like a cancer adversely affecting 
economic quality and, therefore, should be eliminated. No 
matter which "anticycle" policy is adopted, however, an 
"early-warning" system should be used so that enterprises can 
take emergency measures as soon as possible and reduce the 
repercussions from economic fluctuations on the operation and 
development of enterprises.

  [Text] Beijing March 10 (XINHUA) -- The political subject 
panel of the Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory 
Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) 
met in Beijing on March 29-30 to discuss questions concerning 
public servants. 
  Through the media here, the members of the panel answered 
some questions which have aroused suspicions among public 
servants in Hong Kong. 
  The panel noted that according to Article 100 of the Basic 
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, public 
servants in all Hong Kong Government departments, including the 
police department, working before July 1, 1997, can continue 
their work in the Government of the Hong Kong SAR. 
  The panel noted that today's achievements in Hong Kong are 
the results of high-quality public service and an effective 
system governing public servants in Hong Kong. 
  The members of the panel sincerely expect public servants 
now 
working in all of Hong Kong's departments to continue their 
service for the SAR Government and the people in Hong Kong. 
  The panel noted that according to Article 101, foreigners 
can 
be employed as public servants, but not chief officials, in Hong 
Kong Government departments after 1997. However, foreign 
employees must hold permanent identity cards of the region or be 
working in public service in Hong Kong before 1997. 
  According to the Basic Law, foreigners cannot become heads 
or 
deputy heads of major departments of the government after 1997. 
The chief secretary, the commissioner of police, director of 
the Customs Office, chief judges of the Court of Final Appeal 
and Supreme Court in Hong Kong must be Chinese after 1997. 
  On the question of pay, allowances and benefits, the panel 
noted that according to the Basic Law, public servants serving 
in all Hong Kong Government departments, including the police 
department, before the establishment of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, may all remain in employment and retain 
their seniority with pay, allowances, benefits and conditions of 
service no less favorable than before. 
  The Government of the Hong Kong SAR shall pay to public 
servants who retire or who leave the service in compliance with 
regulations before the establishment of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, or to their dependants, all pensions, 
gratuities, allowances and benefits due to them no less 
favorable than before. 
  On the question of the "Plan of the Right of Abode in 
Britain," the panel noted that the Chinese Government's solemn 
stance against "The Plan of the Right of Abode in Britain" is 
not to the individuals who have gained the right, but to the 
British Government's practice and political attempt which 
violated the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR. 
  It noted that the public servants who have gained the right 
can continue to work in the government of the Hong Kong SAR 
after 1997, but their so-called "identity of British citizens" 
will not be recognized by the Chinese Government and they cannot 
enjoy the British counsel protection in the Hong Kong SAR and 
other areas in China. 
  The panel said that such people cannot serve as chief 
officials in the government of the Hong Kong SAR. 
  The panel also said that the saying of Chinese armed police 
to be stationed in Hong Kong after 1997 is groundless. [sentence 
as received] According to the Basic Law, the Hong Kong SAR 
Government will take charge of public security in the Hong Kong 
SAR. The Chinese armed police will not be sent to Hong Kong 
after 1997.

  [Text] Beijing, 30 Mar (XINHUA) -- The task force in 
charge of government affairs under the Preliminary Working 
Committee [PWC] of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region [SAR] held its sixth meeting in 
Beijing on 29 and 30 march, in which it discussed several issues 
of concern to Hong Kong's public servants. Committee members 
maintained: It is necessary to offer explanations to dispel 
doubts currently harbored by public servants. Public servants 
in Hong Kong are encouraged to keep relaying their problems to 
the committee. As usual, the task force will pay close 
attention to their problems. 
  The following are answers offered by the PWC's task force in 
charge of government affairs on several issues of concern to 
Hong Kong's public servants: 
  [Question] Will Hong Kong's public servants be "completely 
replaced" in 1997? 
  [Answer] No. Article 10 of the Hong Kong SAR Basic Law 
explicitly states: Public servants serving in all Hong Kong 
government departments, including the police department, before 
the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR, may all remain in 
employment. This means public servants serving under the Hong 
Kong Government before 1 July 1997 may continue their service 
with the Hong Kong SAR Government after that date. 
  Hong Kong's current achievements are inextricably linked 
with 
a highly qualified pool of public servants and an effective 
public service system. Members on the task force unanimously 
and fully affirmed the contributions made by Hong Kong's public 
servants to stability and prosperity in Hong Kong society. 
Maintaining the stability and continuity of the ranks of public 
servants in Hong Kong before and after 1997 is an important 
aspect of Hong Kong's smooth transition. Committee members 
sincerely hope that public servants currently serving in all 
Hong Kong government departments will be able to work without 
any worries and continue to serve the Hong Kong SAR Government 
and the Hong Kong people after 1997. 
  [Question] Is there any basis to the statement that 
"accounts 
will be settled afterward"? 
  [Answer] No. Public servants working in Hong Kong government 
departments before 1 July 1997 perform their official duties in 
accordance with Hong Kong's laws, regardless of what government 
departments they serve and whether their work is politically 
sensitive. When they continue their service with the Hong Kong 
SAR Government after 1 July 1997, they will also perform their 
official duties in accordance with the law. Moreover, after 
1997 the Hong Kong SAR Government will maintain Hong Kong's 
original system for hiring and disciplining public servants, as 
well as its special bodies, on which basis it will exercise 
management over public servants. Therefore, it is simply 
impossible to "settle accounts afterward," politically or 
institutionally. 
  [Question] Will public servants in Hong Kong be accountable 
to various central people's government departments after 1997? 
  [Answer] The second paragraph of Article 99 of the Basic Law 
states: Public servants must be dedicated to their duties and 
be responsible to the Hong Kong SAR Government. This explicitly 
specifies to whom Hong Kong's public servants must be 
"accountable" after 1 July 1997. To be sure, the Hong Kong SAR 
Government, as a local government directly under the central 
people's government, should be accountable to the latter. This 
applies only to the Hong Kong SAR Government as a whole. This 
relationship of accountability will be reflected through the way 
the chief executive is accountable to the central people's 
government. Article 43 of the Basic Law provides for this 
accountability. Article 22 of the Basic Law states: No 
department of the central people's government and no province, 
autonomous region, or municipality directly under the central 
government may interfere in the affairs which the Hong Kong SAR 
administers on its own in accordance with this law. Therefore, 
the question of accountability to various central people's 
government departments does not exist for the work carried out 
by departments under the Hong Kong SAR Government. 
  [Question] Will public servants in Hong Kong be able to 
retain their posts after 1997? 
  [Answer] Public servants working for the Hong Kong 
Government on 1 July 1997 will, in general, be able to retain 
their posts. Principal officials, however, will be nominated by 
the Chief Executive and referred to the Central People's 
Government for appointment in accordance with the provisions of 
the Basic Law. The appointment and promotion of public servants 
in the Hong Kong SAR after 1 July 1997 will be on the basis of 
the qualifications, experience, and ability of public servants 
themselves in accordance with the provisions of Article 103 of 
the Basic Law; and will be not different from the current 
appointment and promotion of public servants in Hong Kong. 
  [Question] Will foreign nationals be allowed to serve in 
government departments after 1997? 
  [Answer] Certainly. According to the stipulations in 
Article 101 of the Basic Law, except for principal officials, 
foreign nationals can be employed by government departments at 
various levels. However, they must be a permanent resident of 
Hong Kong, or must already serve in the Hong Kong Government 
before 1997. 
  [Question] Are public servants in Hong Kong required to 
speak Mandarin and write in Chinese after 1997? 
  [Answer] Article 9 of the Basic Law stipulates: In addition 
to the Chinese Language, the English Language may also be used 
by the executive authorities, legislature and judicial organs of 
the Hong Kong SAR; English is also an official language. Hence, 
knowledge of Mandarin and Chinese writing is not the 
prerequisite for serving in the Hong Kong SAR Government; 
however, it can help promote exchange and communication with 
various departments in the hintherland. 
  [Question] What are the posts that will be excluded from 
foreign nationals or people with right of residence in foreign 
countries after 1997? 
  [Answer] Very few posts will be excluded from foreign 
nationals or people with right of residence in foreign countries 
after 1997. According to the provisions of Articles 60 and 101 
of the Basic Law, they are secretary and deputy secretaries of 
the Department of Administration, the Department of Finance, and 
the Department of Justice; directors of bureaus; the 
commissioner against corruption; the director of audit; the 
commissioner of police; the commissioner of immigration; and the 
inspector general of customs and excise. Also, chief justices 
of the Court of Final Appeal and the High Court will also be 
excluded from foreign nationals or people with right of 
residence in foreign countries. 
  [Question] Will Hong Kong's existing system of recruitment, 
employment, assessment, discipline, training, and management for 
public service be maintained after 1997? 
  [Answer] Article 103 of the Basic Law clearly stipulates 
that Hong Kong's previous system of recruitment, employment, 
assessment, discipline, training, and management for public 
service, shall be maintained, except for any provisions for 
privileged treatment of foreign nationals. 
  [Question] Will the Public Service Employment Committee's 
standing committees in charge of public servants' pay and 
conditions of service continue to exist after 1997? 
  [Answer] According to the provisions of Article 103 of the 
Basic Law, Hong Kong's previous system of recruitment, 
employment, assessment, discipline, training, and management for 
the public service, including special bodies for their 
appointment, pay, and conditions of serivce, shall be 
maintained, except for any provisions for privileged treatment 
of foreign nationals. Therefore, the Public Service Employment 
Committee and special bodies for pay and conditions of service 
of public servants -- including the standing committee for chief 
executives' pay and conditions of service, the standing 
committee for judicial personnel' pay and conditions of service, 
and the standing committee for public servants' pay and 
conditions of service -- can continue to exist after 1997 to 
perform their duties related to recruitment, promotion, pay, and 
conditions of service of public servants. 
  [Question] Will the salaries, allowances, benefits, and 
conditions of service for Hong Kong's public servants be less 
favorable after 1997? 
  [Answer] No. Article 100 of the Basic Law explicitly states 
that public servants serving in all Hong Kong Government 
departments before the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR may 
retain their seniority, with pay, allowances, benefits, and 
conditions of service no less favorable than before, if they 
remain in employment. Article 102 states that the Hong Kong SAR 
Government will pay to public servants who retire or leave the 
service in compliance with regulations (including those who have 
retired or left the service in compliance with regulations 
before the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR), or to their 
dependents, all pensions, gratuities, allowances, and benefits 
due them on terms no less favorable than before. 
  [Question] Does the task force in charge of government 
affairs actively support the creation of a long-term wage fund 
for public servants? 
  [Answer] Article 102 of the Basic Law explicitly addresses 
the benefits for public servants who retire or leave service in 
compliance with regulations: that is, the SAR Government will 
pay them or their dependents all pensions, gratuities, 
allowances, and benefits due them on terms no less favorable 
than before. Retirement pensions for public servants after 1997 
are evidently guaranteed by law. Judging by Hong Kong's current 
financial status and economic prospects, there should be no 
problem paying retirement pensions to public servants in the 
future. 
  Committee members understand that Hong Kong's public 
servants 
are concerned and worried about their retirement pensions. They 
support the demand for creating a long-term wage fund for public 
servants. It is hoped that the British Hong Kong Government will 
take active and practical measures in this regard. 
  [Question] How will you treat public servants who have 
gained 
resident rights in Britain under the "Plan for Granting Resident 
Rights in Britain?" 
  [Answer] The Chinese Government's solemn stand against the 
"Plan for Granting Resident Rights in Britain" is intended to 
deal with the British Government's intentional violation of the 
Joint Declaration, as well as its political schemes; it is not 
targeted at individuals who have "gained resident rights in 
Britain." Public servants who have gained "resident rights in 
Britain" may continue their service with the Hong Kong SAR 
Government after 1997. However, the Chinese Government will not 
recognize their status as so-called "British citizens." In 
addition, they will not enjoy Britain's consular protection in 
the Hong Kong SAR and in other parts of China. Moreover, 
according to relevant provisions in the Basic Law, they will not 
be allowed to serve as leading officials in the Hong Kong SAR 
Government, which is also true of foreign nationals, because 
they have gained resident rights in a foreign country. 
  [Question] Is it true that the "Chinese Armed Police Force 
will assume the Hong Kong police's functions after 1997"? 
  [Answer] This statement is groundless. According to relevant

  [Text] Beijing, March 31 (CNS) -- Deputy Director of the 
Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office under the State Council, Mr. 
Chen Ziying, today met a senior delegation from the American 
Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong led by its chairman Mr. Gerald 
Murdock. Mr. Chen said that the Chinese government hoped that 
the British Hong Kong authorities would take effective measure 
to control high inflation and soaring housing prices there. 
  With regard to the leasing of land, Mr. Chen said that the 
Sino-British Land Group had been getting on well with their work 
on the leasing of more than 50 hectares of land in recent years 
as set out in Annex 3 of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. 
This amount did not include the leasing of land for public 
housing. The leasing of land approved for this year was 
expected to be no less than 100 hectares. 
  The construction of the railway to serve the new airport, 
Mr. 
Chen said, involved both the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group 
and the Land Commission, and this therefore needed consultation 
between the two parties. He said he hoped that the core project 
for the new airport would be completed as far as possible in 
view of the approach of 1997. [sentence as received] 
  Mr. Murdock said that the American Chamber of Commerce in 
Hong Kong would contribute to encouraging the American 
government to renew China's MFN status without preconditions. 
Mr. Chen expressed his appreciation, saying that MFN was 
reciprocal and if the American government took away China's MFN 
status, both sides would suffer losses and Hong Kong and Taiwan 
would be particularly hurt. Looking into the future, America 
would be the biggest loser, Mr. Chen added. 
  In a 70-minute meeting, Mr. Chen repeatedly stressed that 
the 
Chinese government would unquestionably uphold Hong Kong's 
international financial and trade centre status. He said that 
China did not know how far the British side would go in 
breaching cooperation. Hong Kong's future was ultimately 
decided by the people of Hong Kong. After 1997, he said, the 
Chinese government would implement the policy of "one China, two 
systems" and "Hong Kong run by Hong Kong people" to the letter. 
To maintain Hong Kong's status as an international financial 
and trade centre and its stability and prosperity was the only 
aim of the Chinese government.

  [Text] China is preparing to crack down on pirated compact 
discs (CDs) being smuggled into Hong Kong, according to a 
leading recording industry body that has lobbied the mainland 
for stronger controls. 
  The Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department yesterday 
admitted the problem had become difficult to control because of 
lax restrictions on the mainland covering intellectual property 
rights. The customs commissioner, Don Watson, predicted another 
huge increase in seizures of pirated CDs this year. 
  The regional head of the International Federation of the 
Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Giouw Jui-Chian, said the Chinese 
government was drafting legislation that would make CD piracy a 
criminal offence - it is currently regarded as a civil matter. 
  Giouw said the IFPI, which on behalf of the recording 
industry has been lobbying the Chinese government, had been told 
that a central authority would be set up to combat the problem 
and CD imports and exports would be subjected to rigorous checks 
from June. He said CDs pirated in China had been seized in 
countries throughout Asia and North America and two consignments 
had been recently confiscated by authorities in Central American 
countries. 
  In the first two months of this year, Hong Kong customs 
officers arrested 75 people and seized more than 13,000 pirated 
CDs with a retail value of $600,000 [currency not specified]: 
Last year, the number of seized discs jumped to 95,671, 
compared with only 10,117 confiscated in 1992. Watson said he 
expected more seizures this year. 
  Speaking after a ceremonial destruction of pirated CDs 
yesterday, Watson said the Government was working closely with 
the music industry to stop the influx of pirates, which last 
year cost the industry an estimated $300m in lost profits. He 
said intelligence indicated that organised efforts were behind 
the smuggling and distribution of pirated discs. 
  "I not sure we can dignify them with the name of 
'syndicates' 
as of yet but we're looking very, very closely at who is 
responsible for the distribution," Watson said. "I know when it 
first began as a problem, we were satisfied the (discs) were 
coming in, not in an organised way, but by travellers coming 
back from (Shenzen) bringing CDs with them which they could buy 
very cheaply. The picture has changed because of pressure 
applied by Customs and Excise and the police and I think now 
because of the profits factor, there is growing evidence that 
there is an organisation behind it." 
  He said that several different Chinese authorities were 
responsible for enforcing intellectual property laws and without 
any co-ordinated effort the problem would be remain widespread. 
  "I have spoken to the Chinese customs about this problem but 
the problem there is that they do not have the authority to deal 
with the situation in China," he said. 
  "Until you can actually have one authority which is 
combatting the manufacture, distribution and sale of pirated CDs 
then we're unlikely to get very much further than we are at the 
moment. I understand that through the efforts of the IFPI some 
sort of co- ordinated action is being taken. "It is only 
through co-ordinated action against producers that we are likely 
to see any improvements in the situation locally. 
  "I think the problem is due to the fact that the 
manufacturing capacity of CDs in China far exceeds the domestic 
demand for the product and the spare capacity is being used to 
produce these pirated CDs. I think the problem can only be 
resolved by the factories in China being closed down or being 
reduced to producing legitimate CDs for the legitimate markets. 
  "I would hate to say it's out of control but...the major 
problem is the sheer volume of traffic between Hong Kong and 
China." 
  Watson said none of the pirated CDs seized so far had been 
made locally and although some had been manufactured in other 
Asian countries, most were from China. 
  Giouw said that until stronger legislation was introduced in 
China, the pirating of compact discs would continue to 
proliferate. 
  "None of the pirates are afraid of the laws," he said. 
  "If they are making a million a year, why should they worry 
about paying a fine or half a million dollars in damages?"

<F P=106> [By Sheel Kohli in Bermuda] </F>
  [Text] Jardine Matheson is seeking to enshrine a takeover 
code in Bermudan law because it fears a takeover by Chinese 
companies, according to a senior Bermudan minister. 
  This contradicts statements made by Jardines directors last 
week when they announced the hong's intentions to de-list 
several Jardine companies from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange at 
the end of this year. 
  Bermudan financial ministry officials said Simon and Henry 
Keswick had said there was an extreme likelihood that there 
would be a hostile bid for the group. David Saul, Bermuda's 
Minister of Finance and a senior parliamentary member of the 
ruling United Bermuda Party said he met the Keswick brothers on 
several occasions to discuss details of passing their takeover 
code into law. 
  "The Keswicks were concerned, they expressed those concerns 
and they described those concerns," he said. "They were 
concerned principally about a hostile takeover. They decided 
that they needed protection, and that seemed to us a genuine 
bona fide concern." 
  The code Jardines sponsored in Bermuda stipulates that 
anyone 
acquiring 30 percent of a company's stock must make a general 
offer, whereas the Hong Kong trigger point is 35 percent. 
  The company, which has been doing business in Hong Kong and 
China for the past 150 years, had sought, but been denied a 
special arrangement in Hong Kong, that it said could have 
allowed the group's shares to remain as a secondary listing in 
Hong Kong. 
  Mr Saul said Jardines had been expressing fears about being 
taken over since it first officially announced its new domicile 
in 1984, coinciding with the agreement by Britain to hand Hong 
Kong back to China in 1997. "When Jardines moved their 
headquarters to Bermuda, it was apparent that takeover concerns 
led them to do it." 
  He said it was these concerns too, that proved to be one of 
the deciding factors persuading the Bermudan Government to allow 
Jardines to proceed with a private bill to enshrine a specific 
takeover code. Mr Saul said: "We suggested that they go the 
private bill route. We said that we had no provisions in law to 
prevent hostile takeovers." 
  Malcolm Williams, the general manager of the Bermuda 
Monetary 
Authority, whose department investigated the code and who will 
be responsible for administering it, also said that these were 
their motives. "They were uncertain about 1997, and it seemed 
sensible in some ways in stationing and positioning themselves, 
so that if something adverse happens, then they have something 
to protect shareholders," Mr Williams said. 
  He said that from this assessment he could only surmise that 
the Keswicks felt that the Hong Kong regulations were 
insufficient to protect them adequately. 
  The announcements for the de-listing Jardine Matheson and 
Jardine Strategic were backed by statements that the move was 
not related to fears about China. 
  Jardines officials were not available for comment.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Zhang Yunfei: "Singapore PM Visit Promotes </F>
Bilateral Ties"] 
  [Text] Yangon [Rangoon], March 31 (XINHUA) -- Singapore's 
prime minister Myanmar [Burma] visit this week was widely 
described as successful and fruitful, which would give a strong 
push to the economic relations between the two countries. 
[sentence as received] 
  Observers here believed that through the visit of Prime 
Minister Goh Chok Tong, the relations between Myanmar and 
Singapore especially in the fields of economic cooperation, 
investment and trade are now entering a new stage this year. 
  At the invitation of Myanmar Prime Minister and Chairman of 
the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) Than Shwe, 
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong paid a three-day visit to 
Myanmar from March 28 to 30. 
  The prime minister was accompanied by over 30 government 
officials and over 20 businessmen. 
  At a press conference on Wednesday [30 March] just before he 
concluded his visit to Myanmar, the prime minister said the 
purpose of his visit to Myanmar is to assess the economic 
opportunities for Singapore, to get the opportunity to know 
first hand political developments in the country and to find out 
how Singapore could encourage its investors to work in Myanmar. 
  At the banquet hosted by Than Shwe on Monday, the Singapore 
prime minister said that Myanmar is potentially an attractive 
location for foreign investments. Singapore businessmen have 
placed Myanmar high on their priority list for their 
regionalization venture, he added. 
  The Singaporean leader told his Myanmar counterpart that his 
country is willing to help Myanmar open up its economy, make its 
society progress and succeed like its neighboring countries of 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). 
  Urging the international community to engage in constructive 
dialogue with Myanmar, Goh said, "The ASEAN policy of 
constructive engagement is a better way to engage the Myanmar 
leadership in dialogue." 
  In the economic cooperation, the two sides on Monday signed 
a 
memorandum of understanding for the construction of three 
hotels, a 400-room hotel, a 700-room hotel and a 300-room hotel, 
with a total investment of 200 million U.S. dollars by Singapore 
companies. 
  The two sides signed memorandum of understanding for 
economic 
cooperation. 
  Meanwhile, the Development Bank of Singapore opened its 
Yangon representative office here on Tuesday, which is part of 
its bid to operate a wide range of banking in Myanmar. 
  Singapore is the No. 1 investing country in Myanmar and the 
second largest trading partner with the country. Up to now, 
nearly 20 Singapore companies came to the country with a total 
contract investment value of over 300 million U.S. dollars, 
especially in hotels and tourism industry, and trade between the 
two countries was over 400 million U.S. dollars in the previous 
year.

  [Text] Beijing, March 29 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of 
the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress 
(NPC), met here today with a delegation from the Federation of 
Filipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, headed by 
federation president Jimmy T. Tang. 
  Qiao briefed the guests on China's reforms, opening-up drive 
and economic development. 
  Qiao said that the NPC was speeding up the pace of 
legislation so as to meet the needs of the establishment of a 
socialist market economic system. 
  He said that it would be beneficial to both countries to 
expand their relations of friendly cooperation and contacts and 
foster mutual trust. 
  Qiao expressed the hope that the federation would promote 
Sino-Philippine economic and trade cooperation while 
contributing to the economic development of the Philippines. 
  Tang congratulated China on its achievements in reform and 
opening up to the outside world, saying that the purpose of his

  [Text] Australia's foreign affairs minister, Gareth Evans, 
has reportedly been delayed in the southern Chinese city of 
Guilin because of aircraft problems. Senator Evans was due to 
arrive in Beijing yesterday for several top level meetings with 
the Chinese leadership. But a spokeswoman for the Australian 
Embassy said the minister would probably arrive later today. 
She said the meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen, 
has been rescheduled. Senator Evans was to meet China's premier, 
Li Peng, and Trade Minister Madam Wu Yi tomorrow and those 
meetings are likely to go ahead as planned. 
  Before leaving Australia, Senator Evans said he would raise 
the issue of North Korea and human rights concerns during his 
talks in Beijing.

  [Text] Wellington, March 30 (XINHUA) -- New Zealand [NZ] 
Prime Minister Jim Bolger said this afternoon New Zealand and 
China can enhance their cooperation in many fields, particularly 
in the area of environment. 
  He made the remarks when meeting a Chinese delegation led by 
Deng Nan, vice chairman of the Chinese State Science and 
Technology Commission. 
  He said as China has one-fifth of the world population, a 
better environment in China will contribute to the improvement 
of world environment. 
  Deng Nan said both China and New Zealand are countries of 
the 
Asia-Pacific region and they can promote their cooperation in 
various fields to their mutual benefits. 
  Deng Nan and her party arrived in the northern New Zealand 
city of Auckland on March 28 and arrived here this morning. 
  This afternoon, NZ Deputy Prime Minister Don McKinnon and 
Minister of Environment, Research, Science and Technology Simon 
Upton also met the delegation on separate occasions. 
  Shortly after its arrival this morning, the delegation held 
a 
round-table meeting with New Zealand scientists to exchange 
views on the reform in the field of science and technology in 
their respective countries. 
  The Chinese delegation will leave here tomorrow morning for 
visits in the south island of New Zealand, and will leave for 
home on April 1.

  [Text] Taipei, March 31 (CNA) -- The next round of talks 
between Taiwan and Mainland China is expected to be held in 
Taipei in late April, chief Taiwan negotiator Hsu Hui-yu said 
Thursday [31 March] in Beijing. 
  Hsu, the deputy secretary-general of the Straits Exchange 
Foundation (SEF) and leader of the Taiwan delegation that left 
for Beijing last week for the fourth round of talks with 
mainland negotiators on cross-strait technical issues, boarded 
the plane for Taiwan Thursday empty-handed. 
  The talks centered on three non-political technical issues 
-- 
the repatriation of mainland hijackers, the repatriation of 
illegal mainland immigrants, and the resolution of cross-strait 
fishing disputes. 
  Although the Taiwan negotiators made the biggest concessions 
possible, Hsu said, the talks once again failed because of 
Beijing's continued reluctance to recognize Taiwan's 
jurisdiction rights. 
  SEF Vice Chairman Chiao Jen-ho, while regretting that no 
agreements were reached during the talks, called for 
higher-level dialogue in the future. 
  He said negotiations would not be effective simply because 
of 
the use of "eloquent" or "effective" negotiators, but require 
sincerity and consensus from both sides.

  [Text] Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman of the Mainland 
Affairs Council, Friday [4 March] said Taiwan's future admission 
to the General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, does 
not mean a collapse in the ROC [Republic of China] Government's 
policy to keep trade and transportation with Mainland China on 
indirect basis. Also the cross-strait ties will not be altered 
simply because both Taipei and Peking are expected to join GATT 
in foreseeable future. The GATT membership and cross-strait 
relations are two different issues, Kao explained, judging that 
the government's mainland policy is governed by national 
reunification guidelines. The guidelines state very clearly 
that direct trade and transportation will not be allowed until 
the two sides enter the medium phase of the unification, Kao 
said. 
  Although GATT asked members to remove trade barriers and 
abide by the principle of free trade in open market, Taipei and 
Peking can still apply Article 21 instead 35 to exclude each 
other for enjoying a cross-strait trading privilege.

  [Text] Taipei, April 1 (CNA) -- In a new effort to better 
protect intellectual property rights, Taiwan will establish the 
information product anti-piracy union in late April, the 
Information Service Industry Association (ISIA) announced late 
Thursday [31 March]. 
  ISIA Secretary-General Arthur Hwa said at a news conference 
that the union, aiming to intensify crackdowns on counterfeit 
computer products, will be patterned after the US-based business 
software alliance (BSA). 
  More than 30 domestic computer software manufacturers have 
decided to join the new union, Hwa noted. 
  To give a helping hand to Taiwan's anti-piracy efforts, BSA 
said the American Alliance has chosen April as "Anti-Piracy 
Month" for Taiwan, and will launch a series of activities here 
to advocate the importance of protecting innovative information 
products from unauthorized use. 
  BSA will sponsor seminars on software management and offer 
incentive measures to encourage Taiwan residents to inform the 
alliance of software piracy cases, a spokesman said. 
  Anyone who provides information which leads to the 
indictment, sentencing or out of court settlement of a software 
pirate will be rewarded NT$50,000 (US$1,886.79), he elaborated. 
  Louis Wang, director of the Interior Ministry's Copyright 
Committee, hailed the BSA move, saying the anti-piracy drive 
will promote the development of a sound, healthy information 
industry in Taiwan. 
  Also speaking at the news conference were Director-General 
B. 
Lynn Pascoe of the American Institute in Taiwan, Deputy 
Director- General Lin Yi-fu of the Board of Foreign Trade, and 
Hu Tzu-yin, deputy director-general of the Information Industry 
Institute.

  [Text] Taipei, April 1 (CNA) -- The Belgian Bank opened a 
representative office in Taipei Thursday [31 March] to promote 
financial cooperation and trade between the Kingdom of Belgium 
and Taiwan. 
  The Belgian Bank was founded in 1935 as a far east 
subsidiary 
of Belgium's largest bank, the General Bank, and boasts assets 
of US$2.24 billion, a bank spokesman said. 
  The bank is considered one of the world's top 500 banks, the 
spokesman added, and it is the first bank from Belgium to 
establish a representative office in Taiwan, he said. 
  Two-way trade between Taiwan and Belgium totaled some US$104 
million in 1993 with Belgium enjoying a surplus of US$16.4 
million.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Big brother mentality"] </F>
  [Text] Beijing must give up its big brotherism and cease 
to intervene in Taiwan's efforts to develop foreign relations if 
it wants to see a steady normalization of relations between the 
two sides. Unfortunately, there is no sign of Beijing changing 
that policy. Even recently, Beijing tried all means it could to 
block an eight-day unofficial visit by President Li Teng-hui to 
three Southeast Asian countries, though to no avail. 
  Mainland China's repeated warnings and protests did not 
bully 
the Philippines and Indonesia, the first two nations of Li's 
three- country tour, into refusing to receive him. Both 
Philippine President Fidel Ramos and Indonesian President 
Suharto held talks with Li over economic and other bilateral 
issues. 
  It is still not known whether Thai Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai will meet Li today when the president leaves Thailand, 
the last leg of his Southeast Asian trip, and flies back to 
Taiwan. But Chuan has earlier refuted Beijing's protests by 
defending Bangkok's right to allow President Li to visit 
Thailand. 
  Mainland China's persistent intervention in Taiwan's efforts 
to promote relations with foreign countries is unreasonable, as 
it takes no consideration at all of the island's needs for 
expanding such ties. 
  Taiwan, as an island economy with few natural resources and 
limited domestic market, cannot afford to isolate itself from 
the rest of the world without international economic and 
political relations. 
  Taiwan must go to the world to look for more trade and 
investment opportunities abroad for its companies. And it must 
promote technological, scientific and cultural exchanges with 
other nations to enhance economic and social development. 
  Also, with increasing income and more leisure time, local 
citizens in growing numbers want to go abroad to spend their 
vacations, thereby to gain a firsthand chance to understand 
other nations and their people. 
  Yet to administer all these exchanges with foreign nations 
and to better protect its businessmen's and travelers' interests 
abroad, it is necessary for Taiwan to establish relations and 
high-level contacts with other governments. 
  Beijing's stubborn attempts to block Taiwan from developing 
closer contacts with foreign nations also demonstrates its 
ignorance of the realities of present-day world relations. 
  Taiwan, given its growing economic and financial powers, 
offers a lot-of business opportunities. Foreign governments 
would not be willing to pass up such opportunities by submitting 
to Beijing's unjustifiable demands and refusing to have ties 
with Taiwan. 
  A most vivid illustration of this is the reception the three 
South-east Asian governments have extended to President Li 
during his eight-day tour, in spite of the repeated protests 
from Beijing. 
  The leaders in Beijing may contend that their intervention 
to 
isolate Taiwan internationally is necessary to help prevent this 
island from becoming independent from China. It is wrong. Such 
intervention will only provoke resentment among local citizens, 
impede improvement of bilateral relations and prolong the 
division of the two sides. 
  In the interest of reunification, as pointed out recently by 
Premier Lien Chan, Beijing must abandon its big brother 
mentality and cease to treat Taiwan like the big fish swallowing 
the small one.

  [Text] Hong Kong, April 1 (AFP)--China has signalled that 
it is ready to make concessions to sustain its 
most-favored-nation (MFN) trading privileges with the United 
States, a US business leader in Hong Kong said Friday. Gerald 
Murdock, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong 
Kong, who returned from two days of meetings in Beijing, said 
the Chinese officials he met did not specify what precise steps 
they might take. But he said the officials--including Li 
Lanqing, vice premier in charge of foreign trade--indicated they 
were "willing to be helpful," so long as the steps taken fell in 
line with Chinese law. 
  "I don't think they'd describe it as concessions, but they 
did give us the impression that they're willing to be helpful to 
the (MFN renewal) process within the framework of Chinese law," 
Murdock told AFP. "I interpret that as meaning there would be 
some action on the Chinese part that would make (President Bill 
Clinton's) decision to renew easier," he said. Asked when China 
might act, Murdock replied: "It's got to be soon. They don't 
have much time left." 
  Clinton is to decide by June whether to maintain MFN for 
China, after declaring a year ago that renewal would depend on 
"overall, significant progress" in human rights. While the 
United States extends MFN status to nearly all its trading 
partners, many US congressmen are still in favor of revoking it 
in China's case, five years after the Beijing massacre of 
pro-democracy activists. Earlier this week, the US Assistant 
Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific affairs, Winston 
Lord, suggested that MFN might be revoked on a limited basis, 
with state-owned exporters targeted. 
  But Murdock said: "There is a better understanding by the 
Chinese side of how the US side feels about this issue, how it 
should approach it and what (Washington) is looking for." 
  The American Chamber, with about 325 corporate members, is 
in 
favor of China keeping its MFN status, saying the continued 
presence of US business in the country can help guarantee human 
rights in the long run. Murdock and other chamber members are 
to be in Washington on May 2-5 to urge legislators to support 
MFN renewal, in a mission that will dovetail with a similar 
lobbying effort by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's deputy, 
Chief Secretary Anson Chan.

  [Text] Beijing, April 1 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met here today with Cyrus 
Vance, former U.S. secretary of state. 
  They cordially exchanged views on Sino-U.S. relations and 
other international issues of mutual concern. 
  Qian said that China and the U.S., as big countries in the 
world, should forge a normal and stable relationship, which will 
be in the fundamental interest of both peoples. 
  He expressed his appreciation of Vance's contributions to 
the 
development of Sino-U.S. relations during the time when he was 
U.S. secretary of state and now as co-chairman of the 
America-China Society. 
  Vance said that the U.S. and China share common interests on 
wide-ranging issues and the two countries' economies are highly 
complementary, adding that it is necessary for the two countries 
to strengthen dialogues on major strategic issues within a 
larger scope. 
  Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu, former U.S. Deputy 
Secretary of State John Whitehead, and U.S. Ambassador to China 
Stapleton Roy were present. 
  After the meeting Qian hosted a banquet in honor of Vance 
and 
his party, who arrived here on a goodwill visit at the 
invitation of the Chinese Foreign Ministry.

  [Text] Washington, March 31 (XINHUA) -- The Clinton 
administration said here today that China has taken "important 
steps" to fulfill "most of the obligations" that the country 
incurred in 1992 agreements with the United States. 
  The National Trade Estimate Report, the ninth of its kind 
and 
released here today, said that by the end of 1993, "China had 
committed to substantial improvement of transparency" of its 
import approval process. 
  "Permission to import products now subject to quotas or 
quantitative restrictions appears to be considerably simple and 
more transparent than it was in the past," the report said. 
  China, the report said, had streamlined its import approval 
process for industrial goods, and eliminated "a substantial 
number of industrial products -- particularly in the machinery 
and electronics sectors." 
  The 280-page annual report, compiled by the office of U.S. 
Trade Representative (USTR), listed a wide range of trade 
barriers maintained by 39 U.S. trading partners. 
  In its special 14-page chapter on China, the report called 
the U.S.-China trade consultations in 1992, which covered 
implementation of market access agreement, intellectual property 
rights enforcement and market access for services and textile, a 
success. 
  According to the USTR, U.S. trade deficit with China in 1993 
was 22.8 billion U.S. dollars. U.S. merchandise exports to 
China were 8.8 billion dollars last year, up 1.3 billion dollars 
from the year before. 
  The stock of U.S. direct investment in China was 469 million 
dollars in 1992. Pledged U.S. investment in China in 1993 stood 
at seven billion dollars. Actual on the ground committed 
investment stood at three billion dollars. 
  In 1992 agreements with the U.S., China agreed to dismantle 
almost 90 percent of its non-tariff import restrictions in five 
years and to publish either the quantity or value of any 
products subject to quantitative restrictions.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter He Chong (6320 3095): "It Is </F>
Historically Inevitable That China and the United States Will 
Permanently Grant Preferential Trading Status to Each Other"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 20 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Prior to 
and following U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's 
visit, China unceasingly criticized the United States for 
interfering in its internal affairs on the pretext of human 
rights and stated that it would absolutely not accept the 
question of the most favored nation [MFN] status being lumped in 
with the human rights issue. For this reason, many pessimists 
hold that China will most probably not have its MFN status 
renewed this year. However, some optimists argue that China's 
tough stance reflects the huge changes in the international 
situation and that China is confident and will definitely have 
its MFN status renewed. They maintain that it is even possible 
that China will obtain permanent MFN status, ending once and for 
all the big issue over which China has to quarrel, deal, and 
bargain over with the United States every year. 
  Diplomatic struggles are based on strength. China today is 
able to struggle with the United States. Let us look at how the 
West evaluates China's strength. The ECONOMIST, a British 
magazine, worked out for the first time in November 1992 that 
China's GNP was more or less the same as that of Germany that 
year and ranked third, coming next only to those of United 
States and Japan. Estimating China's economic scale with the 
purchasing power parity method for the first time in 1993, the 
U.S. Land [lan de 5695 1795] Company worked out that China's GNP 
ranked second or third in the world. Articles carried in FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS, an American quarterly, even argued that China's overall 
economic strength will surpass that of the United States and 
rank first in the world by the year 2020. 
  It is from political motives that Western countries and 
international organizations intentionally belittled China's 
economic strength in the past and then are suddenly exaggerating 
China's strength now. Therefore, Beijing expresses its distrust 
and will not accept the title "super economic power." However, 
the various calculations above also have scientific evidence and 
reflect China's increasingly strong economy after years of great 
efforts. According to Beijing, China's foreign trade volume 
exceeded $190 billion last year and is expected to grow at an 
average annual rate of 20 percent. In the next seven years, 
China will import $1 trillion of commercial equipment and thus 
become Asia's largest market. Nowadays, Japan, Germany, France, 
Italy, Australia, and others are vying to develop trading 
relations with China. Can the United States then cancel China's 
MFN status and exclude itself from China's market? 
  In fact, since shortly after he became president, Clinton 
has 
paid special attention to China and has repeatedly revised the 
China policy he put forward during the presidential election 
campaign. Last July, his think tank compiled a research report 
on foreign affairs, stating that the rate of Asia's economic 
growth was quicker than that of the United States and Europe and 
that U.S. exports to Asia ranked first. Therefore, the report 
proposed that the United States shift its economic and foreign 
affairs strategy from Europe to Asia and change the "containment 
policy" for socialist countries to the "market expansion 
strategy" to serve its economic revival. As for its strategy for 
Asia, China, the locomotive of Asia's economic development in 
recent years, will become the focal point for U.S. "market 
expansion." Therefore, in the name of calling the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation Summit, Clinton invited China's State 
President Jiang Zemin and held the first Sino-U.S. summit to 
jointly confirm norms for China and the United States to develop 
friendly and cooperative relations. If Clinton cancels China's 
MFN trading status over the human rights question, it also means 
that the United States will lose its MFN status granted by China 
and that their bilateral trade will retrogress. More 
importantly, the "market expansion strategy," which focuses on 
Asia, planned by Clinton through extraordinarily painstaking 
efforts, will "go bust before it is ever implemented." Being 
the president of a superpower, how much face will he have if his 
strategy ends up this way? 
  If China and the United States lose MFN trading status at 
the 
same time, U.S. losses will absolutely not be "an insect bite" 
as some critics put it. According to statistics, last year, 
U.S. exports to China came to $8.76 billion and 170,000 job 
opportunities were thus created. If trade develops in a normal 
way and if China is willing to reduce the trade surplus, it will 
probably reach $40 billion this year, U.S. exports will be 
nearly $20 billion, and 400,000 job opportunities will be 
created for the United States. Moreover, it will offer a big 
market for its depression-stricken airplane, automobile, 
chemical, telecommunications, and service industries. If a 
trade war begins, the United States will not only suffer from 
its nearly $20-billion exports. Its real losses cannot be 
estimated lightly. Will Clinton, who is currently troubled by 
the Whitewater incident, be laoathe to to incur attacks from 
industrialists and businessmen? Will he? 
  It seems that U.S. "human rights diplomacy" is a 
double-edged 
sword which will hurt others as well as itself. Some White 
House advisers proposed to Clinton that by granting China 
permanent MFN status, the president will be able to get rid of 
the limitations from Congress, thus avoiding bargaining with 
some Congressmen over the question of renewing China's MFN 
status between March and June each year in exchange for 
interests on other bills. If this is true, the permanent mutual 
granting of the favor will become an inevitable historical trend.

  [Text] United Nations, March 31 (XINHUA) -- The UN Security 
Council issued a presidential statement today, calling on the 
DPRK to adopt a cooperative approach on the issue of nuclear 
inspection. 
  In the statement the UN Security Council urged the DPRK to 
fulfill its obligations under the nuclear safeguards agreement 
it signed with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty by allowing IAEA inspectors 
to carry out the inspections agreed by the two sides on 15 
February 1994. 
  The statement also urged the DPRK to resume dialogue with 
the 
ROK or member states of the UN Security Council in order to 
reach an agreement with the ROK and IAEA on the implementation 
of the Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula. 
  In a speech at UN Security Council consultations today, Chen 
Jian, Chinese deputy permanent representative to the United 
Nations, gave a full account of China's stand on finding a 
political solution to the Korean nuclear issue. 
  Chen Jian said: On the Korean nuclear issue, China's 
consistent two aims are denuclearization of the Korean peninsula 
and the safeguarding and maintenance of peace and stability in 
the region. Therefore, every action the international community 
takes ought to be conducive to these two aims. Practice has 
shown that the three bilateral dialogue and negotiations 
involving the four parties represent the fundamental way for 
settling the Korean nuclear issue. Any threat or pressure would 
only intensify contradictions and thus have a destructive effect. 
  He said that thanks to the concerted efforts of all the 
parties concerned, many positive factors emerged earlier in 
regard to the Korean nuclear issue. Of late, some new 
difficulties have appeared concerning the issue of inspection of 
the DPRK's nuclear facilities. These are difficulties amid 
continuous progress. So long as the parties concerned remain 
calm and patient, the problems can be solved properly. The 
Chinese delegation believes that it is essential now to create a 
good atmosphere and an environment of relaxation [kuan song huan 
jing 1401 2646 3883 1064] so that the parties concerned can 
resume the three bilateral talks involving four parties.

  [Excerpt] China favours a "moderately-worded and 
constructive" presidential statement from the UN Security 
Council on the Korean nuclear issue, a spokesman for the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said yesterday. 
  China has said it cannot approve the UN Security Council 
resolution on the issue and believes patient dialogue is the 
best way to handle the crisis. 
  Wu said the government firmly supports a presidential 
statement, adding that exerting pressure will only heighten 
tensions. 
  He also said that ROK President Kim Yong-sam's recent visit 
to China was "very successful." 
  During his visit, leaders of both countries called for more 
cooperation, particularly in trade. 
  Both sides also agreed that: 
  -- Maintenance of peace and stability in the Korean 
Peninsula 
is essential. 
  -- A settlement must be reached through dialogue. 
  -- Increased tension and world pressure must be avoided. 
  Wu said China opposed any action that might jeopardize peace 
and stability' in the region, including military exercises or 
the deployment of Patriot missiles. 
  China would continue to develop friendly relations with both 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and ROK on the 
basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence. [passage

  [Text] United Nations, March 31 (XINHUA) -- The UN Security 
Council issued a presidential statement today, calling on the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to cooperate in the 
international inspection of its nuclear sites. 
  The council urged DPRK to allow IAEA (the International 
Atomic Energy Agency) inspectors to complete the inspection 
activities agreed by the two sides last month. 
  IAEA reported to the council earlier this month that because 
of DPRK's objection, it was unable to draw conclusions as to 
whether there has been either diversion of nuclear material or 
reprocessing or other operations. 
  But DPRK argued that the inspections required by IAEA were 
beyond the line agreed upon by the two sides last month. 
  The council also appealed to those member states engaged in 
dialogue with DPRK to continue their dialogue in accordance with 
the agreement. 
  The United States, Britain and France at first insisted on 
using warning languages in either a resolution or a statement 
but met strong opposition from China, which said that anything 
done by the council should be mild and constructive and that any 
pressure against DPRK would be counterproductive. 
  China's position got support from the 10 non-permanent 
member 
countries, which argued that since China was a next-door 
neighbor of DPRK, its observations should be respected. 
  After several days of heated debate, the council at last 
reached consensus on the statement which contained most of 
China's suggestions.

  [Text] United Nations, March 31 (XINHUA) -- The Security 
Council voted unanimously today to extend UN operations in the 
former Yugoslavia by six months and increase troop strength by 
3,500. 
  The United Nations Protection Force, which was established 
in 
February 1992, now has 31,335 peacekeepers in the region. 
  With cease-fires achieved by Muslims and Serbs in Sarajevo 
and by Muslims and Croats in central Bosnia, the United Nations 
needs more troops in Bosnia to help maintain the peace. 
  The number of troops approved by the council today fell far 
short of the 8,500 called for by Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. This was partly because the United States is 
already overextended in financing the operation. 
  U.S. Deputy Ambassador Edward Walker told the council that 
the American concern has been to "ensure that the financial 
resources are available to sustain this vital operation." 
  The United States, which pays about 30 percent of the cost 
of 
all peacekeeping missions, already owes more than 80 million for 
UN operations in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Besides authorizing more troops for Bosnia, the resolution 
also asks NATO to extend air cover for UN troops in Croatia. 
  The Chinese delegation expressed its concern over the use of 
air cover for UN troops. "With regard to the question of close 
air support over the territory of the Republic of Croatia, the 
Security Council should act prudently," said Chen Jian, Chinese 
deputy representative. 
  "It has been stated repeatedly by the secretary-general's 
special representative on the former Yugoslavia that air support 
should only be used to ensure the safety of UN personnel in the 
performance of its mandate and for self-defense, rather than 
using excessive force for punitive purpose," he added.

  [Text] Moscow, March 31 (XINHUA) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu is expected to visit Moscow soon to 
prepare for a South Korean-Russian summit meeting, the ITAR-TASS 
NEWS AGENCY reported today. 
  The summit, probably scheduled for June between South Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, is 
expected to focus on bilateral relations and the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula. 
  Han is currently visiting the United States and plans to fly 
to Moscow around April 10. 
  Although the announcement of Han's Moscow trip was announced 
suddenly by the South Korean president, Seoul says it is not 
connected in any way with the results of the Chinese-South 
Korean talks which ended Wednesday [30 March]. 
  The ITAR-TASS quoted Kim Yong-sam's associates as saying 
that 
Russia, the United States, Japan, China, are the four countries 
which Seoul considers important in the settlement of the nuclear 
problem. 
  Russia and South Korea have held numerous consultations at 
different diplomatic levels about the security problem on the 
Korean peninsula, but now it is time for their heads of state to 
discuss the problem, the ITAR-TASS said. 
  South Korea has refrained from supporting Moscow's idea of 
holding an international conference on the nuclear problem on 
the Korean peninsula with the participation of all the countries 
concerned, the news agency said.

<F P=106> [By Doreen Cheung in Beijing and S.Y. Yue] </F>
  [Text] Both the Hong Kong and Chinese governments moved 
yesterday to begin implementing measures to cool property 
speculation and bring flat prices back to affordable levels. 
  A top Chinese official revealed that Beijing intended to 
ensure that another huge slice of land would be made available 
this year for the construction of homes. 
  Chinese delegates on the joint Land Commission were yet to 
reply to this year's land programme submitted by Britain earlier 
this year. 
  The supply of land has been singled out as the most 
important 
measure capable of taking the heat out of the property market, 
which has seen speculators push home prices far beyond 
affordable levels. 
  A deputy director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, Chen Ziying, indicated no less than 100 hectares 
would be approved this year. 
  The Hong Kong Government, which has also pledged to release 
more new land for development, yesterday suggested that measures 
might be taken to speed up the construction of flats on existing 
sites re- zoned for residential use. 
  It warned that construction firms might be forced to finish 
re- development projects within three years if evidence of 
hoarding were discovered. 
  The Acting Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands, 
Canice Mak Chunfong, said the three-year requirement at present 
applied only to new land. 
  "If we find developers are holding up land after approval is 
given to change its use and to redevelop the area, we will 
extend the building covenants which require construction to be 
completed within three years," he said. 
  Moreover, if the developer of a redevelopment project wanted 
to sell flats before construction was completed, he might be 
subject to the same restrictions as developers of new land. 
  "Through a consent scheme, the Government can make sure the 
pre- sold flats are completed according to schedule. This will 
reduce room for speculation by such means as holding up the 
construction of a certain number of flats to inflate prices," Mr 
Mak said. 
  More than 130 hectares of land, 60 per cent of the land 
supply last year, came from re-development. 
  If China approves at least 100 hectares of new land, the 
supply for the year would be more than double the 50 hectare 
limit stipulated in Annexe Three of the Joint Declaration. 
  And it would be the third consecutive year that Beijing has 
agreed that the land grant should substantially exceed the limit. 
  The land grants for 1992/93 and 1993/94 were 159.3 hectares 
and 127.8 hectares respectively. 
  All new land must be approved by the Land Commission and 
half 
the money goes to the Land Fund, which is for the use of the 
Special Administrative Region government after 1997. 
  Mr Chen called on the Hong Kong Government to cool the 
heated 
property market and inflation. 
  "Not long ago, Governor Chris Patten said he would act to 
suppress the prices of consumer goods and property. We look 
forward to the practical and viable proposals he is going to 
make," he said. 
  It would take some time for the Chinese delegates on the 
Land 
Commission to study the British proposals, which carried 
detailed information on individual sites, said team leader Chen 
Rongchun. 
  Despite the fact that the land body would normally meet in 
March, the Chinese chief told the PWC [Preliminary Working 
Committee] that last year's session was held in May. 
  Leader of the Chinese Land Commission team, Mr Chen 
Rongchun, 
attributed spiralling property prices to the economic boom in 
Hong Kong and southern China, according to a Preliminary Working 
Committee (PWC) economic sub-group member, Tam Yiu-chung. 
  He did not refer to hoarding of completed flats by 
developers 
or to speculation by China-funded companies, Mr Tam said. 
  The director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, Lu Ping, has criticised China-funded 
enterprises' speculation in Hong Kong's property market. 
  Mr Tam quoted Mr Chen Rongchun as saying it was estimated 
that China-funded enterprises' market share in property 
transactions had been six percent. 
  Mr Mak said the Government was surveying large housing 
projects completed in recent years to find out the vacancy rate 
and the length of time of vacancy. 
  "We think many vacant flats are in the hands of speculators 
rather than developers. This is mainly due to the economic 
factor -- that many people want to put their money into property 
as it is a good investment. 
  "Whatever measures we take, we will be very careful to 
balance individual rights to own property and the public concern 
on flat hoarding," Mr Mak said. 
  He said the Government would, in two months, come up with a 
package of comprehensive measures to bring down property prices.

  [Text] Hong Kong could face an exodus if things go badly 
after China recovers the territory in 1997, and many people 
would probably go to North America or Australia, a survey 
published yesterday indicates. 
  The opinion poll by the Hong Kong Transitions Project, a 
private academic research group, also found that Hong Kong 
people wanting independence or to remain under British influence 
outnumbered those wanting the territory to revert to China. 
  China has promised to keep Hong Kong autonomous for at least 
50 years after 1997. But the poll, conducted early this year, 
shows that many doubt that the territory could survive the 
transition to Chinese sovereignty unscathed. 
  Forty-six percent of the respondents said they would try to 
leave if Hong Kong changed for the worse after China took over, 
and some 50 per cent had relatives abroad, mostly in the United 
States, Canada and Australia. 
  "If events were to turn bad in Hong Kong after 1997, it is 
likely that not only would millions seek to flee, other millions 
abroad would open their arms to receive them," the poll report 
said. 
  But the poll also found that the number who said they would 
stay no matter what happened after 1997 climbed to 43 percent 
from 38 percent in a similar poll a year ago. 
  More than 50 percent expressed concern over personal 
freedoms 
and politics after China takes over and 10 percent said they 
were very worried, the poll said. 
  "Generally, those who are less worried are less educated, 
women, older persons and those born in China," it said. 
  Forty-nine percent wanted Hong Kong to have independence, 
remain British or become part of the Commonwealth. 
  But the number who support the Chinese takeover climbed to 
44 
percent from 26 percent questioned in 1991. Seven percent 
didn't know. 
  The poll also said the Sino-British row over politics would 
dampen voter turnout in the 1995 elections, Hong Kong's last 
year under British rule. 
  The telephone poll of 636 people, conducted in January and 
February, had a margin of error of four percent.

<F P=106> [Article by Zheng Yan (6774 6056): "Where Is the British </F>
Side's sincerity in Holding the Talks?--Commenting on the White 
Paper 'Representative Government in Hong Kong'"] 
  [Text] After the British side published its white paper 
"Representative Government in Hong Kong" (hereinafter "White 
Paper"), the Chinese Foreign Ministry made public the truth of 
several major issues discussed by the two sides in the 
Sino-British talks on the 1994-95 election arrangements in Hong 
Kong (hereinafter the "truth"). The "truth" hit home by 
pointing out that the British side had no sincerity for the 
talks and deliberately sabotaged them. Then, the British side 
could do nought but defend itself once again, saying that "the 
Chinese side often blamed the British for having no sincerity 
for reaching agreement on the political structure but that this 
was absolutely not true in reality." 
  What, then, are the real facts? 
<H5>  The British Side Damaged the Foundation for the Sino-British </H5>
Talks 
  On 13 April last year, China and Britain eventually decided 
to hold the talks for which the Hong Kong people had ardently 
hoped. That day, the Chinese and British Governments jointly 
announced their decision as follows: "According to a decision 
made by the Chinese and British sides after discussion, the 
representatives of the two governments will begin talks on 22 
April 1993 in Beijing on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in 
Hong Kong according to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the 
principle of converging with the Basic Law, and the relevant 
agreements and understandings already reached by the two sides." 
In short, the foundation for the Sino- British talks was the 
abovementioned three principles. However, the 17th paragraph of 
the "White Paper" flatly denied that agreements and 
understandings had been directly reached by the Chinese and 
British foreign ministers in early 1990 on the 1995 electoral 
arrangements in Hong Kong, saying that "there was no agreement 
on electoral arrangements for 1995 and the issue has been left 
open for future discussion." This was a brazen negation of 
historical facts. 
  As a matter of fact, in early 1990, the work of drafting the 
Basic Law entered its final stage and the Drafting Committee 
would soon make its final decision on the political structure of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR]. Although the 
drafting of the Basic Law was China's internal affair, so that 
things would be more favorable to Hong Kong's smooth transition 
and to the smooth transfer of government, and also because 
British Foreign Secretary Hurd had expressed his hope that "an 
understanding can be reached on the development of the political 
structure before and after 1997," the Chinese side still 
discussed with the British side by exchanging correspondence 
(written messages) between the foreign ministers of the two 
countries. The subjects under discussion included the number of 
seats in the council, the composition of the Election Committee, 
the voting procedures in the legislature, and the nationality 
requirements for members of the Legislative Council [Legco]. 
The seven diplomatic documents which have been made public 
clearly show the discussion process between the two sides and 
the agreements and understandings which were reached. 
  For example, regarding the number of directly-elected seats, 
the British held that the number of directly-elected seats in 
the 1991 Legco should be not less than 18, requiring that there 
should be 24 directly-elected seats in the first SAR Legco in 
1997. According to the consensus reached by the Basic Law 
Drafting Committee, the Chinese side held that there should be 
20 directly-elected seats in the 1997 Legco; 24 in 1999; and 30 
in 2003. At the same time, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said in 
his letter to Foreign Secretary Hurd: "In order to realize the 
convergence of the political structure before and after 1997 and 
ensure the smooth transfer of government, the Chinese side is 
willing to consider the British side's idea of increasing the 
number of directly-elected seats from 15 to 18 in 1991." On 12 
February, Foreign Secretary Hurd sent a letter to Foreign 
Minister Qian, the third paragraph of which reads: "I am now 
ready to confirm an understanding with the Chinese Government as 
follows. If the final version of the Basic Law specifies 20 
directly-elected seats in the SAR legislature in 1997, 24 in 
1999, and 30 in 2003, then the British Government is ready to 
limit the number of directly-elected seats in the 1991 direct 
elections to 18." The final version of the Basic Law specifies 
the numbers of directly-elected seats of the Legco from 1997 to 
2003 according to the consensus of the Basic Law Drafting 
Committee and the abovementioned understanding between the 
Chinese and British sides. 
  The "White Paper" admitted only that the 18 directly-elected 
seats in 1991 were arranged according to the "common view" of 
the Chinese and British sides. We must then ask the British 
side: Did the number of 18 directly-elected seats just drop 
from the sky? Mr Hurd, Britain's foreign and commonwealth 
secretary, used explicit words in expressing the understanding. 
The British side agreed to set 18 directly-elected seats in 
1991 precisely under the precondition that there would be 20 
such seats in 1997, 24 in 1999, and 30 in 2003. The four 
figures in the agreement reached by the Chinese and British 
sides were inseparably linked together with the concrete process 
of democracy in Hong Kong. Otherwise, the "18 seats" would 
become a mysterious number that could not be understood. 
  Why did the British side only acknowledge that the 18 
directly elected seats in 1991 represented the "common view" of 
the Chinese and British sides? People should not think that the 
British side still had a fragmentary memory of the agreements 
and understandings reached between China and Britain. No, that 
is not true. For the British side, it would be the best thing 
if this was also negated. However, if they really did this, it 
would be hard for them to explain the introduction of 18 
directly-elected seats to the 1991 Legco election. This was the 
painful and embarrassing reason why the British side had to 
admit that the 18 seats represented a "common view" of the 
Chinese and British sides. 
  In the talks, the British side was also faced with a 
question 
it had to answer. How many direstly-elected seats should there 
be in the 1995 Legco? According to the agreement reached by the 
foreign ministers of the two countries in early 1990, there will 
be 20 seats in 1997; so it is logical that there should also be 
20 seats in 1995. The British side refused to admit this simple 
fact until the third round of the talks and only then very 
reluctantly. 
  As another example, the issue regarding the composition of 
the Election Committee was discussed repeatedly. The letter of 
reply sent by the Chinese side on 8 February 1990 explicitly 
said: "The components and proportions must be arranged 
according to the second point of the Basic Law's Annex I because 
Annex I was passed by the Drafting Committee Eighth Plenary 
Session by a two-thirds majority." On 12 February, the written 
message from Foreign Secretary Hurd to Foreign Minister Qian 
affirmed: "I agree in principle with the arrangements for 
setting up the Election Committee as you propose. The Election 
Committee may be set up in 1995 and the details of such 
arrangements can be discussed by both sides in due course." In 
the covering letter accompanying the abovementioned message, the 
British side explicitly indicated that no obstacles existed to 
both sides' cooperation on the issue of the Election Committee 
and also expressed gratitude for the Chinese side's efforts in 
this regard. 
  Things were written clearly in black and white and were 
absolutely not so vague as the "White Paper" said in that "the 
electoral arrangements were left open for future discussion." 
  In the talks, the British side continually insisted that the 
Chinese and British sides had not reached any agreement on the 
composition of the Election Committee; it also indicated that 
the British side was willing to consider the concrete 
arrangements proposed by the Chinese side according to the terms 
specified by the Basic Law Annex I. That is to say, in the 1993 
talks, the British side refused to implement the agreement and 
understanding reached by the two sides in early 1990 on the 
composition of the Election Committee and would only give 
consideration to the package as a concrete program proposed 
unilaterally by the Chinese side. Such tricks by the British 
side have rarely been seen in the history of world diplomacy. 
  The British side's denial of the fact that the Chinese and 
British sides had reached agreements and understandings on the 
arrangements for the 1995 Legco elections directly shook the 
foundation for the talks, making it impossible for them to move 
along a correct course. This also fully showed that the British 
side was hyprocritical when agreeing to the "common foundation" 
for the talks. If they refused to even acknowledge the existing 
agreements and understandings on the concrete arrangements for 
the 1995 elections, how could they have any sincerity? Here, we 
must ask the British side: As you agreed that the talks be held 
on the basis of the three principles, to what specific things do 
the "relevant agreements and understandings reached by China and 
Britain" refer? 
<H5>  Deliberately Complicating Things Shortly After the Beginning </H5>
of the Talks 
  As their name indicated, the "Sino-British Talks on the 1994 
and 1995 Electoral Arrangements in Hong Kong" were aimed at 
ensuring the convergence of the electoral arrangements for the 
last Legco, the two municipal councils, and the district boards 
under the British Hong Kong authorities with the Basic Law and 
the relevant stipulations made by the National People's Congress 
[NPC] so that members of the three-tiered councils could remain 
there after 30 June 1997, thus making things more favorable to 
Hong Kong's smooth transition and the smooth transfer of 
government. Therefore, the subject of the talks was clear and 
definite. 
  However, the British side deliberately complicated things in 
the first round by raising three subjects beyond the scope of 
the talks for discussion with the Chinese side. They demanded 
that consultation be held on the Hong Kong members of the Hong 
Kong SAR Preparatory Committee; that the Chines Government 
guarantee its support for the election of all members of the 
Legco by universal suffrage in 2007; and that the Chinese side 
be ready to use the same model of the 1995 Election Committee to 
form the selection committee for the first SAR chief executive 
in 1997 and the election committees for other chief executives 
after 1997. 
  The issue of Sino-British consultation about the Hong Kong 
members of the SAR Preparatory Committee. The decision made by 
the Seventh NPC at its third session in April 1990 already 
specified the composition of the preparatory committee and that 
all its members will be appointed by the NPC Standing Committee. 
This is a matter within China's sovereign power and is not open 
to Sino-British consultation. 
  The issue of electing all Legco members by universal 
suffrage 
in 2007. This matter will arise 10 years after the 
establishment of the SAR and will be decided by the SAR on its 
own. This point has also been explicitly specified by Annex II 
of the Basic Law. The Basic Law is the fundamental law of the 
Hong Kong SAR and Hong Kong affairs after 1997 will also be 
handled on the basis of, and in accordance with, the Basic Law. 
The issue of whether or not there should be Chinese Government 
support does not exist. 
  The issue of taking the 1995 Election Committee as the 
model. 
The form of composition and the method of forming the selection 
committee for the first SAR chief executive and the election 
committees for later chief executives have all been specified by 
the NPC decision and the Basic Law annexes. The British side 
have no right to propose any unified model. 
  The British side's intention in raising such questions was 
obvious. In the tactical aspect, the British tried to set 
artificial obstacles to the talks, stalling for time so that the 
talks would not be able to achieve any result before the 
deadline set by the British side beforehand. Thus, it would be 
able to find a pretext for terminating the talks. With regard 
to the aim of the talks, the British side not only tried to seek 
an electoral arrangement favorable to itself but also tried to 
gain more by interfering in affairs within the autonomous 
jurisdiction of the future SAR. Does this show any sincerity 
from the British side? 
<H5>  How Did the Sino-British Talks Break Down? </H5>
  Here, I would like to outline the rough course of the 
breakdown of the Sino-British talks according to what I know. 
  In order to break the deadlocked situation in the talks and 
to achieve positive results as soon as possible, the Chinese 
side proposed that the talks on the 1994 1995 electoral 
arrangements in Hong Kong be carried out in two phases. The 
electoral arrangements for the district boards and the two 
municipal councils, which should be easier to handle and were 
also more pressing, were to be discussed first and settled. The 
talks could then concentrate on the more complicated 
arrangements for the Legco elections. The Chinese side then 
took the initiative and proposed a five-point verbal 
understanding during the 15th round on 28 October 1993. This 
proposal was as follows: 
  1. The British side promises to keep their nature as organs 
without political power and functions of the district boards and 
the two municipal councils unchanged so that they will converge 
with the relevant provisions of the Hong Kong SAR Basic Law. 
  2. The British side agrees to abolish the relevant 
provisions of the regulations on the elections for the district 
boards, the two municipal councils, and the Legco which prevent 
deputies to the people's congresses at various levels in the PRC 
from being elected. While revising the relevant electoral 
regulations, the British side will continue to maintain the 
provision prohibiting members of the national assemblies or 
councils in other countries and regions, and salary-earning 
officials from other countries and regions, from entering Hong 
Kong's Legco, district boards, and the two municipal councils. 
  3. Both sides agree to lower the voting age from 21 to 18. 
  4. The Chinese side has no objection to the British side's 
adoption of a "single-seat, single-vote system" for the district 
board and municipal council elections. 
  5. The British side believes that appointed seats in the 
district boards and in the two municipal councils should be 
removed from the 1994 and 1995 elections. The Chinese side 
holds that an appropriate percentage of appointed seats be 
maintained in the 1994 and 1995 district board and municipal 
council elections; the number of appointed seats in the district 
boards and the two municipal councils will be decided by the 
Hong Kong SAR Government on its own according to Article 98 of 
the Basic Law, after 30 June 1997. 
  On 3 November, through diplomatic channels, the British side 
handed over its draft of the Memorandum of Understanding 
according to the abovementioned five-point verbal proposal with 
an explanation which stated: The copy drafted by the British 
side only made an essential change to one point in the 
five-point proposal put forward by the Chinese side. That is, 
the "single-seat, single-vote" system will be applicable to the 
elections of the district board, the municipal councils, and 
also the Legco. Apart from that, the British side accepted the 
entire contents of the Chinese side's proposal. 
  As for the fifth point, the formula drafted by the British 
side was worded as follows: 
  5. The British side propose that the system of appointed 
membership of district boards and municipal councils should be 
abolished with effect from September 1994 and March 1995 
respectively. The Chinese side have proposed that a certain 
proportion of the membership of these bodies should remain 
appointed, pointing out that on or after 1 July 1997 the Hong 
Kong SAR authorities, in accordance with Article 98 of the Basic 
Law, will determine on their own what the number of appointed 
members of district boards and municipal councils should be. 
  The above quotation showed that the British side had 
already accepted the solution proposed by the Chinese sideand 
this is evidenced by both the British side's expression and the 
specific wording of the copy it delivered to the Chinese side. 
Thus, it is expected that results might be achieved in the 
"separate" settlement of the electoral arrangements after the 
Chinese side's tremendous efforts for the proper settlement of 
the difficult issue concerning the appointment system. At this 
moment, however, the British side once again created new trouble 
by demanding that the voting method for the 1995 Legco elections 
also be written into the fourth point of the understanding. 
This abruptly sharpened and complicated the matter at issue. 
  On 5 November, through diplomatic channels, the Chinese side 
made its initial response to the copy delivered by the British 
side on 3 November and indicated that an official reply would be 
made some time later. The Chinese side indicated: It is 
"improper" to extend the "single-seat, single-vote" electoral 
method to the geographical direct elections for Legco as the 
British draft suggested. The voting pattern for the Legco 
direct elections should be further discussed and separately 
arranged when the two sides concentrate the talks on the Legco 
electoral arrangements. 
  The British side expressed disagreement, and stressed that 
the first-stage agreement must include the voting method of 
"single- seat, single vote" for the geographical direct 
elections for Legco. It indicated that this was a point of 
"substance" for the British side. Otherwise, it would not be a 
"balanced" agreement for the British side and would not be 
"attractive." 
  In order to strive for an agreement and to solve the 
so-called "balance" issue about which the British side was 
concerned, the Chinese side made renewed efforts on the second 
day of the 17th round, proposing that the five-point 
understanding between the two sides might exclude the Legco 
electoral arrangements. The Chinese side then handed over two 
versions of the draft understanding for the British side to 
select from. After considering them, the British side said 
privately that it could not accept any understanding excluding 
the voting method for the Legco elections. Then, it flatly 
rejected the drafts handed over by the Chinese side. In the 
following plenary meeting, the negotiating representative of the 
British Government read a prepared statement, saying that: "From 
the instructions I have received, I am not authorized to 
continue the discussion on the first-stage understanding." 
Thus, the British side first departed from the negotiating 
table; at the same time, they continued to hypocritically 
express their willingness to hold the 18th round of the talks on 
more extensive and more complicated arrangements for the Legco 
elections. After that, the British side took a series of 
unilateral actions to finally and tightly close the door on the 
talks. 
  In order to shirk responsibility for damaging the talks, the 
British side later even talked a lot about the omission of the 
words "on its own" by the Chinese side from its draft in the 
17th round of the talks. Paragraph 42 of the "White Paper" 
says: The omission of the words "on its own" after the 
reference to the Hong Kong SAR Government "did not mean that the 
SAR Government would in future determine on its own whether or 
not to retain or abolish appointed seats; that decision would be 
for 'the Chinese side.'" This was an out-and-out distortion! 
The Chinese side omitted the words "on its own" in order to 
make the version more concise. Despite the omission, the action 
will still be made by the SAR Government, and the meaning of the 
sentence has not changed at all. As a matter of fact, when the 
Chinese side handed over the draft with the omission of the 
words "on its own," the British side did not discuss anything 
with the Chinese side. If in the course of discussion, the 
British side had demanded that the words "on its own" be written 
back into the text, it is believed that it would not have been 
hard for the Chinese side to accept this. However, as the 
British side had made up its mind to terminate the talks, it had 
no interest in further discussing anything with the Chinese 
side. The misleading interpretation of the omission of the 
words "on its own" by the Chinese side in the "White Paper" was 
merely a pretext that the British side later found for shirking 
its responsibility for undermining the talks. 
  "Whether going up to the heavens or going down to the 
netherworld, nothing can be seen at all." [ancient Chinese 
verse quoted from unknown source] Where was the sincerity the 
British side advocated repeatedly? 
  All the facts are plain: The British side stubbornly stuck 
to the package dished out by Chris Patten and had no sincerity 
at all from beginning to end; still less did it want to reach 
any agreement. In the talks, the British side employed the 
following tactics: Damaging the foundation for the talks by 
means of generally affirming and concretely negating the 
principles; trying to rediscuss agreements and understandings 
which the two sides had already reached; imposing subjects 
irrelevant to the theme of the talks, thus causing trouble for 
the Chinese side and stalling for time. At the same time, the 
British Hong Kong authorities put into practice a number of 
electoral affairs which should be discussed by the two sides, 
thus disrupting the talks. When the talks were delayed to the 
deadline set by the British side, it continued to find new 
pretexts to terminate the talks. They then proposed talks on 
more complicated issues in order to shirk responsibility for 
damaging the talks. It then brought the Patten package to the 
Legco "piece by piece" according to its established plan. This 
was the course traversed by the British side in the 17 rounds of 
the talks over seven months.

<F P=106> [By Shi Da (2514 6671): "What Kind of Stuff Is the British </F>
Side's So-called `Being Fair and Open?'--Also Commenting on the 
White Paper on 'Representative Government in Hong Kong'"] 
  [Text] Not long ago, without consulting its Chinese 
counterpart, the British side published a "White Paper" entitled 
"Representative Government in Hong Kong" and unilaterally made 
public its carefully drawn up contents of the talks. If one 
reads the "White Paper," one immediately finds that the whole 
thing is wrappe in a beautiful and ear-pleasing phrase--"being 
fair and open." Why does the British side have such a 
partiality for the phrase? What actually are they all about? 
Is their election proposal as "fair and open" as they have 
trumpeted? These are questions this article intends to answer. 
  First of all, let us have a look at the statements in the 
"White Paper" on several important issues relating to elections. 
  On the election of functional constituencies, completely 
ignoring the understandings which China and Britain had reached 
and the Basic Law's clear stipulation that the election of 
functional constituencies will be by indirect elections, the 
"White Paper" states: "The British Government and the Hong Kong 
Government maintain that the functional constituency system must 
meet the conditions of being fair and open" and "as far as the 
newly added nine functional constituencies are concerned, the 
governor suggested that the simplest and most fair way was to 
let them embrace all the working population. On this basis, the 
governor suggested setting up nine additional functional 
constituencies by continuing to adopt the existing method of 
determining trades and professions." It was precisely under the 
pretense of the so-called "being fair and open" that the British 
side violated its original intention to design functional 
constituency elections and set up nine new functional 
constituencies on the basis of trades and professions, thus 
expanding the electorate of functional constituencies from under 
100,000 to 2.7 million people overnight. At the same time, the 
British side changed the corporate voting into individual 
voting. In this way, functional constituency elections have 
become direct elections based on trades and professions in a 
certain form. Although during the process of talks the British 
side made some revisions on its proposal, it still stuck to its 
own basic stand. In this regard, the "White Paper" explains: 
The revised British side's proposal "accords with the minimum 
requirements of fair and open functional constituencies." 
  On the formation of the election committee issue, China and 
Britain concluded an agreement as long ago as early-1990, 
namely, the election committee will be formed in accordance with 
the number of members from various sectors and ratio as 
stipulated by Annex I, Article 2 of the Basic Law. However, in 
its "White Paper," the British side flatly denied it, arguing 
that both sides "have not reached any agreement" and attacking 
the Chinese proposal to form the election committee in 
accordance with the formula prescribed in the Annex I, Article 2 
of the Basic Law as "not meeting the necessary requirements and 
therefore cannot provide a fair and open election method." The 
"White Paper" says: "The election committee itself should be 
composed of the people who are elected in Hong Kong in an open 
and fair way." It was precisely according to this logic that 
the British side suggested that the election committee "be 
composed entirely or partially of directly elected district 
members." During the talks, through patient reasoning from the 
Chinese side, the British side agreed to act according to the 
relevant stipulations of Annex I, Article 2 of the Basic Law 
concerning the number of members from the first three sectors 
and the ratio of the election committee but persisted in 
replacing the people from the fourth sector prescribed in Annex 
I, Article 2 of the Basic Law with the representatives of 
regional organizations. One of its reasons was that the Hong 
Kong deputies to the National People's Congress and Hong Kong 
members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference in this portion of people "are 
not elected in Hong Kong in an open and fair way." 
  On the issue of voting method to be used in direct elections 
for the district boards, the "White Paper" terms the 
single-seat, single- vote system which the British side 
persisted in adopting as an important content of "fair and open" 
elections and attacked the multiple-seat, single-vote system 
which was proposed by the Chinese side as "unable to provide a 
fair and open system." 
  On the election of district boards and two municipal 
councils, the "White Paper" says: "In October 1992 the governor 
proposed that all members of district boards and municipal 
councils be directly elected" and the "governor's proposal 
completely accords with open and fair elections." 
  From what we have cited above we can clearly see that the 
trick practiced by the British side in its "White Paper" is to 
replace and make a figurehead the three principles on which 
China and Britain had decided through consultations to conduct 
their talks, including the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the 
principle of convergence with the Basic Law, and the agreements 
and understandings which China and Britain had agreed, to use 
the argument of "being fair and open," an out-and-out subjective 
thing, as a yardstick with which to weigh things and judge right 
and wrong. In this way, the British side will be able to act as 
it wishes--all proposals which are put forward by the British 
side are "fair and open" and all proposals which it opposes are 
not "fair and open," thus achieving the objective of Chris 
Patten's "three violations" political reform package. This is 
the real reason the British side has such a partiality for, and 
has preached endlessly about, the argument of "being fair and 
open." 
  Is the election proposal put forward by the British side 
actually in complete conformity with the alleged standard of 
"being fair and open?" Let the facts speak for themselves. 
  On the election of functional constituencies. Of the nine 
new functional constituencies, four include employees who are 
trade union members. They are the public utility and 
telecommunications constituency, the recreation and service 
trade constituency, the land, construction engineering, housing, 
and building industry constituency, and the fishery, 
agriculture, mining, and manufacturing constituency. 
  The British side separated this small number of employees 
from Hong Kong's 850,000 working population and adopted a 
different voting method from the two labor seats in the existing 
21 seats (the British proposal is to expand from the original 
labor community's voting method of one trade union, one vote 
into one trade union secretary, one vote and adopt a one-person, 
one-vote method among the nine new constituencies). This method 
is both unfair and unreasonable. Moreover, In certain 
constituencies, the British side lumped together employees in a 
certain trade and employers or professionals in the trade. 
Whose interests do council members elected this way actually 
represent? This way of doing things adopted by the British side 
can hardly be said to be fair. Moreover, considering that Hong 
Kong's current commercial community is composed of three 
aspects: Foreign capital, foreign nationals of Chinese origin 
in Hong Kong, and China-funded enterprises. The first two 
capitals have their representatives in Legco and only 
China-funded enterprises do not have any representative in the 
ocuncil, the Chinese side suggested nominating the "Association 
of Chinese-Funded Enterprises" as a functional constituency. 
However, the British side tried every possible means to reject 
the proposal, adopting a discriminatory attitude toward 
China-funded enterprises. Can this be justified as being fair? 
Moreover, in its "White Paper," the British side says: "The 
Chinese side wants to adopt electoral arrangements with more 
restrictions and a much smaller number of voters. Of the 
functional constituencies they suggested, the smallest 
constituency has just under 100 voters. Under this arrangement, 
elections can possibly be manipulated." However, in fact, among 
the existing functional constituencies in the Legco, the number 
of voters of two functional constituencies is much smaller than 
that of the functional constituency suggested by the Chinese 
side. Moreover, it was precisely one of the two functional 
constituencies that was manipulated in the 1991 elections. 
Instead of examining its own conscience, the British side made 
such an accusation against China. This way of doing things is 
too far away from being fair. 
  On the election of the election committee. The British 
proposal was that the election committee would be composed of 
346 district board members who were directly elected. This 
means that the 346 members would elect 10 Legco members. In 
this wau, so long as 35 district board members join hands, they 
will be able to elect a Legco member. In fact, for one to 
become a Legco member, it will be not an especially difficult 
job for him or her to find a way to garner the support of 35 
district board members. The British side attacked the Chinese 
proposal saying that "the scope of voters is so small that it 
will possibly lead to corrupt and fraudulent practices." Is 
this precisely not its own portrayal? This British so-called 
"fair and open" proposal is really too bad to be complimented. 
  On the voting method of direct elections based on districts. 
In the "White Paper," the British side termed its own 
single-seat, single-vote system as an important content of "fair 
and open" elections and attacked the Chinese proposal of 
multiple seat, single vote because "it cannot provide a fair and 
open system." This British argument completely does not hold 
water. A single-seat, single-vote system is a majority voting 
system. But it has a shortcoming, namely, the emergence of "an 
excessive gain in seats" or "an excessive loss of seats." As 
society develops, many people maintain that this method is 
unfair and it is a violation of democratic principles and a 
proportional representation system has thus been designed. The 
multiple-seat, single-vote system is the mixture of the majority 
voting system and the proportional representation system. From 
the viewpoint of the development of voting systems, the 
multiple-seat, single-vote system must be said to be more fair 
than the single-seat, single-vote system. In fact, all voting 
systems have their own strong and weak points. It is hard to 
say which one is more fair and reasonable than the other. Hong 
Kong must proceed from its own realities in adopting its voting 
methods. 
  On the issue of appointed seats in district boards and 
municipal councils. Chairmen and members of the Hong Kong 
District Boards and the two municipal councils universally 
opposed the elimination of appointed membership. Ignoring their 
demands, the British side acted willfully and persisted in 
eliminating appointed membership. With this practice, it is out 
of the question for the British side to speak about "being fair 
and open." Moreover, the practice runs counter to the remark 
the British side has repeatedly uttered in its "White Paper" 
that "we abide by the will of the Hong Kong people." 
  In the "White Paper," to shirk the responsibility for 
breaking the talks, the British side tried every means to 
conceal the real situation in the talks. Not only did they 
wantonly distort and attack the Chinese side's position but also 
deliberately cut out many important details detrimental to 
itself. At the same time, it created various false impressions 
to cheat good and honest people. Sham is sham and the mask must 
be stripped off. The British side has repeatedly talked glibly 
about "being fair and open" but the more it tries to cover up 
its real intentions, the more exposed it becomes.

  [Text] Belgrade, March 26 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Croats and 
Muslims have taken new steps toward federation as the Bosnian 
Croat parliament approved the plan, and military leaders from 
both sides agreed to set up a joint army command Saturday [26 
March]. 
  In Mostar, south-western Bosnia, lawmakers of the 
self-declared (Croatian) republic of Herzeg-Bosnia voted almost 
unanimously for the new federation plan signed in Washington 
last week. 
  The Muslim-dominated Bosnian parliament is also due to meet 
on Monday in Sarajevo to debate the plan, crafted by U.S. and 
Russian mediators and signed by Bosnian President Alija 
Izetbegovic, Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zubak, and Croatian 
President Franjo Tudjman. 
  Earlier today, the commander of the Muslim-led government 
army, General Rasim Delic, and the chief of Bosnian Croat 
forces, General Ante Roso, signed an accord in Sarajevo on a 
joint army command, the first practical step toward forming the 
new federation. 
  The military leaders agreed that the joint army command 
should operate until the formation of a new federal army, after 
a new federal constitution has been passed. 
  The agreement on the new federation would mean the end of 
Herzeg-Bosnia as an independent entity. The Serbs, however, who 
control nearly 70 percent of Bosnia, have rejected any 
participation in the new union, ignoring appeals from Washington 
and Moscow. 
  Delic told reporters after signing the military accord that 
he had held "cordial and constructive" talks with his Croatian 
counterpart. But he failed to give more details. 
  Roso also spoke highly of the accord, saying that it has 
created the necessary conditions for Croats and Muslims to live 
together in peace.

  [Text] Beijing, March 31 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Vice-President Rong Yiren held warm and friendly talks with 
visiting Foreign Minister of the Republic of Angola Venacio da 
Silva Moura here this morning. 
  Rong said that China has been watching closely and 
supporting 
the peace process in Angola, and appreciates efforts towards 
peace the Angolan Government has made under the leadership of 
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. 
  He said that China is glad to see the positive progress in 
the peace talks between the Angolan Government and the National 
Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) which resumed 
last November. 
  China sincerely hopes that Angola would realize peace at an 
early date so as to create conditions for the nation's 
reconstruction and economic development. This does not only 
conform to the fundamental interests of the nation and its 
people but also is conducive to stability and development of the 
South African region, he said. 
  Rong said that China attaches great importance to its 
friendship with Angola and is willing to consolidate and further 
the bilateral cooperation and friendship in various fields. 
  Moura said that the friendship between the Angolan and 
Chinese peoples has a long history, and bilateral relations have 
experienced smooth growth since the two countries established 
diplomatic ties. 
  Moura said that the leaders of Angola pay much attention to 
strengthening friendship and cooperation with China. He 
expressed his gratitude to China for supporting Angola's peace 
process.

draw from China's experience. Both Benin and China are 
peace-loving countries, he added; therefore, the friendly 
cooperative relations between them will be further strengthened.

greater role in safeguarding peace in Asia and in the world as 
well.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Qiu Qi: "S. Africa Opens First China </F>
Fair"] 
  [Text] South Africa's first commodity fair in China opened 
yesterday in Beijing, marking a further step by the growing 
African nation into the mainland market. 
  More than 300 South African business representatives are 
attending the four-day event. 
  "The exhibition is a landmark of the strengthened relations 
between the two countries," said David Graaff, South Africa's 
deputy-minister of industry and trade. 
  Companies at the South Africa China Exhibition 1994 come 
from 
31 industries including South Africa's strongest sectors such as 
mining equipment, electronics and jewellery. 
  Many South African big name companies such as Sasol, Iscor 
Mining &amp; Steel Production, Saflec Electronics and Nampak are 
seeking shares in China's flourishing industrial and commercial 
market. 
  Graaff said he believes the exhibition "will make an 
important contribution to bilateral trade relations by 
stimulating more joint ventures, flow of investment and tourism." 
  Since the normalization of bilateral relations in 1992, 
sound 
trade ties have been achieved, he said. 
  Since then, bilateral trade volume has risen more than 30 
percent to reach $658 million last year. 
  If trade through Hong Kong is included, the figure surpasses 
$1 billion. 
  "China is one of the world's fastest-growing economies and 
we 
always take her as an important trading partner," said the 
deputy-minister. 
  He added that South Africa will continue to enjoy ties with 
China for years to come. 
  After years of isolation on the world market, South Africa 
has become a strong economic power. 
  Fifty-five percent of the nation's gross national product 
comes from international trade, 30 percent of which is generated 
by exports. 
  China mainly imports minerals and exports light industry 
products to the South African nation. 
  Besides being rich in mineral resources, South Africa also 
produces construction equipment.

  [Text] Helsinki, March 31 (XINHUA) -- Finnish Prime 
Minister Esko Aho said here today that Finland and China have 
maintained very good and extensive friendly relations and that 
finland is ready to further promote such ties with China in 
various fields. 
  "Finland was among the first countries to establish 
diplomatic relations with China (in 1950), and since then 
bilateral relations have been stable and have stood the test of 
difficult times," Aho said in a written statement released to 
XINHUA. 
  Aho, who is to visit China on April 6-11 at the invitation 
of 
Chinese Premier Li Peng, said, "the forthcoming visit is 
designed to further strengthen the Sino-Finnish friendly 
relations." 
  He added that during the visit, he will hold talks with 
Chinese leaders and learn about the progress of China's economic 
reform, particularly its influence on China's foreign trade, and 
about Chinese views on vistas of development and cooperation in 
Asia. 
  The prime minister also said he will brief Chinese leaders 
on 
Finnish views on the situation in Europe. 
  On future development of Sino-Finnish ties, Aho noted that 
the two countries have broad prospects in furthering their 
relations and that trade between the two countries has been 
extended to all speedily developed fields of Finland. 
  "Although a small country, Finland is advanced in certain 
technologies and Finland is ready to share them with China," he 
said. 
  "Finland's forestry and forest industry are well-known in 
the 
world and other fields in which China is interested include the 
energy production and telecommunications," he noted. 
  "As a new field of bilateral cooperation, I want to stress 
in 
particular the significance of technology for environmental 
protection. As China is paying increasing attention to 
environmental protection, Finland can provide China with various 
technologies in this field," Aho specified. 
  Aho, 40, has been Finnish prime minister since April 1991.

<F P=106> [By special correspondent Ching Chi (5427 2765): "Fifty </F>
Percent of People Favor Using Demonstrations When Necessary"] 
  [Text] With the further development of reform and opening 
up in China in the past year, citizens are enjoying more and 
more political rights. People also have new ideas of how to 
participate in politics, such as holding assemblies and 
demonstrations. A survey shows that when asked about their 
attitude toward holding demonstrations, more than half of the 
interviewees said that they should be held if necessary. Thirty 
percent of the interviewees said that it is better not to adopt 
such means. Nearly 8 percent of the interviewees said under no 
circumstances should people take to the streets and hold 
demonstrations. 
  However, results of the survey show that when common Chinese 
people wanted to criticize the government for certain policies 
or practices, their first option was to "report their views to 
party and government departments concerned," and holding 
assemblies or demonstrations was their last option. 
  This research, directed by Zhang Mingshu, associate research 
fellow of politics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, is 
one of a series of surveys on national conditions organized 
since 1988 by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. More than 
2,000 people living in 13 large, medium-sized, and small cities 
were interviewed. The method of random sampling was used. Major 
results of the research are published in the new book entitled 
"`Political People' in China." 
  Zhang Mingshu made a further explanation about the survey, 
saying that some people regarded politics as a field in which 
morals, sincerity, and conscience were totally lost, but most 
Chinese citizens held that politics were not something bad. 
During the survey, the latter expressed that the government was 
an organ for the administration of public affairs of the people 
and they hoped that the government could do more for them. 
  Therefore, in their participation in politics, Chinese 
citizens always trusted and depended more on the governments and 
organizations concerned and showed relatively close cooperation 
with the ruling party and the government in the course of 
participation. Zhang Mingshu said that these features in 
selecting a means for the participation in politics of Chinese 
citizens were great "political resources" of the government. 
  When they wanted to express their views on government 
policies and behaviors, nearly 26 percent of the interviewees 
optioned to report their views to government departments 
concerned, 15 percent of them favored reporting their views to 
the leadership of the respective units, only 1.3 favored holding 
demonstrations, and only 1.8 percent favored holding rallies. 
Nevertheless, more than half of the interviewees held that 
holding rallies and demonstrations can be a means to be adopted 
when necessary. 
  Since 1954, all constitutions of China state that holding 
demonstrations is one of the basic political rights of the 
citizens. However, in 37 years from 1949 to 1986, basically no 
large-scale demonstration was held by citizens to criticize 
government policies in China. 
  After the survey, Zhang Mingshu put forward suggestions 
concerning policies. To the portion of citizens with a 
relatively high political quality, such as intellectuals, 
personalities of the democratic parties, young students, and so 
on, it is necessary to adopt flexible methods, to provide them 
with more opportunities to participate in politics, and to 
eliminate intermediate obstacles so that their views and 
suggestions can reach the ruling party and government through 
normal channels, the situation at the lower levels can be made 
known to the higher levels, and the democratic channels are 
unimpeded.

  [Text] Beijing, April 1 (AFP)--A cholera epidemic hit 
China last year, killing 142 people as the number of cases rose 
to the highest level in a decade, Health News [JIANKANG BAO] 
reported Friday. A total of 11,717 cases of cholera were 
reported in 12 of China's 30 provinces, the newspaper said, 
categorising the situation as an epidemic that began in about 
April and reached its high-point in September and October. 
  Two different strains were found, it said, describing their 
origins as "complicated." It did not specify whether either was 
the aggressive new 0139 strain of cholera, which has already 
killed thousands in India and Bangladesh. In August, China 
acknowledged that the mutant strain, which attacks people who 
would normally have immunity after having cholera, had killed at 
least two people in the far northwestern province of Xinjiang. 
  Health News said the low incidence of cholera in China for 
the past 10 years was partly to blame for the rapid spread of 
last year's epidemic because the population's immunity was low. 
Unhygienic food and water supplies in rural areas and inadequate 
grassroots health services had also contributed to the problem, 
the report said. 
  The ministry of health has ordered local authorities to 
emphasize prevention, particularly in areas where cholera has 
been a problem, it said. Special clinics should be set up and 
new cases reported to the ministry immediately, it added.

<F P=106> [Report on "exclusive" interview with Lu Xueyi (7120 1331 </F>
5669), National People's Congress deputy and noted sociologist, 
by reporters Zhang Hong (1728 4767) and Liu Hongtao (0491 3163 
3447); date, place not given] 
  [Text] Beijing, 22 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- In an 
exclusive interview with these reporters, Lu Xueyi, National 
People's Congress deputy and noted sociologist, pointed out: In 
the relationship among reform, development, and stability, it is 
stability that should be put in the first place. At present, 
special precautions should be taken against the trends of 
soaring prices, boasting and exaggeration, and corruption, as 
well as against the massive flood of migrant workers. 
  Lu said: Judging by the price increases in the first two 
months of this year, it will be very difficult to keep this 
year's price increase index below 10 percent. For this reason, 
it is absolutely necessary to keep down the scale of capital 
construction and the growth rate; we should not be impatient. 
Provided China can maintain an annual progressive growth rate 
of 9 percent, and even 7 percent in the future, its absolute 
economic strength will reach the world standard quickly. 
According to his analysis, the problem this year will focus on 
commodity prices. If the increase rate can be contained within 
a double-digit figure, there will not be big problem. It is 
only the peasants, the unemployed urban workers, and young 
people who have just joined the work force who will be hard up. 
  Lu pointed out: There is a very serious trend of boasting 
and exaggeration going on. He cast doubts on the credibility of 
some important statistical figures. He took up a list of last 
year's total industrial output indices from various localities, 
saying that, calculated in terms of comparable prices, the 
township industrial enterprises in 10 provinces registered a 
growth rate of 60 and even 100 percent. He said: How was this 
possible? China has come to grief on account of boasting and 
exaggeration. He said: If we are not clear about our rice 
output last year, there will be problems when we need rice, but 
it is unavailable. 
  Lu said: According to an anticorruption report by the 
procuratorate, some 110,000 cadres at or above the 
department-head level have economic or other problems. This 
represents a large proportion of in-service cadres at or above 
the department-head level in China. The public, however, does 
not know this proportion; There are a lot of complaints against 
the public security organs, procuratorial organs, and people's 
courts. If we fail to step up supervision over law enforcement, 
it will adversely affect social stability. 
  Lu said: Now people have eventually come to realize that 
civilian workers play an irreplaceable positive role in economic 
construction and have stopped calling them "blind migrant 
workers." For this reason, it is necessary to guide them and 
ameliorate their situation. It is not good for the economy to 
grow either too rapidly or too slowly. If it grows too slowly, 
many of the capital construction projects will have to be 
stopped and the civilian workers will be the first to bear the 
brunt, which is likely to cause social instability.

<F P=106> [By A. R. Wilkie] </F>
  [Text] Imagine a world where all outsiders are enemies; 
where not even your closest colleagues are above suspicion, 
where all telephone calls are assumed to be bugged; where even 
trivial internal documents must be burnt in the presence of 
witnesses. Living with suspicion is the fate of many who work 
for intelligence organisations all over the world. China too 
has specialist organisations which carry out intelligence and 
counter-intelligence operations, the most important of which is 
the Ministry of State Security. But the police, even down to 
the lowly beat officer, also live in a John Le Carre world of 
spy-counter-spy. 
  Skim the pages of the POLICE OFFICE WORK HANDBOOK, published 
for internal circulation only by the Police Officers Education 
Publishing House. The handbook opens with some general words of 
warning for police officers meeting foreign visitors. "Be 
friendly, warm and polite, at the same time raise vigilance and 
act according to the principle of `treating insiders and 
outsiders differently' in order to protect against any attempt 
to gather intelligence." Much of the handbook deals with 
practical hints, such as how to deal with superior officers on 
the telephone (never hang up first) and how to handle the messy 
paperwork required to send a detainee to a labour camp. 
  But at least 20 pages are devoted to secrecy. Police 
officers are instructed "never to sell secret documents to scrap 
paper merchants, never use them as wrapping paper, and never use 
them as wallpaper". Secret documents must never be sent through 
the mail or carried when shopping or visiting restaurants. Even 
after secret documents have passed their expiry date, the 
information in them remains secret. If the documents are 
clogging up the shelves, permission must be sought to burn them, 
but only in the presence of two police officers. 
  What are these secrets that must be so fiercely protected? 
Some have to do with arrangements for the protection of top 
leaders or visiting dignitaries. But political dissent and the 
fight against it is at the top of the list. "Anything that 
creates difficulties for quelling or handling riots, chaos, 
disturbances, protests and sudden incidents" is a state secret. 
Top secret -- to be kept under wraps for at least 30 years -- 
includes "information held by the police on spying, rebellions, 
hijackings, plots, treachery, intelligence about serious cases 
of smuggling, investigations or charges against the police, 
details of surveillance operations, investigations and plans to 
solve crimes, plans for cracking down, and any knowledge that if 
it became known might cause serious losses to the unity of the 
country, political stability, the unity of nationalities, 
foreign relations and economic interests". Statistics concerning 
"counter-revolutionary incidents" are considered "highly 
confidential". Officially, they should be kept secret for at 
least 20 years, as should "plans for quelling or dealing with 
local protests, disturbances and other sudden incidents which 
have a big impact on social order". "Captured reactionary 
leaflets" are state secrets, and so are information about police 
who break the law and "political accidents". Inexplicably, the 
number of overseas Chinese permanently resident in China is also 
a state secret. There are other categories of secret that are 
so secret they cannot be named in a handbook that is only 
semi-secret, such as any sensitive information about leaders and 
their families. 
  Documents which contain secrets must be printed only by 
approved specialist printers who have been vetted. If this is 
not possible, the printing must take place in a workshop which 
stands on its own and where privacy is guaranteed. The number 
of copies cannot exceed the number ordered, and any spoiled 
copies or scraps of waste must be carefully destroyed. 
  When there is to be a meeting at which secrets may be 
discussed, all arrangements "from decorating the room to 
purchasing necessary items to the preparation of the teapot and 
cups" must be made by police officers. Such meetings must never 
be held in hotels which receive foreign guests. After the 
meeting, a search of the room must be carried out to make sure 
no state secrets have been slipped between the cushions or been 
idly doodled on the table top. 
  The reason for this obsession with secets, the handbook 
explains, is that just about everybody is out to get them. 
"With increased reform and opening to the world, there are more 
routes for exchanges with the world on wider subjects. Foreign 
intelligence organisations and other personnel from abroad are 
trying every other way to gather intelligence. In the past few 
years, the central government's secret documents have been 
copied by people at foreign organisations stationed in China... 
People come to China in all sorts of guises, including 
businessmen, journalists, academics, to do spying... There are 
also some people in China who have ulterior motives and sell the 
top secrets of the party and government." 
  Spies, the handbook explains, try to intercept police 
information as it is communicated internally, in particular by 
listening in on telephone calls. Deleted material can be 
salvaged from computer disks. Fax machines and computer modems 
can be easily bugged with simple equipment. Imported fax 
machines and computers, the handbook warns, should be treated 
with particular care, since bugs may have been planted in them 
at the time of manufacture. Any imported electronic equipment 
must therefore be inspected for security before it can be 
installed. 
  There is no doubt that China, like all countries, is spied 
on 
by foreign governments. But Beijing's concern about espionage 
seems unusually intense and wide-ranging. The only hard 
evidence for foreign intelligence gathering cited in the 
handbook is the publication abroad of excerpts from Chinese 
newspapers and magazines and transcripts of radio broadcasts, 
all or most of which are already openly available. 
  Perhaps the greatest worry for the police are the highly 
organised and well-funded dissident groups now active in China. 
Rightly or wrongly, the authorities believe these dissident 
groups are supported and encouraged by prodemocracy groups 
abroad. Increasingly, modern dissidents carry beepers and use 
fax machines, spreading the word electronically. 
  Nor can the police force be fully confident of everyone in 
its own ranks. Dissidents say that while the police have 
infiltrated their organisations, they, in return, have also 
infiltrated the police. Dissent is a crime, so the police -- 
like almost everything else -- has become politicised. And the 
price to be paid for engaging in politics in China is paranoia.

<F P=106> [Report by Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] Deng Xiaoping's daughter is suing a printing 
factory in Shandong province after it pirated thousands of 
copies of her biography of the patriarch, mainland sources say. 
Deng Rong is demanding 70,000 renminbi [RMB] (HK$61,600) from 
the Yantai Printing Factory in a suit filed in the city's middle 
courts last month. The Yantai factory is understood to have 
hired a lawyer to defend itself against the charges, raising the 
possibility that Deng Rong herself might appear before the court 
at a hearing this month. "The Yantai factory is not going to 
admit to the charge. But it's hard to say now whether she will 
go," a source said. 
  Deng Rong -- the youngest of Deng Xiaoping's three daughters 
and perhaps his closest confidante -- felt Shandong authorities 
had been too soft on the factory. The Shandong Press and 
Publications Bureau fined the factory only RMB 20,000 earlier 
this year after it admitted printing 30,000 illegal copies of 
the popular book. Private investigators hired by Deng Rong later 
discovered that more than 100,000 copies had been run off. "Mao 
Mao [her pet name] felt it was useless to rely on the Shandong 
authorities because this factory is part of their system," a 
source said. "We suggested she delay the suit and allow 
administrative measures to take effect but she insisted on going 
ahead right away." 
  My Father, Deng Xiaoping has been the target of 
book pirates ever since it hit the shelves in China last 
September. Pirate editions may outnumber the 900,000 officially 
issued copies by as much as 10 times, sources said. Another 
state printing factory, in Wuhan, admitted to pirating 10,000 
copies, although the books were confiscated before being sold. 
Other printing factories in Guangxi and Shaanxi were under 
investigation by the State Copyright Administration (SCA) on 
special orders from Deng Rong, the sources said. Those pirated 
in Guangxi were of such low quality that it was difficult to 
read, which Deng Rong believed lowered the book to the level of 
underground trash novels, the sources said. 
  She hoped the Yantai case, where a decision was expected by 
the end of this month, would serve as a warning to other pirate 
printers. She also wanted the problem to be solved before her 
second volume of the biography -- covering the patriarch's life 
since 1976 -- appears in a few years. Juicy details about the 
elder Deng's role in crushing the Tiananmen Square protests of 
1989, as well as other political storms since the Cultural 
Revolution, would make even richer pickings for book pirates, 
especially if he had died by the time the volume came out, the 
sources said. 
  SCA sources have confirmed that copyright violations will 
soon be made a criminal offence subject to jail terms of up to 
seven years. As reported earlier in EASTERN EXPRESS, Beijing 
leaders promised to pass the criminal legislation after Deng 
Rong flew into a rage over rampant piracy of the biography prior 
to a trip to Japan in February. A special National People's 
Congress Standing Committee will be held in May to pass the 
legislation. When asked about the piracy problem during the 
recent meeting of the National People's Congress in Beijing, 
Deng Rong grimaced and replied: "Of course, I'm not happy about 
it."

<F P=106> [By Cao Min: "Code Rates The Work of State Employees"] </F>
  [Text] The Personnel Ministry has issued China's first 
code to appraise government workers. 
  And it lays down grades for regular checks on their 
performance which may lead to promotion, demotion or the sack. 
  The code, titled "Provisional Regulations on Appraisal of 
State Civil Servants," aims to improve the performance of State 
employees. 
  Appraisals will include day-to-day evaluations and an annual 
examination and they will rank civil servants in three glades -- 
excellent, qualified and unqualified -- according their 
integrity, ability, dedication and service record. 
  The new code says no more than 15 percent of civil servants 
should receive "excellent" rankings. 
  Appraisal committees are to be composed of department heads 
and staff representatives elected by workers. 
  Employees must comprise at least a third of the selection 
group. 
  "Excellent" workers get cash rewards equivalent to one or 
two 
months extra pay, while "qualified" ones get an extra month's 
salary. 
  Those who receive the top two grades for two consecutive 
years will be promoted. 
  Those deemed unqualified get demoted in their first year and 
dismissed if they are found to be unproductive a second year. 
  Since the civil service was set up October 1 last year, more 
than 40 ministries have trained workers or organized courses to 
publicize the system. 
  Several provinces, including Hainan, Guangdong, Shangdong, 
Anhui and Jilin, have taken steps to set up the new civil 
service. 
  The Ministry of Coal, which was set up in the first half of 
last year, has shed about 900 -- 75 percent -- of its workers. 
  Provincial governments are focusing their attention on 
solving problems arising from the implementation of the new 
system.

  [Text] Beijing, March 31 (XINHUA) -- Air China passengers 
can now be sure of being taken care of comfortably if a flight 
is delayed. 
  To provide better services for passengers of delayed 
flights, 
Air China has recently drafted a number of special service 
standards. 
  Air China sources said that these standards apply to flights 
which are delayed for weather reasons or by mechanical failure. 
They include the following services: 
  For passengers who are delayed more than two hours, drinks 
and food should be provided. Important passengers and 
first-class passengers should be served meals in dining halls. 
  When a flight is delayed over four hours, passengers should 
be sent to hotels or sight-seeing and other entertainment 
activities. 
  If a flight is postponed until the next day, board and 
lodging should be arranged for the passengers. Important 
passengers and first-class passengers should be sent to hotels 
of at least four- star standard; business-class passengers 
should be sent to hotels with three or more stars, while 
economy-class passengers should be sent to hotels with at least 
two stars. 
  If a flight is delayed due to mechanical failure, passengers 
can make international or domestic long-distance calls or fax 
materials free of charge. 
  If a flight is delayed due to bad weather, free 
telecommunications services are provided for important 
passengers and first-class and business-class passengers, while 
economy class passengers have to pay for phone calls or faxes.

  [Text] Beijing, March 31 (XINHUA) -- Three young priests 
have been elected vice-chairmen of the Beijing Patriotic 
Catholic Association or the Beijing Religious Affairs Committee, 
marking the entry of a younger generation of clergy. 
  Officials of religious affairs said that more younger 
clergymen have been trained in Beijing and nearly half of all 
the 400-plus religious teaching staff in the Chinese capital are 
young or middle- aged. 
  In the past several years, a few theological institutes 
including the Christian Yanching Theological Seminary, the 
Catholic Monastery, the Institute of Islamic Theology, and 
seminars including the Buddhist Monks' Class and the Lama Class 
at the Yonghe Lamasery have been restored in Beijing. 
  Since 1989, some 22 graduates from the Catholic Monastery 
have become priests. Three others have been sent for 
theological studies in the United States and another two are 
scheduled to study in Hong Kong. 
  In addition, 18 young sisters from the Catholic convent have 
become leaders of religious affairs and scores of graduates from 
religious schools have become imams, lamas and nuns. 
  The religious officials said the emergence of these younger 
clergy has greatly reduced the lack of successors to carry on 
religious affairs. 
  So far, there is a 35-year-old monk acting as vice-president 
of the Beijing Buddhist Association, and a number of other young 
clergy have been elected leaders of monasteries or the Beijing 
Islamic Association.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Bao Hongjun (7637 3163 0193): "Hainan </F>
Province Fights Corruption by Looking Into Both Its Root Cause 
and Symptoms -- Not Only Handling Cases in Earnest, But Also 
Deepening Structural Reform"] 
  [Text] If the situation is judged from appearances alone, 
the newly founded Hainan Province gives the impression of 
prosperity coexisting with corruption. Before it was designated 
a province, Hainan Island was economically backward, but 
nowadays it has become one of the most vigorously growing 
regions in China. In the last few years, the provincial party 
committee and government has persisted in market orientation, 
continuously deepened reform, opened wider to the outside world, 
and thus achieved inspiring results in economic construction. 
In the last six years since the founding of Hainan Province, 
economic indexes such as gross domestic product and national 
income increased at an average rate of more than 11 percent a 
year. Nevertheless, as the economy developed at high speed, 
corruption was haunting Hainan like a specter. Hainan is a 
small province, with a population of only 68 million people. 
Last year it had three cases carried in nationally circulated 
notices. In the cases, Jiang Wei, former planning department 
director and Li Shanyou, former deputy secretary general of the 
provincial government, took 100,000 yuan or so and tens of 
thousands of yuan in bribes respectively and, had thus their 
cases became well-known as two typical corruption cases. 
  To punish corruption, the Hainan provincial party committee 
has worked hard to investigate and handle cases and done a lot 
of work in the last few years. The province has handled 4,421 
cases of violating party discipline and investigated and dealt 
with 3,810 party members who violated discipline, of whom 15 
were cadres at the departmental level and above, 126 cadres at 
the office level, and 694 cadres at the section level. 
Corruption has disappeared to some extent but in some aspects, 
it is continuing to spread. 
  As the drive of reform and opening up spurs speedy economic 
growth, corruption is growing and spreading continuously. In 
early 1993 it was this grim situation that the new Hainan party 
provincial committee and government confronted. 
  The facts are thought-provoking. Do reform and opening up 
bring about corruption? Apart from investigating and handling 
cases, are there any other more effective options in combating 
and punishing corruption? 
  Through a thorough investigation and study, leaders of the 
party provincial committee reached a consensus: Some corrupt 
phenomena did appear in the course of reform. However, the 
fundamental cause for corruption lies with the lack of reform 
rather than reform itself. At a time when the old structure was 
being replaced by the new one, the old structure and the 
imperfect new structure were counteracting with each other. 
This gave corrupt elements an opportunity to make 
power-for-money deals. Hence, corruption was concentrated in 
the offices and departments which "dispose of resources under 
the planned economic structure" or retained the power of social 
micro-operations. The current spread of corruption is a phased 
phenomenon of structural transition and economic transformation 
and a kind of "transitional corruption." For example, as prices 
are being gradually unified, profiteers living on sales of 
approval documents and indexes and on "the dual-price gap" will 
gradually disappear from the scene. It is thus clear that to 
punish corruption, it is imperative to investigate and handle 
cases in real earnest. However, this alone is not enough. Only 
when reform is deepened and the legal system is perfected can 
the soil on which corruption breeds be scratched out. If the 
structure is not reformed and the legal system is not perfected, 
corruption will grow everywhere like half-cut Chinese chives. 
  With this understanding, the party provincial committee and 
government intensified reform and determinedly expanded the 
tentacles of anticorruption work to the old structure last year. 
  First of all, let us take the land market as an example. 
Land is a nonrenewable element of production. In a market 
economy, land resources should be disposed of by the market. To 
put it another way, land prices should be determined by the 
market and land should not be allocated by the government using 
administrative fiats. The land market in Haikou, Sanya, and 
Qiongshan was once thrown into confusion because land resources 
were disposed of by the government using administrative fiats 
and the resulting gap between government- offered prices and 
market prices ranged from several to 20 times. Some people would 
reap exorbitant profits overnight by selling the "pieces of 
land" they gained through connections or position, while the 
government's finances and taxes suffered losses. The masses 
were quite dissatisfied with such a practice. Last spring, 
Hainan resolutely adopted a tender system and auction method in 
land transfers, thus thoroughly reforming the land transfer 
method. In Qiongshan City, the auction price of a piece of land 
was 9 million yuan or so. Once the new move was taken, illegal 
land trading at a profit was immediately checked. Haikou even 
got instant results in this regard. Last year the city 
collected 1 billion yuan in land fees, much more than the total 
land transfer fees collected in the previous five years. 
  While the cries for tenders in the land market have not yet 
subsided, more than 100 contenders have begun entering into a 
fierce rivalry in the "enterprise leader open recruitment 
activities" sponsored by the Organization Department of the 
Hainan CPC Provincial Committee. Four outstanding contenders 
successfully distinguished themselves and assumed the post of 
general manager in the four companies under the commercial and 
trade departments. The ways of using enterprise leaders under 
the old structure, such as "Bo Le seeing horses for himself [bo 
le xiang ma 0130 2867 4161 7456]" and "naming a person for a 
particular job behind closed doors" were apt to lead to 
unhealthy practices such as appointing people by favoritism, 
currying favor from upper circles, and sending gifts and 
practicing bribery. As such, Hainan was determined to "employ 
people with doors open to society" and boldly explored 
organization and personnel systems under the market economic 
structure. 
  Haikou's reform of the tax collection and management system 
is another successful typical case of punishing corruption. The 
traditional tax collection and management system relied on tax 
staff, who collected taxes personally from the taxpayers. Every 
tax collector was assigned to collect taxes from 400 taxpayers. 
Malpractices such as abuse of power for private gain, 
embezzlement, and bribery could be found among some tax 
collectors. However, such malpractice could not be curbed 
despite repeated prohibitions. In the drive to "rectify 
unhealthy practices" alone, discipline inspection departments in 
Haikou investigated and handled 17 such cases with 18 persons 
involved. In June last year, the city deepened reform, 
abolished the tax collector system, and introduced unified 
computerized management, under which the taxpayers were required 
to pay taxes directly to relevant organs or through social 
agency organizations. Malpractices in tax collection and 
management have disappeared since then. For example, a certain 
enterprise was fined for tax evasion. When its manager 
personally went to the tax bureau director to ask for an 
exception, he saw the fine bill on the manager's computer 
screen, and he had to withdraw his request blushingly. 
  Some reforms have been introduced such as changing the 
"enterprise legal person examination and approval system" into a 
"direct registration system"; removing the 10 barriers to 
enterprise examination and approval; changing the system of 
managing university student job assignments on graduation into a 
system under which "the supplier and the end-user meet" and 
choose each other and students on graduation seek jobs 
themselves in society; introducing an all- worker contract 
system by breaking the demarcation line on identity, encouraging 
fair competition, and carry out a job assessment system; and 
introducing a tender system in distribution of export quotas. 
The reforms have a common special characteristic -- operational 
procedures being simplified, standardized, open, and fair, and 
arbitrariness in doing things being reduced. Like double-edged 
swords, the reforms thrust directly into the old structure and 
systems. Thus, the intensity of reform was increased and 
corruption was checked once and for all. 
  "Veteran discipline inspectors," such as Cao Bailin, deputy 
secretary of the Hainan Provincial CPC Committee and Xie 
Mingren, secretary of the Haikou City CPC Committee, maintained: 
In regard to discipline inspection and supervision work, there 
is also the question of micro and macromanagement and of 
effecting a permanent cure and bringing about a temporary 
solution. Investigating and handling specific cases belongs to 
micromanagement and bringing about a temporary solution. 
Deepening reform and establishing a new structure will help 
solve recurring problems. This belongs to macromanagement and 
effecting a permanent cure. In discipline inspection work, if 
we are satisfied with limited investigation of cases and do not 
adapt ourselves to the objective requirements of the new 
situation for anticorruption, we will find it difficult to keep 
the initiative in anticorruption work. 
  Effecting a permanent cure and bringing about a temporary 
solution are the two aspects of anticorruption. Neither should 
be overemphasized at the expense of the other. While striving 
to effect a permanent cure, Hainan did not relax in the 
slightest degree in its efforts to investigate and handle cases 
of corruption. From January to December last year, the 
discipline inspection and supervision departments of the 
province placed 733 cases of party and government cadres 
violating discipline for investigation and prosecution, punished 
650 party members who had violated discipline, of whom seven 
were cadres at the departmental level and above, 34 were at the 
office level, and 166 were at the section level. Some typical 
cases were exposed to the general public and the several 
unhealthy practices against which the masses of people had 
strong complaints were effectively rectified. Deepened reform 
and anticorruption have injected new vitality into economic 
construction. The province's economy is developing healthily 
and at high speed. The main economic indexes, such as gross 
national product and local financial revenues showed relatively 
big increases over the previous year. 
  While many people have some confused ideas about the 
launching of anticorruption struggle at a time when the old 
structure is being replaced by a new one, the Hainan Provincial 
CPC Committee conscientiously implemented the party Central 
Committee's strategic plan of "grasping reform and opening up in 
the one hand and grasping anticorruption in the other," and has 
proven with its fruitful explorations and practice that the 
dialectical unity of "anticorruption and deepening reform" has 
opened a path of effecting both permanent and temporary 
solutions to fighting and eliminating corruption in the new 
period.

Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, at 
the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
(NPC) on 11 March 1994] 
  [Text] Beijing, 24 Mar (XINHUA) -- Fellow Deputies: 
  Entrusted by the State Council, I now submit a report on the 
implementation of the National Economic and Social Development 
Plan for 1993 and the Draft Plan for National Economic and 
Social Development for 1994 for your examination and approval, 
and also for suggestions from the members of the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] and other personnel present at the session as 
observers. 
<H5>  1. The Basic Situation in the National Economic and Social </H5>
Development in 1993 
  In 1993, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory 
on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the 
guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress, the people of 
all nationalities across the country united, worked hard, and 
continued to march forward triumphantly. On the whole, the 
National Economic and Social Development Plan for 1993 was 
implemented satisfactorily. Various reforms designed to 
establish a socialist market economy are being carried out in 
depth, step by step, and in a planned way according to the 
decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, and have made important progress. China further 
opened its doors wider to the outside world; achieved sustained, 
rapid, and healthy national economic development [guo min jing 
ji chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 0948 3046 4842 3444 2170 
4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455]; and made sweeping progress 
in various social undertakings. 
  1) Social production continued to increase 
rapidly. The gross domestic product [GDP] reached 3.138 
trillion yuan in the whole year, up 13.4 percent over the 
previous year and 8 percent higher than the planned growth rate. 
The year's GDP growth rate breaks down into 4 percent for 
primary industry, 20.4 percent for secondary industry, and 9.3 
percent for tertiary industry. The rural economy saw overall 
growth. The output of grain and oil-bearing crops hit an 
all-time high. Grain output reached 456.4 million tonnes, 103.1 
percent of the planned figure and 13.8 million tonnes more than 
for the previous year; the output of oil-bearing crops totaled 
17.61 million tonnes, 106.7 percent of the planned figure and 
1.2 million tonnes more than the previous year. The output of 
cotton and sugar dropped and failed to fulfill the plan due to a 
decrease in the cultivated area, plant diseases, and insect 
pests. The farming structure developed along the direction of 
producing high yields of fine quality crops with maximum 
efficiency. The output of animal husbandry and fishery posted 
comparatively rapid growth. The total output of meat increased 
10.2 percent over the previous year; and the output of aquatic 
products grew 14.6 percent from the previous year. Village and 
township enterprises continued to enjoy vigorous development, 
and their development accelerated especially in the central and 
western regions of China. The nation's industry produced a 
total added value of 1.414 trillion yuan, up 21.1 percent over 
the previous year. Within this figure, heavy industry grew 22.2 
percent; and light industry, 19.9 percent. The output of major 
products continued to increase. China produced 1.141 billion 
tonnes of coal, up 2.2 percent over the previous year; 144 
million tonnes of crude oil, up 1.3 percent; 820 billion kwh of 
electricity, up 8.8 percent; 88.68 million tonnes of steel, up 
9.6 percent; 2.039 million tonnes of ethylene, up 1.8 percent; 
3.298 million tonnes of 10 kinds of nonferrous metals, up 10.2 
percent; 360 million tonnes of cement, up 16.8 percent; 1.31 
million automobiles, up 22.8 percent; and 2.215 million tonnes 
of chemical fiber, up 3.9 percent. The production of washing 
machines and refrigerators increased by more than 20 percent. 
The industrial sectors saw an improvement in their economic 
returns. 
  The sales rate of industrial products increased from 95.5 
percent to 96.4 percent; the profit and taxation rate of funds 
increased from 10.1 percent to 10.6 percent; the turnover number 
of circulating funds increased from 1.66 to 1.71. The output 
and business volume of the construction industry continued to 
grow; new results were achieved in geological prospecting; new 
development was made in the tertiary industry. Efforts were made 
to exploit the potentials in the transportation and 
communications industries to meet production needs and needs in 
daily life. The railway cargo turnover volume reached 1,193.6 
billion tonnes-km, an increase of 3.1 percent over the previous 
year; the business volume of the posts and telecommunications 
industry totalled 46.1 billion yuan, an increase of 58.9 percent 
over the year before. The financial, accounting, auditing, 
information, consultation services, and other trades providing 
direct services to the people also developed quite rapidly. 
  2) Key Construction Projects and Technological 
Transformation Were Strengthened The country's total fixed 
asset investment amounted to 1,182.9 billion yuan in 1993, or 
147.9 percent of the annual plan, up 50.6 percent from the 
previous year. Taking price factor into consideration, the 
actual work volume increased 22 percent. Of the total fixed 
asset investment, investment in state- owned units' capital 
construction projects totalled 464.7 billion yuan and investment 
in technological upgrading and transforming totalled 219.2 
billion yuan. To alleviate the constraint on economic 
development caused by the "bottleneck," greater increase was 
given to the investment in the transportation and communications 
industries -- the investment in these two industries increased 
from 14.7 percent of the total investment in state-owned units' 
capital construction projects in 1992 to 20.2 percent in 1993. 
The amount of investment and work progress in railway 
construction were unusually high compared with those since the 
founding of the Republic. Preparations for the construction of 
the Chang Jiang Three Gorges key water control project, which 
has been decided by the NPC, were carried out in all areas. 
Construction of the first- phase earth and stone cofferdam 
project and the water diversion and canal dredging work were 
carried out smoothly; resettlement work has being carried out in 
full swing; good results were achieved in raising and securing 
funds for the project; new progress was made in the study of 
relevant major equipment and technical problems. Completion of 
key state construction projects was better than previous years 
-- a number of backbone projects of restructuring nature were 
completed and put into use. A total of 133 large and medium 
capital projects were completed and put into operation in 1993 
and 128 major technological upgrading and transformation 
projects were completed. Generators capable of generating 14.38 
million kw of electric power were installed and the petroleum 
exploitation capability was increased by 15.42 million tonnes. 
A total of 1,019 km of new, multiple-track, and electrified 
railroads, and 3,556 km of highway were put into use; sea ports' 
handling capacity increased by 37.52 million tonnes; 3.672 
million households were installed with telephones. A number of 
other projects for public interests were also put into use. 
  3) Foreign Trade and Economic and Technical Exchange 
Further Increased 
  Opening up of the coastal areas developed toward improving 
local industrial structures; Shanghai's Pudong New Area 
quickened its development and opening up pace; a number of 
economic and technological development zones were established in 
some frontier and coastal cities and cities along Chang Jiang. 
Foreign trade continued to grow -- import and export volume 
totalled $195.8 billion, an increase of 18.2 percent over the 
year before. Of the total import and export volume, $91.8 
billion were of exports, up 8 percent from the previous year, 
and $104 billion were of imports, up 29 percent from the year 
before. The export product mix was further improved -- 
percentage of manufactured industrial products increased, of 
which machinery and electric appliances, which have a higher 
added value, increased to 24.7 percent. Utilization of foreign 
funds increased sharply -- a total of $36.77 billion of foreign 
fund, an increase of 91.5 percent over the previous year, was 
actually used in 1993. Of the total foreign fund utilized, 
$25.8 billion, an increase of 1.3 times over the previous year, 
were of foreign companies' actual direct investment. A total of 
$10.8 billion, up 36.9 percent from the year before, of foreign 
loan were utilized in 1993. Foreign companies' investment 
pattern changed to some degree -- investment in long- and 
medium-term development projects increased, investment by large 
companies and consortia outside the country increased, the 
investment gradually shifted to the construction of 
infrastructural facilities and basic industries, and investment 
in central and western parts of the country increased. Good 
results were achieved in the international tourism industry and 
the foreign exchange income from the industry increased 
considerably. The state's spot exchange reserve amounted to 
$21.2 billion at the end of 1993, up 9 percent from the 
beginning of the year. 
  4) The Domestic Market Was Brisk and Active The 
total retail sales volume of consumer products amounted to 
1,223,7 billion yuan in 1993, 26.1 percent more than the 
previous year. Taking price factor into consideration, the 
actual growth was 11.6 percent. Supply of consumer products was 
ample and the variety was great. A balance was maintained 
between supply and demand, or the supply outstripped the demand 
for more than 90 percent of commodities. The circulation volume 
of capital goods increased -- the total sales of capital goods 
by material supply and marketing enterprises at and above the 
county level amounted to 779.6 billion yuan in 1993, an increase 
of 32.3 percent over the year before. The retail sales of 
capital goods for agricultural production use totalled 135.6 
billion yuan -- taking price factors into consideration, this 
actually is a drop of 7.8 percent from the previous year. 
  5) Science, Technology, Education, and Other Social 
Undertakings Developed Robustly New results were achieved 
in the state's key science and technological projects -- a total 
of 33,000 major science and technological results at the 
provincial and ministerial levels were achieved in 1993 and 781 
results were awarded by the state. New progress was made in 
transforming research results into practical productive forces. 
New varieties of major grain crops were grown on more than 20 
million mu of land. Relatively good economic results and social 
benefits were achieved in developing and applying new industrial 
products and new technologies. A set of heavy-duty railway 
transportation technologies were put into use on some trunk 
railroads; optical fiber communication technology has entered 
the industrialization stage -- "four-track" [si ci qun, 0934 
2945 5028] optical fiber communication lines were completed and 
put into use between Beijing, Wuhan, and Guangzhou. New- 
generation well-drilling technology played a role in exploiting 
special oil reserves; important technological breakthroughs were 
made in developing the "Shu Guang No. 1" computer. The state 
increased investment in the study of basic sciences and results 
of the current international standards were achieved in the 
study of superconductivity, botanical gene engineering, 
atmospheric sciences, geoscience, and information technology. 
The technology market developed in a healthy manner -- the 
volume of technology transaction totalled 20.76 billion yuan in 
1993. 
  Education further developed and the fundamental education 
was 
strengthened. About 97.7 percent of children at the primary 
school ages attended school; new development was made in 
secondary vocational education of various kinds. Ordinary 
institutes of higher learning enrolled 924,000 undergraduate 
students, up 22.5 percent from the previous year; students 
attending school totalled 2.536 million, 16.1 percent more than 
the year before. About 42,000 postgraduate students were 
enrolled in 1993, an increase of 27.3 percent over the previous 
year. New results were achieved in the cultural sector, in 
journalistic work, in the publication industry, and in radio 
broadcasting, film production, television, public health, and 
sports. New progress was made in family planning work -- the 
natural population growth was 1.145 percent, or 0.243 percentage 
points lower than the planned target. New results were achieved 
in controlling environmental pollutions. 
  6) Lives of Urban and Rural Residents Continued to 
Improve In general, residents' incomes continued to 
increase. The annual per capita living-expense income of urban 
residents was 2,337 yuan -- an increase of 10.2 percent over the 
previous year after taking price factors into consideration. 
The net per capita income of rural residents was 921 yuan -- an 
increase of 3.2 percent after taking price factors into 
consideration. The balance of savings deposit of urban and 
rural residents reached 1,476.4 billion yuan, up 321.9 billion 
yuan from the end of the year before, representing an increase 
of 27.9 percent. Company shares, treasury bonds, and other 
financial assets owned by residents also increased considerably. 
Cities and towns across the country found jobs for 7.05 million 
people; the unemployment rate of urban areas was 2.6 percent at 
the end of 1993. The living conditions in urban and rural areas 
continued to improve -- new residential houses with a total 
floor space of 836 million square meters were built in 1993, of 
which 266 million square meters were in urban areas, and 570 
million square meters were in rural areas. 
  Important achievements and progress were made in national 
economic and social development, and in the reform to establish 
a socialist market economic structure in 1993. All sectors of 
the economy, with the public sector as their mainstay, continued 
to develop. The degree of application of market prices in the 
national economy was further heightened. Rural reform continued 
to deepen. New progress was made in reforming state-owned 
enterprises following the further implementation of the 
"Enterprise Law" and the "Regulations on Transforming the 
Operating Mechanisms of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the 
Whole People." Price relationships were further straightened 
out as a result of big strides made in pricing reform. In the 
majority of the areas across the country the purchasing and 
marketing prices of grain and oil- bearing crops, and the prices 
of state-distributed coal and steel products were decontrolled, 
while the contract purchasing prices for some crude oil, railway 
freight transport, electric power, and cotton were increased. 
The markets for labor, capital, technology, information, and 
other basic means of production grew rapidly. Programs were 
studied and drawn up for deepening reform of the banking, 
financial and taxation, investment, planning, foreign trade, 
labor, wages, housing, and social security systems, some of 
which have been implemented while others will be gradually 
implemented. 
  These achievements were able to be achieved in 1993 because 
the people of the whole country, guided by the party Central 
Committee, continued to implement the important remarks of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the guidelines of the 14th CPC 
National Congress, and seized the opportunities to accelerate 
reform, opening to the outside world, and the modernization 
drive. At the same time, the achievements were made because the 
party Central Committee and the State Council promptly adopted 
the measures to deepen reform and to strengthen and improve 
macroeconomic regulation and control to deal with the notable 
contradictions which had emerged in the operation of the 
economy. Practice in 1993 has proved that to realize sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of the national economy, and to 
accelerate the building of a socialist market economic 
structure, we must not only give full play to the basic function 
of market forces in the allocation of resources but also 
strengthen and improve the state's role in exercising macro 
regulation and control over the economy. Macroeconomic 
regulation and control should suit the new situation. It is 
necessary to exercise indirect regulation and control by mainly 
adopting economic and legal means. 
  In 1993, while important achievements were made in the 
national economy, some major contradictions and problems 
remained in the economy. They are: excessive scale of fixed 
assets investment; irrational investment structure; the 
structural contradiction in economic growth is still very 
serious; infrastructural facilities and basic industries such as 
transportation, communications, petroleum, and electric power 
remain the "bottlenecks" restricting national economic 
development. Some state-owned enterprises were faced with 
fairly great difficulties. Their deficits were quite huge, and 
the number of losing enterprises continued to grow. Worthy of 
particular attention is that price rises were fairly high, 
considerably exceeding the target set by the macroeconomic 
regulation and control plan. The country's general index of 
retail sale prices rose 13 percent over that of 1992; the 
cost-of-living price index increased 14.7 percent, but in 35 
large and medium-sized cities the cost-of-living price index 
went up 19.6 percent. Governments at all levels have expressed 
serious concern over these problems encountered in the course of 
advance and have taken, or are taking, positive measures to 
solve them. In the area of prices, the State Council convened a 
meeting to stabilize the prices of grain and cooking oil, and 
also held a "vegetable basket" working conference to put grain 
and other important goods on the market, to stabilize market 
prices, to increase effective supply, and to strengthen 
supervision of market prices so as to stabilize the living 
conditions of the residents. 
  2. The Major Targets and Tasks of National Economic 
and Social Development in 1994 
  This year is a crucial year for us to establish the 
socialist 
market economic structure, as well as an important year for us 
to continue the good development trend of the national economy. 
To seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote 
development, and maintain stability is the overall task of the 
whole country. The 1994 plan for national economic and social 
development should be formulated and implemented in such a way 
as to serve the overall task. We should work under the guidance 
of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, implement in 
an all-around way the guidelines of the 14th National Party 
Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, accelerate the pace of building a socialist market 
economic structure, open China wider to the outside world, 
strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, 
vigorously adjust the economic structure, promote technological 
progress, actively open new markets, enhance economic 
efficiency, control inflation, and maintain a sustained, rapid, 
and healthy development of the national economy. 
  In accordance with the above requirements, the major 
macroeconomic regulation and control targets for the national 
economic and social development in 1994 are as follows: 
  -- Gross domestic product is to increase 9 percent over the 
previous year. That breaks down into 3 percent for primary 
industry, 10.7 percent for secondary industry, and 11 percent or 
higher for tertiary industry. 
  -- Total investment in fixed assets is expected to reach 
1,300 billion yuan. That breaks down into 875 billion yuan for 
state- owned enterprises and institutions, and 425 billion yuan 
for collective enterprises and institutions, and the private 
sector. 
  -- The deficit for 1994 is expected to reach 66.9 billion 
yuan. Counting the principal and interest of internal and 
external debts and external loans for key projects due to be 
paid back in 1994, total internal and external debts for this 
year will amount to 129.2 billion yuan. 
  -- Banks will grant 470 billion yuan in new loans. 
  -- Total retail sales are expected to reach 1,600 billion 
yuan in value, including 149 billion yuan in the sales of 
agricultural capital goods. 
  -- Imports and exports are expected to reach $200 billion in 
value, with $100 billion for exports and the same amount for 
imports. 
  -- Inflation will be controlled under 10 percent for the 
whole of 1994. 
  -- Efforts will be made to improve the economic efficiency 
of 
enterprises. That will include increasing the sales ratio of 
their products, boosting their ratio of profits and taxes to 
capital, improving their labor productivity, increasing their 
capital liquidity, and raising their energy-saving efficiency. 
  -- The natural population growth rate is to be controlled at 
about 1.3 percent for the year. 
  In setting the above macroeconomic regulation and control 
targets, we have taken into consideration the needs in 
maintaining a sustained, rapid, and healthy development, the 
needs to create a more relaxed environment for starting major 
reforms this year, and the needs to create the necessary 
conditions for keeping a steady growth next year and even in 
several subsequent years, following this year's rapid and 
healthy economic development. 
  The major tasks of the national economic and social 
development for 1994 are as follows: 
  (1) Persistently put agriculture in the position of 
prime importance and develop the rural economy in an all-around 
way 
  We will continue to strengthen the agricultural base, 
invigorate the rural economy and increase peasants' income, all 
of which has a bearing on the overall situation of the nation's 
economic development and social stability. We will make every 
effort to obtain good agricultural harvests and ensure steady 
and increasing outputs of such principal products as grain, 
cotton, and oil bearing crops. Our plan projects an annual 
grain output of 450 billion kilograms, a cotton output of 4.85 
million tonnes, and an output of oil-bearing crops of 17.65 
million tonnes. We will comprehensively implement the 
guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee and the national rural work conference, continue to 
carry out the party's rural economic policies, and implement 
"Agriculture Law," "Law on Popularizing Agricultural 
Techniques," and "Program of China's Agricultural Development in 
the 1990's." We will further deepen reform; stabilize and 
improve the household contract responsibility system with 
remuneration linked to output as the main form, as well as the 
dual management system that combines household with collective 
operations; and gradually switch agriculture and the rural 
economy onto the track of socialist market economy. 
  This year, we must do a good job in the following areas: 
(1) Protect the arable land and see to it that the area planted 
with the principal crops is not diminished. We should see to it 
that 1.65 billion mu of land is planted with grain and do what 
we can to raise the area for cotton to 90 million mu. We should 
pay close attention to high-yield crops including early 
long-grained nonglutinous rice and try our best to raise the 
per-unit output. (2) Develop farming, forestry, animal 
husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries in line with local 
conditions; develop a diversified economy that includes 
processing of agricultural products, manufacturing, and service 
trades; and raise the added value of agricultural products to 
increase peasant incomes. Continued efforts should be made to 
slash the financial burden on farmers. (3). Appropriately raise 
purchasing prices of grain and cotton when new crops are going 
on the market. (4) Help the major grain and cotton producing 
areas develop their economies. State support will be given to 
500 major grain producing counties and 150 counties known for 
producing high quality cotton in developing their economies. 
(5) Develop a type of farming that provides high yields of 
fine quality with maximum efficiency, build a number of 
demonstration counties each with its own characteristics, and 
organize input in terms of new technology, funds, and materials 
in a well coordinated manner. (6) Step up construction of 
agricultural infrastructure facilities and improve the 
conditions for agricultural production. We should harness large 
rivers and lakes in an all-round manner, step up construction of 
key projects, and make preparations for projects of water 
diversion from south to north. We should continue constructing 
irrigation and water conservancy projects. Efforts should be 
continued to build large environmental protection projects 
including the shelterbelt networks in northwest, north, and 
northeast China and projects along the upper and middle reaches 
of the Chang Jiang and Huang He and along the coast. We should 
do a good job in conserving water and top soil along the upper 
reaches of the Chang Jiang and Huang He. (7) Increase 
agricultural input. This year, there will be a 35.6 percent 
hike in the central government's budgeted appropriation and bank 
credit for construction of farmland irrigation and water 
conservancy projects over last year. Local governments at all 
levels must also increase input in agriculture and, at the same 
time, guide the peasants to increase investment in terms of both 
labor and capital. (8) Speed up the dissemination of advanced, 
applicable technology. In 1994, we should expand the area 
planted with hybrid rice to 230 million mu; hybrid corn, 270 
million mu; the area using prescription fertilizer, 650 million 
mu; the area using straw compost to fertilize farmland, 400 
million mu; the area using polyethylene mulch, 70 million mu; 
and improve 50 million mu of waterlogged lowland and saline 
soil. We should popularize the technology of applying chemical 
fertilizer deep in the soil, the pattern [mo shi hua 2875 1709 
0553] crop cultivation technique, and technology for preventing 
plant diseases and insect pests in crop farming, stock breeding, 
and fish farming. It is necessary to improve forecasting and 
monitoring of disastrous weather. A collectivized service 
system for agriculture should be developed. (9) Provide 
continued guidance to help village and township enterprises 
optimize their structure and improve efficiency in line with 
state industrial policy. It is necessary to implement the 
central government's policy of helping the central and west 
regions and minority regions develop village and township 
enterprises. We should strengthen planning and guide township 
enterprises to concentrate appropriately, make full use of the 
existing small cities and townships, and build up new ones. 
(10) Implement the plan adopted by the CPC Central Committee 
and State Council to solve, within seven years, the problem of 
inadequate food and clothing for 80 million impoverished people. 
In 1994, the state will make available manufactured goods and 
foods worth 6.1 billion yuan -- up 19.6 percent over last year 
-- to work-relief programs to help old revolutionary base areas, 
areas inhabited by minority nationalities, border areas, and 
poverty-stricken areas develop their economies. 
  (2) Vigorously readjust the structure, improve 
management and operation, raise efficiency, and run large and 
medium state-owned enterprises well 
  Irrational economic structure and low economic efficiency 
are 
prominent problems in China's economic development today. In 
1994, industries must truly focus on optimizing structure, 
improving efficiency, and maintaining an effective growth rate 
through deepening reform, opening new markets, strengthening 
management, and accelerating technological progress. Toward 
this goal, special efforts shall be made to carry out the 
following tasks: First, we shall actively increase the output 
of basic industrial products that are in short supply and 
enhance our ability to maintain sustained and rapid growth of 
the national economy. We project the output of raw coal in 1994 
to be 1.16 billion tonnes; crude oil, 144.1 million tonnes; 
electricity generated, 890 billion kwh; steel, 91 million 
tonnes; the 10 kinds of nonferrous metals, 3.3 million tonnes; 
and ethylene, 2.1 million tonnes. Second, we shall promptly 
adjust product mix in light of market demands, actively support 
the production of readily salable goods, do a good job of 
limiting the production of overstocked goods and promoting their 
sales, and vigorously open and expand domestic and overseas 
markets, particularly the rural market. We shall actively 
develop new products, designs, colors, styles, and varieties to 
meet different levels of consumer demands. Third, we shall 
truly give top priority to improving product qualities, perfect 
quality control and warranty systems, initiate a quality 
certification system, and bring into full play the role of 
market forces in raising product quality and ensuring survival 
of the fittest. We shall resolutely deal with the manufacturing 
and selling of fake and substandard products in accordance with 
the law. Fourth, we shall strive to reduce consumption of 
energy and raw and semifinished materials, accelerate the 
turnover of funds, and reduce production cost. We shall take 
further steps to halt losses and increase profits. We demand 
that for the whole year, electricity consumption for every 
10,000 yuan's worth of industrial products drop 8-10 percent; 
the sales rate of manufactured goods be maintained at over 96 
percent; the turnover rate of circulating funds increase from 
1.71 to 1.75; overall labor productivity, the ratio of profits 
and tax to capital, and ratio between production cost and profit 
increase further; and both the number of money-losing 
enterprises and the amount of money lost drop. 
  State-owned enterprises, particularly large and medium-sized 
enterprises, are the pillar of China's economic development and 
revitalization. Therefore, we must make greater efforts to 
improve their performance. In line with the requirement to 
change enterprise operating mechanisms and establish a modern 
enterprise system, we shall deepen enterprise reform, ensure 
that enterprises truly have the rights and interests as well as 
responsibilities due to them, increase their vitality, and raise 
their ability to compete and develop new products and 
technologies to meet changing market demands. We shall 
earnestly implement the "General Financial Rules for 
Enterprises" and the "Guiding Principles for Enterprise 
Accounting" and establish a standard financial and accounting 
system. We shall earnestly strengthen the management of 
state-owned assets, and make enterprises responsible for 
preserving and increasing the value of the state assets to 
prevent their losses. We shall bring into active play the role 
of large enterprise groups in readjusting the industrial 
structure and enterprise organizational structure. We shall 
attach great importance to and earnestly strengthen safety in 
production. 
  (3) We shall maintain a rational scale of investment 
in fixed assets and vigorously optimize the investment structure 
  In light of the currently overextended scale of investment 
in 
fixed assets that are under installation, we must strictly 
control excessive investment growth this year, shifting the 
focus of our work to optimizing the investment structure and 
improving investment returns. Capital construction, technical 
upgrading, and real estate development will receive 485 billion 
yuan, 250 billion yuan, and 80 billion yuan, respectively, in 
fixed-assets investment by state- owned units in 1994. In 
accordance with the demands of industrial policy, we shall 
increase investment in infrastructure, basic industries, and 
backbone industries, mainly devoting additional state investment 
to agriculture, water conservancy, transportation, 
communications, energy, major raw and semifinished materials, 
electronics, science and technology, and education. We shall 
expand investment in exploiting resources in the west-central 
region. In investing in key construction projects, we shall 
first concentrate on projects that have been completed and put 
into operation, projects that must be continued, and key 
projects in the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" that must be launched. 
Specifically, we shall concentrate on a number of major 
projects which affect overall interests. These include projects 
to harness the Huai He, Tai Hu, and Dongting Hu; the Xiaolangdi 
water control project and other water conservancy projects on 
the Huang He; the Beijing-Jiulong and Lanzhou-Xinjiang railways; 
key port projects in Qinhuangdao, Dalian, and Shanghai; the 
Beijing-Shenyang-Harbin, Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou, and 
Xining-Lanzhou-Urumqi fiber-optics cables; and key projects such 
as large coal bases, hydroelectric stations, thermal power 
stations in the eastern region, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and 
Shaanxi. We shall intensify efforts to complete automobile 
projects selected by the state, the Wuxi microelectronics 
project, and special projects on application-oriented 
satellites. We shall make preparations for the early stage of 
the Three Gorges project on the Chang Jiang, simultaneously 
starting construction on both banks of the river. We shall 
begin full-scale construction of transportation projects leading 
to other places and the Xiling bridge. We shall complete land 
requisition in the dam area and the resettlement of residents. 
We shall continue preparations for the early stages of Phase 
Three of the Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex and other key 
projects. We shall strictly control investment in processing 
industries with excess production capacities. We shall launch 
infrastructure and basic industrial projects in accordance with 
the principles of overall state planning, rational distribution, 
efficiency, and acting within our means, and in order of 
importance and urgency. We shall give priority to key state 
projects that have a bearing on overall interests, and avoid 
launching redundant projects indiscriminately. This year, we 
will not approve various types of new development zones. The 
construction of tourist facilities, guesthouses, and office 
buildings essential for opening up to the outside world must be 
reported for approval in accordance with prescribed state 
procedures, and they must be strictly controlled. 
  We shall make further efforts to upgrade the technological 
levels of existing enterprises, particularly large and medium 
state-owned enterprises, as well as old industrial bases. To 
improve economic returns, we shall improve enterprises' capacity 
for self-development and encourage them to pursue expanded 
re-production. To meet the requirements of readjusting the 
investment structure and improving economic returns, we shall 
mainly funnel investment in technical upgrading to developing 
new products, improving product performance and quality, 
upgrading products, reducing consumption of energy and raw and 
semifinished materials, and promoting production safety and 
environment protection. We shall increase financial inputs in 
upgrading the technological levels of industrial enterprises in 
the communications, transportation, energy, and raw and 
semifinished materials sectors. 
  The key to controlling the investment scale, optimizing the 
investment structure, and improving investment returns lies in 
accelerating reform of the investment structure. We shall 
gradually institute a risk responsibility system for corporate 
and credit investment. We shall adopt different investment and 
financing methods for differing investment fields, and gradually 
turn enterprises into principal investment vehicles. We shall 
rationally delineate the scope of investment in infrastructure 
and public welfare by governments at all levels, as well as 
their responsibilities for such investment. We shall give full 
rein to the National Development Bank's functions in 
policy-related investment and funding. We shall guide 
localities and enterprises to funnel more funds toward 
infrastructure and basic industries through various means, such 
as joint investment and stock investment, in accordance with 
state policies, laws, and regulations. And we shall institute a 
system by which representatives of legal entities will assume 
responsibility for construction projects, as well as a bidding 
system and a system of reporting and registering construction 
projects. 
  (4) Open wider to the outside world and make active 
and efficient use of foreign funds, resources, technology, and 
markets 
  We shall seize the current favorable international climate 
to 
further expand foreign trade and economic and technological 
exchanges. Through the restructuring of the foreign trade and 
foreign exchange systems, we shall promote an increase in 
exports and allow a reasonable flow of imports to achieve a 
balance between foreign exchange revenues and expenditures for 
the year. In export trade, it is necessary to unswervingly 
implement the strategy of market diversification with product 
quality as a top concern, and open up new markets while 
maintaining and developing existing ones. It is necessary to 
continue to improve the mix of export products, accelerate a 
switch from exporting semi-processed goods to 
intensive-processed goods, and encourage and promote the export 
of high- and new-tech products. It is necessary to integrate 
technology, production, and trade; and vigorously expand the 
export of mechanical and electrical products and complete sets 
of equipment that are competitive on the international market, 
rely heavily on modern technology, and have a high added value 
and good export potential. It is imperative to speed up the 
establishment of a quality certification system. It is 
necessary to encourage and support stronger large and 
medium-sized enterprises with good credit to move into foreign 
markets with quality products and good after- sales services. 
It is imperative to develop integrated trade companies in the 
form of enterprise groups for different industries to engage in 
international trade. It is necessary to strictly implement the 
system of making settlements and sales in foreign exchange for 
exports, raise the settlement rate for exports, and improve the 
system of tax refunds on exports. It is imperative to 
strengthen control over imports and optimize the import mix. We 
shall continue to severely crack down on smuggling. We shall 
tighten supervision over enterprises located abroad by 
exercising strict control over the outflow of foreign currency 
in investment and capital accounts outside the country. We 
shall continue expanding international tourism and increasing 
foreign exchange revenues from non-trade sources. It is 
necessary to diligently check trade and non-trade collection and 
payment of foreign exchange, and to strengthen supervision over 
and examination of the collection and payment of foreign 
currency to prevent leaks resulting from arbitrage and evasion 
of state control over foreign currency and from capital drain. 
  We shall continue to operate in an efficient way special 
economic zones, the Pudong New District in Shanghai, open 
coastal cities, and economic and technological development 
zones, and open up more central cities in border regions, along 
the Chang Jiang river and in the interior. It is necessary to 
further improve the investment climate in China, expand the 
scope of projects using foreign funds, improve the performance 
and quality of projects using foreign funds, and make efficient 
use of foreign funds. It is necessary to absorb more direct 
foreign investment in line with the country's capacity to 
provide supplementary funding and increase the proportion of 
foreign investment committed to projects. It is imperative to 
guide the orientation of foreign investment in accordance with 
the state's industrial policies, directing more foreign 
investment towards infrastructure and basic industries, key 
projects and technology upgrading in existing enterprises, in 
particular towards projects that make foreign-exchange-earning 
products. It is necessary to support the central and western 
parts of the country in using foreign capital to develop local 
resources. Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperative 
enterprises should strictly abide by the principle of sharing 
both benefit and risk, and work to achieve a balance of payments 
in foreign exchange. State-owned enterprises must evaluate 
their assets before they sell stock rights or use existing 
assets to establish joint ventures or cooperative enterprises 
with foreign businesses so as to prevent the loss of state 
assets. It is imperative to strictly control the use of 
international commercial loans, continuing to keep it under 
mandatory planning control. It is necessary to encourage and 
support localities, departments, and enterprises with heavy 
foreign debts to establish a system of debt repayment financing 
to ensure that foreign debts are repaid on schedule. 
  (5) Earnestly shift economic construction onto the path 
that relies on scientific and technological progress, and 
further develop educational undertakings 
  We shall continue to implement the guiding ideology that 
science and technology constitute the primary productive force, 
and the "National Medium- and Long-Term Science and Technology 
Development Programs." We shall focus this year's science and 
technology- related work on the following areas: First, it is 
necessary to vigorously promote advances in industrial 
technology. Through the technology market and the support of 
necessary credit and investment, we shall popularize the 
application of a number of scientific and technology research 
results that have a high added value and that can cover a wide 
range of areas and promote many others and can yield good 
economic returns, to facilitate better and faster application of 
scientific and technology research results in production and 
construction. Second, it is necessary to continue to promote 
key scientific and technology research projects that have a 
major impact on economic and social development, and to apply 
major scientific and technology achievements in industries. We 
shall organize a number of key state industrial experimentation 
projects in some leading industries and high-tech areas; 
continue to implement high-tech research and development plans 
and the "Torch Program"; and accelerate the commercialization, 
industrialization, and internationalization of high- and 
new-tech products. Third, it is necessary to strengthen the 
construction of basic scientific research facilities and improve 
the quality of scientific and technical personnel. We shall 
build new and expand a number of engineering technology research 
centers and key state laboratories, and further carry out the 
"Climbing Program." Fourth, it is necessary to help enterprises 
become the mainstay in technological development. We shall 
bring into further play the role of market forces to promote the 
integration of science and technology with the economy. We 
shall encourage and guide scientific and technology development 
institutes to gear their operations to markets and to set up 
high- and new-tech enterprises. We shall encourage enterprises 
to cooperate with institutions of higher learning and scientific 
research units in establishing technology development 
organizations of various types, and shall support qualified 
enterprise groups, and large and medium-sized enterprises in 
establishing technology development centers. In assigning 
talented scientific and technology personnel and utilizing 
science and technology development funds, we shall increase the 
proportion of enterprises and form a system for promoting 
technological progress which closely integrates market, 
research, and production. 
  We shall continue to place education in a strategic 
position and earnestly implement the "Program for China's 
Educational Reform and Development." We shall further 
strengthen elementary education, make concentrated efforts to 
implement the nine-year compulsory education, and provide 
greater support to outlying and poverty-stricken regions to help 
them implement compulsory education. We shall develop secondary 
vocational education and different types of adult education. We 
shall steadily develop higher education, provided conditions for 
setting up and operating school are there and teaching qualities 
can be guaranteed. Regular colleges in the country will enroll 
895,000 regular and special program students and 42,000 
post-graduate students in 1994. Schools of different types and 
at all levels shall pay attention to raising teaching standards 
and improving performance. We shall continue to increase 
investment in education. The government shall assume primary 
responsibility for investing in compulsory education. At the 
same time, the general public and nongovernment sectors are 
encouraged to raise funds at different levels and in different 
forms to invest in schools. Vocational and adult education 
shall orient more to market demands so as to arouse the 
initiatives of all quarters of society to build and operate 
schools. We shall reform the structure of higher education to 
encourage joint operation of schools and to gradually institute 
a system of managing higher education at the central and local 
levels. Greater decisionmaking power shall be granted to local 
and school authorities to set up and operate schools. Schools 
in different categories and at all levels shall attach 
importance to and improve moral education. We shall earnestly 
implement the "Teachers Law," strive to improve teachers' pay 
and benefits, and take further steps to strengthen the building 
of teachers' ranks. 
  (6) Continue to improve the people's livelihood and 
develop various social undertakings 
  We shall continue to improve the living standards of the 
people on the basis of economic growth and increased labor 
productivity. We shall work hard to increase the peasants' 
income, making it an important task in this year's economic 
work. We shall develop the rural economy in an all-round way 
and appropriately increase the procurement prices of grain and 
cotton so that there will be a considerable increase in the 
peasants' income. State-owned enterprises shall appropriately 
increase workers' wages as production increases and economic 
returns improve. We shall continue implementing the civil 
service system reform and the reform of the wage system in 
public institutions. We shall concern ourselves with and 
properly provide for the livelihood of retired personnel, 
workers in enterprises having problems operating, and peasants 
in poor areas. We shall adopt measures to help them overcome 
difficulties. We shall continue to open new avenues to broaden 
the labor market, guide the rational movement of surplus 
personnel in public institutions, enterprises, and rural areas, 
and increase urban employment. We shall actively promote reform 
of urban commercial housing, reduce housing construction cost, 
and increase residential housing construction. To meet the need 
of continued reforms and maintain social stability, we will 
gradually establish a multi-form, multi-tier social security 
system. 
  Promoting all-round progress in social undertakings is an 
important task of macro-controls by the state. We will further 
strengthen socialist spiritual civilization as well as actively 
develop cultural, press, publishing, broadcasting, film and 
television, health care, and sports sectors. We should increase 
input, in different forms and through different channels, for 
improving the infrastructure facilities for social development. 
We will continue to earnestly and effectively tackle family 
planning by paying more attention to rural areas and the migrant 
population, and work to control the natural population growth 
rate within macroeconomic control targets. We should further 
strengthen environmental protection, control pollution, plant 
trees, and improve the ecological environment. We will protect 
and rationally utilize natural resources such as land, minerals, 
forests, and water. This year, the state will also draw up an 
outline for the development of national social undertakings to 
guide work in this regard. 
  3. Strengthen and Improve Macroeconomic Regulation and 
Control; Comprehensively Accomplish the 1994 Plan for National 
Economic and Social Development 
  The task of reform and development for 1994 is onerous. To 
accomplish this year's economic and social development plan in 
an all-round manner, we must do hard, solid work in many areas. 
One of them is to strengthen and improve macroeconomic 
regulation and control in line with the needs of establishing a 
socialist market economic system, deepening reforms in major 
areas, and maintaining the momentum of sustained economic growth. 
  (1) The basic point of departure in carrying out 
macroeconomic regulation and control is to maintain balance and 
unity between reform, development, and stability. We are 
faced with a rare historic opportunity for speeding up the 
reform, opening up, and modernization drive. On the one hand, 
we are advancing economic restructuring amid fast economic 
growth; on the other hand, we need to maintain a fast economic 
growth -- social stability as well -- while establishing a 
socialist market economic system. Reform is the motive force of 
development, and development is the foundation of reform and 
stability, and stability, in turn, is a prerequisite for 
economic and social development. Without social stability, 
nothing can be accomplished. 
  After two consecutive years of fast economic growth, the 
"bottleneck" industries have become an even greater restraining 
factor, and pressure for inflation has risen. Under these 
circumstances, it is necessary to pay close attention to the 
following in order to properly balance the relations between 
reform, development, and stability: First, we should maintain 
the momentum of fast economic development and, at the same time, 
keep a watch on the tightened situation in terms of 
macroeconomic regulation and control. We must not blindly 
pursue high growth rates in disregard of actual conditions. 
Nationally, the 9 percent growth rate set for this year is 
appropriate. Instead of vying with one another for the highest 
growth rate, localities should set their growth rate rates in 
the light of their respective conditions. Development is the 
last word. To develop we must have new ideas. It is crucial to 
place the emphasis on optimizing the economic structure, 
quickening technological progress, strengthening operations and 
management, and upgrading economic efficiency. Second, work out 
well-considered plans for reform in such sectors as finance, 
taxation, banking, investment, foreign trade, and the enterprise 
system in accordance with plans announced by the CPC Central 
Committee and State Council. We should do a good job in 
coordinating the various reform measures, execute well the 
transition from an old system to a new one, and do a good job in 
providing guidance through the media, and in propaganda and 
ideology work. Meanwhile, we should closely watch -- and tackle 
in a timely fashion -- the new situations and problems arising 
in the course of reform. Third, we should bring inflation under 
control and maintain market stability. This is a major concern 
affecting the steady growth of the economy and the immediate 
interests of the broad masses of the people. All localities and 
departments must take it seriously, coordinate their efforts, 
and employ a combination of economic, legal, and when necessary, 
administrative means to ensure the healthy operation of the 
economy. 
  (2) The main task of macroeconomic regulation and 
control is to maintain an overall balance of the total supply 
and demand of society. To fulfill this task, it is 
imperative to use all means to increase effective supply and 
prevent overall social demand from rising too rapidly. 
  First, it is necessary to exercise strict control over 
investment in fixed assets. We shall earnestly implement the 
"Circular on Continuing to Strengthen Macroeconomic Regulation 
and Control Over Investment in Fixed Assets" issued by the State 
Council last January. No locality or department should be 
allowed to go beyond the state-approved investment scale of 
fixed assets and to resume without authorization construction of 
projects suspended or postponed last year. Banks at all levels 
must strictly abide by state plans on loans for fixed assets 
investment, must exercise strict control over loans for fixed 
asset investment, and should refuse to finance any new projects 
not approved by the State Council or the State Planning 
Commission, or any projects outside state plans. It is 
necessary to standardize operations and strengthen the 
supervision over inter-bank loan markets, strictly implement 
state plans for issuing stocks, and resolutely check illegal 
fund-raising activities. It is necessary to effectively prevent 
the resurgence of development zone, and housing and real estate 
crazes. Housing and real estate development should be focused 
on building commercial residences in conjunction with housing 
reform. No locality should be allowed to expand fixed assets 
investment scale in the name of residential housing 
construction. To guard against haphazard and redundant 
construction, the State Planning Commission shall work together 
with departments and localities concerned in expeditiously 
drawing up a number of special programs on products and projects 
in great demand, so as to more effectively use both market and 
planning to optimize the distribution of resources. 
  Second, it is necessary to rationally control and guide the 
growth of consumer demand. We shall earnestly implement the 
"Circular Concerning Wage Reform of Staff Members of Offices and 
Institutions" issued by the State Council last year, and 
strictly control the volume of wage increases. We shall take 
effective measures to ensure that the total payroll of workers 
and staff of an enterprise grow at a lower rate than the 
enterprise's economic returns, and the growth rate of average 
wage of workers and staff is lower than the increase of labor 
productivity. We shall guard against draining state assets to 
increase individual incomes. We shall use economic means to 
regulate individual incomes and strengthen tax collection and 
management, especially the collection and management of 
individual income taxes. We shall firmly check indiscriminate 
issuance of bonuses and subsidies. We shall encourage an 
atmosphere of advocating thrift and actual results, and working 
hard to start a new undertaking in the whole society, and shall 
resolutely overcome the widespread practice of waste and 
extravagance. 
  Third, it is necessary to continue to keep money supply and 
credit under control, and tighten budgetary restraint. Through 
the restructuring of banks, we shall strengthen the central 
bank's functions for regulating and controlling currency and 
supervising various banking institutions, and shall exercise 
strict control over the basic volume of currency in circulation. 
All banks and other banking institutions must strictly control 
the volume of loans, and energetically optimize the pattern of 
loans to ensure needs for key production and construction 
projects and increase the efficiency of using funds. We shall 
continue to consolidate order with regard to money. We shall 
actively promote fiscal and taxation reform, go all out to 
broaden sources of income and cut back expenditures, increase 
financial revenues, control financial expenditures from growing 
too rapidly, reduce the balance between revenues and 
expenditures, and control financial deficits within the targets 
of macroeconomic regulation and control. 
  (3) Macroeconomic regulation and control should focus 
on controlling the margin of overall price rises. To 
further rationalize prices, cultivate and expand the market 
system, and promote economic restructuring and development, this 
year we shall appropriately readjust the prices of energy, 
grain, and cotton after fully taking into account what the 
state, the enterprises, and the masses can tolerate. In view of 
the high price rises since the beginning of last year, there 
will be intense pressure with regard to price hikes this year. 
Therefore, while pushing ahead with price reform, we must use 
every possible means to keep the margin of price increases 
within the targeted range of macroeconomic control and 
regulation. To this end, it is necessary to take the following 
measures: 1) We should work hard to increase effective supplies 
of goods and make every effort to promote the production and 
supply of daily necessities, especially the production and 
supply of such major farm products as grain, cotton, edible oil, 
sugar, and meat and the "vegetable basket" project in cities. 
2) We should, in line with the central authorities' 
arrangements, carefully organize the implementation of price 
adjustment measures formulated by the state. No department or 
locality should be allowed to exploit the chance to drive up the 
prices of goods and service charges. Meanwhile, we shall 
correctly implement the new taxation system and shall not allow 
anyone to take advantage to increase the current prices of 
factory, wholesale and retail goods. 
  3) We should establish channels that permit the free flow 
of commodities, eliminate various barriers to commodity 
distribution, reduce intermediate stages in the distribution 
process, lower costs, establish long-term and stable relations 
of supply and marketing between areas producing nonstaple 
foodstuffs, and those marketing them in the cities, and improve 
the allocation and transportation of grain, cooking oil, and 
other essential commodities. 4) We should establish a sound 
reserve system for grain, cotton, cooking oil, meats, sugar, and 
other major farm products; establish a full-fledged risk-control 
fund for grain and nonstaple foodstuffs; improve market 
regulation; and control prices. 5) We should improve the 
market-based monitoring and control system. We should step up 
supervision and control over the prices of daily necessities and 
basic services. While keeping their actual conditions in mind, 
all localities should specifically produce lists of essential 
commodities whose prices are subject to monitoring and control. 
Moreover, we should establish and implement a system under 
which prices for goods and services are clearly marked, as well 
as a system for registering and reporting price increases for a 
few important commodities. All localities must seriously 
implement the "Circular on Strengthening Efforts To Monitor and 
Review the Prices of Daily Necessities and Services" promulgated 
by the State Council and the "Provisions on Clearly Marking the 
Prices of Goods and Services" promulgated by the State Planning 
Commission. We should continue to overhaul all kinds of 
unwarranted fees; stop monopoly industries from increasing 
prices indiscriminately and covertly; give full rein to the 
roles of media departments and consumer and trade organizations; 
and enlist public opinion and the masses in tightening 
supervision over commodity prices. 6) We should set standards 
governing market order and improve market administration. We 
should accelerate the process of enacting laws on markets and 
prices, encourage fair competition, oppose monopolistic 
practices, protect legitimate profits, and stop the practice of 
making staggering profits through fraudulent means. We should 
also step up the inspection of price-related law enforcement 
efforts. The State Council has decided to conduct two 
nationwide general price surveys during the first and second 
halves of this year, and to investigate and sternly deal with 
illegal price increases and actions disruptive to market order. 
7) Administrative departments in charge of prices, as well as 
industry and commerce, at all levels should earnestly step up 
their efforts to monitor and inspect market prices and order, 
and better perform their functions of monitoring and controlling 
prices and markets. 
  (4) The macroeconomic regulation and control system 
needs to be improved continuously during the course of deepening 
reform. To develop the socialist market economy and 
maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy development in the 
national economy, we must gradually establish a sound 
macroeconomic regulation and control system in accordance with 
the "Decision on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a 
Socialist Market Economic Structure" of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. 1) All departments 
and localities must maintain the state's authority in exercising 
macroeconomic regulation and control, ensure the fulfillment of 
this year's goals and tasks for state macroeconomic regulation 
and control, and carefully consider and serve the overall 
requirement for the state to exercise macroeconomic regulation 
and control when drawing up their work plans. 2) We should 
establish a mechanism by which planning, banking, and finance 
will restrain each other; improve the overall coordination of 
economic operations; promote the integration of various 
macroeconomic policies; and encourage the comprehensive 
application of economic, legal, and essential administrative 
means, so that the different components will work closely with 
each other and combine to form a joint force. We should conduct 
fine-tuning on a timely basis to avert the buildup of 
contradictions, prevent drastic economic upswings and 
downswings, and improve the effectiveness of macroeconomic 
regulation and control. 3) We should step up efforts to monitor 
economic trends and issue advance warnings and forecasts of such 
trends. We should closely track economic trends, study 
potential contradictions and problems in economic activity, 
issue advance warnings on a timely basis, and adopt practical 
and effective policy measures. We should strengthen and improve 
the system of collecting, analyzing, and releasing information 
on the national economy and on various markets, giving full 
scope to the role of information-based guidance in promoting the 
healthy operation of the national economy. 4) We should 
continue to deepen reform of the planning system and let state 
planning play its due role in macroeconomic regulation and 
control. In accordance with the requirements of the decision of 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we 
should stress the macroeconomic, strategic, and policy aspects 
of planning work; draw up long-term, mid-term, and annual plans; 
and set forth rational strategies, goals for macroeconomic 
regulation and control, and industrial policies for national 
economic and social development. We should devise plans for the 
major components of the economic structure, for the distribution 
of productive forces, for land conservation, and for key 
construction projects. We should coordinate the application of 
macroeconomic policies and levers in an all-around way. 
  Fellow deputies: Successful planning for this year's 
economic work carries important implications for expediting the 
pace of building a socialist market economic structure; for 
maintaining sustained, rapid, and healthy development in the 
national economy; and for promoting overall social progress. We 
should rally more closely around the party Central Committee 
with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, emancipate our minds, seek 
truth from facts, take overall interests into account, work in a 
down-to-earth manner, and make great efforts to fulfill the 1994 
national economic and social development plan under the guidance 
of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and of the party's basic line.
